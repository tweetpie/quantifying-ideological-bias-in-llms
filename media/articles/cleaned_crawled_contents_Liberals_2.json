(AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\nSTAR, Idaho (AP) - Once he and his wife, Jennifer, moved to a Boise suburb last year, Tim Kohl could finally express himself.\n\nKohl did what the couple never dared at their previous house outside Los Angeles - the newly-retired Los Angeles police officer flew a U.S. flag and a Thin Blue Line banner representing law enforcement outside his house.\n\n\"We were scared to put it up,\" Jennifer Kohl acknowledged. But the Kohls knew they had moved to the right place when neighbors complimented him on the display.\n\nLeah Dean is on the opposite end of the political spectrum, but she knows how the Kohls feel. In Texas, Dean had been scared to fly an abortion rights banner outside her house. Around the time the Kohls were house-hunting in Idaho, she and her partner found a place in Denver, where their LGBTQ+ pride flag flies above the banner in front of their house that proclaims \"Abortion access is a community responsibility.\"\n\n\"One thing we have really found is a place to feel comfortable being ourselves,\" Dean said.\n\nAmericans are segregating by their politics at a rapid clip, helping fuel the greatest divide between the states in modern history.\n\nLeah Dean, a native of the Texas Panhandle, poses outside her home in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\nOne party controls the entire legislature in all but two states. In 28 states, the party in control has a supermajority in at least one legislative chamber - which means the majority party has so many lawmakers that they can override a governor's veto. Not that that would be necessary in most cases, as only 10 states have governors of different parties than the one that controls the legislature.\n\nThe split has sent states careening to the political left or right, adopting diametrically opposed laws on some of the hottest issues of the day. In Idaho, abortion is illegal once a heartbeat can be detected in a fetus - as early as five or six weeks - and a new law passed this year makes it a crime to help a minor travel out of state to obtain one. In Colorado, state law prevents any restrictions on abortion . In Idaho, a new law prevents minors from accessing gender-affirming care , while Colorado allows youths to come from other states to access the procedures.\n\nFederalism - allowing each state to chart its own course within boundaries set by Congress and the Constitution - is at the core of the U.S. system. It lets the states, in the words of former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, be \"laboratories of democracy.\"\n\nNow, some wonder whether that's driving Americans apart.\n\n\"Does that work as well in a time when we are so politically divided, or does it just become an accelerant for people who want to re-segregate?\" asked Rob Witwer, a former Republican Colorado state lawmaker.\n\nAaron and Carrie Friesen feed chickens in the backyard of their home in Boise, Idaho. (AP Photo/Kyle Green)\n\nColorado and Idaho represent two poles of state-level political homogenization. Both are fast-growing Rocky Mountain states that have been transformed by an influx of like-minded residents. Life in the two states can be quite similar - conversations revolve around local ski areas, mountain bike trails, and how newcomers are making things too crowded. But, politically, they increasingly occupy two separate worlds.\n\nWitwer watched Colorado steadily swing to the left as affluent, college-educated people fled the coasts for his home state starting in the late 1990s. For two decades, it was one of the nation's fastest-growing states, and during the Trump era it swung sharply to the left. Democrats control all statewide offices and have their largest majorities in history in the legislature, including a supermajority in the lower house.\n\nIn contrast, Idaho has become one of the nation's fastest-growing states during the past decade without losing its reputation as a conservative haven. It has moved even more sharply to the right during that time and become a beacon to those, like the Kohls, fleeing blue states where they no longer feel welcome.\n\nThe states' swings aren't simply due to transplants, of course. The increasing clustering of Americans into like-minded enclaves - dubbed \"The Big Sort\" - has many causes. Harvard professor Ryan Enos estimates that, at least before the pandemic, only 15% of the homogeneity was due to people moving. Other causes include political parties polarizing on hot-button issues that split neatly on demographic lines, such as guns and abortion, and voters adopting their neighbors' partisanship.\n\n\"A lot of this is driven by other sorting that is going on,\" Enos said.\n\nA flag supporting former President Donald Trump for president in 2024 flies in the front yard of a house in Horseshoe Bend, Idaho. (AP Photo/Kyle Green)\n\nWhen Americans move, politics is not typically the explicit reason. But the lifestyle choices they make place them in communities dominated by their preferred party.\n\n\"Democrats want to live in places with artistic culture and craft breweries, and Republicans want to move to places where they can have a big yard,\" said Ryan Strickler, a political scientist at Colorado State University-Pueblo.\n\nBut something may have changed as the country has become even more polarized. Businesses catering to conservatives fleeing blue states have sprouted, such as Blue Line Moving, which markets to families fleeing from blue states to Florida. In Texas, a \"rainbow underground railroad\" run by a Dallas realtor helps LGBTQ+ families flee the state's increased restrictions targeting that population.\n\nThe switch might have been flipped during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, which created a class of mobile workers no longer bound to the states where their companies were based. Those who are now mobile are predominantly white-collar workers and retirees, the two most politically engaged parts of the national population.\n\nMike McCarter, who has spearheaded a quixotic campaign to have conservative eastern Oregon become part of Idaho, said most people didn't pay much attention to state government until the pandemic.\n\n\"Then it was like 'Oh, they can shut down any church and they can shut down my kids' school?'\" McCarter said. \"If state-level government has that much power, you'd better be sure it reflects your values, and not someone else's values that are forced on you.\"\n\nAaron and Carrie Friesen in the back yard of their home in Boise, Idaho. (AP Photo/Kyle Green)\n\nThe pandemic helped push Aaron and Carrie Friesen to Idaho. When the pandemic hit, they realized they could take their marketing firm remote from its base near Hilton Head, South Carolina. They'd always planned to return to the West, but California, where Aaron, now 39, was born and raised, was disqualified because of its cost and progressive politics.\n\nThe Friesens and their three children settled on Boise. They loved the big skies, the mountains rearing up behind the town, the plethora of outdoor activities.\n\nAnd they liked Idaho's pandemic policies. When the Friesens visited, almost no one was wearing masks, which they took as a good sign - they were happy to mask up when sick, but found constant masking pointless.\n\n\"This was a place that had like-minded people,\" Carrie Friesen said.\n\nThe Friesens are happy with the direction of their new state and the abortion and transgender restrictions out of the latest legislative session. But they don't see themselves as part of what they called \"the crazy right,\" referring to the families displaying Trump yard signs in the less-politically-mixed Boise suburbs. They like living close to the center of Boise, one of the more liberal areas in the state.\n\nThey try not to make too many decisions based on politics - to a point.\n\n\"With the temperature of politics nowadays, if people choose to move somewhere, they are going to choose to move to a place with like-minded people,\" Aaron Friesen said.\n\nThat's apparently been happening in Idaho, said Mathew Hay, who oversees a regular survey of new arrivals for Boise State University. Historically, transplants mirrored the conservative population's leanings, with about 45% describing themselves as \"conservative,\" and the rest evenly split between liberal and moderate.\n\nBut something changed last year - the share of newcomers that said they lived in Idaho for the politics jumped to 9%, compared to 5% for long-timers. The percentage describing themselves as \"very conservative\" also rose.\n\nWhen Melissa Wintrow rode her motorcycle across the U.S. in 1996, she was captivated by Idaho.\n\n\"It was this grounded, commonsense, reasonable group,\" Wintrow said. \"Of course they were conservative, but they weren't going to say openly racist and homophobic things.\"\n\nNow a Democratic state senator, Wintrow is aghast at how her adopted state has become more hardline.\n\n\"The state has just moved to a more extreme view,\" she said. \"It's a certain group of people that is afraid their 'way of life' is diminishing in the world.\"\n\nIn Colorado, the reverse may be happening.\n\nBret Weinstein, owner of a realty firm in Denver, said politics has become the top issue for people buying a home.\n\n\"It's brought up in our initial conversations,\" Weinstein said. \"Three years ago, we didn't have those conversations, ever.\"\n\nNow, many entering the state tell him they're looking for a way to escape their red state - and homeowners leaving Colorado say they're fed up with it turning blue. Even within Colorado, Weinstein said, homebuyers are picking based on politics, with some avoiding conservative areas where debates on mask mandates and curriculum has dominated school board meetings.\n\nOne of those politically motivated migrants is Kathleen Rickerson, who works in human resources for Weinstein's firm. Rickerson, 35, lived in Minnesota for seven years, but during the pandemic grew weary of the blue state's vocal anti-masking, anti-vaccine minority.\n\nRickerson's parents and sister urged her to join them in Texas, but that was out of the question. Ready for a change, Rickerson instead zeroed in on Colorado. She moved to a Denver suburb in December 2021.\n\nCheered by the state's strong stance to protect abortion rights, Rickerson wants Colorado Democrats to go further.\n\n\"Colorado isn't as quick to take a stand on things, and I'd like to see that happen a bit more,\" she said.\n\nThat was a sentiment shared by Colorado progressives, who were frustrated their party didn't muscle through an assault weapons ban and other priorities of the left during the most recent legislative session.\n\n\"There is a point at which we need to stop acting like trying to get along with our enemies is going to preserve our institution,\" progressive state Rep. Stephanie Vigil said at the end of the session, after the chamber's Democratic leader said it was important that Republicans still feel like they have a voice.\n\nThe increasing political homogeneity in states makes it harder for both parties to feel invested, said Thad Kousser, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego.\n\n\"It gives one party the ability to move a state further when they're doing exactly what their constituency wants,\" he said.\n\nThe system works as a sort of escape valve, Kousser said, letting the majority in the state feel in power regardless of what's happening in Washington, D.C. But the local minority party gets shortchanged.\n\nThe Kohls felt shortchanged in California. They said they watched their native state deteriorate before their eyes, and no one was willing to fix the problems. Trash piled up with homeless encampments. Tax money seemed to go to immigrants who had entered the country illegally rather than U.S. citizens. Jennifer's mother qualified for government assistance due to her low income, but was on dozens of wait lists that were seven years long. Tim's police station, in a former hippie colony in the mountains running through West Los Angeles, was firebombed during the George Floyd protests in 2020.\n\nThe Kohls wanted to live in a red state, but Jennifer said they're not just party-line voters. A nurse, she hasn't registered with either party and has a wide range of beliefs, including that abortion is sometimes necessary.\n\n\"I believe so many different things,\" she said.\n\nOn balance, they feel more comfortable in a more conservative place.\n\n\"Here, the tax dollars naturally goes to the citizens, not the immigrants,\" said Tim Kohl, who can understand why Idaho is growing so fast. \"Most of the people we've met here are from California originally.\"\n\nIn Denver, Dean has found other people who fled red states. She and her partner, Cassidy Dean, discovered that their neighbors fled Florida after the state's hard turn to the political right.\n\nLeah Dean was a 19-year-old cosmetology college student in San Antonio in 2008 when she had an abortion. She chafed at the obstacles she faced - the state-mandated waiting period before the procedure, having to get a sonogram before the procedure - and became a committed Democratic activist. She met her partner at the Texas state party convention in 2016, and every year since then she's felt the Republican state legislature and governor make the state less and less hospitable to people like her.\n\nNow in Colorado, she and her partner both work from home, telecommuting to their old Texas jobs. They have limited social outlets, but took care of that by throwing themselves into politics again, with Leah Dean becoming vice chair of Denver Democrats.\n\n\"It's also how we meet people,\" she said. \"We don't have any other way to do that.\"\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nTORONTO (AP) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party finds itself in search of a new leader while dealing with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threats to impose steep tariffs on Canadian goods and with Canada's election just months away.\n\nTrudeau announced his resignation after facing an increasing loss of support both within his party and in the country. The 53-year-old scion of Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada's most famous prime ministers, became deeply unpopular with voters over a range of issues, including the soaring cost of food and housing as well as surging immigration.\n\nTrudeau said he plans to stay on as prime minister until a new party leader is chosen, but a new Canadian leader is unlikely to be named before Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20.\n\nThe political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada. Trump keeps calling Canada the 51st state and has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian good s. He is preoccupied with the U.S. trade deficit with Canada, erroneously calling it a subsidy.\n\nTrump said Tuesday he would not use the military to force Canada to join the U.S., but would rely on \"economic force.\" If Trump applies tariffs, a trade war looms and Canada has vowed to retaliate.\n\n\"There isn't a snowball's chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,\" Trudeau posted on X. \"Workers and communities in both our countries benefit from being each other's biggest trading and security partner.\"\n\nTrump said the U.S. doesn't need anything from Canada. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, which is also the top export destination for 36 U.S. states.\n\nThe Liberals need to elect a new leader before Parliament resumes March 24 because all three opposition parties say they will bring down the Liberal government in a no-confidence vote at the first opportunity, which would trigger an election.\n\nThe new leader might not be prime minister for long: A spring election would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party.\n\nIt's not often that central bank governors get compared to rock stars. But potential Liberal leader Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada, was considered just that in 2012. He was named the first foreigner to serve as governor of the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. The appointment of a Canadian won bipartisan praise in Britain after Canada recovered faster than many other countries from the 2008 financial crisis. He gained a reputation along the way as a tough regulator.\n\nFew people in the world have Carney's qualifications. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who is widely credited with helping Canada dodge the worst of the 2008 crisis and helping the U.K. manage Brexit. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister but lacks political experience. He said in a statement he is encouraged by support he has had, and that he's considering his decision with family over the next few days.\n\nFormer finance minister Chrystia Freeland is also a front-runner. Trudeau told Freeland last month he no longer wanted her to serve in that position but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. An official close to Freeland said she couldn't continue serving as a minister knowing she no longer enjoyed Trudeau's confidence. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The person added it's far too early to make declarations but said Freeland would talk to her colleagues this week and discuss next steps.\n\nAfter she resigned, Trump called Freeland \"totally toxic\" and \"not at all conducive to making deals.\" Freeland is many things that would seem to irritate Trump: a liberal Canadian former journalist. She is a globalist who sits on the board of the World Economic Forum. Freeland, who is of Ukrainian heritage, also has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n\nAnother possible candidate is the new finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc. The former public safety minister, and a close friend of Trudeau, LeBlanc recently joined the prime minister at a dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. LeBlanc was Trudeau's babysitter when Trudeau was a child.\n\nRecent polls suggest the Liberals' chances of winning the next election look slim. In the latest poll by Nanos, the Liberals trail the opposition Conservatives 45% to 23%.\n\n\"Trudeau's announcement might help the Liberals in the polls in the short run and, once a new leader is selected, things could improve further at least for a little while but that would not be so hard because, right now, they're so low in the polls,\" said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.\n\n\"Moreover, because Trudeau waited so long to announce his resignation, this will leave little time to his successor and the party to prepare for early elections,\" Béland said.\n\nMany analysts say Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre will form the next government. Poilievre, for years the party's go-to attack dog, is a firebrand populist who blamed Canada's cost of living crisis on Trudeau. The 45-year-old Poilievre is a career politician who attracted large crowds during his run for his party's leadership. He has vowed to scrap a carbon tax and defund the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

All Rights Reserved.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., speaks with reporters at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 13, 2024. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Demand Justice, a progressive organization focused on the judiciary, is set to bombard Capitol Hill with a message for the closing weeks of the 118th Congress: Do \"whatever it takes\" to confirm President Joe Biden's nominees as a second Donald Trump presidency looms.\n\nThe Republican president-elect's victory and the GOP takeover of the Senate leaves just seven weeks of Democratic control of the chamber.\n\nDemocrats have confirmed 213 of Biden's judicial nominees during his presidency. Another few dozen are still pending. To add to those confirmations, Senate Democrats would need to stay in Washington far longer than they had planned and also navigate a razor-thin margin that hamstrung them at times on other Biden priorities.\n\nTrump focused heavily on filling court vacancies in his first term, getting 234 judges confirmed, including three to the Supreme Court. Democrats are seeking to deny him more opportunities to name conservative judges as the party determines its path forward after a sweeping defeat that will leave it out of power come January.\n\n\"Senate Democrats cannot give up and go home just because they lost the chamber,\" said Skye Perryman, a senior adviser to Demand Justice, whose push will include widespread lobbying, Capitol Hill events and targeted ads. \"It is even more critical now that good, qualified, fair-minded judges are confirmed so they can serve as a backstop and uphold the rights of ordinary people and protect our Constitution.\"\n\nAccording to the United States Courts website , 17 pending judicial nominees have advanced out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, eight are waiting for votes from the committee and six are waiting for committee hearings. The White House announced new judicial nominees in October and November .\n\nThe Senate returned this week from their break around the election. The Senate calendar has the legislative body being out of town around the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. But the calendar is subject to change, and it is common for senators to leave Washington for extended weekend breaks.\n\nThe push will confront an already full schedule in the Senate , too. In addition to confirmations, the legislative body will be tasked with providing more disaster aid after a string of deadly storms, passing the annual defense policy bill, and keeping the government funded and open.\n\nSome Democratic-caucusing senators like West Virginia's Joe Manchin and Arizona's Kyrsten Sinema, both independents, are leaving the chamber at the end of this session. And if Republicans are unified to oppose Biden's picks, Manchin has said he will not support judicial appointments that are not bipartisan, shrinking the Democratic margin.\n\nOne nominee, April Perry, was confirmed on Monday evening for the northern district of Illinois.\n\nAsked about the effort to pressure Senate Democrats to do all they can to confirm these nominees, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, \"We are going to get as many done as we can.\"\n\nTrump on Sunday urged Republicans to oppose Schumer's efforts. \"No Judges should be approved during this period of time because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Delaying the confirmation of strongly qualified, experienced judges takes a real-life toll on constituents and leads to backlogs of criminal cases - meaning there is every urgent reason for Republicans and Democrats to continue working together in good faith to staff the federal bench,\" White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in response to Trump. \"There is no excuse for choosing partisanship over enforcing the rule of law.\"\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he hoped Republicans would not seek to delay confirmation votes for judges, noting that Democrats agreed to a package of 12 judicial confirmations at the end of the first Trump presidency.\n\n\"I hope they follow the precedent,\" Durbin said.\n\nHe added that he hopes to get about two dozen judicial nominees confirmed during the lame-duck session.\n\n\"That's just about all we can do,\" he added.\n\nPerryman from Demand Justice echoed that sentiment. \"There is no excuse not to put these qualified individuals on the floor for a vote. Americans all across the country are working overtime to make ends meet, and the Senate should work overtime too: Americans deserve better from their elected officials than excuses or delays,\" Perryman added.\n\nAccording to operatives working with Demand Justice, the group's plan includes a widespread lobbying effort aimed at key senators, press events urging action and a new website that gives constituents a chance to see where the effort stands.\n\n\"With only weeks left before the new Congress, it's more urgent than ever that Democratic senators do whatever it takes - staying late, working weekends - during the lame duck session,\" said Maggie Jo Buchanan, a top operative at the progressive organization.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, in a series of post-election posts reflecting on Trump's win, urged Schumer to \"use every minute of the end-of-year legislative session to confirm federal judges and key regulators - none of whom can be removed by the next President.\"\n\nAnd groups like The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights have echoed this focus.\n\n\"As the Senate returns to Washington and with limited time remaining, it is critically important that our senators immediately vote on all of President Biden's judicial nominees,\" said Lena Zwarensteyn, senior director of the fair courts program and an advisor at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Robert Franklin/South Bend Tribune via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Americans view college campuses as far friendlier to liberals than to conservatives when it comes to free speech , with adults across the political spectrum seeing less tolerance for those on the right, according to a new poll.\n\nOverall, 47% of adults say liberals have \"a lot\" of freedom to express their views on college campuses, while just 20% said the same of conservatives, according to polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the University of Chicago Forum for Free Inquiry and Expression.\n\nRepublicans perceive a stronger bias on campuses against conservatives, but Democrats see a difference too - about 4 in 10 Democrats say liberals can speak their minds freely on campuses, while about 3 in 10 Democrats say conservatives can do so.\n\n\"If you're a Republican or lean Republican, you're unabashedly wrong, they shut you down,\" said Rhonda Baker, 60, of Goldsboro, North Carolina, who voted for former President Donald Trump and has a son in college. \"If they hold a rally, it's: 'The MAGA's coming through.' It's: 'The KKK is coming through.'\"\n\nDebates over First Amendment rights have occasionally flared on college campuses in recent years, with conflicts arising over guest speakers who express polarizing views, often from the political right.\n\nStanford University became a flashpoint this year when students shouted down a conservative judge who was invited to speak. More recently, a conservative Princeton University professor was drowned out while discussing free speech at Washington College, a small school in Maryland.\n\nAt the same time, Republican lawmakers in dozens of states have proposed bills aiming to limit public colleges from teaching topics considered divisive or liberal. Just 30% of Americans say states should be able to restrict what professors at state universities teach, the poll found, though support was higher among Republicans.\n\nA man stands by flyers on a University of California, Berkeley campus bulletin board calling for a protest against right-wing speaker Ben Shapiro in Berkeley, Calif., Sept. 8, 2017. (AP Photo/Jocelyn Gecker, File)\n\nOverall, Republicans see a clear double standard on college campuses. Just 9% said conservatives can speak their minds, while 58% said liberals have that freedom, according to the polling. They were also slightly less likely than Americans overall to see campuses as respectful and inclusive places for conservatives.\n\nChris Gauvin, a Republican who has done construction work on campuses, believes conservative voices are stifled. While working at Yale University, he was once stopped by pro-LGBTQ+ activists who asked for his opinion, he said.\n\n\"They asked me how I felt, so I figured I'd tell them. I spoke in a normal tone, I didn't get excited or upset,\" said Gauvin, 58, of Manchester, Connecticut. \"But it proceeded with 18 to 20 people who were suddenly very irritated and agitated. It just exploded.\"\n\nHe took a lesson from the experience: \"I learned to be very quiet there.\"\n\nA protester shouts down White Nationalist Richard Spencer during a speech at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Fla., Oct. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara, File)\n\nRepublicans in Congress have raised alarms, with a recent House report warning of \"the long-standing and pervasive degradation of First Amendment rights\" at U.S. colleges. Some in the GOP have called for federal legislation requiring colleges to protect free speech and punish those who infringe on others' rights.\n\nNicholas Fleisher, who chairs an academic freedom committee for the American Association of University Professors, said public perception is skewed by the infrequent cases when protesters go too far.\n\n\"The reality is that there's free speech for everyone on college campuses,\" said Fleisher, a linguistics professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. \"In conversations within classrooms, people are free to speak their minds. And they do.\"\n\nOfficials at PEN America, a free speech group, say most students welcome diverse views. But as the nation has become more politically divided, so have college campuses, said Kristen Shahverdian, senior manager for education at PEN.\n\n\"There's this polarization that just continues to grow and build across our country, and colleges and universities are a part of that ecosystem,\" she said.\n\nMiddlebury College students turn their backs to Charles Murray, unseen, during his lecture in Middlebury, Vt., Thursday, March 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Lisa Rathke, File)\n\nMorgan Ashford, a Democrat in an online graduate program at Troy University in Alabama, said she thinks people can express themselves freely on campus regardless of politics or skin color. Still, she sees a lack of tolerance for the LGBTQ+ community in her Republican state where the governor has passed anti-LGBTQ legislation.\n\n\"I think there have to be guidelines\" around hate speech, said Ashford. \"Because some people can go overboard.\"\n\nWhen it comes to protesting speakers, most Americans say it should be peaceful. About 8 in 10 say it's acceptable to engage in peaceful, non-disruptive protest at a campus event, while just 15% say it's OK to prevent a speaker from communicating with the audience, the poll found.\n\n\"If they don't like it, they can get up and walk out,\" said Linda Woodward, 71, a Democrat in Hot Springs Village, Arkansas.\n\nMike Darlington, a real estate appraiser who votes Republican, said drowning out speakers violates the virtues of a free society.\n\n\"It seems to me a very, very selfish attitude that makes students think, 'If you don't think the way I do, then your thoughts are unacceptable,'\" said Darlington, 58, of Chesterfield County, Virginia.\n\nThe protest at Stanford was one of six campus speeches across the U.S. that ended in significant disruption this year, with another 11 last year, according to a database by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free speech group.\n\nThose cases, while troubling, are one symptom of a broader problem, said Ilya Shapiro, a conservative legal scholar who was shouted down during a speech last year at the University of California's law school. He says colleges have drifted away from the classic ideal of academia as a place for free inquiry.\n\nAn even bigger problem than speakers being disrupted by protesters is \"students and faculty feeling that they can't be open in their views. They can't even discuss certain subjects,\" said Shapiro, director of constitutional studies at the Manhattan Institute think tank.\n\nAbout three in five Americans (62%) say that a major purpose of higher education is to support the free exchange and debate of different ideas and values. Even more U.S. adults say college's main purpose is to teach students specific skills (82%), advance knowledge and ideas (78%) or teach students to be critical thinkers (76%). Also, 66% said a major purpose is to create a respectful and inclusive learning environment.\n\n\"I believe it should be solely to prepare you to enter the workforce,\" said Gene VanZandt, 40, a Republican who works in shipbuilding in Hampton, Virginia. \"I think our colleges have gone too far off the path of what their function was.\"\n\nThe poll finds that majorities of Americans think students and professors, respectively, should not be allowed to express racist, sexist or anti-LGBTQ views on campus, with slightly more Republicans than Democrats saying those types of views should be allowed. There was slightly more tolerance for students expressing those views than for professors.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 said students should be permitted to invite academic speakers accused of using offensive speech, with 55% saying they should not. There was a similar split when asked whether professors should be allowed to invite those speakers.\n\nDarlington believes students and professors should be able to discuss controversial topics, but there are limits.\n\n\"Over-the-top, overtly racist, hateful stuff - no. You shouldn't be allowed to do that freely,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nThe poll of 1,095 adults was conducted Sept. 7-11, 2023, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\n___\n\nGecker reported from San Francisco.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

(Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nTORONTO (AP) - Former central banker Mark Carney will become Canada's next prime minister after the governing Liberal Party elected him its leader Sunday as the country deals with U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and annexation threat, and a federal election looms.\n\nCarney, 59, replaces Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , who announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until his successor is sworn in in the coming days. Carney won in a landslide, winning 85.9% of the vote.\n\n\"There is someone who is trying to weaken our economy,\" Carney said . \"Donald Trump, as we know, has put unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell and how we make a living. He's attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses and we cannot let him succeed and we won't.\"\n\nLiberal Party of Canada Leader Mark Carney speaks following the announcement of his win at the party's announcement event in Ottawa, Ontario, Sunday, March 9, 2025. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nCarney said Canada will keep retaliatory tariffs in place until \"the Americans show us respect.\"\n\n\"We didn't ask for this fight. But Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,\" Carney said. \"The Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.\"\n\nCarney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.\n\nLiberal Party of Canada leadership candidate Mark Carney delivers a speech as he's introduced during the Liberal leadership announcement in Ottawa, Ontario, Sunday, March 9, 2025. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nThe opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged.\n\nTrump's trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.\n\nThe surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party's chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls.\n\nCanada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at the Liberal leadership announcement in Ottawa, Ontario, Sunday, March 9, 2025. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\n\"The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country. Think about it. If they succeed they would destroy our way of life,\" Carney said. \"In America health care is big business. In Canada it is a right.\"\n\nCarney said America is \"a melting pot. Canada is mosaic,\" he said. \"America is not Canada. And Canada will never, ever will be a part of America in any way, shape or form.\"\n\nAfter decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada's next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.\n\nNewly appointed Liberal Leader Mark Carney and his wife Diana Fox Carney leave the stage following his speech at the Liberal leadership announcement in Ottawa, Ontario, Sunday, March 9, 2025. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\n\"These are dark days, dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust,\" Carney said. \"We are getting over the shock but let us never forget the lessons. We have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead.\"\n\nTrump has postponed 25% tariffs on many goods from Canada and Mexico for a month, amid widespread fears of a broader trade war . But he has threatened other tariffs on steel, aluminum, dairy and other products.\n\nCarney picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience.\n\nIn 2020, he began serving as the United Nations' special envoy for climate action and finance.\n\nChrystia Freeland listens to Mark Carney, Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, not shown, speak after he was announced the winner at the Liberal Leadership Event in Ottawa, Ontario, Sunday, March 9, 2025. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nCarney is a former Goldman Sachs executive. He worked for 13 years in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003.\n\nThe other top Liberal leadership candidate was former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who received just eight percent of the vote. Trudeau told Freeland in December that he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.\n\nCarney is expected to trigger an election shortly. Either he will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.\n\nTrudeau urged Liberals supporters to get involved.\n\n\"This is a nation-defining moment. Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given,\" Trudeau said.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Former President Donald Trump has plans to radically reshape the federal government if he returns to the White House, from promising to deport millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally to abolishing government agencies and firing tens of thousands of workers and replacing them with loyalists.\n\nLiberal organizations in Washington are backing President Joe Biden and say they expect Trump to lose. But they're quietly trying to install roadblocks just in case.\n\nA collection of activists, advocates and legal experts is promoting new federal rules to limit presidential power while urging Biden's White House to do more to protect his accomplishments and limit Trump in a possible second term. All of that is happening with far less fanfare than plans by Trump supporters to create a conservative government-in-waiting via an effort known as \"Project 2025.\"\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management, the federal government's chief human resources agency, proposed a rule against reclassifying tens of thousands of workers so they can be more easily fired. According to spokesperson Viet Tran, the office will finalize the rule in April. That means that a future administration would likely have to spend months - or even years - unwinding it if they want to try to do so.\n\nThose supporting the effort are open about its limits.\n\n\"My impression is the Biden administration is taking very seriously that potential threat and is trying to do things now,\" said Michael Linden, a former executive associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget under Biden. But he added, \"Nobody should be under any illusion that there's anything that this president can do in advance to prevent the next president from doing things that are very damaging, potentially catastrophically.\"\n\n\"There isn't any magic bullet,\" Linden said.\n\nThe White House is reluctant to talk about a second Trump term before Election Day, as that would imply it has plans for if Biden loses.\n\nTrump \"is already telegraphing plays straight out of the authoritarian playbook - gutting the civil service of people he deems disloyal and plotting revenge on his political enemies,\" said Kevin Munoz, a spokesman for Biden's campaign. \"There's one way of stopping Trump's dangerous and un-American plans: reelecting President Biden.\"\n\nStill, Norm Eisen, who was chief ethics counselor to President Barack Obama, wants Biden to issue executive orders that could limit the use of the military domestically. Trump has talked about sending troops to the southern border or to Democrat-run cities dealing with rising crime rates.\n\n\"I understand the potential reluctance to signal any risk here as a political matter and that's not an illegitimate consideration,\" said Eisen, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution. \"But there are countervailing considerations given the threat that we face.\"\n\nCentral both to Trump's plans and the Democratic efforts to impede him is deciding how many government workers can be removed by a new administration, potentially to be replaced with loyalists.\n\nTrump at the end of his term sought to reclassify thousands of the more than 2 million federal employees, stripping them of job protections and making them at-will employees under a new classification known as \"Schedule F.\" Around 4,000 federal employees are now considered political appointees who typically change with each administration. Creating Schedule F could have increased that more than tenfold.\n\nBiden revoked that order but Trump says he'll revive it should he win. And conservatives preparing thick policy books are strategizing on how to fire employees to make more room for Trump appointees.\n\nA spokesman for Trump's campaign did not answer a message seeking comment and the Heritage Foundation, which is running \"Project 2025,\" declined to answer written questions. But Heritage's president, Kevin Roberts, told The New York Times Magazine that he wants to see \"destruction\" in the government.\n\n\"People will lose their jobs. Hopefully their lives are able to flourish in spite of that,\" Roberts said. \"Buildings will be shut down. Hopefully they can be repurposed for private industry.\"\n\nThe OPM in September proposed the rule making it more difficult to reclassify employees and allowing anyone moved into a potential \"Schedule F\" to retain their protections against being fired.\n\nIt's been endorsed by 27 advocacy organizations whose policy interests don't always align.\n\n\"I think you've seen the federal agencies, and the president himself, talk about the importance of a functioning government, the importance of a democracy and the importance of a government that works for all people,\" said Skye Perryman, president of the advocacy group Democracy Forward, which has been a leading proponent of the proposed rule.\n\nJames Sherk, a former Trump administration official now working at the America First Policy Institute, another group strategizing for a second Trump term, opposed the rule in a letter sent to OPM. Sherk argued worker protections against termination \"enable what are typically very liberal career staff to stymie conservative policies.\"\n\n\"The federal workforce has ideologically polarized, and this rulemaking would impede the ability of presidents whose views differ from the bureaucracy's to implement their agendas,\" Sherk wrote.\n\nMany liberals are also promoting a separate OPM rule that could slow future executive branch orders to relocate government agencies. That grew out of the Trump administration's announced plans to relocate agencies within the Department of Agriculture from Washington to Kansas City in 2019, and within the Bureau of Land Management from Washington to Grand Junction, Colorado, the following year.\n\nBesides taking time to undo, federal rules can also be the basis for lawsuits - hundreds of which were filed to stop Trump priorities on issues ranging from immigration to the environment during his presidency.\n\nCongress has also passed changes responding to issues that arose during the Trump administration. Lawmakers barred presidents from unilaterally withdrawing the U.S. from NATO and strengthened the Electoral Count Act , which Trump tried to put to the test on Jan. 6, 2021 , when he pressed lawmakers to reject electors from states he lost on the basis of falsehoods he spread about voter fraud.\n\nAdvocates say Biden has more options to thwart a Trump administration, from promoting expanded collective bargaining agreements with federal personnel to beginning the complicated bureaucratic task of designating more government posts as policy-dedicated, thus making workers harder to fire.\n\n\"A lot of this about good governance,\" said Ben Olinsky, senior vice president for structural reform and governance at the Center for American Progress' Action Fund, the political arm of the Washington think tank. \"If you believe in a functioning government, then you should want to use these tools to enshrine policy and make sure there's continuity from one government to another, regardless of who you think might or might not be in the White House in a few years.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nFILE - New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh points to his turban as he speaks about racism during a speech in London, Ontario, June 8, 2021. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press via AP, File)\n\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) - The leader of Canada's leftist New Democratic Party said Thursday that policies supported by liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre hurt Canadians, although he didn't say if he was willing to trigger a snap federal election soon.\n\nJagmeet Singh had said a day earlier in a video posted on social media that he had \"ripped up\" a key agreement with Trudeau's Liberal government, that helped keep the minority government in power.\n\nDuring a news conference in Toronto on Thursday, Singh acknowledged that his surprise decision to pull support from the supply and confidence agreement could move up the date of Canada's next general election, expected to be held in October 2025.\n\n\"I ripped up the supply and confidence agreement with Justin Trudeau, and we know that makes the election timing more uncertain,\" Singh said.\n\nSingh declined to provide a specific timeline about when he could vote against the Liberals in a no-confidence vote.\n\n\"I will look at any vote that comes before us and we will make a decision in the best interests of Canadians, as any minority government normally operates,\" he said.\n\nThe Liberals currently have 154 seats in the 338 Canadian House of Commons. The Conservates hold 119 and the NDP 24. The Bloc Québécois, a party based only in Quebec and devoted to Quebec sovereignty, has 32 seats.\n\nSingh and Trudeau reached the supply and confidence agreement in March 2022, committing the Liberals to implement several NDP priorities such as dental care and pharmacare in exchange for the NDP caucus supporting the Liberals on key votes.\n\nSanjay Jeram, a political science professor at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C., said the agreement always \"had more bark than bite\" and didn't give the NDP any official representation in the federal government, like some coalitions in other countries.\n\nMost polls show the Conservatives well ahead of the Liberals with the NDP sitting third, making it difficult to see what the New Democrats could gain from a quick election.\n\n\"Where the polls are now, there is no realistic option of them forming government,\" said Jeram. \"It's hard to really understand what they're aiming for,\" he said, adding, \"Do they want to become the official opposition?\"\n\nJeram said there may be concerns in the party that the Conservatives have been trying to appeal to working class voters, which could drain away support from the centre-left NDP. An early election may halt this erosion of support.\n\nLibby Davies, who spent 18 years as an NDP member of Parliament, said ending the agreement puts pressure on the Liberals.\n\n\"Will it increase the likelihood of an election sooner? That's part of the risk,\" said Davies. \"It's the tension of a potential election that keeps the Liberals on their toes and allows the NDP to have a lot more leverage.\"\n\nWith the Liberals trailing badly in the polls, and Trudeau very unpopular, she doubts they want an election.\n\n\"I don't think they want an election right now,\" she said. \"It really puts the pressure on the Liberals to decide; are they going to listen to whatever demands come from the NDP?\"\n\nIn a campaign style speech, Singh criticized both Trudeau and Poilievre.\n\n\"Justin Trudeau has let Canadians down,\" said Singh. \"Trudeau's Liberals can't deliver change. They are too weak and too selfish to stop Pierre Poilievre and the Conservatives.\"\n\nAs for the Conservatives, Singh accused them of wanting to reduce health care benefits and encourage corporate greed.\n\n\"Conservative cuts would take things from bad to worse,\" he said.\n\nHe pitched the NDP as the party of hope.\n\n\"There's a battle ahead of us, the fight for the Canda of our dreams,\" said Singh. \"The fight to restore hope and the promise that working hard gets you a good life.\"\n\nDavies, the former member of parliament, said if the NDP forces an early election they must explain their reasoning.\n\n\"Mr. Singh needs to present an NDP vision and what that looks like for the country,\" she said. \"The longer he (was) tied to that agreement, the harder it is in some ways because all the good things that happened, the Liberals will take credit for.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCanada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, second left, and Minister of Innovation and Science François-Philippe Champagne greet people during a walkabout on Fête Nationale in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, Monday, June 24, 2024. (Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nTORONTO (AP) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal party has suffered a major upset in a special election for a Toronto district it has held for three decades, raising doubts about Trudeau's leadership ahead of next year's general election.\n\nElections Canada reported Tuesday that opposition Conservative candidate Don Stewart won the Toronto-St. Paul's district by almost 600 votes, 42.1% over the Liberal candidate's 40.5% with all 192 polling stations reporting results of Monday's voting.\n\n\"This was obviously not the result we wanted, but I want to be clear that I hear the concerns and frustrations,\" Trudeau said in Vancouver.\n\n\"These are not easy times. And it is clear, that I and my entire Liberal team, have much more hard work to do to deliver tangible, real progress that Canadians can see and feel.\"\n\nThe Liberals had held Toronto-St. Paul's since 1993. It is one of 338 seats in Canada's House of Commons.\n\nLosing in Canada's largest city, a traditional Liberal stronghold, does not bode well for Trudeau ahead of the election expected in the fall of 2025.\n\nTrudeau has said he intends to lead the party into the next election. The Liberals have been in power since 2015 but are trailing badly in the polls amid concerns over the cost of living.\n\n\"Justin's position is seriously weakened inside the party,\" Canadian historian Robert Bothwell said.\n\nBothwell said there had been solidarity with Trudeau's leadership, noting some have just left the government rather than publicly grumble, but he expects comments now.\n\nOne of Trudeau's closest allies backed him.\n\n\"The prime minister is committed to leading us into the next election and he has our support,\" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said.\n\n\"The result in St. Paul's is certainly disappointing. We knew it was going to be a hard fight. We know that these are hard times for Canadians. We know that we have to work hard to earn back their trust.\"\n\nThe vote marks the first time Conservatives have beat the Liberals in Toronto proper since 2011.\n\nOpposition Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre demanded that the prime minister call a snap election after what he described as a \"shocking upset.\"\n\n\"Here is the verdict: Trudeau can't go on like this,\" Poilievre said on X.\n\nNelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, said the Liberals lost the district not because of a wave of support for Poilievre and his party but because of deepening distaste for Trudeau.\n\n\"The pressure on Trudeau to announce that he will be stepping down is now insurmountable,\" Wiseman said. \"Toronto-St. Paul's was one of only 40 seats the Liberals won when they experienced their worst performance ever, in 2011.\" If the Liberals cannot win this district, Wiseman said, \"how can they hope to win a general election?\"\n\nWiseman said the already anxious Liberal caucus will now go into a kind of panic mode. He noted the average shelf life of prime ministers since the 1950s has been about a decade.\n\n\"This is a very ominous sign for the Liberals,\" said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. \"The Conservatives have scored major political points by blaming him for the cost-of-living crisis.\"\n\nCanada's annual inflation rate ticked higher in May, raising doubts about what the country's central bank will do when it makes its next interest rate decision in July. Statistics Canada, a government agency, said Tuesday the annual rose to 2.9% in May and noted Canadians are paying 22.5% more for groceries compared with May 2020.\n\nTrudeau reasserted the country's liberal identity in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative rule. His legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change.\n\nTrudeau's father, Pierre Trudeau, swept to power in 1968 on a wave of \"Trudeaumania\" and led Canada for almost 16 years.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "It's Dumb and Dangerous for Liberals to Conflate All Conservatives With MAGA\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nMore and more, liberals are attempting to cast all conservatives as enemies of democracy while simultaneously casting all of their political policies as pro-democracy. The consequences of this could be disastrous.\n\nThe most blatant example occurred during Joe Biden's primetime \"Soul of America\" speech earlier this month-a speech advertised as addressing conspiracy theories , political violence , and attempts to overthrow democracy.\n\nIn this context, Biden talked about how \"MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,\" before hastening to add, \"Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose...\" In one fell swoop, Biden conflated \"MAGA Republicans\" who deny elections and participate in insurrections with Reagan Republicans who care about the right to life of unborn babies . There is no comparison.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut it's not just social issues that get you written out of polite society. Fiscal conservatives are also suspect. In a tweet sent on Friday, Biden wrote that \"Republicans have pushed an ultra-MAGA agenda to: Threaten Social Security and Medicare...Raise taxes on working families [and] Give big corporations and billionaires tax breaks.\" Axios's Josh Kraushaar called this \"Defining down 'ultra MAGA' and noted that, \"Under this standard, Liz Cheney would qualify.\"\n\nAnd Biden isn't the only one guilty of this. This past week, New York magazine's Jonathan Chait took to Twitter to remind us that during the Tea Party era, then-Rep. Ron DeSantis wrote a book that Chait sees as a Rosetta Stone for decoding conservatism's illiberal tendencies. After reading the book, Chait surmises that : \"The Constitution's role, as DeSantis sees it, is to prevent popular majorities from enacting the economic policies they want.\"\n\nConservatives have long worried that, \"A democracy can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury\"-a line sometimes apocryphally attributed to Alexis de Tocqueville . This is very similar to what DeSantis was saying. Indeed, most of the lines that trouble Chait are standard boilerplate conservative rhetoric.\n\nAnd maybe that's the point. The implication being that the whole conservative project-including Reagan, two Bushes, John McCain, Mitt Romney, et al.-was fruit from a poisonous tree.\n\nThe logical conclusion, if you subscribe to this worldview, is that conservatives inherently hate democracy and, therefore, have no place in polite society. We increasingly see this attitude manifested in electoral politics-the last place you want to write off a prospective convert or customer.\n\n\"Those who support [DeSantis] should stay with him and vote for him and I don't want your vote,\" Rep. Charlie Crist (who was once the Republican governor of Florida) said just after winning the state's Democratic gubernatorial primary this year.\n\n\"If you have that hate in your heart,\" Crist continued, \"keep it there.\" And Crist isn't the only politician to express this sentiment.\n\nOr consider New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who said: \"Trump and [GOP gubernatorial candidate Lee] Zeldin and [GOP congressional candidate Marcus] Molinaro-just jump on a bus and head down to Florida where you belong, OK? Get out of town because you don't represent our values.\"\n\nHochul later clarified that her comments were directed at these three \" extreme \" men, but another line-\" You're not New Yorkers , because we come from a long line of people who fought for women's rights that happened here first\"-was interpreted as a broader attack on people who don't share her pro-abortion views.\n\nHey, what else are you supposed to say to a \" semi-fascist\" movement ? No Republicans Need Apply.\n\nThis attitude is counterproductive on multiple levels. First, of course, it's terrible (morally and politically) to dismiss approximately half the country .\n\nSecond, instead of rising to the occasion and giving America at least one responsible, normal, or decent party, Democrats are taking political advantage of what could be considered a perilous moment.\n\nRather than acknowledging that reasonable people can have honest disagreements about public policy questions such as abortion (which you should ostensibly do in a democracy), Democrats are attempting to baptize and sanctify their political preferences in the holy waters of American democracy, which is (to extend the religious metaphor) unseemly and sacrilegious.\n\nThird, this practice will likely lead to more, not less, MAGA extremists (an outcome which ought not to shock members of a party that has spent tens of millions of dollars helping to boost MAGA candidates in Republican primaries ).\n\nPeople who feel threatened are more likely to retreat to their tribe for protection. By creating a scenario where even \"normal\" non-Trump Republicans feel victimized and shamed, liberals risk making the radicalization of conservatism a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nI'm not sure they even see that as a problem.\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Will Raging Liberals Cause an Anti-Democrat Backlash?\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nDemocrats are betting that anger over the reversal of Roe v. Wade will take down Republicans in the 2022 midterms . This is a plausible, if desperate , hope.\n\nThe theory is that the \"winning\" side of such a long struggle will now be pacified, while the \"losing\" side is energized and outraged. And abortion rights-with some limits- remain broadly popular on a national scale .\n\nThe political calculus over the right's biggest victory in a half-century is so scrambled that even former President Donald Trump is reportedly worried about this .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut Republicans have a secret weapon: Democrats' penchant for progressive overreach . We are already seeing signs at multiple levels-among activists, elite celebrities, and politicians. It raises the question: Could there be a backlash against the backlash?\n\nLet's start with the most serious: activist overreach. Since May's leak of Justice Samuel Alito's draft opinion in the Dobbs case, pro-life crisis pregnancy centers in dozens of locations have been vandalized or firebombed (in the wake of the Dobbs decision, centers in Virginia and Colorado have been added to the list).\n\nA group called \"Jane's Revenge\" has claimed credit for some of the destruction, writing on their website on June 15 , \"We have demonstrated in the past month how easy and fun it is to attack... Rest assured that we will, and those measures may not come in the form of something so easily cleaned up as fire and graffiti.\" As the progressive data analyst David Shor suggested (in a 2020 tweet that got him cancelled shortly after the police murder of George Floyd), while nonviolent protests can be helpful, violence is bad for Democrats' electorally.\n\nLike the attempted assassination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh , the attacks on crisis pregnancy centers have not garnered the mainstream attention they deserve (or would garner if the roles were reversed). They are, however, getting plenty of play on Fox News, where voters in the Republican base are likely to be paying attention. Fox has already hyped fears of massive spasms of violence over the weekend that didn't come to pass, but who's to say the \"Summer of Rage\" will remain \" mostly peaceful \" during the entire hot season?\n\nLess dangerous, but still problematic, are examples of progressive overreach among out-of-touch liberal elites and celebrities (like clockwork, they never fail to take the bait).\n\nThe list of celebrities weighing in since Roe was overturned includes names like feminist Gloria Steinem, who is offering her New York guest room to out-of-state abortion seekers , and Barbara Streisand, who says the Supreme Court is \" the American Taliban .\" Not to be outdone, Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong said he is renouncing his citizenship, adding \" F- America .\" And John Legend referred to Capitol police as \"Storm troopers on their way to tell women to shut up and accept government mandated childbirth. Sickening.\"\n\nRegardless of how you feel about this issue or these celebrities, their virtue signaling (a) garners buzz for attention-starved has-beens, and (b) is universally applauded by most mainstream media. As such, they have every incentive to keep churning them out-and to ramp up the rhetoric.\n\nThe problem for Democrats is that they rarely catch on to this race to the bottom, until it's too late.\n\nThey start out with an issue where public opinion seems to be on their side and keep talking until they undermine it. They have no way of realizing this, though, because radical rhetoric is rewarded inside the progressive media filter. And so you go from position like \"safe, legal, and rare\" to something akin to abortion on demand . Whatever the abortion version of \"defund the police\" turns out to be, Democrats will embrace it and once again grasp defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nThe last and, arguably, least disquieting part of this story concerns progressive politicians' rhetoric. For example, in the wake of the Dobbs decision, Rep. Maxine Waters declared, \" The hell with the Supreme Court. We will defy them .\" Meanwhile, politicians like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are talking about impeaching Supreme Court Justices and packing the court . If you were hoping for a return to normalcy and restoring institutions, you should probably keep looking. What is more, if you're a normie Republican who doesn't quite fit in with the Jan. 6 crowd, do you really want to throw in with a radical Democratic Party?\n\nA reasonable political observer might conclude that if Democrats can't win the midterms on the heels of two mass shootings and the overturning of Roe v. Wade , they might want to pack it up (no pun intended). Even Sen. Mitch McConnell recently admitted that Republicans have a real problem in the suburbs . And as Axios notes , \"Democrats see [overturning Roe ] as a mobilizing issue for suburban women in swing House districts across the country.\"\n\nOn the other hand, there are reasons to believe all the talk about Republicans being \"the dog that caught the car \" is overblown. The unpopular Texas Heartbeat Act similarly fueled electoral warnings and ample outrage on Twitter and cable news back in 2021, but it doesn't appear to be an issue anymore with regards to the GOP's midterm fortunes. Heck, the issue even receded from the spotlight in Texas .\n\nWe still have four months until Election Day. During that time, new, big stories and scandals will undoubtedly emerge. People may realize that Dobbs does not affect them (especially people living in progressive states) nearly as much as inflation, high gas prices, and an overbearing sense of national malaise .\n\nDemocrats were expecting to take a beating this November, but now that Roe is gone forever, they see a glimmer of hope that they could avoid the typical fate of the incumbent president's party-which is to lose bigly in the midterms.\n\nBut I'm counting on progressives to overreach, alienate the middle, and blow their shot-again.\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "What Liberals Don't Want to Admit About Influxes of Migrants\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nWhen I first heard Republican governors were busing or flying migrants to liberal sanctuary cities , I was instantly opposed to it. To me, it felt like yet another cruel stunt meant to boost their standing with the GOP base.\n\nBut then, I started hearing about leaders from these liberal cities signing \" disaster declarations ,\" complaining that the \" horrific \" influx was creating a \" humanitarian situation ,\" and reports saying it \" strained a social safety net .\"\n\nAnd then it hit me. While these stunts may be callow, there's still a there there. Blue states are finally getting a taste of what red border states have to deal with every day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCase in point: a total influx of around 7,000 migrants caused Washington, D.C.'s mayor to declare a public emergency and ask the National Guard for help . But that number doesn't equal the number of migrants who are stopped crossing the southern border in a single day . Heck, according to El Paso Times , there were \"more than 900 migrants released by U.S. Border Patrol in Downtown El Paso over the past week.\"\n\n(It's impossible to know how many illegal crossings go undetected, but border agents have made approximately 1.82 million arrests at the southern border so far this fiscal year.)\n\nIn fairness, border states and towns do ask for and receive support from the federal government-but their anger and frustration stems from the belief that the federal government isn't effectively stopping, detaining, or deporting undocumented immigrants. Less than one year ago, for example, The New York Times reported that \"Immigration agents were releasing so many migrants into town [Del Rio, Texas] in March that residents complained that the spike would drain the town's limited resources.\"\n\nEven though New York City has received fewer bused migrants than D.C ., the influx of immigrants is leading Mayor Eric Adams to suggest it's time to reassess the city's \"right to shelter\" policy. This policy guarantees a person the right to a bed in a homeless shelter, regardless of their immigration status.\n\n\"The city's system is nearing its breaking point. As a result, the city's prior practices, which never contemplated the busing of thousands of people into New York City, must be reassessed,\" Mayor Adams said .\n\n\"The city is bursting at the seams,\" said City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams , \"and quite frankly, is not prepared to handle this influx of individuals coming.\"\n\nIf New York City can't handle the influx, do you think Del Rio -population 36,000-can?\n\nTo be sure, there are millions of immigrants-including undocumented-in blue states like New York. They are part of the social fabric. Still, rich blue states may not have heretofore realized the toll a large and sudden influx takes on government services. When large groups of people come into your community unannounced and uninvited, it strains your government and common resources.\n\nWhat is more, sanctuary cities and progressive policies (including policies pursued by President Joe Biden ) may serve as a magnet for illegal crossings in border states.\n\nWith this maneuver, Republican governors are forcing the rest of the nation to sympathize with the plight of border states and grapple with the consequences of a nation unable to control its borders.\n\nUntil recently, this gambit has belonged to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey-but Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has now gotten into the act (and escalated the troll) by sending two planeloads of Venezuelan migrants to the \"playground of the rich,\" known as Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts.\n\nTo their credit, the summer colony's latte liberal denizens have responded so far with compassion . But it's worth noting that Washington, D.C., and New York City have also welcomed migrants -and that we are only talking about an estimated 50 migrants (so far) in Martha's Vineyard.\n\nSpeaking of which, for anyone worried about inhumane treatment, there are worse places to be sent. For someone fleeing Venezuela or Haiti, Martha's Vineyard is hardly like being sent to Gitmo. Heck, it's not even Ocean City, Maryland. Besides, the Biden administration reportedly transported migrant children to Chattanooga, Tennessee, overnight last year, while simultaneously busing migrant children to Dallas, Texas, and Miami, Florida. All in all, I'd rather be in Martha's Vineyard.\n\nI will say that there is one big caveat to all of this: There are reports that migrants were misled to believe they were going to Boston and that jobs and housing were waiting for them. This is sort of like being told you are flying to Washington, D.C., and then realizing you have flown to Baltimore/Washington International airport, which no matter what the name says is not in the Washington, D.C., area-and that you'll be staying at a Hilton when it's actually a hostel. Obviously, asylum seekers shouldn't be lied to or otherwise misled. If true, it's indefensible.\n\nStill, it seems weird to me that progressives are more angry with Florida and Texas for sending immigrants north than they are at Venezuela or Haiti (or Mexico) for creating an environment where a human is willing to risk their life to get to the United States. This is just one of the realizations this \"gimmick\" has made me contemplate.\n\nThat is not to say DeSantis' strategy is effective or that there won't be costs. Migrants-many of whom are likely fleeing violence and seeking asylum- are being used as pawns to make a political point.\n\nIt's impossible to predict what tragedy might befall them (or others) in transit or upon arrival. If and when that happens, some fingers might be pointed southward to the border states. There is also the potential for political backlash back home (for example, DeSantis is taking heat from the South Florida Venezuelan community).\n\nBut give credit where credit is due. Republicans have finally crafted a stunt that owns the libs, highlights hypocrisy, and makes us think. For them, it's a major improvement.\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "'The Hunt': The Controversy-Baiting Movie That Made Trump Furious\n\nEntertainment Critic\n\nIn what amounts to the opposite of breaking news, Donald Trump's August 2019 tweets about The Hunt -which, along with two mass shootings, compelled Universal Pictures to delay the film's original September 27 release- were hopelessly misguided .\n\nDirector Craig Zobel's B-movie about a collection of wealthy liberals hunting kidnapped conservatives turns out to be a far cry from a simple blue-state screed against red-state inhabitants. Instead, this gleefully trashy, superficial satire takes shotgun aim at both Democrats and Republicans for their stereotypical assumptions about, and thin-skinned fury at, each other-and the ultraviolence that inevitably comes from such blind hatred.\n\nPlaying off its politicized-warfare conceit, the initial us-against-them ad campaign for The Hunt (debuting March 13) certainly courted controversy, and in hindsight, it was somewhat predictable that the president took the bait and used it to opportunistically rile up his base. Opportunism works both ways, however, and Universal has subsequently leaned into the hullabaloo by rebranding the thriller with the tagline, \"The most talked about movie of the year is one that no one's actually seen.\" The result has been a cinematic machine that generates heated op-ed pieces and Twitter rants.\n\nBut what of the actual film? Written by Watchmen 's Damon Lindelof alongside his The Leftovers partner Nick Cuse , The Hunt operates similarly to Blumhouse Productions' recent The Invisible Man in that it's a lean genre effort predicated on hot-button issues. In this update of The Most Dangerous Game for our era of polarized discourse, it's liberals orchestrating the mayhem, as the exploitative action opens with the sight of a mysterious woman participating in a group text chat in which, after Trump is referred to as the \"ratfucker-in-chief,\" she confesses she can't wait to slaughter \"deplorables\" at the \"manor.\" An ensuing scene aboard a luxury jet confirms that said plan has been set in motion. Amidst snobbishly talking about caviar and champagne, a crew of genteel men and women freak out when a captive hillbilly emerges from his narcotized stupor and, for his disobedience, has his eyeball impaled, and removed, by a stiletto heel.\n\nThose dastardly Democrats! The Hunt immediately segues to the sight of Emma Roberts-sporting bleach blonde locks-awakening in a field, a locked gag in her mouth. She follows other, similarly befuddled abductees to a large clearing, where they discover a crate housing a pig in a shirt, as well as a rack full of heavy-duty weapons. No sooner have they armed themselves than these strangers-including Ike Barinholtz and This is Us ' Justin Hartley -are besieged by deadly fire from unseen assailants. Director Zobel employs familiar faces to court sympathy for his preyed-upon victims, and then pulls the rug out from under viewers by offing some of them in gruesome fashion.\n\nNo one is safe from liberal \"elites,\" as confirmed by a following scene of three geographically disparate conservatives (spoiler alert: the Orlando native is the one covered in clownish gang tats) taking refuge at a gas station. The proprietors claim they're in Arkansas, but when canny Crystal ( Glow 's Betty Gilpin ) arrives, she isn't convinced by this ruse, and takes the fight to her assailants. Thus, what began as a jovial massacre perpetrated by individuals who believe in climate change and worry about whether or not African-Americans can now be called \"blacks\" (as NPR contends), transforms into a full-fledged war, with Crystal displaying a battlefield canniness that puts her lefty attackers on the defensive.\n\nSince Crystal is never sure whether she's dealing with friend or foe, it would be criminal to reveal what happens during her encounters with the likes of a right-wing podcaster ( Ethan Suplee ) who rails about being an unwitting participant in \"Manorgate\"-a conspiracy theory born from the introductory text-chat conversation-and that \"globalist cucks who run the deep state\" are behind it. While she never stoops to using the sort of ugly rhetoric found on far-right corners of Reddit and social media, her embattled comrades do, thereby underlining their repugnance and painting their torment as, if not justified, then still deserved. However, for every instance that The Hunt slams conservatives as bigoted know-nothing hicks, it also ridicules liberals as P.C. wokester cretins driven by a belief system that's as intolerantly extreme as that of their enemies. Lindelof and Cuse's script is an equal-opportunity denouncer, casting everyone in this conflict as a distasteful radical eager to kill for sport, survival or the simple thrill of validating their ideology.\n\nDoes that make The Hunt juvenile and wishy-washy? Yes, especially as it barrels forward to a ho-hum finale that's been designed to have it both ways, courtesy of a late Crystal twist. Yet even at its shakiest, Zobel's film gets decent mileage out of making audience members flip-flop between rooting for Crystal and company to take down their bloodthirsty oppressors, and hoping these conservatives experience some Second Amendment-enabled suffering. One can imagine moviegoers of both political persuasions enjoying (and being disgusted by) this carnage, which benefits from fleet pacing and sharp staging that leads to a series of surprises that play off the idea that, in this age of endless paranoia and disinformation, no one can be trusted.\n\nPrimarily, The Hunt benefits from Gilpin as its de facto heroine, a Mississippi car-rental employee with an aptitude for weapons and hand-to-hand combat. Speaking sparsely but conveying much with a steely glare, the actress is as ferocious as they come. Yet what makes her performance so electric are the occasional moments-lifting her feet and twisting sideways to boot someone out of a speeding car, for instance-when her eyes go wide, the corners of her mouth curl upwards in a slight smile, and she transforms into a cartoonish angel of death.

And while her Crystal may liken herself to a jackrabbit (via a gruesome version of \"The Tortoise and the Hare\"), the lasting impression she leaves is of a merciless Bugs Bunny, hopping her way through a minefield of mad fanatics.\n\nEntertainment Critic\n\nNick.Schager@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Bluesky Overtakes Threads as Liberals Flee MAGA Trolls on X\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nSocial media start-up Bluesky is exploding as academics, journalists, and left-leaning politicians abandon Elon Musk 's X in search of bluer skies. Now, the platform has surpassed Meta 's Threads in user numbers, yet Threads still leads in app usage.\n\nAccording to data from Similarweb, app and website usage of Bluesky in the United States rose more than 500 percent following President-elect Donald Trump's election win, raking in 3.5 million daily users. The platform still only has around 21.5 million users as of Nov. 22.\n\n\"We've been growing by about a million users a day for several days,\" Bluesky CEO Jay Graber told NPR on Monday. \"It's proving out the model that we thought would be the right approach to social [media]: Give people the tools to control their experience and they'll have a better time.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe app, created by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey , debuted in 2019 as a desktop and app-based social network that operates similarly to X. Users can post text, videos and photos, reply to one another and share other users' posts. The platform is now led by digital rights activist and software engineer Graber.\n\nAside from the growing discontent among X users with Musk, Bluesky's expansion has come partly from its \"starter pack\" feature that allows users to follow curated groups of accounts with the click of a button.\n\nThis growth, however, has faltered due to repeated outages and glitches, and concerns over its future success as a working business model.\n\nStill, prior to Nov. 5, Threads had five times more daily U.S. users than Bluesky. Now, the Meta run platform is only 1.5 times larger than its much smaller rival.\n\nSome have attributed the closing margin to Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg 's decision to de-prioritize political content across its apps, including Facebook and Instagram.\n\nBy contrast, Musk has curtailed content moderation on X since taking over the platform, leading to concerns about the spread of disinformation.\n\nThe Tesla executive's embrace of deregulation, his affiliation with Trump , and promotion of fringe theories prompted a first wave of user departures after the app was suspended in Brazil in September.\n\nThe temporary ban coincided with Bluesky picking up 3 million new users that week. The X alternative added another 1.2 million users in the two days after Musk announced his app would allow blocked users to view posts by those who had blocked them.\n\nSince Trump's election victory, however, several prominent businesses, celebrities, and journalists have publicly and officially left X, including Target, The Guardian , journalist Don Lemon , actor Bradley Whitford, and singer Barbra Streisand .\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nlilymae.lazarus@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "A Fuck You to the White Liberals Who Cleared the Runway for Trump's White Supremacist Suicide Mission\n\nIn the midst of all this , I can't help but recall that just four years ago, those of us who were panicked and petrified about the lethality of the Trump presidency were being dismissed as hysterics. A chorus of white New York Times milquetoast-liberal opinion writers suggested we \" stop shaming Trump supporters \"; announced that hysteria, not Trump , was the real threat to democracy; and advised us to suspend all rational disbelief and give \" President-elect Trump a chance .\"\n\nPolitical writers including Will Marshall , John B. Judis and Mark Lilla, among many others, actually used the moment to chastise progressives with the taunt that identity politics \" never wins elections \"-as if white male identity hasn't always been the centerpiece of American politics, and hadn't won the damn presidency just days before. Everyone from Tom Hanks to Dave Chapelle to outgoing President Barack Obama proposed that we just take it down a thousand, wait and see, everything would be probably fine.\n\nAs it turns out, those of us predicting the absolute worst-just based on, you know , observable reality-were right. Donald Trump has been a cruel, crude, unethical conman of a president whose ineptitude, narcissism and incapacity for empathy continually endangers countless lives. His administration has fatally harmed immigrant kids and families, been careless in foreign conflicts , and worsened racist violence . It was always clear that Trump was going to get a lot of people killed. As coronavirus ravages the country and racks up a body count, remembering the gaslighting from naysayers proffering condescension or dumb optimism is all the more enraging. Trumpism is the white supremacist capitalist kamikaze mission we warned you about.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe president is an obvious horror show, but he's enabled by members of a movement most saliently characterized by its racism and vengeance, and by apologists who insist the rest of us must understand and respect that movement. We know from multiple studies conducted before and after the 2016 election that what united Trump voters-including those who previously cast ballots for President Obama -wasn't economic anxiety but racism.\n\nMost white Americans have fever-dreamed a country where the racial hierarchy is now topsy-turvy and they've become victims of anti-white discrimination. (Though they admit they haven't experienced it firsthand .) White Republican voters, specifically, report that they face as much racism as black people . That self-imposed victimhood led them to vote for the guy who promised that he'd effectively punish the blacks, Mexicans and Muslims they saw as taking a country they truly believe is solely, rightfully theirs.\n\nThe problem with white supremacy, though, is that in its single-minded effort to maintain and preserve white power above all else, it self-harms. Red states, which take up way more than their fair share of government funding, essentially voted to gut the very safety nets that benefit them , out of fear that they just might benefit black people, too. (This continues a long and historic tradition of white Americans voting against their own health and well-being to keep black people from deriving similar gains.) The question of why Trump supporters vote against their interests overlooks the fact that their primary interest is white supremacy. They'll go down with the ship to maintain white power-and their status in the racial hierarchy-even if it kills them. Literally.\n\n\"White backlash politics gave certain white populations the sensation of winning, particularly by upending the gains of minorities and liberals; yet the victories came at a steep cost,\" writes Jonathan Metzl , author of Dying of Whiteness . Their political choices ultimately \"materially benefitted people and corporations far higher up the socioeconomic food chain-whose agendas and capital gains depended on the invisible sacrifices of low-income whites.\" In other words, they become self-sacrificing tools of capitalists who don't care about them at all, but who recognize that by exploiting their racial resentments, they can be used to political and economic advantage.\n\nIn return, we've all ended up with a barely functioning health-care system, crappy environmental legislation, and unfettered access to guns that white people increasingly turn on themselves. \"When white backlash policies became laws, as in cutting away health care programs and infrastructure spending, blocking expansion of health care delivery systems, defunding opiate-addiction centers, spewing toxins into the air, or enabling guns in public spaces, the result was increasing rates of death.\"\n\nThat shakes out in the numbers. Mortality rates among whites, which had been shrinking at about 2 percent a year for decades, have been rising since 1999, the result of what researchers label \" deaths of despair \" by suicide, drugs, and alcohol. When they drilled down to see precisely what's happening, researchers found a direct correlation between the increase in death rates and white people's obsessive fear of losing privilege. The \"fuck your feelings\" crowd's self-pitying over imagined status loss is so all consuming, it's costing them their lives.\n\n\"For perhaps the first time, we're suggesting that a widespread population health phenomenon can't be explained by actual social or economic status disadvantage, but instead is driven by a perceived threat to status,\" Arjumand Siddiqi, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto , has said. \"The anxiety of whites is coming from a misperception that their dominant status in society is being threatened, which is manifesting in multiple forms of psychological and physiological stress.\"\n\nIn their endless and desperate efforts to protect white supremacy, Trump voters rewarded  incompetence and mediocrity, two traits that have defined this presidency on every front-including its response to a deadly global pandemic. This is how white supremacy ultimately hurts us all, including its defenders. And to be sure, communities of color and other marginalized populations will suffer the most because of this resistance to anything resembling equality. But white communities needlessly suffer, too.\n\nAnd yet, despite bearing witness to the president 's lies and mismanagement of the crisis , which have made the U.S. the global leader in known coronavirus cases -and likely the future leader in COVID-19 related deaths-the white supremacist capitalist kamikaze mission continues. As long as Trump and his ilk are putting the screws to the blacks and the libs, as long as \"those\" undeserving people will be hurt, it's worth it in the end.\n\nThat's the sentiment at the core of the Trump administration's ongoing push to take food stamps from more than 700,000 people, a significant number of them members of the GOP base, in the middle of a health pandemic. It's why white conservatives who are well aware that racial divisiveness is a key ingredient to maintaining Trumpism keep dog-whistling anti-Asian sentiments in their messaging-intentionally labeling the disease the \" Wuhan virus \" and \" the Chinese coronavirus \"-to divert attention from this administration's abysmal mishandling of the epidemic.\n\nIt explains how this government, which constantly pretends we don't have money for free college or debt forgiveness, health care for all, or black chattel slavery reparations, for that matter, just passed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill to ensure white folks facing economic woes can feel like there's government action-and remain complacent enough that they don't get up in arms about the fact that the legislation doesn't federally mandate that testing and treatment be free and easily accessible; that $1,200 checks for working people are means-tested but superrich corporate shareholders get cash giveaways; and that undocumented immigrants and their families get absolutely nothing .\n\nIt's why Republican lawmakers Matt Gaetz and Fox News anchor Ed Harris singled out Howard University- an historically black college that houses a hospital designated a Washington, D.C., COVID-19 treatment center-for questioning regarding funds allotted in the stimulus bill, despite the fact that white colleges also received support.\n\nAnd it's why right-wing blowhards are attempting to paint this as a blue state, coastal elite issue, even though the number of coronavirus cases are currently \" increasing at a more rapid rate in red states .\"\n\nThis is the red meat that Trump voters love. As of this writing, a whopping 76 percent of Republicans still approve of how the Trump administration is (mis)handling this outbreak, yet another testament to the intractability of white supremacy among folks who are just dying to own the libs.\n\nBut Trumpism is a monster that's never satisfied. The rise of the coronavirus seems to have engendered a kind of transparency on the right, and now wealthy conservative figures are outright asking Trump's base to die to preserve a racialized economic status quo that does nothing for most of them. How else to explain the calls for lots more people to die so that markets can thrive?\n\n\"America will again, and soon, be open for business,\" the president said last Monday. \"A lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.\" R.R. Reno, the supposedly pro-life editor of the right-wing religious outlet First Things , has cautioned readers that \"there is a demonic side to the sentimentalism of saving lives at any cost.\" Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick went on Tucker Carlson's Fox show to tell senior citizens that dying so the stock market can live is the patriotic choice, asking \"are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren?\" Glenn Beck, in a video that showed him comfortably working from his home studio, said he'd \"rather die than kill the country. Because it's not the economy that's dying, it's the country.\" Conservative radio host Jesse Kelly tweeted , \"You do not destroy your economy for any reason...Not for a virus. Not for a plague...The show must go on.\"\n\nSo far, recent polls suggest even Trump voters are skeptical of this line of thinking. But never underestimate the suicidal tendencies of the Trump cult, especially as his overall numbers are somehow up in the midst of the mess he didn't make but has already made much worse than it had to be.\n\nSo yeah, I'll never forgive Trump, but my greatest ire is reserved for the people who voted for him, who aid and abet him and his toxic agenda daily. And for those who opposed Trump, sort of, but mocked or dismissed us as we expressed our entirely justified fears about how terrifying this presidency would be to our lives and this country-I see you. At this point, it almost feels unnecessary to say fuck you to all those who proffered condescension or dumb optimism in the face of looming Trumpian disaster and destruction. Mostly because Donald Trump's governance is now shouting it louder than ever.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Netflix Takes Aim at Liberals With 'Snowflake Mountain'\n\nOn Wednesday, Netflix quietly dropped Snowflake Mountain with little promotion in the lead-up to its arrival. And it only takes watching the first 30 seconds of the reality-television series to understand why.\n\nIf you hadn't already guessed, the \"snowflake\" in Snowflake Mountain refers to the pejorative term largely used by the right-and often preceded by the word \"liberal\"-to describe someone who is overly sensitive. The eight-episode series follows a group of young adults who are purportedly \"overly emotional, easily offended, and dramatic.\" Their parents, whom they all still live with, send them off to the wilderness where two military veterans teach them survival skills that will somehow transfer into maturity and accountability once they return home. Later on, it's revealed that they're also competing in a Survivor- style competition for a $50,000 prize.\n\nThe show's authenticity immediately comes into question as we're given a brief overview of the cast. You sense that the participants are either actors or non-professionals who were instructed to appear overly narcissistic and lazy by producers. For instance, a 19-year-old woman named Devon, who \"parties 24/7,\" tells us that her only contribution to society is being a vegan. A British white guy named Liam childishly asserts that cleaning is \"not for me, hon!\" And a Black man named Carl tells us, while playing basketball, that he dropped out of college without any further information about his life.\n\nOverall, Snowflake Mountain has a familiar, early-to-mid-2000s Fox sensibility regarding its subject matter, mixed with the sort of overtly wacky tone of other Netflix programs like The Floor Is Lava and Is It Cake? The series lacks the stakes it tries to establish given how obviously scripted it all feels. And the challenges are as riveting as watching your neighbor cut down a tree, which is literally one of their assignments. (Although, there is one particularly shocking, unflinching scene where Devon, the vegan, has to butcher a deer carcass).\n\nThe depictions of the cast members become more bearable over time, treating them less like one-dimensional caricatures and more like recognizable human beings with backstories. Meanwhile, the survival experts, Matt and Joel, a former Army combat engineer and a former Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal technician, respectively, are purposely presented as disarming and approachable so as to convey the message that people who commit mass destruction for a living are actually harmless. Toward the end of Snowflake Mountain , you realize it touts the same centrist messaging of Netflix's Emmy-winning original series Queer Eye , only this time aimed at progressive, urban millennials and Gen-Zers.\n\nAt a time when Netflix's stock is plummeting due to a major loss in subscribers this year that's only projected to get worse, Snowflake Mountain reads as a desperate attempt by the streaming service to court conservatives viewers who may not see themselves represented in their current slate of programming. Netflix has already taken a right-wing stance in our current culture war by allowing transphobic comedians to thrive on its platform , so why not invite bigoted subscribers to mock a decidedly diverse group of young people introduced in the most stereotypical fashion?\n\nOne can imagine Netflix executives defending Snowflake Mountain by claiming it pokes fun at young people broadly as opposed to the people of color and queer people that are cast in the show. But viewers who already make uninformed generalizations about younger generations-like the idea that they don't work, are too sensitive, and are economically privileged-and earnestly use the term \"snowflake,\" typically hold bigoted views about the demographics on display in the series. Even as the show becomes more grounded and sympathetic, it's already done the work of confirming any biases conservative viewers may have of Black women and gay men, for example.\n\nAll in all, Snowflake Mountain is another instance of Netflix, which likes to applaud itself for having progressive values and embracing diversity, wanting to have it both ways. It's also another reminder that tech companies, particularly ones as big as Netflix, don't actually have morals, and we shouldn't really look to them to have any. If their newest reality series becomes a success, we should only expect more of this sort of bootlicking, conservative garbage in the future.\n\nkyndall.cunningham@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "What is 'abundance' liberalism, and why are people arguing about it?\n\nA new book has sparked debate with its provocative claim that progressive public policy in the US is broken\n\nI s progressive public policy in America broken? Do many left-leaning laws actually make life more expensive for struggling people? Is regulatory red tape hindering growth and innovation? Have Democratic-run cities, such as New York and San Francisco, become giant billboards against liberal governance?\n\nThese arguments wouldn't sound out of place in a policy paper from a conservative thinktank. Yet their newest champions are two of America's best-known left-leaning journalists, the New York Times' Ezra Klein and the Atlantic's Derek Thompson - and they believe the left is overdue for a reckoning of sorts.\n\nKlein and Thompson make their case in a new book simply called, with no subtitle, Abundance. The authors put forward a positive pitch for \"abundance liberalism\": a vision of the US where policymakers spend less time fighting over how to apportion scarce resources and more time making sure there's no scarcity to start with.\n\nAbundance has received a mostly positive reception so far, but also sparked debate, with critics arguing that the book ignores the effect of corporate power, downplays Republicans' role in the crises that the US faces or overstates the effectiveness of its policy prescriptions. A writer in the left-leaning magazine American Prospect accused the \"abundance agenda\" of being \"neoliberalism repackaged for a post-neoliberal world\".\n\nThe book opens with a striking image of a US, in the year 2050, that is close to utopia. Americans' electrical needs are powered by sustainable energy \"so clean it barely leaves a carbon trace and so cheap you can scarcely find it on your monthly bill\". AI breakthroughs, labor rights and economic reforms mean that most people can do their jobs in a shorter workweek. Vertical farms provide cheap and fresh vegetables, desalinated water from the ocean is used as drinking water, and lab-grown meat has replaced animal slaughter.\n\nThis near-future America - less the gritty neon smog of Blade Runner than a hi-tech Copenhagen - is entirely achievable, the authors argue. It just requires political vision and a willingness to reconsider certain assumptions.\n\nDespite being the richest country in the world, the US has a problem of scarcity, particularly in Democratic-run metropolitan areas, where the costs of housing and other basic needs have spiraled out of control. This is exacerbated by the traditional progressive solution of giving people money or vouchers to help them pay for finite resources such as housing, healthcare and food, the book argues, which increases demand and merely makes those things even more expensive.\n\n\"The problem is that if you subsidize the cost of something that there isn't enough of, you'll raise prices or force rationing,\" Klein has said . He and Thompson have described themselves as \"supply-side\" progressives, borrowing a term usually associated with conservative economic theories .\n\nWhat the US badly needs to do is build, they argue - build more houses, public transportation, power plants and other infrastructure - but that isn't happening.\n\nOne obstacle is nimbyism, the tendency of people to support public works and development in the abstract but fight them when they affect their own neighborhoods. Another is \"everything bagel\" logrolling that complicates what should be narrowly focused legislation by layering it with other social and political objectives, such as diverse hiring requirements or climate crisis goals, in order to appease interest groups or political constituencies.\n\nIn an example Thompson recently discussed on a podcast, then president Joe Biden signed legislation in 2021 providing $42bn of funding to expand access to broadband internet in rural America. As of this December, according to Politico, the program had \"yet to connect a single household\". Critics told Politico that this was partly because of a \"suite of federal conditions\" that required states \"accepting the money to make sure providers plan for climate change, reach out to unionized workforces and hire locally\", as well as guarantee affordable broadband plans for people with low incomes.\n\n\"I don't want the state of Virginia taking, say, federal money to build broadband internet and then charging poor rural folks, like, $200 a month to go online,\" Thompson said. \"But by holding those values so closely ... we accidentally built just about nothing.\" A \"confusion of process versus outcomes\" meant that \"very little was actually done on behalf of the Americans for whom we wanted to raise their living standards\".\n\nAnother example is California, which in 1982 began studying the idea of implementing a high-speed rail system across the state. The idea was, and is, extremely popular with voters, and billions of dollars were budgeted for the project. Four decades later, almost none of it has been built. A \" vetocracy \" of regulatory, legal, environmental and political considerations have caused endless delays and continually narrowed the project's ambition.\n\n\"In the time California has spent failing to complete its 500-mile high-speed rail system,\" Thompson and Klein write, \"China has built more than 23,000 miles of high-speed rail.\"\n\nThe solution to these problems, Abundance argues, is a combination of techno-optimism, ambitious and clearly defined policy goals, and political leadership that is willing at times to say no to progressive pressure groups.\n\nKlein and Thompson favorably cite what happened when a bridge collapsed in Pennsylvania in 2023, crippling an essential highway. To fix it would typically take months of planning, consultation and reviews; Governor Josh Shapiro instead declared a state of emergency that allowed the reconstruction of the bridge with union labor but free from many normal processes. The highway reopened in 12 days, instead of the 12 to 24 months that it might have taken.\n\nAbundance makes clear that it is a book written for the left, and isn't really interested in elaborating the ways that Republicans and conservatives have contributed to these problems, though Klein and Thompson acknowledge that they have. Yet within the left the book has proved controversial.\n\n\"[I]t would be a huge mistake,\" Matt Bruenig, a policy analyst, wrote in Jacobin, \"to sideline whatever focus there is on welfare state expansion and economic egalitarianism in favor of a focus on administrative burdens in construction.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Indeed, we have now seen what it looks like when the government supports and subsidizes technological innovation and implementation without concerning itself with the inegalitarianism of the system. His name is Elon Musk. In its desire to promote electrical vehicles and rocketry innovations, the US government made him the richest man in the world and then he used his riches to take over a major political communications platform and then the government.\"\n\nWhile agreeing with some of Abundance's aims, the journalists Paul Glastris and Nate Weisberg, writing in the Washington Monthly, argued that the book's prescriptions wouldn't necessarily bring the kind of sweeping changes that Klein and Thompson believe. For example, according to examples they cite, areas of the US that have reformed zoning laws to make it easier to build apartment buildings and multifamily homes have seen only modest reductions in the cost of housing.\n\nThompson and Klein have argued that the abundance agenda is bigger than any individual policy proposal, and more about the Democratic party and other left-leaning institutions rethinking their own ambitions and how they conceive of success and failure.\n\n\"Liberals should be able to say: Vote for us, and we will govern the country the way we govern California! \" they write. \"Instead, conservatives are able to say: Vote for them, and they will govern the country the way they govern California! ... What has gone wrong?\""

      "text": "Canada's Liberals on course for political resurrection amid trade war, polls show\n\nMark Carney-led ruling party projected to form majority months after political wipeout seemed inevitable\n\nIn January, Canadian pollsters and political pundits struggled to find fresh ways to describe the bleak prospects of Justin Trudeau 's Liberal party, musing whether it would be a wipeout of existential proportions, or merely a catastrophic blowout.\n\nBut fresh polling released by three companies this week shows a stunning reversal of fortunes for the party: newly minted prime minister Mark Carney 's Liberals are projected to secure a majority government.\n\nThe outcome has little precedent in Canadian history, reflecting the outsized role played by an unpredictable US president, and it underscores the incentives for Carney to call a snap election in the coming days.\n\nOn Tuesday, the political analyst Philippe Fournier updated his closely watched website 338Canada, which tracks and aggregates national polls, converting those figures into projected election results.\n\nFor the first time, his projection showed the Liberals with a 55% chance of a majority government. In January, the odds stood at less than 1%.\n\nFor the last two years, the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, has used a controversial carbon levy and Trudeau, a deeply unpopular outgoing prime minister, to propel his Tories to what promised to be one of the most lopsided political wins in recent memory. Pollsters predicted his party would seize a commanding majority of seats. For more than a year and a half, the Conservatives' win probabilities stood at more than 99%.\n\nAs recently as January, for example, the most sympathetic polling firm had Trudeau's party trailing the Conservatives by 20 points. Others had the gap as high as 27 points.\n\nBut Trudeau's resignation days later, and Donald Trump 's threats to take over Canada , changed everything.\n\nIn a recent column for the Walrus magazine on the \"stunning Conservative collapse\", Fournier warned the Tories, whose odds of winning stood at 15%, were \"suddenly at risk of blowing one of the largest polling leads in modern Canadian history\".\n\nVirtually all Canadian polling companies have shown a sharp trend towards the Liberals, at the expense of the Conservative party and the leftwing New Democratic party. If current polling predictions are reflected in the results of the upcoming federal election, the NDP would collapse and lose party status in the House of Commons.\n\n\"This shift would be among the biggest we've seen in such a short period of time in Canadian history,\" said Éric Grenier, a political analyst at the Writ . Unlike other notable shifts in public sentiment, he says, the result is heavily skewed by threats from Donald Trump.\n\n\"It isn't just a question of a leadership honeymoon ... But that adds a level of volatility to the public opinion environment that makes things unpredictable.\"\n\nFor Poilievre, who had harnessed a populist current in the country and drawn comparisons with Trump, the avenues forward are less clear after losing the easy political targets of Trudeau and the carbon tax.\n\nWhile the Conservative leader's combative politics have served him well as opposition leader, that same strategy appear to be faltering as nationalism supplants partisanship.\n\nPoilievre this week held an event with an \"Axe the Tax\" sign - days after Carney had dismantled the consumer-facing carbon tax.\n\nThe political columnist Robyn Urback posted on social media that the Conservatives \"are still waging the election campaign they never got to have\".\n\nIn more grim data points for the Tories, polling from the Angus Reid Institute released on Monday found Canadians preferred Carney over Poilievre on all questions relating to the ongoing trade war and the future of Canada's economy.\n\n\"More bluntly, 41% now view Carney as best suited to be prime minister compared to 29% for Poilievre,\" the company said in its new release. \"At least measurement, with Trudeau sitting in the PM chair, Poilievre led the Liberal leader by 19 points on this question.\"\n\nIf the polling holds, \"what was a tired, discardable brand just three months ago would be on its way to a fourth term, this time with a majority\".\n\nThe firm notes the profound effect Trump has had on Canadian politics. After staring down a US-led trade war and giving impassioned speeches about the need to fight for Canada's independence, Trudeau left with the approval of 47% of Canadians - a 25-point jump compared with an all-time low of 22% just weeks before he announced his resignation."

      "text": "Behind Trump's victory lies a cold reality: liberals have no answers for a modern age in crisis\n\nAs authoritarians triumph by lying and scapegoating, there is no hope for centrists doubling down on a broken neoliberal system\n\nT he most useful lesson of growing up under a dictatorship is that dictatorships are never absolute. Sometimes they are even democracies - ones that thrive by co-opting those with proximity to power and managing those who do not benefit. That management is often through brute oppression, but mainly it is through securing consent by convincing enough people that things are about to get really great. Any minute now, once the enemies of the people are thwarted, a corner will be turned. Authoritarian democracies recognise anger, foment it, then bottle it for their own purposes.\n\nThe trick is to always have a horizon, distant but in sight, beyond which things will get better. While this happens, the trappings of national success assuage the masses and give a sense of power, prosperity and momentum. In Egypt, as the jails swelled with political prisoners, the military government erected grand pharaonic monuments and embarked on a colossal construction project in the capital. In India, Narendra Modi entrenched authoritarianism while he wooed big business and launched enormous infrastructure projects and Hindu temples. Dictators establish themselves as both great modernisers and stabilisers, promising both conservatism and futurism. They emphasise traditions and values but wrap these up in technology, urbanisation and even a certain aesthetic - clean lines, mirrors, glass and steel skyscrapers.\n\nBut the beneficiaries of modernity remain relatively limited. And so the rest of the work of political stabilisation has to happen through populism - the creation of a threatening other (the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, or just all Muslims in India) and the promise to eliminate it. If all else fails, there is legal capture, persecution and imprisonment. Such governments have understood that, in the absence of social justice and redistribution, the way forward is to deal with disaffection through strongmen leaders, lies and the ostracism of those who object.\n\nThis style of governance is not just confined to states in the global south. As someone with a foot both there and in the west, I can see a through line. Globalisation and free market capitalism , the organising principles of all but a few states, delivered on their promise of bringing us all closer together. But what often gets overlooked is how these processes made us more similar by creating winners and losers in pretty much the same way across the world. The standardisation of ways of living and doing business that globalisation produced anchored the winners, and unmoored the losers. Our lives are much more recognisable to each other than they were 30 years ago. We have all been flooded by goods, services, apps and digital entertainment, and yet we still feel the need for something else - for a sense of security beyond just our ability to consume in the immediate term.\n\nPretending to meet that need is what delivered Donald Trump's victory. He understands that an oligarchic system that enriches a few cannot deliver economic security to the masses. If you want the majority of the public on your side, you have to promise change , but not in a way that actually reconfigures society.\n\nThe problem is not a rapaciously capitalist system that has resulted in broken healthcare provision, a legislature captured by rich lobbies or deregulation that has stripped workers of their statutory rights and consequently created an epic transfer of wealth to a billionaire class . The problem is the undocumented immigrants, the enemies within the bureaucracy who tried to bring Trump down, the diversity extremists. If you are the Democrats and all you have to counter this powerful vision is a lot of nice values and dancing \"joy\" but no material proposal to radically change people's lives, you haven't even brought a knife to a gunfight - you've brought Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThe socially liberal free market model that progressives believe in has seized up. It was always going to without more aggressive regulation, redistributive policies and the sort of high tax and high spend safety net that is necessary when traditional social arrangements are shattered. In the wake of globalisation, whole communities in the west were deindustrialised while a poorly paid urban working class was created in the global south. After the 2008 financial crash, wealth became concentrated and shut an entire generation of people out from the life their parents had. In the 2010s, with the rise of Silicon Valley tech companies, another number was added to a ballooning precariat: drivers, riders and box packers were plunged into poorly protected and poorly paid work. Social media launched with the promise of crowdsourcing truth to power and bringing us all closer together, then succumbed to enshittification , misinformation, deepfakes and racism.\n\nModern life is out of control. There was no path for the Democrats to mimic the trick of Trump and the rest of the authoritarian crew. Hampered by the increasing exposure of what little can be done by liberals in a neoliberal world, progressives in the US can only point to the importance of law and order and institutions. It's a problem that Labour in the UK may well soon face. All you need is one compelling rightwing figure and Labour's rousing \" things will get worse before they get better\" approach will be shredded.\n\nSo long as centrists double down on this system and hope for the best, western democracies will be vulnerable. I remember, in the tumultuous aftermath of the Arab spring , the question over whether Arabs were \"ready for democracy\" - but democracy alone cannot guarantee freedom and equality if the economic system in which it exists prevents those very qualities from emerging. It was easier to overthrow Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak than unseat the military-private commercial partnerships behind him.\n\nThe authoritarians have an answer to the problem of systems too established and lucrative to undo: lie, scapegoat and appeal to people's fears, prejudices and vanities. Liberals don't. Because they cannot grasp that within such systems, the benefits of rationality and individual freedoms, and the pursuit of scientific endeavour and personal prosperity just do not accrue meaningfully to enough people any more.\n\nIt is easier to believe that it is racism that elected Trump, or backwardness that reversed the Egyptian revolution, or ethnic supremacism that elevated Modi. But the truth is that, all over the world, the old order is gone and the new one is bewildering. People feel trapped and want a sense of release, a promise of a dramatically different future, or just a future. Even if that sense of freedom comes vicariously from an autocrat who has flexed and snapped the chains of the system. And they want to feel as if they are part of something bigger and stronger as they get lonelier and weaker and their worlds fracture and atomise by the day. It's not that they are not ready for democracy - democracy is not ready for them.\n\nNesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist"

      "text": "The Liberals are a party  of new men\n\nTo a large part of the electorate, a general election is a new and strange thing. It will surprise them to be told that this is really pretty normal, even down to the red herrings and the personal abuse.\n\nThe re-emergence of the Liberal party is almost the most striking thing about it. A few years ago, how many people would have dared to prophesy that there would ever again be over 300 Liberal candidates in the field?\n\nIn 1929, the party made its great effort of 512 candidates. In 1931 it committed self-immolation: only 160 Liberals of all brands came forward.In 1935 it added 40 more, but its fate at the polls was so hard that its days seemed to be over.\n\nIt is quite certain that most of the young men and women who have come forward as Liberal candidates know little (and care little) about the tangled history of the Liberal party in the two decades between 1918 and 1939. They have become Liberal because Liberalism stands for something different from Labour or from Toryism (even Toryism of the reform variety).\n\nIt offers something which, better than other parties, satisfies the desire for bold reform combined with freedom and personal initiative. The Labour party can reflect that this revival of Liberalism is a sign of Labour's failure to broaden from a sectional into a national party.\n\nEven on the eve of war, there was no swing towards Labour. We shall see how far to the record of its ministers in the [wartime] coalition has gone to reassure doubters.\n\nBut Labour, like the Liberals, is also in large degree a party of new men. In the last parliament it was, in average age, the oldest of the three parties. It has had the wisdom to refresh itself.\n\nThe elector has often no easy choice before him; particularly if his main object is to see that we do not again, for the sixth time in 27 years, saddle ourselves with an overwhelming Conservative majority.\n\nIf there is one thing that our political experience should have taught us, it is that virtual dictatorship of one party is desperately bad for the credit of the parliamentary system, bad for the government which has to work it and fatal to decent progressive legislation and social policy. Mr Churchill knows this as well as any man. Mr Churchill fears that a small Conservative majority would mean weakness. On the contrary it is, short of Conservative defeat, the only tolerable thing that could happen.\n\n· [In Labour's 1945 election landslide, the Liberals won 12 seats and National Liberals 11, a combined loss of 31.]"

      "text": "Anti-Trump sentiment drives dramatic upturn in fortunes for Canada's Liberals\n\nRuling party was deeply unpopular but threat of US tariffs combined with prospect of new leader spurs rise in polls\n\nCanada 's ruling Liberals, who a few weeks ago looked certain to lose an election this year, are mounting a major comeback amid the threat of US tariffs and are tied with their rival Conservatives, according to three new polls.\n\nAn Ipsos survey released late on Tuesday showed the left-leaning Liberals have 38% public support and the official opposition right-of-center Conservatives have 36%. The Liberals have overturned a 26-point deficit in six weeks, and run advertisements comparing Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, to Donald Trump.\n\nThe Conservative strategy had long been to attack the unpopular prime minister, Justin Trudeau , but he said last month he was resigning after more than nine years in power.\n\nThe Liberals, who will choose a new leader on 9 March, steadily picked up support after the US president threatened to impose tariffs on almost all imports from Canada and said he wanted to annex Canada as the 51st US state.\n\n\"The Conservatives are facing headwinds from rising anti-Trump sentiment and anticipation surrounding the Liberal party's new leadership,\" Ipsos said in a release.\n\nThe next election must be held by 20 October but could come much sooner than that. The new Liberal leader has the option of calling an election immediately.\n\nA Leger poll released on Tuesday put the Conservatives on 38% public support with the Liberals on 35%, compared with 43% and 21% respectively in December. And an Ekos poll, also released on Tuesday, put the Liberals on 38% and the Conservatives on 37%.\n\nThe results of the three polls indicate that if an election were held now, the Liberals and Conservatives would both fall well short of a majority in the 343-seat House of Commons and could only take office with the support of smaller parties.\n\nSuch minority governments are less stable and rarely last more than two years. During the second of two Liberal leadership debates on Tuesday night, the major contenders called for tough countermeasures against the US and said the Conservatives' Poilievre would not save Canada.\n\n\"Who's the worst person to stand up to Donald Trump? It's Pierre Poilievre. He worships the man. He uses his language. He's not the right person for our country at this crucial time,\" said the former central bank governor Mark Carney.\n\nPoilievre's office was not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe former finance minister Chrystia Freeland told the debate that \"Trump is posing the gravest challenge our country has faced since the second world war\"."

John K. Bromilow, Okehampton UK Originally,  Conservatism's aim was to  conserve the existing order and protect the economy from foreigners, Liberalism's was to loosen restrictions and advance free trade. Socialism differed in advocating a classless society in which all had an equal stake.\r\nConservatism and Liberalism represented shades of ruling-class opinion in the 19th century and both sought to exclude the workers from any undue influence. \r\nSocialism appealed to the workers because it promised to dispossess the rulers and owners and share wealth and power equally. Phil Ashmore, London Liberals believe in individual action; socialists believe in collective action. Alan Mills, Alne There's a great cod-political analysis in terms of cows, part of which goes:\r\nConservatism: you have two cows. And you're bloody well keeping them away from those poor people, because they enjoy being poor.\r\nSocialism: you have two cows. The government takes one and gives it your neighbour.\r\nLiberalism: you have two cows. But they both wander round freely and you can't ever manage to milk both together.\r\nThe better parts of the rest of it include:\r\nCapitalism: you have two cows. You sell one, buy a bull, and then starve in order to feed the calves.\r\nCommunism: you have two cows. The government takes both and gives you some of the milk.\r\nFacism: you have two cows. The government takes both and sells you the milk.\r\nFederalism: you have two cows. You milk both, but then both cows assert their sub-federal autonomy and veto your central authority to drink the milk.\r\nThe alternatives to this are almost endless, of course. M B Drennan, Oxford UK Objectives are generally shared but in a world of finite resources we cannot pursue all of them so the question arises as to which is paramount.  It is also not only a question of resources; some objectives are inherently in conflict - freedom versus order or (often) peace versus justice.\r\n\r\nAs shorthand descriptions, Liberals emphasise democracy and civil liberties; Socialists emphasise equality (at least of personal worth and opportunity) and Conservatives emphasise economic freedom and wealth creation.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of UK politics is the virtual absence of policy discussion.  For example debate about education mainly revolves around who will be able to spend more on it, and issues of principle such as whether it should be primarily for personal development or to serve the needs of the economy (training for work) or to what extent the education system should promote equality are not generally heard.\r\n\r\nHistorically liberals, as I have described them, have been fewer than the others, probably because their emphasis on democracy has less appeal to any particular economic group. Nick Brown, Portishead UK Though there are scores of issues that can be analysed from both viewpoints, most of us liberals are concerned with labour and social issues while having no problem with private ownership of business or with the existence of social classes. The latter is often indirectly valuable. Many young men who are prodigal by nature and receive very large inheritances are key in the re-distribution of wealth without socialism.\r\n\r\nIn extreme forms, of course, one who is a liberal believes in the ballot, where a socialist prefers the bullet. Elizabeth, New York City USA Liberalism is the political Man United - dominating, dull and self-indulgent - whereas Socialism is more of a Man City type - trendy, always got something to aim for, never stand a chance. Jay Illing, How does Elisabeth from New York come to the distinction being one of ballots or bullets?  \r\nLiberals in general have supported their countries in war.  Socialists have in large numbers have largely opposed such wars.  \r\nLiberals have consistently supported violence in order to maintain private property, from the Paris Commune to Chile in 1973 (and that was an elected socialist government).\r\nThe key distinction is that liberalism supports private property and capitalism and is prepared to support the use violence to maintain it.  Socialism wishes to establish collective property relations in the major sectors of the economy.  When faced with a ruling class (liberal or otherwise) who will resort to violence it would be foolish to eschew bullets of our own. Fez, Leeds UK Fez is spot-on. Liberalism always supports general notions of private property and individual liberty over the general concepts of equality and collective needs. In the context of a capitalist society based on the exploitation of one class by another, liberal reformism stumbles into the contradictory position of handwringing condemnations of poverty whilst also supporting the rights of corporations and the political state to crush the active dissent of the exploited. It occupies a half-way house which cannot stand. Mitch, Sheffield UK Imagine the traditonal left/right graph of politics. On the left you have communists on the right fascists and in between conservatism and socialism to ever decreasing levels towards the middle. Now add the y axis, which represents, at the top liberalism, and at the bottom authoritarianism. Liberals believe people are intelligent and able enough to look after themselves and their collective interest and need only a minimum of guidance from institutions. Authoritarians believe people need almost big brother like control. \r\n\r\nOn this graph it is possible for your own views to appear anywhere, ie you can be socialist and liberal, or socialist and authoritarian. It is possible, though perhaps less plauisble to be a liberal fascist. David, Warwic UK I've just had the delight of re-encountering this thread, from many years ago, when looking into further issues around this same question.\r\n\r\nMy thanks to all who have contributed their fascinating answers.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly noteworthy how different are the European and American perspectives on these terms.\r\n\r\nIf I may, I'll share with you my own further conclusions on simple but distinctive definitions.\r\n\r\nConservatives believe in inequality of opportunity and inequality of outcome.\r\n\r\nLiberals believe in equality of opportunity and inequality of outcome.\r\n\r\nSocialists believe in inequality of opportunity and equality of outcome.

      "text": "Canada's Liberal party was left for dead, but Trump might have just given it a second chance\n\nExperts say the US president's takeover threat will shift election priorities to who seems best suited to face Trump\n\nUntil just a few weeks ago, it was an exhilarating time to be a Conservative in Canada\n\nAfter nearly 10 years of Liberal rule, a deepening cost of living crisis had soured public support for Justin Trudeau and his shop-worn government. The Tory leader, Pierre Poilievre, had seized on a controversial carbon levy , and pledged to make the next federal vote an \"axe the tax\" election. Pollsters predicted his party would seize a convincing majority of seats. The country was on the cusp of a new Conservative era.\n\nAnd then Donald Trump suggested the US might take over Canada .\n\nThe US president's threats - ranging from \"economic coercion\" to outright annexation - have upended Canadian politics in a way few could have predicted. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday as he travelled to the Super Bowl game, Trump further escalated his rhetoric, claiming that Canada is \"not viable as a country\" without US trade, and warning that it can no longer depend on the US for military protection.\n\nFor the last two years, any consideration of the future of Canada's Liberal party had focused on the scale of its impending electoral loss. But in recent weeks, a series of polls have suggested that the Liberals have reversed their freefall.\n\nAnd a key factor in the party's apparent resurrection has been Trump.\n\nSince Trump's comments, Canada has seen a groundswell of visceral patriotism. Maga-style hats emblazoned \"Canada Is Not for Sale\" went viral . Canadians jeered visiting American sports teams, even during a children's ice hockey tournament in Quebec City.\n\nAnd amid a shift in the public mood, the Canadian prime minister has positioned his government as leading a \"Team Canada\" approach to the emerging threat from the south.\n\n\"In this moment, we must pull together because we love this country,\" Trudeau said in a recent speech in response to Trump's threats. \"We don't pretend to be perfect, but Canada is the best country on earth. There's nowhere else that I and our 41-million strong family would rather be, and we will get through this challenge just as we've done countless times before: together.\"\n\nBut for Poilievre, who had harnessed a populist current in the country and drawn comparisons with Trump, the avenues forward are less clear.\n\nThe Conservative leader's combative politics have served him well against Trudeau, but now appear to be faltering as nationalism supplants partisanship.\n\nOne poll, from Ipsos, found the Conservatives had shed roughly 12 points of support within two weeks. Another survey in Quebec, from the firm Leger, found that if the Liberals put former central banker Mark Carney atop their ticket, the party vaulted far ahead of both the Conservatives and the separatist Bloc Québécois.\n\nA third, from the outfit Mainstreet, found the Liberals were tied - or even leading - among likely voters in the battle ground of Ontario.\n\n\"This is very much a race that still favours the Conservatives. But if the Liberals gain even a couple more points, we're in a place where they would suddenly become much more competitive, and the potential for minority government is possible,\" said Éric Grenier, a political analyst at the Writ .\n\nOne of the main drivers in shifting sentiment has been the resignation of Trudeau as Liberal leader, after the Conservatives had gleefully prepared to wage an entire federal election campaign against him.\n\n\"Now the election isn't going to be about Trudeau. And with both Liberal candidates saying they won't move forward with the carbon tax, it also won't be about that. It will most likely be about the next four years and who is best able to dealing with Trump,\" said Grenier.\n\nLast week, another poll from the Globe and Mail and Nanos found that 40% of Canadians felt Carney - the former governor of the Bank of England - was best suited to face off against Trump. Only 26% of respondents felt that person was Poilievre.\n\nFor a campaign to go from a very specific issue - a referendum on Trudeau's last nine years as leader - to a completely different issue - Donald Trump - is \"rare\", said Grenier.\n\nThe Conservatives plan to present a new, patriotic election message in the coming days. Attenders have been instructed to wear red and white - the colours of Canada, but also the colours of the Liberal party.\n\n\"Adopting a Canada-first approach to the election is needed, but it's an awkward one for them, because they've been saying for the last couple years that the country is broken,\" said Grenier. \"And now they have to say: 'Well, it is but we still really love it.' And it also feels a bit forced because a segment of their voting base - and probably a segment of their caucus - prefers to have Donald Trump as a president.\"\n\nFor the Liberals, the reversal confirms their decision to force Trudeau out. But Grenier cautions against reading too much into the polling.\n\n\"The danger for someone like Carney, who is polling surprisingly well in a place like Quebec, is that some of the numbers are quite high. Can he live up to that? Or is the idea of him more attractive to voters than the reality of him as an actual leader?\"\n\nStill, in an election fought over national identity and the protection of sovereignty, Liberals have unexpectedly found themselves dealt a few lucky cards.\n\nNone of the Liberal candidates vying for the party's top job are cabinet ministers, depriving opposition parties the chance to accuse them of dereliction.\n\n\"It may still be a 'change' election, but it looks like it is not going to be a carbon tax election. Rhyming couplets like 'axe the tax' feel a little stale and disconnected from contemporary political and economic challenges,\" said Scott Reid, a political adviser and former director of communications to the former Liberal prime minister Paul Martin. \"And if the next election is going to be about how we rewire our relationship to the United States in the face of Trump's capriciousness, someone with the credentials of Mark Carney starts to look interesting to some voters, and it at least gives the Liberal party the possibility of resurrecting itself.\"\n\nStill, the polls at this point are \"more akin to a spark than a bonfire'', Reid said, adding that if an election were held today, Poilievre's Conservatives would probably win a majority of seats.\n\nBut the largely unprecedented nature of Trump's unpredictable incursions into the national discourse means that honing a careful message, for either party, is largely a useless task.\n\n\"What will Donald Trump do in the coming months when there's a new prime minister on the scene [after the Liberals select their new leader]? How might he blunder into the minefield of Canadian politics? We just don't know,\" said Reid. \"But we almost do know that it will happen. Either he determines the ballot question or, on any given day, he has the capacity to dictate the ballot question of the next election. That's just the reality of it.\""

Lloyd George's small group of independent Liberals opposed the National Government and rejoined the official party after the 1935 election.

Despite attempts at reunification, the National Liberal Party (as it called itself from 1948) moved ever closer to the Conservatives.

      "text": "Liberals Rose to Fight the Assault on Abortion - but Not Trans Rights\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n2022 has seen right-wing attacks on trans rights increasingly aided by the tacit, if sometimes unwitting, transphobia of liberal institutions.\n\nDemocratic Party representatives march toward the Supreme Court during a protest of the court overturning Roe v. Wade in Washington, D.C., on July 19, 2022.\n\nWhen 2022 is tallied in the annals of history, it will no doubt be remembered as the year the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Yet, while the decadeslong right-wing assault on reproductive liberties reached new heights this year, it also met a broad wave of long overdue resistance, even in crimson red states. The midterm election results were in many ways a popular rebuke to the Republican pro-natalist agenda - cold comfort as that might be in a country of minority rule.\n\nThe crucial struggle for abortion access is, however, a response to only one front in the far right's all-out war on bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom. In statehouses nationwide, Republicans consistently put forward extreme anti-abortion bills at the very same time that they have proposed bills to attack, immiserate, and eliminate trans people, particularly trans children.\n\nThe GOP has made clear that its anti-abortion efforts go hand in hand with an anti-trans eliminationist project; they are two sides of the same coin. The mass efforts to defend abortion access, however, have not been echoed in the fight for trans lives.\n\nRather, 2022 has seen right-wing attacks on trans rights increasingly aided by the tacit, if sometimes unwitting, transphobia of liberal political and media institutions - consider the numerous New York Times reports and columns, for example, that have this year put trans lives up for debate. This has been no less than a victory for fascism.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn previous years, liberal transphobia seemed largely the preserve of Britain's media ecosystem. Looking across the Atlantic, to my birth country, I had felt a certain relief that in the mainstream U.S. discourse, anti-trans rhetoric was, for the most part, understood to be a mark of the far right.\n\nThis year anti-trans liberal feminism - the sort championed by author J.K. Rowling - has been mainstreamed in the very same opinion pages that once treated the position as an unpleasant British curiosity.\n\nThe far right has, meanwhile, only escalated its anti-trans onslaught, grimly secure in the knowledge that, unlike with abortion, no significant political pushback will come. This is in part thanks to U.S. transphobes who falsely consider themselves in opposition to the far right - like some New York Times columnists - as well as fangless Democrats who treat trans people as an afterthought. Even the anti-fascist left has not done enough to take up the fight for trans rights.\n\nPride flags and candles wave during the Transgender Day of Remembrance in Wilkes-Barre, Penn., on Nov. 20, 2022.\n\nIn 2022 , state lawmakers filed a record number of anti-LGBTQ bills - nearly 300 - with many targeting trans kids in schools. Ten states barred trans students from playing sports , two states barred trans children from accessing the correct bathrooms , and two states banned discussions of sexual orientation or gender identity in schools (which, of course, only means the discussion of non-cisgender identities and non-heteronormative sexual orientations).\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott directed state agencies to investigate parents of trans kids as child abusers, an effort Republicans in other states are looking to advance . In Congress, far-right extremist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., introduced the first piece of federal legislation, co-sponsored by a whopping 40-plus House Republicans, to outlaw gender-affirming care for minors nationwide. That law would make providing such care a felony punishable by up to 25 years in prison.\n\nThe only thing holding many of these barbaric laws and policies at bay are lawsuits filed by trans children and their families, represented by attorneys like Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe outlook for 2023 remains dark: Republicans will control the U.S. House and state lawmakers - with scant reason to limit their anti-trans eliminationist efforts - will continue apace. Immediately after the midterms, lawmakers in Tennessee filed bills to ban gender-affirming health care for children in next year's state legislative session.\n\nMeanwhile, outside statehouses and courtrooms, the far right has declared open season on LBGTQ spaces. It is now common practice for armed, self-identifying Christian nationalist militia members to harass family-friendly drag brunches and drag queen story hours. When a mass shooting last month at Club Q, an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs, left five people dead, the national response was one of shock but not surprise. Anti-LGBTQ violence felt all but inevitable.\n\nThe response from the usual liberal bastions wasn't surprising either: There was handwringing about physically defending queer people. A week after the massacre, the New York Times editorial board chose to dedicate column inches to condemning armed anti-fascist groups who have been protecting queer spaces in response to this ongoing wave of armed fascist harassment.\n\nFascist propagandists like the Manhattan Institute's Christopher Rufo - who cynically transformed \"critical race theory\" from a term of scholarly inquiry into a racist foghorn - have spoken publicly about stoking their conservative base with anti-LGBTQ myths of \"groomers\" and pedophiles.\n\nIt's not a secret that the anti-trans panic has been manufactured by think tanks or that anti-trans legislation is drafted from model bills, circulated from the top down, and spewed from Tucker Carlson's furiously contorting mouth into millions of living rooms every evening. There is nothing organic nor grassroots about this anti-trans moral panic, yet it is accorded the status of a legitimate public concern.\n\n\"Rufo is so confident in his disdain\" for liberal establishment media, noted writer Max Fox in a recent essay for Parapraxis, \"that he can be seen telling credulous liberal journalists precisely how he has manipulated them into carrying out his campaign.\"\n\nIt's working: Liberals might not be echoing QAnon \"groomer\" conspiracies, but anti-trans panic abounds, reliably articulated as fear for the fates of children - notional children , who are presumed cis, that is. Time and again, I've heard ostensibly well-meaning liberals regurgitate the same sentences that were used in previous eras to treat gay identity, or interracial couples, as sites of potential peril. The refrain is the same: I support it, but won't children suffer? And the answer should be the same too: Only if we maintain a world wherein such identities and relationships are deemed unnatural and unwanted.\n\nThis is not a question of showing liberal deference to personal identity. It's about who is and is not permitted to produce and reproduce the world as they see fit. When it comes to queer and trans liberation, especially of queer trans people of color, we have this year seen the consequences of treating the recognition of identity as merely an issue of visibility or representation. Without a commitment to our shared liberation, without active solidarity, increased visibility for trans people can just mean greater exposure to risk.\n\nWe will carry the struggle for reproductive freedom into the new year. We must: Republican efforts to decimate reproductive health care have been horrifyingly successful, and they will not stop. Avoiding a red wave in the midterms did not restore abortion rights, let alone the free and accessible abortion and reproductive care we so need.\n\nYet we can't win this fight unless we understand the right's anti-abortion politics for what they are. That means seeing why the struggle for trans rights and reproductive justice must go together. For the most part, beyond a highly religious minority, those who are anti-abortion are not driven by a true belief in the inviolable value of all fetal life; Republicans would have and pay for fewer abortions themselves if that were true, and they would arguably care more about the lives of poor, Black pregnant women.\n\nInstead, when Republicans invoke the child who needs saving from abortion, they refer to a political construction, a figuration: the \"innocent\" white, cis child at the heart of the Republican political imaginary, reproduced within the confines of the private nuclear family. It's this organization of white standing and property that anti-abortion politics aim to uphold.\n\nIt's not an accident, then, that Republicans call upon the same myth of imperiled children to warn of trans indoctrination, grooming, or \"social contagion\" - with the very same notions of \"purity\" and traditionalist family reproduction at play.\n\nFascism holds this imaginary \"innocent\" child at its rhetorical center - and when it comes to abortion politics, liberals and leftists have rejected its invocation, insisting instead on prioritizing the health and well-being of actually living adults and children and their rights to bodily autonomy.\n\nIn the struggle for trans rights, all too many liberals - and some leftists - have interpellated notions about pure and innocent children who must be somehow protected from transness. That is, they have let fascism's child win the day. Vanquishing the right's pro-natalist fascism requires standing with trans children.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "Liberals Are Celebrating a New Book on Rural Trump Voters That Falls Apart Under the Simplest Inspection\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nMaine state Sen. Chloe Maxmin correctly recognizes that coastal Democrats are confused by rural America. She's exploiting their ignorance in \"Dirt Road Revival.\"\n\nA store covered with Trump signs in support of the former president is seen in Steep Falls, Maine, on Aug. 5, 2021.\n\nThis past week, Maine Democratic state Sen. Chloe Maxmin has received glowing media attention for a new book about how to woo rural Donald Trump supporters. Maxmin, a 29-year-old first-term state senator and former member of Maine's House of Representatives, and her campaign manager, Canyon Woodward, argue in their book \"Dirt Road Revival: How to Rebuild Rural Politics and Why Our Future Depends on It\" that the Democratic Party has \"abandoned rural communities\" and given up on trying to persuade people who disagree with them. Their book tour, which has stretched from the pages of the New York Times and Teen Vogue to the studio of Bill Maher, has focused on the insights she says she gleaned in flipping a rural state Senate district.\n\nTheir recent New York Times op-ed \" What Democrats Don't Understand About Rural America \" describes how Maxmin - a progressive, small-town politician - stood up to party bosses, rejected standard Democratic Party dogma, and flipped solid Trump voting districts blue by having 20,000 face-to-face conversations with Trump voters over two election cycles. In a recent appearance on \"Real Time With Bill Maher,\" Maxmin lays out her argument this way:\n\nI grew up in a House district and a Senate district in Maine that voted for Trump, and we just went out and started talking to folks and listening to people who did vote for Trump and try and have more of an honest conversation about what was happening. And we won in both of those seats. There were Trump signs next to Chloe signs, and we discovered all of this common ground with folks we usually write off. ... It was so sad to see my community left behind by the Democratic Party, but also so hopeful at all of this space that we can build relationships for durable political power.\n\nThis is the kind of hopeful path forward in red America that Democrats in blue areas have been craving: that because she focused her campaign on engaging so many conservative voters, she was able to defeat a popular Republican incumbent in a Trump voting district. The possibility that Maxmin and her young team had cracked the \"Make America Great Again\" code is intoxicating. And it meant that Maxmin had no difficulty getting air and print space.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nI share Maxmin's concern that the national Democratic Party needs to do a better job of winning back rural voters. As a former state Representative who also defeated a Republican incumbent in a similar rural district up the coast, I also firmly believe in the mantra of knocking on doors and engaging with and listening to as many voters as possible. Like other Maine Democratic candidates, I was also able to get a few Republicans to put my lawn signs next to their signs for Republican Governor Paul LePage. But many of Maxmin's claims about Senate District 13 and the nature of local Democratic campaigns in Maine are distortions and exaggerations.\n\nIronically, Maxmin accurately recognizes that liberals in New York and Los Angeles have a surface-level understanding of rural America which hampers their ability to connect. Instead of correcting those misperceptions, however, Maxmin deftly exploits the ignorance to spin tales that readers of the New York Times want to hear. Fact-checking her claims can't be done with a single Google search but instead requires tabulating vote totals and taking a closer look at the district she actually represents. Here's what that closer look reveals.\n\nMap of Maine highlighting Lincoln County.\n\nThe most glaring problem with her story of flipping a Trump district is that, running for state Senate, Maxmin did not actually flip any towns that voted for Trump.\n\nSenate District 13 includes all but one town in wealthy, coastal Lincoln County with the addition of two neighboring conservative towns. Trump narrowly won Senate District 13 over Hillary Clinton by only 11 votes in 2016. In 2020, Maxmin lost all seven towns Trump won. Instead, Maxmin won her race with big enough margins in the wealthy areas to compensate for the Trump areas. In fact, Maxmin did not perform as well as Joe Biden, who won the whole district that year with 13,034 votes to Maxmin's 12,806. And progressive U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree outperformed them both in District 13 - bringing into question how unique Maxmin's win really was. (Republican Sen. Susan Collins did also win District 13, but she won in 14 out of 16 counties in Maine.)\n\nMaxmin also claims in her book that Lincoln County is trending red, writing that \"deeply ingrained frustration with Washington helps explain the phenomenon of so many counties across the country, including Lincoln County, Maine, that voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 and then for Trump in 2016.\" In fact, Lincoln County has voted for every Democratic presidential candidate since 2004 - including for Clinton in 2016. That's not surprising, given that Lincoln County has a substantial population of middle- and upper-class retirees and transplants who reliably vote Democratic. And with more out-of-state liberal leaning voters moving here, it is trending even bluer.\n\nMaxmin also writes, \"Democrats only flipped one seat in the Maine State Senate - ours.\" That's incorrect. Democratic state Sen. Joe Rafferty also flipped a more conservative district in southern Maine that was previously held by Republicans.\n\nAnd while it's true that Maxmin flipped a state House seat in 2018, it was an open seat that she won as part of a large blue wave in the state. Her claim in her book that she is the first Democratic candidate to win in that district - House District 88 - is also misleading because the district has only existed since 2014. Before the lines were redrawn, a more conservative area including much of District 88 was also represented by Democrat Lisa Miller for three terms.\n\nMaxmin deserves credit for her boundless energy; there's no question that having tens of thousands of conversations with voters through both phone and door canvassing during her Senate campaign helped Maxmin against a popular incumbent, former Senate Minority Leader Dana Dow. Dow is a well-known, respected, and charismatic Republican who served Senate terms from 2004 to 2008 and 2016 to 2020. But Maxmin isn't the first Democrat to defeat Dow. Former Sen. Chris Johnson, who served two terms representing Senate District 13, beat Dow in 2012 and served there until Dow defeated him in a rematch in 2016. Other Democrats represented Lincoln County from the mid-1990s until 2004. (Maxmin claims that Dow never lost a \"general election,\" and in fact Johnson beat Dow in a special election - which may be the distinction Maxmin is resting on to make her claim.)\n\nMaxmin's district has been trending blue for a long time, and the majority of the population of the county is represented by Democrats and one progressive independent in the State House. So if Maxmin is doing something unique, the result - a Democrat winning a rural district in Maine - is not.\n\nSenate President Troy Jackson, D-Aroostook, conducts business at the State House in Augusta, Maine, on April 12, 2022.\n\nThere are also a lot of reasons why Maxmin's strategy can't translate easily to the rest of the country, which Maxmin and Woodward acknowledge in their op-ed. Just how unique Maine is may need a little emphasis for a national audience: Maine has a very large legislature for the size of its population of 1.36 million. With 151 House seats and 35 Senate seats, Maine House districts represent about 9,000 people and Senate districts have roughly 39,000 people. This structure allows for more face-to-face interactions and makes legislators much more accessible. Many lawmakers even put their cellphone numbers on their literature and websites.\n\nFor candidates in other states, Maxmin's method would be incredibly difficult if not impossible to replicate. For instance, in West Virginia, a small state with similar demographics, state senators represent 54,500 residents on average. Maine also has a \"Clean Elections\" public financing system that allows candidates like Maxmin to focus less on fundraising and more on campaigning.\n\nMaine also has a part-time citizen legislature where lawmakers earn about $25,000 salary for a two-year term, plus health care and very modest per diems for gas, food, and lodging. Incumbents struggle to balance campaigning with family responsibilities and earning enough income to survive. Half of Maine's state legislators are self-employed or run a business , which allows for more flexibility than if they had to work a 9-to-5 job. Maine is the nation's oldest state by median age , and more than a quarter of our lawmakers are retired because they have the time to devote to the job. When I ran for state representative, I was able to spend so much time campaigning because I was also in my 20s and had no responsibilities. I was able to cobble together enough income to survive on student loans and landscaping jobs and lived with my parents for my first campaign.\n\nMaxmin didn't have to hold a full-time job; she comes from a wealthy background and, according to her mandatory income disclosure reports , receives income from investments. She was fortunate to be raised by one of the most professionally accomplished couples to have made Maine their home. Her late father Jim Maxmin was CEO of Volvo and later Laura Ashley, a pioneer in the creation of the global supply-chain. Her mother, Shoshana Zuboff, is among the foremost chroniclers of the role of power and technology in the contemporary era, capping her career (to date) with the 2019 book \" The Age of Surveillance Capitalism .\" Zuboff attended and taught at Harvard University, where Chloe Maxmin also attended. (Jim Maxmin and Zuboff chose a farm in Nobleboro to raise their children and sent Chloe to Lincoln Academy, which the Harvard Crimson called a \" public high school \" in a profile of Maxmin. It's true that students who live in the area can attend at a subsidized rate, but boarders from outside Maine owe $50,000 a year at the school founded in 1801. She told the Crimson there was no environmental club, so she started one. \"We galvanized this huge movement in this rural Maine community where no one really talked about sustainability or environmentalism that much,\" Maxmin said.)\n\nShe also had her fellow Harvard alums, Woodward and her field organizer Henney Sullivan, volunteering to work full-time on her campaign, which is a benefit most local candidates don't have.\n\n\"I think [Maxmin] has a huge blind spot about her privileged position,\" said April Thibodeau, a Lincoln County resident and former Maine House Democratic Campaign Committee organizer who worked on Maxmin's House campaign.\n\nThe state and county Democrats also devoted a substantial amount of money, time, and labor to Maxmin's campaign because her district was a key battleground district for control of the state Senate (which belies Maxmin's claim that nobody in the party thought her race was winnable). As a result, it was one of the most expensive Senate races in Maine for outside spending in an election where Democrats vastly outspent Republicans . In addition to tens of thousands of dollars in independent spending, Maxmin outspent her opponent $68,478.70 to $33,700.44.\n\nIn their book, Maxmin and Woodward wrote that Maine Democrats told her they \"don't believe in talking to Republicans\" - a claim disputed by Julia Brown, the former executive director of the Maine Senate Democratic Campaign Committee who worked on Maxmin's campaign. In a Medium post, she points out that a key part of the Democratic strategy is to knock on doors and talk to rural voters.\n\nIn fact, Maine is the most rural state in the country , and Democrats couldn't have won a Democratic trifecta of the governor's office and both chambers of the legislature if they hadn't talked to rural voters. All one has to do is look at Maxmin's progressive caucus leader Senate President Troy Jackson - a labor activist, former Bernie Sanders surrogate, and a fifth-generation logger - who consistently outperforms Republicans and wins in his very rural Trump voting district in far northern Maine. Maxmin's claim that Democrats in Maine don't talk to Trump voters raises the question of why voters in an actual Trump district like Jackson's keep voting for him if he doesn't talk to them.\n\n\"Right now in the Maine Senate, Democrats hold the largest majority held by either party in over 30 years,\" Brown wrote. \"This was only possible by winning rural and non-rural senate districts and earning the support of both Biden and Trump voters. It wasn't some messiah with an 'only-I-can-fix-it-attitude' that made the Maine Senate Democrats one of only two legislative chambers in the country to pick up seats in 2016. That didn't secure us back-to-back historic majorities in 2018 and 2020 either .\"\n\nThibodeau took particular offense to Maxmin's anecdote about a man who claimed Democrats \"didn't even bother to knock on his door\" because they \"judged him for what his house looked like.\"\n\n\"I can assure you we all talked to plenty of Republicans and independents. I've been down a lot of dirt driveways in Lincoln County in my time,\" said Thibodeau. \"I grew up in a trailer. I'm not skipping houses just because the person is low-income.\" Poverty in Maine is not something that's restricted to Trump voters.\n\nWhat really happened is this: The Democrats provided Maxmin with what is known as a \"persuasion\" universe of voters in her district using voter data. It roots out both partisan Republicans and Democrats to come up with a list of gettable voters, including both unenrolled voters and Republicans. The final list comprises those voters who are considered the most persuadable.\n\nMaxmin wanted to focus on those \"forgotten\" Republicans who had been discarded as unpersuadable. Brown, the party campaign aide, told her that it made no sense as a matter of prioritizing scarce resources, but the districts are so small, and Maxmin had so much energy, that it seemed mostly harmless.\n\n\"While Chloe used her candidates' campaign to test her theory of deep organizing, the focus on actually winning her race went to the Senate Campaign Committee and volunteers.\"\n\n\"From a strategy standpoint, it was baffling. But I loved Chloe and thought she could probably knock on all of the voters' doors, so I said 'Let's do it,'\" said Brown. \"But while Chloe used her candidates' campaign to test her theory of deep organizing, the focus on actually winning her race went to the Senate Campaign Committee and volunteers. This meant we had union guys taking time off work to knock doors and turn out people to vote.\"\n\nSo while Maxmin focused on getting Trump voters, Democrats more broadly in the district, on her behalf, were talking to the persuasion universe of largely Republicans and independents. (In her interviews, she has focused on Trump voters, but in her Times op-ed, she and Woodward wrote that they \"believed that Democrats could still win conservative rural districts if they took the time to drive down the long dirt roads where we grew up, have face-to-face conversations with moderate Republican and independent voters and speak a different language, one rooted in values rather than policy.\")\n\nIn my campaigns for state representative, I also used a similar strategy of deep canvassing that included reaching out to partisan Republicans. But in retrospect, I question this strategy of spending so much time talking to rock-ribbed conservatives. While I can also point to similar anecdotes of winning over conservative voters, it was most often because we connected on a personal level or they already knew me and respected my family. But hardcore partisan Republicans were seldom interested in supporting me no matter how much I tried to appeal to kitchen table issues or what Maxmin calls \"rural values.\" Brown said her team researched Maxmin's theory to prove whether spending so much time on solid Republicans voters was worth the time and energy but couldn't find any evidence of its effectiveness.\n\nChloe Maxmin, a co-founder of Divest Harvard, and other students staged a sit-in in Massachusetts Hall to protest the university's decision not to divest from fossil fuel companies in Cambridge, Mass., on Feb. 12, 2015.\n\nSen. Maxmin has been a great legislator, especially with her work bringing labor and environmental groups together to pass landmark Green New Deal legislation to create good union jobs in the renewable energy sector. She is also an excellent organizer and deserves a lot of praise for running a strong grassroots effort where she made 80,000 voter contact attempts over the course of the campaign. Making thousands of outreach calls to voters to offer aid and support at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic was an excellent idea. Knocking on doors and writing personalized, handwritten \"clincher\" postcards to every person she met on the campaign trail is a great strategy and one used by Maine Democrats for many years.\n\nThe fact that she ran her own campaign, designing her own literature and hand-painted signs, is proof of her commitment and of the freedom Maine Democrats give candidates to run their own campaigns. Unfortunately for many people who supported her, Maxmin has decided not to run again for her Senate seat and is instead focusing on going to law school, promoting her book, and creating a new nonprofit to help Democrats learn how to better campaign in rural districts .\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats and grassroots activists in Lincoln County are focusing on holding onto Senate District 13 as we face what is shaping up to be a wave election for Republicans. With former Gov. Paul LePage making a comeback, control of the Senate will be critical to putting a check on his far-right policies if he's reelected.\n\nNone of this is to diminish Maxmin's success in winning her two races. She's been a powerful voice for the climate in the legislature, while dealing with both ageism and sexism in the capital and on the campaign trail. What it does mean, though, is that there is no evidence her victories were in any way unusual, nor, sadly, are there lessons that can be scaled. Quite the opposite: A number of campaign organizers I spoke to expressed worries that other candidates might take Maxmin's advice to heart and blow an election based on a theory tested in a blue-leaning district.\n\n\"Senator Maxmin's playbook for rural campaigning leads Democrats into a dangerous trap,\" says Brown. \"By lumping all rural Mainers (and Americans) into one category, she insists the pathway to winning votes in a blue-leaning coastal community is the same pathway that wins votes in a rural community in the midwest. This one-size-fits-all approach is how Democrats lose a long-term rural strategy.\"\n\nWAIT!

The value of his program was quantified in May when the streaming service Spotify paid a reported $100 million for the exclusive rights to broadcast his podcast.\n\nAs one illustrative example of his reach, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden appeared on Rogan's program six days ago, and the episode has already been viewed more than 5 million times on YouTube alone. The first time Snowden appeared on his program was last October, and that episode, just on YouTube, has more than 16 million views.

Why does someone who packs such a big punch in terms of audience size and influence receive so much less media attention than, say, cable news hosts with audience sizes far smaller than his? Presidential candidates certainly recognize Rogan's importance: All of the major Democratic candidates, according to him, requested to appear on his show. (The only ones he invited on were Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard, and Andrew Yang.)\n\nJoe Rogan interviews Sen. Bernie Sanders on Aug. 6, 2019.\n\nRogan was in the news this week after President Donald Trump favorably responded to a guest's suggestion that Rogan host a four-hour, sit-down presidential debate between the two candidates. The mere suggestion that someone like Rogan could host as prestigious and high-minded an event as a presidential debate prompted condescending scorn from establishment media precincts.\n\nPrior to that, one of the few times Rogan was discussed in mainstream political circles was when outrage among establishment Democrats ensued after Sanders touted a quasi-endorsement from Rogan. The argument was that Rogan's views are so repellent, bigoted, and anathema to liberalism that no Democratic candidate should be associated with him (this anger was shared by some of Sanders' own supporters including, reportedly , Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez).\n\nWhat is it, by the standards of U.S. political and media orthodoxy, that makes Rogan so radioactive? In March, billionaire and former NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg - who spoke at the 2004 GOP Convention in the middle of the Iraq War and war on terror to urge the reelection of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, and who presided over and repeatedly defended the racially disparate \"stop and frisk\" police practice - endorsed Joe Biden for president, and Biden not only accepted but celebrated the endorsement, praising Bloomberg in the process:\n\n. @MikeBloomberg , I can't thank you enough for your support-and for your tireless work on everything from gun safety reform to climate change. This race is bigger than candidates and bigger than politics. It's about defeating Donald Trump, and with your help, we're gonna do it.\n\n- Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) March 4, 2020\n\nWhat are the standards that make Michael Bloomberg an acceptable endorsement to tout but not Joe Rogan, given that the billionaire three-term mayor and former Republican has taken far worse positions and done far more damage to far more people than the podcaster could ever dream of doing?\n\nThat question is even more compelling when it comes to the Biden/Harris campaign's touting of the endorsement of former Republican Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, widely blamed for the criminally negligent lack of clean drinking water which plagued primarily African American residents of Flint, Michigan, for many years. Not only did the Biden campaign accept Snyder's endorsement, but they issued a press release trumpeting it:\n\nIt is one thing for @JoeBiden 's campaign to not reject ex-MI Governor Rick Snyder's endorsement.\n\nIt is an ENTIRELY different thing for them to actively be promoting and publicizing it. Absolutely shameful. #FlintWaterCrisis pic.twitter.com/NShC3ViqX7\n\n- Jordan (@JordanChariton) September 3, 2020\n\nWhat makes all of this more confounding is that Rogan is a fairly basic political liberal on almost every issue: He believes in the need for greater social spending for the nation's poor and working class, opposes war and militarism, favors drug legalization, is adamantly pro-choice and pro-LGBT rights, and generally adheres to liberal orthodoxies on standard political debates. That is why he was so fond of Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard, and why Andrew Yang - whose signature issue was the universal basic income - was one of the few candidates he deemed worth talking to.\n\nThe objections typically raised to Rogan concern his questioning of some of the very recent changes brought about by trans visibility and equality, particularly asking whether it is fair for trans women who have lived their entire lives and entered puberty as biological men to compete against cis women in professional sports (a question also asked - and even answered in the negative - by LGBT sports pioneer Martina Navratilova , among many others), and whether young children are emotionally and psychologically equipped to make permanent choices about gender reassignment therapies and gender dysphoria.\n\nIf embracing and never questioning the full panoply of trans advocacy is a prerequisite to being permitted in decent society, I seriously doubt many prominent Democratic politicians will pass that test (even Kamala Harris, from San Francisco and the very blue state of California, has a very mixed record on trans rights ). Moreover, though polling data is sparse, the data that is available show that there is still much work to do in this area: Only a small minority of Americans believe it is fair to allow trans women to participate in female professional sports.\n\nIf the standard is that anyone who even entertains debates over the maximalist and most controversial questions in this very new and evolving social movement is to be cast out as radioactive, liberalism and the Democratic Party will be a very small group. It will also have to proceed without the vast majority of political leaders whom they currently follow. Even on this issue of trans rights, Rogan's views are in accord with the standard Democratic Party view: He advocates full legal protection and dignity for the right of trans people to live with their gender respected.\n\nThe other critique centers on Rogan's willingness to invite on his show various pundits with far-right views. That's a bizarre criticism of someone who purposely hosts a program designed to foster dialogue with people across the political spectrum. After all, if one employs the blatantly irrational tactic of attributing to Rogan the views of all his guests, he would be simultaneously everything and nothing.\n\nBut again, this is a standard which few if any Democratic Party leaders could meet. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders all went on Bill O'Reilly's Fox News show, while Rep. Adam Schiff has appeared on Tucker Carlson's program. Speaking with people with differing views is called politics and journalism, and if one is decreed radioactive for interacting with people with bad views, few will survive that standard. (Liberals also point to the fact that Rogan said he could not vote for Biden over Trump, but that was not on ideological grounds but based on the same narrative that Democratic political and media elites spent all of last year disseminatin g: namely, that Biden's cognitive decline makes him unfit for the job.)\n\nWhile Rogan is politically liberal, he is - argues former Obama 2008 campaign strategist and Rogan listener Shant Mesrobian - culturally conservative , by which he does not mean that Rogan holds conservative views on social issues (again, he is pro-choice and pro-LGBT rights). He means that Rogan exudes culturally conservative signals: He likes MMA fighting, makes crude jokes, hunts, and just generally fails to speak in the lingo of the professional managerial class and coastal elites. And it is those cultural standards, rather than political ones, that make Rogan anathema to elite liberal culture because, Mesrobian argued in a viral Twitter thread , liberals care far more about proper culture signaling than they do about the much harder and more consequential work of actual politics.\n\nAs Rogan's platform grows, it is worthwhile to understand his appeal, his audience, and what he is doing that is new and different to attract such a large following. But it is also very worth examining the reaction to him by the political and media class because in that reaction, one finds many revealing attributes about how they think, what they value, and the priorities that they actually venerate. Today's SYSTEM UPDATE on The Intercept's You Tube channel with Mesrobian as my guest is devoted to examining those questions, or it can be viewed on the player below:\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Liberals Wonder What to Tell Their Children. The Truth: America Is Not a Fairy Tale.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIt was in Spain, Albert Camus wrote of a civil war war lost to fascists, that his generation learned \"that one can be right and yet be beaten.\"\n\nIt was in Spain , Albert Camus wrote of a civil war war lost to fascists, that his generation learned \"that one can be right and yet be beaten, that force can vanquish spirit, and that there are times when courage is not rewarded.\"\n\nIn more or less functioning democracies, election nights like the one we've just lived through can provide a version of the same lesson, at infinitely less cost. Many American liberals, for instance, still recall the feeling of shock that struck them on November 2, 2004, when George W. Bush was re-elected with surprising ease, after it had become obvious, even to Donald Trump , that the war in Iraq was a disaster.\n\nBut as many of those dismayed by Trump's victory struggled to come to terms with it, another question entered the discussion of the results: how could parents possibly explain to their children that a bigoted, sexist bully with no impulse control and no qualifications to do the job had been elected president of the United States?\n\nI have to explain this to my kids in the morning.  And for at least 4 years thereafter.\n\n- ???????? ??????? (@BlackiusMaximus) November 9, 2016\n\nhttps://twitter.com/bobbyhundreds/status/796243330246053888\n\nBreaking it to children that such a man would soon replace Barack Obama, who has been held up as a role model and a paradigm of personal decency even by many of his political opponents, seemed daunting even to observers as far away as Ireland.\n\nHow do you explain to your kids that Trump was elected? Feels like Voldemort won\n\n- Lorna Sixsmith ? ???? (@LornaESixsmith) November 9, 2016\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday morning, video of a CNN commentator, Van Jones, grappling with the question struck such a chord that it was shared, in various forms, hundreds of thousands of times on social networks.\n\nVan Jones, looking choked up,  somehow manages to sum up the fear and pain that many are feeling tonight. pic.twitter.com/K7eiJdO8Aj\n\n- Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) November 9, 2016\n\nThe only voice of sanity tonight: @VanJones68 ' words are heartbreaking. #ElectionNight pic.twitter.com/DhgmY8BDdy\n\n- Jenna Amatulli (@ohheyjenna) November 9, 2016\n\n\"It's hard to be a parent tonight for a lot of us,\" Jones said. \"You tell your kids, 'Don't be a bully.' You tell your kids, 'Don't be a bigot.' You tell your kids, 'Do your homework and be prepared.' And then you have this outcome, and you have people putting children to bed tonight and they are afraid of breakfast. They're afraid of 'How do I explain this to my children?'\"\n\nThe task is made more difficult by the fact that politicians feed the hearts of their supporters on the fantasy that, as Hillary Clinton said, \"America is great because America is good.\"\n\nIt was an uplifting speech on this theme, memorably delivered at the 2004 Democratic convention, that made Barack Obama into a political superstar. Again and again over the past eight years, President Obama has tried to inspire Americans to live up to higher ideals by avowing, even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that the nation is made up of kind, moral, inherently good and just people.\n\nPresident Barack Obama with young supporters at a rally for Hillary Clinton in Charlotte, N.C., last week.\n\nThe theme was also central to the argument offered by both Clinton and Obama that Trump was not fit to be president not only because of his cultivation of nativist, racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, and Islamophobic supporters, but also because of his many personal faults.\n\n\"That is not the America I know,\" Obama says about Trump's dystopian depiction of the U.S. https://t.co/BBUHAyQNjn pic.twitter.com/RlvyRLQy2s\n\n- POLITICO (@politico) July 28, 2016\n\nEven though Obama's personality and speaking ability positioned him to be a uniquely powerful exponent of this message, it has been commonly voiced , in less convincing fashion, by many other American politicians, including his predecessor .\n\nOn May 4, 2004, for instance, as the country was exposed to graphic evidence of that American soldiers had tortured and abused Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, George W. Bush insisted that the behavior of these Americans was un-American. \"I share a deep disgust, that those prisoners were treated the way they were treated,\" he told reporters. \"Their treatment does not reflect the nature of the American people - that's not the way we do things in America.\"\n\nThe next day, as the president scrambled to deal with the fall-out from the scandal, he assured the Iraqi people that \"what took place in that prison does not represent America that I know.\"\n\n\"The America I know is a compassionate country that believes in freedom. The America I know cares about every individual,\" Bush added. \"The America I know has sent troops into Iraq to promote freedom - good, honorable citizens that are helping the Iraqis every day.\"\n\nIn a mock news report parsing those remarks for \"The Daily Show\" that night, the comedian Rob Corddry explained:\n\nThere's no question that that what took place in that prison was horrible, but the Arab world has to realize, the U.S. shouldn't be judged on the actions of a... well, that we shouldn't be judged on actions, Jon. It's our principles that matter. Our inspiring, abstract notions.\n\nRemember, Jon, just because torturing prisoners is something we did doesn't mean it's something we would do .\n\nIn their own ways, parents across the nation have been trying to explain Clinton's loss, and Trump's victory, without shattering the idealism of their children. But the widespread shock among many adults that such a man will soon represent the country is perhaps a reminder that even those of us most cynical about it still want to believe in the myth that American democracy is a fairy tale, where good always triumphs over evil.\n\n\"This is the real world that we live in,\" Bernie Sanders told his delegates at the Democratic convention, after they booed him for saying that it was imperative to stop Donald Trump by electing Hillary Clinton.\n\n. @BernieSanders booed telling supporters to help elect Clinton: \"This is the real world that we live in.\" https://t.co/8jV2wUWtiK\n\n- ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) July 25, 2016\n\nAnd it is a real world where democracy is simply a contest for votes, many of them cast by people who are open to appeals based on lies, misogyny and racism, or feel blind rage at the failure of government after government to adequately shield them from the ravages of globalization that their elected leaders accept as inevitable.\n\nTop photo: Supporters of Hillary Clinton waited to hear her concession speech on Wednesday in New York.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Facebook Fact Checks Were Never Going to Save Us. They Just Made Liberals Feel Better.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBillionaires gonna billionaire - and lick the boots of whoever will bring them more riches and impunity.\n\nIn a shameless act of genuflection toward the incoming Trump administration, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Tuesday that his social media platforms - which include Facebook and Instagram - will be getting rid of fact-checking partners and replacing them with a \"community notes\" model like that found on X.\n\nThere could be little doubt about whom Meta aimed to please with these changes: Donald Trump and his far-right political movement.\n\nIn a video message explaining the announcement, Zuckerberg framed the new policies in the Republican lexicon of \"free expression\" against \"censorship,\" echoing right-wing talking points about how the social media platform's third-party fact checkers have been prone to \"political bias.\"\n\nAnd ending the fact-checking program was a direct demand of Trump's pick for Federal Communications Commission chair and current FCC commissioner, Brendan Carr, according to The Verge .\n\nThen there was the venue: News of the changes was first shared by Meta's chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan in an exclusive on \"Fox & Friends,\" Trump's favorite show.\n\nZuckerberg and his executives' naked pandering is worthy of contempt. As is the tech mogul's decision last month to donate $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund.\n\nZuck is just one of the most prominent Silicon Valley billionaires making moves to lick the president-elect's boots. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Jeff Bezos's Amazon both donated $1 million to the Trump fund. And Elon Musk's ultra-MAGA performance needs no mention. There's nothing surprising about the machinations of the mega-rich when it comes to aligning with power.\n\nWhen it comes to shifting their businesses to be less accountable, the full effects remain to be seen, but we can be confident it will poison the discourse with even more right-wing garbage.\n\nMeta platforms will now follow in the footsteps of X and become more filled with unchecked, reliably racist conspiracy theories, a proliferation of neo-Nazi accounts, hate speech, and violence. Zuckerberg himself admitted in his announcement that \"we're going to catch less bad stuff.\"\n\nLiberals have wrongly treated Trump's rise as a problem of disinformation gone wild, and one that could be fixed with just enough fact-checking.\n\nNone of this, though, should lead us to draw the wrong conclusions about the value of social media fact-checking, or fact-checking more broadly, when it comes to combating the far right and the appeal of its conspiratorial world view. For a decade now, liberals have wrongly treated Trump's rise as a problem of disinformation gone wild, and one that could be fixed with just enough fact-checking.\n\nA case in point is Trump's forthcoming second term itself: He won back the White House while spewing unfounded, racist lies about Haitian immigrants stealing and eating pets, among other falsehoods - lies that were again and again debunked by every establishment media outlet.\n\nAn entire liberal cottage industry of fact-checking Trump and his allies on news and social media, even removing Trump from major social media platforms, did not diminish his support nor expunge dangerous disinformation from the echo chambers primed to receive and propagate it.\n\nThe end of the fact check era, however, is worth examining because of how it heralds another liberal failure with little to offer in the way of alternatives. It is just another capitulation in the battle against fascism. Liberals, it turned out, were never really the \"resistance\" that they pretended they were.\n\nThe idea that Zuckerberg is acting out of a renewed, conveniently timed commitment to \"free speech\" is laughable, and we'd be wise to expect further bending to Trump and Republican whims.\n\nFacebook introduced its third-party fact-checking program in 2016 , following Trump's first election victory. The system relied on 90 organizations worldwide to address \"viral misinformation.\"\n\nIn 2021, in response to Trump's role in the January 6 Capitol attack, Meta banned the then-president from its platforms. Around that time, over 800 QAnon conspiracy groups were also removed from Facebook. Social media censorship became a hot button for the grievance-driven Trump and his far right.\n\nNone of the right-wing's agenda, however, was about free speech for all. Consider that, at the same time, the right was rallying behind book bans in schools. They didn't utter a peep when, as The Intercept reported in 2020, dozens of left-wing and antifascist groups were also banned from Facebook. And Meta has been engaging in what Human Rights Watch called \"systematic and global\" censorship of Palestinian and Palestine-solidarity content on its platforms.\n\nNonetheless, the right has successfully created a victim narrative out of content moderation.\n\nThe right has successfully created a victim narrative out of content moderation.\n\nEnter Zuckerberg and the utter lack of subtlety in his announcement. These new policies were clearly not meant to serve the political left or censored pro-Palestinian users. \"We're getting rid of a number of restrictions on topics like immigration, gender identity and gender that are the subject of frequent political discourse and debate,\" Zuckerberg said, issuing a thinly veiled signal that anti-trans, anti-immigrant hate would face fewer roadblocks.\n\nWith history as a guide, it's hard to imagine that pro-Palestinian speech, alongside speech for environmental, racial, and gender justice won't face policing under a Trump administration. The Republican-led Congress is already chafing at the bit to condemn such activism as terrorism .\n\nOn the eve of Trump's second term, liberal shibboleths about speaking truth to power are worse than outdated. Meta imitating X's permissive approach to right-wing fearmongering is not a welcome development, nor is the loss of funding that journalistic and research organizations got for partnering with Meta on fact checks. Yet fact checks were never going to deliver us from the political context in which far-right propaganda thrives - one of alienation, austerity, inequality, and fearfulness.\n\nI'm not the first to point out that narratives about the current scourge of disinformation, largely propagated by establishment media outlets fearful of their diminished authority, failed to account for why certain conspiracies and falsehoods were able to appeal to huge but specific swaths of the population.\n\nDisinformation, though, has been a convenient narrative for a Democratic establishment unwilling to reckon with its own role in upholding anti-immigrant narratives, or repeating baseless fearmongering over crime rates, and failing to support the multiracial working class.\n\nIn an essay questioning popular narratives around \"big disinformation,\" Joe Bernstein recounted that posts labeled as false by Facebook only saw an 8 percent reduction in sharing - showing how the designation doesn't stop information from spreading. Bernstein noted that the story of disinformation was one that tech giants could use to their advantage, as its very premise - that social media content has a nearly all-powerful ability to convince and persuade users - is a helpful narrative when appealing to advertisers. It's also largely unfounded.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe persuasion power of social media posts has been overstated, while the political, socioeconomic contexts in which conspiracies thrive has been significantly understated in the disinformation discourse. QAnon appeals disproportionately to evangelicals, for instance, and Covid skepticism gained a foothold because of the experiences that formed Americans' opinions of public health authorities. \"There is nothing magically persuasive about social-media platforms,\" Bernstein wrote.\n\nThe nails are firmly in the coffin, and the coffin has been buried - so long dead is the idea that social media platforms like X or Instagram are either trustworthy news publishers, sites for liberatory community building, or hubs for digital democracy. Instead, we need to think about the internet as a place driven exactly by the motives of the people who own - and profit from - these platforms.\n\n\"The internet may once have been understood as a commons of information, but that was long ago,\" wrote media theorist Rob Horning in a recent newsletter . \"Now the main purpose of the internet is to place its users under surveillance, to make it so that no one does anything without generating data, and to assure that paywalls, rental fees, and other sorts of rents can be extracted for information that may have once seemed free but perhaps never wanted to be.\"\n\nSocial media platforms are huge corporations for which we, as users, produce data to be mined as a commodity to sell to advertisers - and - and government agencies . The CEOs of these corporations are craven and power-hungry.\n\nZuckerberg, lest we forget, is still facing an antitrust Federal Trade Commission lawsuit over claims that Meta bought Instagram and WhatsApp to crush competition. Luckily for him, Trump responds well to bootlicking.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Democrats Need to Wake Up: The Trump Movement Is Shot Through With Fascism\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe sooner liberals understand that Trump's supporters don't care about autocracy, the better they can push to win this election.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to supporters at a campaign rally at Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Latrobe, Pa., on Sept. 3, 2020.\n\nAllegations of involuntary hysterectomies conducted on people in a migrant detention center? Record numbers of children going to bed hungry ? It's futile to pinpoint when exactly President Donald Trump's America left the community of civilized peoples. It's more important and useful to explain how we kid ourselves about the fascist impulses of his \"ordinary\" supporters that hide in plain sight.\n\nUnder some delusion, many Democrats and liberals have expected each new whistleblower's report, each insider's memoir to expose Trump's corruption so shockingly, so unequivocally, as to make his supporters see the light. But the sooner these politicos understand that Trump's supporters don't care about his autocracy, the better the liberals can go about the business of trying to win this election.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nJust pay attention to the urgent MSNBC, NPR, and New York Times exposés on each incriminating revelation into Trump's misconduct or read the liberal nonprofit industrial complex's battery of watchdog reports, and you will witness liberals acting as though a lack of information is damning our democracy, as though one more smoking gun would save it. If only they knew, the mantra goes. Nope, neither Michael Wolff's \"Fire and Fury\" nor John Bolton's \"The Room Where It Happened\" nor Mary Trump's \"Too Much and Never Enough\" have clarified Trump's reputation to his followers or undecided voters. A major commentator just suggested : Bob Woodward's book is the one that will land \"like a hydrogen bomb.\"\n\nIn order to win this presidential contest, liberals need to accept that Trump supporters do not care if he were to scrap millions of mail-in votes or to welcome, and even solicit, Russian interference for his cause. Not only do some Trump supporters understand that he is an autocrat who will cheat the rules to stay in power, that's precisely what they like about him. The left should understand that many Trump supporters inherently believe that they would fare better under an autocratic system of white supremacy than under a multiracial democracy.\n\nSo many white liberals and moderates are invested in the idea that authoritarianism can't happen in America, because to question whether authoritarianism exists here is to question what they've achieved. Such white people, figuratively and literally, have so much money, property, social status, and self-image invested in the mirage that this country is based on merit and fair play. They have so much invested in the illusion that their political institutions and white cohorts are good actors that will keep everything nicely afloat.\n\nQuestioning all that fervent, widespread Trump support would force them to question how their neighbor, their cousin, their uncle, their co-worker, their favorite vendor is complicit to a regime that prioritizes their well-being and social privilege as white people, second only to Trump's greed. To acknowledge your aunt's or your own complicity in Trump's nationalist autocracy might make you feel accountable for what this country is. And that accountability to the problem damns you to an accountability to the solution.\n\nExposing the breadth of Trump's proto-fascist moves becomes more necessary and urgent every day in the run-up to this election\n\nLeading up to November's vote, Trump's appointed Homeland Security chief ordered nonpartisan intelligence officers to stop conducting risk assessments on threats posed by Russia, because doing so could harm Trump's campaign. The security chief also tried to suppress the words \"white nationalists\" from experts' analysis of threats, in order to minimize how much this administration has inflamed the growing white nationalist security threat. So Trump's most senior, unqualified appointments are trying to politicize, manipulate, and censor the security community's intelligence - especially concerning Russia and violent domestic white nationalists - in order to stay in power. Powerful Republicans in Congress and governorships made barely a peep.\n\nThe multi-headed hydra of Russian collusion, tear gas for photo-ops, and Trump deliberately lying about the deadliness of a virus that directly led to 200,000 deaths are not confirmation enough of the president's unworthiness to his supporters. Nothing ever will be.\n\nTranslated for Democrats, this means standing in the way of combatting fascism are the millions of his proponents who inherently welcome it.\n\nHistory, here, is telling. Historical comparisons should not be thrown around haphazardly or promiscuously, but this careful comparison between the past and the present needs to be made. One of historians' most confounding tasks has been to explain what made supposedly honorable, civilized Germans actively participate in the killing of millions of people. In his seminal, if hotly debated, book, \"Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust,\" Daniel Jonah Goldhagen disputes all the myths that historians previously offered to explain Germans' willing participation in such an atrocity.\n\nGoldhagen debunks the explanation of situational pressure, that hard times rendered Germans incapable of saying no. He disproves the myth of sheer self-interest, that ordinary Germans were just trying to get by. He dismisses the theory of bureaucratic myopia, that toiling Germans were too busy focusing on the minutia of survival to be aware of the Nazis' larger systemic killing. He refutes the caricature of cultural predisposition, that Germans were automatons, inclined to mindlessly obey authority. And he dismisses the prevalent impulses to exaggerate the sway of misinformation, that Germans were seduced into submission by Leni Riefenstahl's magic-making or their führer's charisma.\n\nLike Goldhagen does with Nazis, we have to avoid pat answers.\n\nCould present Americans participate in slaughtering millions as Germans did? Hardly. And there are no useful comparisons to be made between Hitler's political methods and Trump's. Significant differences distinguish the political impacts of the Third Reich versus the Trump administration. This country is no Nazi Germany. But America under Trump demonstrably treads into fascist territory.\n\nOurs is a country where the president can witness 5-million-plus acres burn, millions of residents flee their homes, miles of toxic air blight the sky, blackouts, triple-digit heat waves, and literally not be bothered. We have a leader who knew the deadliness of a virus, lied about his awareness, and still indifferently presides over the subsequent deaths of 200,000 and counting. Even during the country's bleak distress, Trump supporters - from his cabinet down to ordinary, diehard voters - put his money and their collective political power ahead of human life, undoubtedly a fundamental feature of autocracy.\n\nSo I can't help but reveal how the excuses made on behalf of Nazi-era Germans resemble the collective naïveté - the delusional pass - afforded to roughly 40 percent of our people. America's democratic free fall is not just Trump. Ours is a nation full of mini-fascists: Trump's Willing Executioners.\n\nThe investigative reports and the common depictions of Trump supporters at dinner-table conversation deny or radically minimize those perpetrators' ideology, compromised values, and complicity in Trump's autocracy. Fox News is the most widely watched cable network in this country by a factor of five. Though Fox News primes its viewers for their absolutist outlook, Trump voters are active agents in this drama.\n\nWe can't dismiss Trump's Willing Executioners as mindless victims to the president's charisma and Fox disinformation, or as practical taxpayers who are just voting in their economic interest. We have to take their cognition and values seriously. We have to name their political alignment for what it is: a very conscious choice. They are not automatons sleepwalking through history and helpless to the reigning propaganda: They understand the massive incentive structures that draw them to willingly and actively support this autocratic regime.\n\nWealth redistribution to the top, privatization, extreme incoming inequality, and ruling kleptocracy: Such are the hallmarks of this regime's totalitarian capitalism, one that exploits catastrophe to further undercut a fair economy, a robust middle class, and truly representative democracy.\n\nMost authoritarianism that exploits corruption is hatched in ethnic favoritism - and this one especially so. Whiteness motivates this autocracy, even as it blinds Americans to its behavior. Democracy has been such an uncontested tenet of this country, an unquestioned norm, that we naively assume that all Americans still love it. In fact, its favorable traits - \"good,\" \"fair,\" \"orderly,\" and \"stable\" - are implicitly associated to whiteness in itself.\n\nWhite Americans like to think of fascism as a calamity that happens only to third world countries or to dismiss its Western examples as historical exceptions. One of the reasons Americans minimize the vile depths of Trump supporters is that we are inculcated to believe that Westernized and modern men and women are incapable of holding prejudices that devalue human life. We are indoctrinated to the idea that people who are modern and white and Christian surely do not have the same barbaric proclivities as the Cambodians who sent millions to the killing fields, or the Chileans who ratted out their neighbors to Pinochet's police. Our fantasies about white Christian exceptionalism whisper to us that Americans are bound by \"the rule of law,\" by decency, that all \"normal\" Americans operate with \"common sense\" A nation of \"civilized people\" is incapable of falling for an autocrat or annihilating its fellow citizens.\n\nYet the modus operandi of Trump's Willing Executioners is to code America, this land, its heart, its patriotism as white and Christian, and as having \"common sense.\" Those codes gloss over all the Black military vets from the Midwest who've died in combat; they gloss over the Tuskegee experiment; they gloss over the Justice Department's statistical findings of widespread race-based police brutality. Those codes dehumanize.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., like many Trump apologists, once asserted that football players linking arms for racial equality was browbeating middle America. In reality, protest is \"middle America.\" Autocracy isn't just a question of censorship and violence; it depends on an exclusionary definition of homeland that suppresses ethnic dissent. God forbid that Black people should protest for human rights in middle America. Were we in Hong Kong, the Republican Party would be praising us.\n\nNew research reveals the extent to which authoritarian impulses have found a significant grounding in the Republican base. According to new survey data from Larry Bartels of Vanderbilt University, slightly over half of Republican voters - both self-identified Republicans and independents who lean toward the party - strongly or somewhat agree with the statement that \"the traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.\" And roughly 2 in 5 Republican or independent voters agree that \"a time will come when patriotic Americans have to take the law into their own hands.\" And a whopping three-fourths agree that \"it is hard to trust the results of elections when so many people will vote for anyone who offers a handout.\"\n\nWhich Republicans are most ready to scuttle democratic norms? Harboring hostility toward the nation's growing racial and ethnic diversity was the single best predictor of respondents' readiness to desert democratic principles. Age, education level, geographical location: None of these markers was a key factor to authoritarian impulses akin to hostility to growing diversity.\n\nTo deny the link between fascism and Trump's Willing Executioners is to absolve yourself from having to confront the sabotaged census count; the unprecedented financial graft and the worsening economic hardship; the Russian targeting of Black populations for social media manipulation; and the 17 million Americans, mostly Black, purged from U.S. voter rolls between 2016 and 2018, with especially alarming voter purges in former Confederate states now governed by Republicans.\n\nAs many white people toggle between the existential threats to their bank accounts, to their family's health, meanwhile deeply distracted by the banal details of housebound life - so much Netflix, so many memes - they do not want to feel accountable to fixing a fascist state supported by a president's Willing Executioners.\n\nThis article was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project .\n\nCorrection: September 29, 2020 An earlier version of this story included a reference to a news report about Trump ignoring intelligence about Russian bounties on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. The reference was removed because the news report is disputed.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Wendell Primus, the Most Powerful Staffer in Congress, Represents a Generational Divide on the Left\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nWendell Primus's generation of liberals strives not to make the world a better place, but to make it less bad than Republicans want.\n\nThe remark drifted quietly past nearly all political watchers, but inside Congress, it reverberated like a patch of rolling thunder. \"I'm not worried what Wendell thinks,\" said Mark Pocan , D-Wisc., the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, in February. \"When he gets elected to Congress, it'll matter.\"\n\nWendell was a reference to Wendell Primus, a top policy aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who, inside the halls of Congress, needs no surname clarification. Pocan gave voice to simmering frustrations about Primus's meddling in internal House policy debates. On the Hill, there's a name given to people like Primus, unelected lifers who use their years of service and clout to influence the party's direction: He's a member/staffer. And members don't like it when a staffer - even a member/staffer - starts setting the boundaries of their ambitions.\n\nPrimus serves as Pelosi's sharp elbows, particularly on health policy. He is working directly with the Trump White House on watered-down drug-pricing legislation that differs from a bill favored by House liberals. And as The Intercept has reported , Primus reassured insurance executives last December, shortly after the Democratic takeover of the House, that party leadership would not favor a Medicare for All plan.\n\nHe also lashed out at Medicare for All on tape , at a little-noticed health care conference in Irvine, California, in February, homing in on regional differences in provider reimbursement rates as a signature obstacle. \"The regional issues about transfers of money that were involved are enormous here and for that reason, I don't think it's going to happen,\" he said, adding that senior Democrats all agreed with him on this. Primus even cited a right-wing study about the costs of single payer, neglecting to mention that the same study found that it would reduce overall health expenditures .\n\nPelosi has defended Primus publicly, touting him in the Washington Post as \"probably the most progressive staff person on Capitol Hill.\" Pelosi's office wouldn't make Primus available for interview, but in an email, spokesperson Henry Connelly said that \"Wendell is the architect of some of the most sweeping and impactful progress in extending health coverage and lowering Americans' health costs that has been signed into law in the past 50 years.\"\n\nBut one line from the slide deck Primus presented to insurers reveals the disconnect between what \"progressive\" means to the old guard in Congress and what it means to a new generation.\n\nAmong other criticisms, Primus explained to insurers that \"stakeholders are against\" single payer, therefore leadership is too. This rationale for policy opposition - stakeholders are against virtually anything that would damage their interests, regardless of whether it benefits the public - represents Primus's worldview in one phrase. You could call him the last of the loser liberals, desperate to maintain the last few scraps of the welfare state rather than forward anything more bold. The mindset views younger progressives as people to protect leadership from, and anti-government conservatives as people to bargain with. They strive not to make the world a better place, but to make it less bad than Republicans want.\n\nRep. Mark DeSaulnier of California has clashed with Primus, and said that he is a symptom of a broader cultural problem in Washington. \"There are mostly good people in staff, but there are some people who start to think they have to protect democracy from elected officials,\" DeSaulnier said. \"If you even bring up something that's hard to do or aspirational, staff are like, Oh, you can't do that here - which is a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"\n\nProtesters holds signs rallying against then-President Bill Clinton's approval of the welfare reform bill in downtown Los Angeles, Calif., on Aug. 4, 1996.\n\nPrimus was once seen as the face of the principled left, fighting the ravages of Clintonism from the inside. In 1996, he resigned as deputy assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, in a public protest against President Bill Clinton's decision to sign the welfare reform bill. At HHS, Primus produced a study showing that welfare reform would increase child poverty (a prediction that hasn't really come true because of other policy supports for children, although overall poverty is indeed up). \"To remain would be to disown all the analysis my office has produced regarding the impact of the bill,\" he wrote in his resignation letter.\n\nThe resignation was an important act of defiance from the left flank of the party and should be commended. But by 2001, when studies showed two-parent families increasing, particularly among low-income African Americans, Primus told the New York Times , \"'In many ways welfare reform is working better than I thought it would. ... The sky isn't falling anymore. Whatever we have been doing over the last five years, we ought to keep going.\" Of course, those numbers were mainly due to a stock-fueled economic boom in the late 1990s, and when that reversed during the Great Recession, a lack of welfare benefits utterly failed the poor .\n\nConnelly responded to this quote by saying, \"You shouldn't cherry-pick a single comment from a man who had the courage to actually resign over welfare reform.\" But he didn't answer the question of whether Primus still thinks that welfare reform worked better than expected.\n\nThe fight over welfare reform is illustrative in another way: Primus, like many liberals of his generation, was mostly engaging in the same work he does today - defending America's meager safety net from a right-wing assault. Prior to working in the Clinton administration, he spent several years on the House Ways and Means Committee as chief economist and staff director for the Human Resources subcommittee. He penned his own welfare legislation, which was a bit kinder to the poor. In the 1980s, he helped draft the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget Act, softening the most harmful implications of its automatic spending cuts. The impetus was the same: Protect the safety net.\n\nThere's an entire cottage industry on the center-left dedicated to this purpose, with which Primus has long been associated. After leaving the Clinton administration, he joined the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , which focuses on welfare state programs. Its tentative approach is embedded in its very name; while today's progressives are arguing for Medicare for All and a full-blown economic restructuring around a Green New Deal, yesterday's were weighing different budget and policy priorities, defending some while sacrificing others in an endless retreat. Primus has also written for the Brookings Institution , another similarly aligned organization that was once the beating heart of liberal policymaking, but is absent from today's more ambitious debates.\n\nProgressive economist Dean Baker recalled a meeting he took with Primus in 2000. At the time, there was a huge budget surplus, and Baker had just released a book calling for no cuts to Social Security. Primus asked him to soften his resistance if the cuts would pay for other important programs. Baker recalled that Primus said, \"'I'm worried about the budget in 2015, how are we going to pay for food stamps in 2015?' And he was dead serious. Maybe I'm an optimist, but aren't there other things to worry about [in 2000]?\"\n\nPrimus and those who think like him have a well-established mindset and a narrow viewpoint on policy debates, one beaten into them by the Reagan years. They want to preserve benefits for the poor and needy, without too many painful cutbacks. They are deficit hawks who want to use resources they consider scarce to barely cover what we have today. They generally seek to protect the handful of programs that managed to survive the conservative revolution, because they believe that's all government can do.\n\nWithout question, these organizations play an important defensive role on the left and can provide a countervailing force to the Clintonite center and the far right. They're not inherently bad people, they're simply creatures of their time, as we all are.\n\nFor instance, Primus joined Pelosi's office and was a key conduit between the CBPP/Brookings axis and Capitol Hill. During the debate over the Affordable Care Act, Primus clashed so much with White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel that the two \"couldn't be in the same room together,\" according to the Washington Post . Emanuel wanted to scale back the ACA, but Primus won that battle.\n\n\"They do great work between the 40-yard lines,\" said Baker. \"Whenever something might be cut in Congress, they do the best stuff on why it's bad. It's good and useful stuff, but it's never going to change the ballgame.\"\n\nOthers who have clashed with Primus think his worldview is ultimately self-defeating. \"If you followed their advice, all the programs they're interested in saving would be cut, they would all be worse off today than right now,\" said Alex Lawson of Social Security Works.\n\nWe are now in a different era than even a few short years ago. Progressives, responding to decades of stagnant wages, sinking economic mobility, and soaring income and wealth inequality have proposed structural changes across the board. This goes well beyond the \" pity-charity liberalism \" that grants some minor alms for society's losers, rather than broad agency or power for the working class.\n\n\"It's a problem throughout the caucus,\" said one House aide, who sought anonymity to speak candidly. \"These people who are thought of as liberal lions have not updated themselves to the politics of the moment.\" Instead of fighting the Rahm Emanuels of the world, that puts Primus in opposition to the vanguard of the left. And that has created significant tension.\n\nIt doesn't help that Primus's portfolio primarily includes health policy, the area that won House Democrats the 2018 midterms, and where the left has constructed a defined imperative to take on the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. Primus has been the proxy for Pelosi's fight to control the narrative on health care.\n\nPelosi has made clear that she follows Primus's lead on these issues. \"On health policy, 'what does Wendell think' is what we say all the time about this issue,\" the speaker said at a 2013 town hall . \"He's very much empowered by the speaker,\" said the House staffer. \"The speaker is running a thing where he gets the first draft on these policies.\"\n\nThe controversy between Primus and liberal lawmakers in this Congress started with his undermining Medicare for All. Pelosi has promised hearings on a Medicare for All bill during this congressional session, which is farther than any similar effort has gone. But she's been ambivalent in public about the concept. Behind the scenes, Primus has attempted to knife it. Pelosi, said Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, \" has made it clear that [Medicare for All] isn't necessarily the fix that she at this moment believes in, but she is respectful of me in leading this effort, and I would expect her staff to at least follow that.\"\n\nIn the slide presentation to insurers, Primus said that party leaders weren't interested in Medicare for All and wanted to work with the Trump administration on drug-price legislation instead. Improving the Affordable Care Act would be the \"most cost-effective path to universal coverage,\" according to Primus's slides. House Democrats recently proposed a package of legislation to do just that, by expanding exchange subsidies and instituting a national reinsurance program.\n\nPrimus described single payer with phrases like \"implementation challenges,\" \"monies needed for other priorities,\" and \"creates winners and losers,\" along with the warning that stakeholders are against it. Last week, Politico reported on a second Primus meeting, this time with health policy researchers, where he called Medicare for All an \"unhelpful distraction\" and solicited research to \"discredit the idea, or at least amplify its risks.\" Pelosi's office denied that Primus was requesting hit pieces. \"Wendell absolutely did not ask for any kind of one-sided analysis of Medicare For All, and anyone who says otherwise wasn't actually listening,\" said Connelly.\n\nBut at the health care conference in Irvine, Primus approvingly cited the Charles Blahous study for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University , a hit piece that produced an allegedly staggering cost for Medicare for All. \"There are experts on the right and the left, Chuck Blahous, the Urban Institute, that have said all of that [costs] about $32 trillion,\" Primus said.\n\nBlahous's own calculations reveal that Medicare for All would save Americans $2 trillion relative to what they would spend on health care under the current system, while covering 30 million more people. Despite that, right-wing media and campaign ads have consistently parroted the headline $32 trillion figure, without context. It's jarring to see the alleged \"most progressive staff person on Capitol Hill\" do the same.\n\nPrimus seemed to recognize the minefield he was walking into in Irvine, saying about Medicare for All, \"I get myself into trouble every time I say something about this.\"\n\nThe Progressive Caucus demanded answers from Primus on his Medicare for All maneuvering last week, even going through the slide presentation piece by piece. Primus insisted that his remarks were distorted. But members didn't seem to take that as a sufficient answer. \"It's really inappropriate for staff representing the speaker's office to be undercutting members of our caucus,\" said Jayapal after the meeting. \"This does not help us at all and was frankly insulting to those elected to represent our constituents.\"\n\nAdded DeSaulnier, \"I didn't hear an apology from him.\"\n\nOn drug prices, Primus has been far more aggressive, taking the lead in dictating policy. He is known in the Capitol as a principled foe of drug industry greed. In his briefing for insurers, Primus mentioned a handful of modest but worthwhile ideas, like lifting roadblocks to generic medication production, stopping schemes that lengthen patent protections, and ending \"pay for delay,\" in which a drug company pays a generic manufacturer to not produce a generic version of an expensive drug. Two of these passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee last Wednesday.\n\nBut since Congress's swearing-in, Primus has become obsessed with finding a drug proposal the Trump administration will support. In February, he backed an idea to use third-party arbitration to set the price of certain prescription drugs. This neglected the fact that, for a year, House Democrats were coalescing around a bill from Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, to require Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over price, and if they refused, to authorize compulsory licensing of that drug to generic manufacturers.\n\nDoggett has 122 co-sponsors for his bill, yet Primus short-circuited it. \"Pharma peeled off members from his bill,\" said Lawson. \"Wendell's discussion gave those who dropped the ability to say, 'It's not because of my funders, but because of the same concerns that Wendell has.'\"\n\nPrimus initially signaled support for Doggett, but shifted to arbitration around the same time Patients for Affordable Drugs , a group funded by former hedge fund manager John Arnold , started to favor the concept. \"Arnold has spent enormous money on ads, both for and against members,\" Lawson said. \"Maybe he's thinking this is the way to keep them on his side.\"\n\nThe arbitration concept grew out of a 2008 study in Health Affairs from a former Obama administration official and a director at health insurer Aetna. The government and the drugmaker would submit prices, and a third-party arbitrator would select one or choose a third price based on their own research.\n\nPrimus's version would only cover a select set of high-cost drugs, and critics fear that the arbiter would be unaccountable and the process opaque. Initial reports suggested that the arbitration would be voluntary and nonbinding , though Connelly suggested that those reports were false. \"We're continuing to incorporate feedback and ideas from members and stakeholders about how we can develop the toughest possible bill,\" he said. Still, it's unclear whether drug manufacturers would be forced to accept the arbitrated price.\n\nWe do know that pharmaceutical lobbyists appear to be more comfortable with the arbitration concept, which \"comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of the debate,\" said Peter Maybarduk, director of Public Citizen's Access to Medicines Program. \"It's not a good strategy to be reasonable to the pharmaceutical lobby. You have to be bold and go after them with a fight that's big enough that the public is engaged and mobilized in support.\"\n\nPrimus has progressed to formal talks with the Trump administration, as well as Senate Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. As part of what's been called a \" reassurance tour \" with groups inside and outside of the Capitol, Primus told Progressive Caucus members that he was not negotiating with the White House, but instead trying to find something all House Democrats could support. Doggett has said that any potential compromise must \"be on something that really makes a difference in the lives of people on health care and not agreement for agreement's sake.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIt's hard to square Primus's insistence that he's not negotiating with the White House with what he said at the Irvine health care conference: \"I think we will cut a deal with the administration. And I think that if we do it right in the House, that will give it enough push to get it done in the Senate.\"\n\nHe added, \"I think it's going to take some time to educate members about all of this.\"\n\nPrimus has also tried to derail an idea from the Trump administration some consider useful. He wants to delay an HHS rule to eliminate the legal kickbacks that pharmacy benefit managers get from negotiating rebates with drug companies. Supporters believe ending rebates will change the business model for pharmacy benefit managers and control the misaligned incentives that lead to high list prices. (The higher the list price, the higher the rebate, the story goes, and if rebates are effectively banned, PBMs would have to earn their fees from insurers by pushing list prices down.)\n\nAt the Irvine health care conference, Primus cited estimates from the Center on Medicare and Medicaid Services' Office of the Actuary suggesting higher consumer prices and government costs from the rebate rule. \"If you take away those rebates, prescription drug prices might go down a little bit, but they're not going to come down nearly enough to offset the loss of the rebates,\" Primus said. \"The administration has no authority right now to force the manufacturers to lower list prices.\" The speaker has said something similar .\n\nNobody thinks banning rebates will cure all ills in the pharmaceutical supply chain. But Primus's complaint that the government might have to pay more fits with his longstanding concern over federal deficits.\n\nThen-President Ronald Reagan, center, signs the Social Security Act Amendment with Vice President George Bush, Sen. Bob Dole, Rep. Tip O'Neill, and Daniel Moynihan on hand as witnesses in 1983.\n\nAnother slide in Primus's insurance presentation, titled \"Not Preparing for Boomer Retirement,\" explained how deficits could strain health budgets as the population ages. This has been a consistent Primus concern. \"We didn't use the decade just before the baby boom generation retired to get ready,\" Primus said in a 2010 roundtable on Social Security preserved on C-SPAN . \"That is really one of the greatest failures of the Bush administration.\" (I could think of others .)\n\nIn that roundtable, Primus advised lawmakers to \"learn the lesson\" of 1983, when Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill got together to make Social Security more solvent by, among other things, gradually raising the retirement age for full benefits.\n\nPresident Barack Obama did try to reduce the cost of living adjustment in Social Security, a net benefit cut. Primus, according to several outside groups, warned them against going hard against the Obama plan, and asked them to slow-walk any calls for expanding the program. It was a replay of the conversation Dean Baker had with Primus a decade earlier. But the groups didn't listen, rallied against Obama's benefit cut and for Social Security expansion, and won. Two hundred House Democrats endorsed a Social Security expansion bill this year.\n\nThis rare loss for Primus didn't alter his viewpoints on fearing deficits and debt. Lawson said that Primus was the driving force behind Pelosi including a controversial \"pay-go\" provision into House rules, requiring all new spending to be offset with either budget cuts or tax increases. And his top priority for the prescription drug plan, according to his remarks at the Irvine health care conference, is that it saves money for the government, which can then be plowed into other programs.\n\nWhen Pete Peterson, a billionaire who spent hundreds of millions of dollars to push Washington policymakers toward austerity, died in 2018, Pelosi delivered a floor speech that praised him effusively, as if he'd dedicated his life to eradicating child malnutrition or curing cancer, rather than pouring millions into pushing for major cuts to Social Security and Medicare. \"Pete was a clarion voice for fiscal responsibility, and a strong moral conscience in Washington,\" Pelosi said in her House floor eulogy of Peterson, who, by 2012, had already spent half a billion dollars targeting Social Security, Medicare, and other spending programs.\n\nIf Primus didn't write that speech, he surely supported it. \"He was 100 percent the main guy behind pay-go,\" Lawson said. \"He thinks the thing you do as a lefty is that you reduce the deficit.\"\n\nJayapal acknowledged Primus's long tenure in Washington, but suggested that it wasn't necessarily something to celebrate. \"This is somebody who has been a staff for a very long time. We don't have the health care system we need, do we?\" she said. \"Maybe it's time to try something new.\"\n\nWhile progressives have been more willing to attack Primus as a member/staffer interfering with their priorities, they haven't extended that critique to the woman empowering him: Pelosi. \" The speaker respects members. This is separate from her,\" DeSaulnier said. Jayapal added, \"She has always been respectful of members.\" But w ithout a go-sign from the speaker, Primus wouldn't have any weight to throw around. While the House Democratic caucus has unified in opposition to Trump, there are key splits on core values and ideals. It's a bit easier to blame the split on a staffer, but the root cause has yet to be resolved.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "Mike Pompeo Has Extreme Views on Muslims - and Liberals Don't Seem to Care\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA lengthy profile in the New Yorker conspicuously neglected to mention the secretary of state's ties to notorious Islamophobes.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo before an event on June 26, 2019.\n\nOn June 11, 2013, not long after the Boston Marathon bombings, a Republican congressman from Kansas took to the floor of the House of Representatives. \"It's been just under two months since the attacks in Boston, and in those intervening weeks, the silence of Muslim leaders has been deafening,\" began Mike Pompeo, before going on to claim that \"silence has made these Islamic leaders across America potentially complicit in these acts and, more importantly still, those that may well follow.\"\n\nPompeo's remarks were \" false and irresponsible ,\" as the Council on American Islamic Relations demonstrated at the time. Every major Muslim organization in the United States had put out a statement condemning the horrific terror attacks in Boston within hours of the blasts. Democrat Keith Ellison, one of only two Muslims members of Congress back in 2013, complained to Pompeo on the House floor - but the Republican refused to apologize and doubled down on his smear.\n\nThis remarkable and alarming incident, however, appears nowhere in this week's 8,000-plus-word New Yorker profile of Pompeo, now President Donald Trump's second secretary of state and \"most loyal soldier.\" Written by the respected Washington correspondent Susan Glasser and based on \"dozens of interviews,\" the piece includes, among others, this damning quote from a former U.S. ambassador on the obsequious Pompeo: \"He's like a heat-seeking missile for Trump's ass.\" It also nods to the secretary of state's old-fashioned racism (\"Pompeo ran a nasty race against the Democrat, an Indian-American state legislator named Raj Goyle ... [and] tweeted praise for an article calling Goyle a 'turban topper'\") and his evangelical faith (\"Pompeo, an evangelical Christian who keeps an open Bible on his desk\").\n\nYet, rather disappointingly, it ignores his well-documented bigotry toward Islam and Muslims - in fact, neither word even makes an appearance in the piece. Reading this lengthy profile of Pompeo, you would never guess that he has a long history of what Shaun Casey, former director of the State Department's Office of Religion and Global Affairs during the Obama administration, has referred to as his \"horrific, inaccurate, bigoted statements and associations vis-à-vis Muslims around the world.\" You would have no clue that the secretary of state has long-standing ties to the country's top anti-Muslim bigots and far-right organizations.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Listen to the bigots themselves. Brigitte Gabriel runs ACT for America, which has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as \"the largest grassroots anti-Muslim organization in the country.\" Gabriel herself has said a practicing Muslim \"cannot be a loyal citizen to the United States of America\" and believes Arab Muslims are \"a natural threat to civilized people of the world.\" She has also bragged about the secretary of state being \"a steadfast ally of ours since the day he was elected to Congress.\" In 2016, ACT bestowed upon Pompeo its \"highest honor,\" the National Security Eagle Award.\n\nPompeo, in turn, has been keen to boost Gabriel and ACT. As researchers from Georgetown University's Bridge Initiative on Islamophobia have observed , in 2016, \"Pompeo sponsored the room at the U.S. Capitol for ACT's 'Legislative Briefing' in conjunction with its annual national conference,\" and he \"spoke at these briefings in 2016, 2015 and 2013.\"\n\nThen there's Frank Gaffney, who runs the Center for Security Policy, which the SPLC calls a hate group and a \"conspiracy-oriented mouthpiece for the growing anti-Muslim movement.\" Gaffney himself has suggested that former President Barack Obama is a secret Muslim and has accused U.S. mosques and Muslim organizations of mounting a \"stealth jihad\" against the United States. He has also described Pompeo as \"one of the most intelligent men I know in public life.\"\n\nAgain, the feeling seems to be mutual. According to the Bridge researchers , Pompeo appeared on CSP's \"Secure Freedom Radio\" 18 times between 2014 and 2016. He also spoke at a CSP event in 2015, alongside the far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who has called for the eradication of Islam and a ban on the Quran , and the far-right lawyer David Yerushalmi, who has declared that \"Muslim civilization is at war with Judeo-Christian civilization\" and is the driving force behind the anti-sharia movement in the United States.\n\nPompeo and Yerushalmi share the same conspiratorial obsession with the Muslim Brotherhood and have both promulgated the (false) claim that mainstream Muslim-American organizations are \"fronts\" for the Brotherhood. Pompeo even co-sponsored congressional legislation in 2014 and 2015 to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nAs J.M. Berger , a counterterrorism analyst and author of a book on extremism, told BuzzFeed News in 2016 that the GOP's obsession with banning the Brotherhood is really about \"controlling American Muslims, not with any issue pertaining to the Muslim Brotherhood in any practical or realistic sense.\"\n\nShould we be surprised? Islamophobia was rampant in the Republican Party even before the election of Trump. Anti-Muslim bigotry, in fact, is what unites far-right parties across the West.\n\nBut what about the Democrats? And the liberal media? Why doesn't rising anti-Muslim bigotry bother them in the same way as, say, anti-Semitism, homophobia, or anti-black racism? The appointment of Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton - another card-carrying Islamophobe - was, admittedly, met with a handful of pieces expressing concerns about the duo's extreme views on Islam and Muslims. But there has been a deafening silence since then.\n\nWhy? Shouldn't every media profile of Pompeo acknowledge how he smeared a minority community on the floor of the House of Representatives? Shouldn't every news story about the secretary of state's latest hawkish statement on Iran, for example, note his own deep-seated Islamophobia? Shouldn't every analysis of his close relationship with the president mention, say, their shared prejudice toward Muslim Americans? Isn't it a disgrace that 16 Senate Democrats voted to confirm Pompeo as CIA director and six voted for him to be secretary of state?\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe pass given to Pompeo by the New Yorker is only the latest glaring - and depressing - example of the way in which, to borrow a line from the British Conservative politician Sayeeda Warsi, Islamophobia still passes \"the dinner table test\" here in the United States.\n\nIn November 2016, when Trump picked Pompeo to head the CIA, my colleague Lee Fang summarized a rather startling speech that he had come across from the then-congressman, at the Summit Church in Wichita, in July 2015:\n\nAt an evangelical church in his district that specializes in addressing \"Satanism and paranormal activity\" - and standing in front of a Christian flag - Pompeo in 2015  spoke of the \"struggle against radical Islam, the kind of struggle this country has not faced since its great wars.\" He warned that \"evil is all around us,\" citing reports of terror plots, and cautioned the congregation not to be deterred by those who might call them \"Islamophobes or bigots.\"\n\nPompeo need not have been worried. Despite his own shocking track record, he has ascended to one of the most powerful jobs in the U.S. government. Despite his bigoted statements and Islamophobic associations, he continues to be the subject of profiles in the liberal press that make no mention of said bigotry or Islamophobia. As Matt Duss, foreign policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders, tweeted on Monday: \"Anti-Muslim bigotry is still something that won't get you in trouble in DC.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Nancy Pelosi Has Chosen Her War, and It's With Her Own Party's Future\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIt is time for liberals and leftists who lambast Mitch McConnell to admit to themselves that the hippie-punching Pelosi has become a Trump enabler too.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi answers questions during her weekly press conference at the U.S. Capitol on June 27, 2019, in Washington, D.C.\n\nThey call themselves the \" Squad .\" From climate change to student debt to migrants in detention , progressive House Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley have been energetic and outspoken since getting elected last November - and, as a result, have become inured to constant attacks from congressional Republicans and, of course, Fox News .\n\nBut how about from their own boss?\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times' Maureen Dowd, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the Squad as \"four people\" who have their \"public whatever and their Twitter world\" but don't \"have any following.\"\n\nOuch. This isn't the first time Pelosi has trolled the left-wing quartet. In April, when she was asked by Lesley Stahl on \"60 Minutes\" to comment on the newly emboldened progressive wing of her party, Pelosi responded : \"That's like five people.\"\n\nRead our Complete Coverage All the President's Crimes\n\nRead our Complete Coverage\n\nIn the wake of November's midterms, Pelosi mocked calls from AOC and her allies for a Green New Deal: \"The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it right?\"\n\nTo be clear: None of these freshmen Democrats have personally attacked Pelosi, and all four of them backed her bid for the speakership. As CNN's Nathan McDermott tweeted , \"It is pretty notable that the most vocally anti-Pelosi Democrats (ala the moderates in swing districts who opposed her leadership) don't get as much criticism from her as the left-wing of the party.\"\n\nHow about Donald Trump? Pelosi is willing to criticize Trump - \"I've never encountered, thought about, seen within the realm of my experiences as a child or an adult, anybody like this\" - but only criticize. Nothing more. Not impeachment, that's for sure. The top Democrat in the House told Dowd that the president has engaged in criminal behavior but - wait for it - \"you can't impeach everybody.\"\n\nThe New York Times interview is yet another reminder for liberals and leftists that if they want to oppose Trump, they have to oppose Pelosi too.\n\nThink I'm exaggerating? Consider three recent - and shameful - episodes.\n\nFirst, the rape allegations against the president. On June 21, New York magazine published a cover story from the famed advice columnist and writer E. Jean Carroll, in which she documented in excruciating detail how Trump, back in the mid-1990s, forced \"his penis halfway\" inside of her in the midst of a \"colossal struggle\" in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room.\n\nPelosi's response to a reporter who asked her for comment a whole six days later? \"I don't know the person making the accusation ... I haven't paid that much attention to it.\"\n\nHere's Nancy Pelosi verbally shrugging in response to a question about what she thinks Congress should do about a credible rape accusation against the president. Not great. pic.twitter.com/NPoEUB3jgg\n\n- Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) June 27, 2019\n\nNow, she tells Dowd: \"I respect the case she has but I don't see any role for Congress.\"\n\nThe sitting Republican president has been credibly accused of having committed a sexual assault and yet Congress, says the Democratic speaker of the House, has no \"role\" in holding him to account for it. Oh, and the speaker herself hasn't been paying \"attention to it.\"\n\nThis, my dear liberals, is your (feminist) champion.\n\nSecond, the crisis at the border. One of the reasons Pelosi cited for not being familiar with the E. Jean Carroll story was that she was \"busy worrying about children not being in their mothers' arms.\" Yet on that same day, as the New York Times reported, Pelosi \"capitulated to Republicans and Democratic moderates and dropped her insistence on stronger protections for migrant children in overcrowded border shelters\" by signing onto a bill from the Republican-led Senate, giving the Trump administration $4.6 billion to tackle the situation on the southern border.\n\nLast time I checked, though, this administration's horrific decision to separate migrant children from their parents had nothing to do with a lack of funds. \"The cruelty is the point,\" as the Atlantic's Adam Serwer so memorably put it. Plus, 18 so-called \"centrist\" Democrats pushed Pelosi into dropping her objections to the Senate bill and yet in her New York Times interview, the speaker decided to level her attack on - you guessed it - the Squad. They made themselves irrelevant and shouldn't have voted against \"our bill,\" she told Dowd, adding: \"They're four people and that's how many votes they got.\"\n\nYet they were far from alone in opposing Pelosi's decision. \"The final vote, 305 to 102,\" reported the Times on June 27, \"included far more Republicans in favor, 176, than Democrats, 129.\"\n\nMeanwhile, over at the border, children continue to be starved , women continue to drink out of toilet bowls , and men continue to be held in standing-room-only conditions. The Trump administration is now contemplating mass video proceedings for immigrants seeking asylum.\n\nThank you, Madam Speaker.\n\nI don't believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody. It's a huge mistake.\n\nThis admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People's lives are getting bargained, & for what? https://t.co/h7gP8Wous1\n\n- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 7, 2019\n\nThird, Trump's tax returns. Last Tuesday, almost exactly six months after Democrats won control of the House, they finally took the president of the United States to court to try to force disclosure of his financial records. Trump administration officials and Trump's army of personal lawyers have offered a range of excuses for refusing to release these records - and for defying congressional subpoenas in the process. But as Slate's Mark Joseph Stern has noted , one in particular stands out from the rest.\n\nOn June 10, in an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Trump's lawyers contested the claim that the House's impeachment power could justify subpoenaing the president's financial records while gleefully pointing out to the judge that impeachment is not even on the table. They wrote in their brief :\n\nSpeaker Pelosi has steadfastly denied that the House's investigations are in any way related to impeachment. In March, she unequivocally told the Washington Post, 'I'm not for impeachment.' In late May, the Speaker reiterated that 'any suggestion that Democrats are planning to pursue impeachment 'simply isn't the truth.'\" After she received the district court's ruling in this case, the Speaker boasted that the Committee had prevailed despite \"the fact the House Democratic caucus is not on a path to impeachment.\" Just four days ago, the Speaker again told senior Democratic leaders that \"she isn't open to the idea\" of impeachment, and Chairman Cummings \"sided with Pelosi.\"\n\nIs it not a source of shame for rank-and-file Democrats, whether on the left or in the \"center,\" that Trump lawyers are citing Pelosi's refusal to impeach him as their defense in court? As their justification for ignoring congressional subpoenas?\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nMeanwhile, Pelosi herself continues to duck and dodge the arguments in favor of impeachment - even when she happens to be the one making them. \"The thing is that, he every day practically self-impeaches by obstructing justice and ignoring the subpoenas,\" she told the Times.\n\nSorry, what is she on about? I may not be a U.S. citizen yet, or speaker of the House of Representatives for that matter, but I have read the U.S. Constitution from beginning to end, and I have yet to come across the clause that refers to \"self-impeachment.\"\n\nSo forget the \"you-go-girl memes for literally clapping back at Trump\" that Dowd fawns over in her interview with the speaker. It is time for liberals and leftists who lambast Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to admit to themselves that the hippie-punching Pelosi has become a Trump enabler too.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Liberals Have Some Soul-Searching to Do\n\nPaul Christian Gordon/ZUMA\n\nI don't know that I trust myself yet to say anything about the election, but there's a little bit I can say.\n\nFirst, no matter what else, and no matter how close the count was, it looks like Donald Trump is being tossed out of the White House. This is an unalloyed good thing and we should all be breathing a huge sigh of relief over it.\n\nThat said, Joe Biden's victory represents only a tiny change in the vote compared to 2016. Trumpism wasn't rejected-he probably would have won if not for the pandemic-and liberalism wasn't embraced. At this point, Republicans still need to come to grips with how Trump took over their party, but Democrats need to come to grips with the fact that they remain a generally unloved alternative. I have my own ideas about why that is, which I'll keep to myself for the time being, but it's something that needs to be addressed in a clear-eyed way. No more hiding behind popular vote victories or polls claiming to show that everyone loves our policies. It's obvious that both are misleading. Nor is the answer for the party to be more vigorous about supporting your personal policy preferences. That's just lazy.\n\nThis is all going to be discussed to death over the next few months, and we're all going to get sick of it. But the worst thing liberals can do is to keep piddling down the same path as always without giving it much thought.

      "text": "Are Liberals Too Smug? Nah, We're Too Condescending.\n\nAre liberals too smug? Sure. That's what Emmett Rensin says at Vox, anyway. Unfortunately, his essay runs to a Voxtastic 7,000 words, so there probably aren't too many people willing to read it all the way through. These days, I'm tempted to say that the real problem with liberalism is that we've forgotten how to make a good, crisp point in a couple thousand words. We've fallen victim to the idea that longer essays signal greater importance. Maybe I'll write a 2000-word piece about that someday.\n\nBut anyway-smugness. Are liberals too smug? I'd say so, except I'm not sure smug is really the right word. Here is Rensin explaining it:\n\nBy the 1990s the better part of the working class wanted nothing to do with the word liberal. What remained of the American progressive elite was left to puzzle: What happened to our coalition? Why did they abandon us?\n\n....The smug style arose to answer these questions. It provided an answer so simple and so emotionally satisfying that its success was perhaps inevitable.... The trouble is that stupid hicks don't know what's good for them. They're getting conned by right-wingers and tent revivalists until they believe all the lies that've made them so wrong. They don't know any better. That's why they're voting against their own self-interest.\n\n....It began in humor, and culminated for a time in The Daily Show , a program that more than any other thing advanced the idea that liberal orthodoxy was a kind of educated savvy....The internet only made it worse. Today, a liberal who finds himself troubled by the currents of contemporary political life need look no further than his Facebook newsfeed to find the explanation:\n\n....NPR listeners are best informed of all. He likes that.\n\n....Liberals aren't just better informed. They're smarter.\n\n....They've got better grammar. They know more words.\n\n....Liberals are better able to process new information; they're less biased like that. They've got different brains. Better ones. Why? Evolution. They've got better brains, top-notch amygdalae, science finds.\n\nEtc.\n\nFair enough. But what would you call that? There's some smugness in there, sure, but I'd call it plain old condescension. We're convinced that conservatives, especially working class conservatives, are just dumb. Smug suggests only a supreme confidence that we're right-but conservative elites also believe they're right, and they believe it as much as we do. The difference is that, generally speaking, they're less condescending about it.\n\n(Except for libertarians. Damn, but those guys are condescending.)\n\nIn any case, to boil things down a bit, Rensin accuses liberals of several faults:\n\nI agree with some of this. I've long since gotten tired of the endless reposting of John Oliver's \"amazing,\" \"perfect,\" \"mic drop\" destruction of whatever topic he takes on this week. I'm exasperated that the authors of papers showing that liberals are better than conservatives seem unable to write them in value-neutral ways that acknowledge the value of conservative ways of thinking. I don't like the endless mockery of flyover country rubes. We should punch up, not down.\n\nAs it happens, I think Rensin could have constructed a much better case with 7,000 words to work with. His essay didn't feel very well researched or persuasive to me, even though I agree with much of it. Still, the pushback has mostly been of the \"Republicans are smug too!\" variety:\n\nI don't care enough to read it, so I'll ask: Does that \"smug liberalism\" piece address smug conservatism? (\"Real America\"; \"lazy poor\")\n\n- Jamison Foser (@jamisonfoser) April 23, 2016\n\nAnyone ever been told by a liberal that you'll burn in hell, simply because you disagree with him? Didn't think so. But *liberals* are smug!\n\n- Jamison Foser (@jamisonfoser) April 23, 2016\n\nDeclaring Paul Ryan a serious thinker, then refusing to entertain requests to square that with his constant falsehoods: Pretty smug!\n\n- Jamison Foser (@jamisonfoser) April 23, 2016\n\nBut this isn't smugness. It's outrage, or hypocrisy, or standard issue partisanship. And as plenty of people have pointed out, outrage sells on the right, but for some reason, not on the left. We prefer mockery. So they get Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly, while we get Rachel Maddow and Jon Stewart.\n\nYou can find a good example in conservative criticism of political correctness on college campuses: trigger warnings, safe spaces, shouting down speakers, etc. They're infuriated by this. They think college kids are cosseted by their administrations; can't stand to be disagreed with; and have no respect for the First Amendment. But they're not usually smug or condescending about it. Most of the time they're scornful and outraged.\n\nGenerally speaking, elite conservatives think liberals are ignorant of basic truths: Econ 101; the work-sapping impact of welfare dependence; the value of traditional culture; the obvious dangers of the world that surrounds us. For working-class conservatives it's worse: they're just baffled by it all. They're made to feel guilty about everything that's any fun: college football for exploiting kids; pro football for maiming its players; SUVs for destroying the climate; living in the suburbs for being implicitly racist. If they try to argue, they're accused of mansplaining or straightsplaining or whitesplaining. If they put a wrong word out of place, they're slut shaming or fat shaming. Who the hell talks like that? They think it's just crazy. Why do they have to put up with all this condescending gibberish from twenty-something liberals? What's wrong with the values they grew up with?\n\nSo liberals and conservatives have different styles. No surprise there. The question is, do these styles work? Here, I think the answer is the same on both sides: they work on their own side, but not on the other. Outrage doesn't persuade liberals and mockery doesn't persuade conservatives. If you're writing something for your own side, as I am here most of the time, there's no harm done. The problem is that mass media-and the internet in particular-makes it very hard to tailor our messages. Conservative outrage and liberal snark are heard by everyone, including the persuadable centrist types that we might actually want to persuade. In the end, I think this is probably the real point to take away from Rensin's essay. The first law of marketing, after all, is to know your audience. Handily, that's also the first law of journalism.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "How Can Liberals Expand Their Reach?\n\nAnti-abortion marchers and abortion-rights supporters at the U.S. Supreme Court on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade in January 2005. Pete Souza/TNS via ZUMA Wire\n\nOver at New York , Eric Levitz makes a familiar case: the Republican Party is crazy and the system is rigged in their favor:\n\nEvery elected branch of the U.S. government structurally overrepresents low-density areas. And since America's two parties are now polarized along urban-rural lines, the GOP has ballots to burn.\n\n....Biden has no plausible answer to the problem that the conservative movement poses. But it's not clear that anyone else does either. Some segments of the left preach economic populism as a panacea for polarization: Provide working-class voters with a robust, social-democratic alternative to cultural conservatism, and the Democratic Party just might regain its New Deal-era dominance. I favor this strategy on its substantive merits. And it may well be the best hope our Republic's got. But there is little empirical evidence to support a \"just world\" theory of American politics in which Democrats are reliably rewarded for taking on plutocratic power or reliably punished for appeasing it.\n\nThis is all true. But here's what I don't get: this has all been obviously true ever since the Moral Majority powered Ronald Reagan to victory in 1980. Over the following 40 years liberals griped incessantly about the electoral advantage that conservatives enjoy and wondered aloud what the problem is with Kansas. Why, oh why, do conservative voters keep supporting the GOP even though it's the party of Social Security \"reform\" and tax cuts for millionaires?\n\nThe answer is equally obvious: these voters don't really care much about economic policy and we can't make them. They care about social issues. Translated into non-apocalyptic language, here's what the world looks like from their point of view:\n\nThe thing is, all of this is more or less true. We liberals do want to separate church and state; we do support gay rights; we do support abortion rights; etc. And this strikes a lot of rural conservatives as basically depraved. Conservative politicians and conservative media turn all this stuff into a caricature, but it's not as if it isn't grounded in reality.\n\nSo this leaves liberals with two alternatives. First, we can figure out a way to retain our views on social issues but convince conservative voters that they aren't a big deal and don't represent the fall of Western civilization. Second, we can tone down our social views to make them more acceptable to moderate conservatives. Those are our two choices, but among the activist wing of the left we're not really willing to pursue either one of them. We mostly ignore or mock the rural conservatives, and we certainly refuse to soften our views on social issues for them. They're just bigots, right? Then we wonder why they vote for Republicans.\n\nAll of this used to be fairly obvious to anyone interested in politics, but it gets surprisingly little attention these days because we spend so much time acting goggle-eyed at the lunatics. But the lunatics have always been around: the John Birch Society, the Moral Majority, the Mena airport clowns, the tea party, and today QAnon and assorted other crackpots. So forget them for the moment. The real question is: How can liberals appeal to folks who are just normal conservatives?\n\nOne way or another, the answer is that we have to make our views on social issues acceptable to them. Everything else is just so much fluff.

      "text": "Liberals Need to Stop Whining Endlessly About How We're All Doomed\n\nMichelle Goldberg describes the ending of Parasite , in which a poor family meets its final, inescapable fate:\n\nAt the film's end, after a spasm of murderous violence, infamy and grief, the Kims' son makes a \"fundamental plan\" to grow rich enough to save his father. There's a gauzy sequence where this seems to be actually playing out, and \"Parasite\" briefly dangles the prospect of a Hollywood ending. Only in the last shot is it clear that it's a fantasy and that he's stuck right where he began.\n\nAccording to the O.E.C.D., American social mobility is no more robust than South Korea's. But with a few exceptions like Boots Riley's surrealist 2018 indie film \"Sorry to Bother You,\" American popular culture hasn't caught up to a world where brains and gumption are no match for larger material forces.\n\nWe liberals keep trying to push this theme, but it sure doesn't feel like people are buying it. Conventional wisdom says that at least a few of them bought Donald Trump's version of it, namely that China and Mexico are stealing our jobs and he's going to get them back, but not that many. After all, Trump won a smaller share of the vote than Mitt Romney did just four years earlier, and his share was considerably less than the average of all the other Republican presidential candidates of the 21st century.\n\nSo even Trump's apocalyptic version of this doesn't seem to appeal to very many people, and the liberal version, if anything, seems to appeal to even fewer. And even if it does have some appeal, it gets us nowhere unless we have a great elevator pitch about how we're going to fix it. But we don't. We have Medicare for All, which is great if you lose your job. We have wealth taxes on billionaires, which is great if you lose your job. And we have infrastructure plans, which might provide work if-well, you know.\n\nBut how about a plan to keep people from losing their jobs in the first place? Or making their jobs better? That's what they want. Trump at least makes fake promises about that, but we don't do even that much.\n\nThere are really only two options here. First, we just stop talking about how unfair the world is, because all it does is discourage people. Or, second, we offer an actual solution that's credible and appealing. The only one I can think of is a big, loud, endless promise to rebuild unions. But there's not even a single Democratic candidate who has made that their trademark in the same way that Medicare for All is Bernie's trademark or a wealth tax is Elizabeth Warren's.\n\nWhy not?\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Liberals Need to Be Lincolnesque In Our Latest Race War\n\nSeven years ago I wrote a piece for Democracy about where political trends would take us by 2024. Here's one bit:\n\nTrend #5: The Republican Party will continue to become ever more dependent on the white vote, while the Democratic Party will depend ever more on minorities.\n\n....So what does this all mean? One: Certain aspects of the culture wars will heat up. In particular, thanks to the increasingly polarized demographics of the two main political parties, fights over immigration and race may well be even more acrimonious than they are today.\n\nThat's all I said in that particular piece, but in other posts where I had more space I still mostly failed to grapple with the obvious conclusion of my own reasoning. I figured there was a limit to what Republicans could do. They could pack-and-crack congressional districts. They could squeeze a little more turnout out of evangelicals and older whites. Fox News could run its endless \"scary black folks\" segments. State legislatures could pass photo ID laws designed to suppress black voter turnout.\n\nBut they were running out of options. The last item in that list is a good example of what influenced my thinking. The truth is that photo ID laws have only a tiny influence on presidential elections. It turns out that most people who lack photo IDs aren't likely to vote in the first place, and loud pushback from liberals offset some of the losses anyway. What's more, photo ID laws were passed only in states with total Republican control, and by definition those are states that are mostly safe Republican havens to start with. The fact that Republicans put so much energy into this project only showed how desperate they were. There just wasn't much left for them to do in the face of demographic changes that were reducing the size of their white base by a point or two every election cycle.\n\nFor what it's worth, this was mostly the conclusion of Republicans themselves, too. The famous post-election autopsy written by the Republican National Committee after Mitt Romney's 2012 loss, said this:\n\nIn 1980, exit polls tell us that the electorate was 88 percent white. In 2012, it was 72 percent white....According to the Pew Hispanic Center, in 2050, whites will be 47 percent of the country.... The Republican Party must be committed to building a lasting relationship within the African American community year-round, based on mutual respect and with a spirit of caring.\n\nBut there was always a glaring problem with this strategy, one that everybody was keenly aware of: reaching out to black voters would only work if Republicans also ceased their tolerance of white bigotry. In other words, they'd almost certainly lose votes on a net basis at first, which would mean handing over the presidency-and maybe much more-to Democrats for upwards of a decade or so. That's just too big a sacrifice for any political party to make.\n\nSo instead they took another route: they went after the white vote even harder. In Donald Trump they found a candidate who wasn't afraid to appeal to racist sentiment loudly and bluntly, something that simply hadn't occurred to other Republicans. They never thought they could get away with something like this in the 21st century, and normally they would have been right: it would have lost them as many votes among educated whites as it won them among working-class whites. But after eight years of a black president in the White House, racial tensions were ratcheted up just enough that Trump could get away with it. Only by a hair, and only with plenty of other help, but he did get away with it, losing 10 points of support among college-educated whites but gaining 14 points among working-class whites.\n\nThe entire Republican Party is now all-in on this strategy. They mostly stay quiet themselves and let Trump himself do the dirty work, but that's enough. Nobody talks anymore about reaching out to the black community with a spirit of caring or any other spirit. Nor is there anything the rest of us can do about this. Republicans believe that wrecking the fabric of the country is their only hope of staying in power, and they're right. If working-class whites abandon them even a little bit, they're toast.\n\nSo all we can do is try to crush the Republican Party at the ballot box. What other options are there? Reactionary American whites, as always, won't give up their power unless it's taken from them by either a literal or figurative war. Liberals need to be as Lincolnesque1 as possible in this endeavor-we don't have to win the votes of unrepentent bigots, just the fretful fence-sitters-but we also need to be Lincolnesque2 in our commitment to winning the Trump-inspired race war we're now in the middle of.\n\n1That is, with malice toward none and charity for all.\n\n2That is, with an iron determination to win.\n\nUPDATE: I've made a couple of very slight wording changes to the last paragraph, just to make it absolutely clear what I mean here.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "White Evangelicals Are Terrified That Liberals Want to Extinguish Their Rights\n\nPresident Trump at Christmas Eve services last year. Olivier Douliery/CNP via ZUMA\n\nAs we all know, white evangelicals are convinced that their religious liberties are under attack from liberals and atheists. But are they really? Political scientists Ryan Burge and Paul Djupe looked at survey data to find out:\n\n[Among] white evangelical Protestants, we found that 60 percent believed that atheists would not allow them First Amendment rights and liberties. More specifically, we asked whether they believed atheists would prevent them from being able to \"hold rallies, teach, speak freely, and run for public office.\" Similarly, 58 percent believed \"Democrats in Congress\" would not allow them to exercise these liberties if they were in power.\n\nIs this true? The authors go to a second survey to find out, but it has different questions and different groups of respondents and doesn't really address the question. Nonetheless they try to tease out an answer, and unsurprisingly the answer is no. Most atheists and Democrats are pretty tolerant of basic religious liberties even if they really, really hate evangelicals. Conversely, evangelicals who hate atheists are pretty intolerant of their religious liberties:\n\nConservative Christians believe their rights are in peril partly because that's what they're hearing, quite explicitly, from conservative media, religious elites, partisan commentators and some politicians, including the president. The survey evidence suggests another reason, too. Their fear comes from an inverted golden rule: Expect from others what you would do unto them. White evangelical Protestants express low levels of tolerance for atheists, which leads them to expect intolerance from atheists in return. That perception surely bolsters their support for Trump. They believe their freedom depends on keeping Trump and his party in power.\n\nI'd add to this that it's all unfolding against a background in which the biggest real-world fights are over abortion and contraceptives and cake decorators. Conservative Christians believe that their freedom to refuse these services is also a basic religious liberty, and there's no question that liberals are pretty determined to take those particular liberties away. Given that, it's a short step to believe that liberals might someday decide to remove their rights to \"hold rallies, teach, speak freely, and run for public office.\"\n\nIn any case, this is something I've written about occasionally: it's impossible to understand evangelicals and their support for Donald Trump without first understanding just how frightened they are of the steady liberal march toward secular hegemony. They consider the aughts and teens to have been a nearly complete disaster, capped by the 2015 Supreme Court ruling forcing states to recognize gay marriage. Many prominent evangelical leaders literally gave up after that, and the ones that didn't had little hope for the future.\n\nThen, suddenly, Donald Trump showed up and promised them everything they wanted. In short order he became their Joan of Arc, rallying them back to a fight he assured them they could win as long as he was on their side. And rhetorically, at least, he delivered. The fight was back on.\n\nIt's not clear to me that there's much we can do about this. We can't do anything about the \"inverted golden rule,\" and we're certainly not going to stop fighting for gay rights or reproductive rights. That leaves only a more concerted effort to assure evangelicals that they have nothing to fear regarding things like teaching, speaking, and holding rallies. And even that's a tough nut when evangelicals can look to other countries and see that, in fact, those rights have occasionally been circumscribed to some degree. This may seem like a pretty small and distant issue, but I assure you that Fox News and talk radio report on every single example no matter how small, and they keep it front and center forever and ever.\n\nUnderstanding your opponents is usually useful because it provides some guidance about how best to respond. In this case I'm not sure it does, but it's still good to know on the off chance that it might be helpful. Evangelicals are not generally engaged in faux outrage. They are truly scared silly that liberals will steadily and unrelentingly dismantle their rights if they ever get in power again.

      "text": "What Should Liberals and Conservatives Write More About?\n\nOver at National Review , Jim Geraghty joins in the mockery of all the lavish Christmas trips that the editors of British Vogue wrote about last month:\n\nThose extravagant Christmas vacation plans are even more ironic with the arrival of the first issue of Vogue in 2020 which brings the declaration of \" Vogue values.\" The magazine declares, \"in 2020, Vogue promises to live more sustainably every day, in every way.\" The print magazine includes a letter from \"all of the editors in chief of Vogue \" declaring: \" Vogue stands committed to practices that celebrate cultures and preserve the planet for future generations. We speak with a unified voice, across 26 editions standing for the values of diversity, responsibly, and respect for individuals, communities, and for our natural environment.\" Again, in a matter of hours, these editors racked up more carbon emissions than the average American does in three weeks - and that's just from the flights, not from anything else they did on their extravagant getaways. Just how loose are the standards for \"living sustainably\" at Vogue ?\n\nOK, fine. Vogue editors probably deserve all this just on general principles. If you can't mock Vogue , who can you mock?1\n\nStill, this should stop. Personal contributions to fighting climate change are pretty near zero, and it's not controversial to say that we should stop trying to guilt our way to saving the planet. Practically every serious environmentalist is on board with this. On a personal level, you should go ahead and do whatever you want. If that means making a difference by getting rid of your dryer and hanging your clothes on a line in the backyard, then do that. If it means flying to Bermuda, then fly to Bermuda. They're both perfectly good choices-the first since every little bit helps, and the second since, nonetheless, the only way we'll make a real dent in global warming is via massive collective action-that is, action at the national and international level.\n\nOf course, this is National Review . The only time they mention climate change is when there's a chance to mock people who take it seriously. Likewise, the only time they mention the plight of the poor is when there's a chance to write about a program that doesn't work or a beneficiary who cheated. The only time they mention African Americans is when there's a chance to defend the police or mock some aspect of modern wokeness.2\n\nIf you ask them, they'll say they take climate change seriously. They aren't a bunch of idiot Trumpies who think it's all a Chinese hoax. They'll also say they truly want to help the poor. And they agree that racism is still a problem in America. That's what they'll say. But when it comes time to write about it, somehow it's always on the other side. That's not a coincidence.\n\nAll of us in the writing biz demonstrate our priorities by what we choose to write about. I think National Review shows its priorities by declining to write about the dangers of climate change; the genuine problems faced by the poor and homeless; and the racism that still afflicts America , especially in their own circle of movement conservatism.\n\nThat's what I'd like to see them write more about-from a conservative perspective, of course. But what do they think we progressive writers ignore that we shouldn't? Perhaps they think I should write more about ways to improve the military. Or ways to keep our borders secure. Or ways to keep universities open to conservative voices. Or something else. That is, I shouldn't write about these things only when I have a chance to mock conservative hypocrisy or cite a study showing that conservatives are wrong.\n\nAnd maybe so. But what should those subjects be? The three I chose for NR are off the top of my head, but they're good enough. I'll stick with them. What do they have for me?\n\n1This is going to get me in trouble. I should be getting a call from my sister shortly.\n\n2This footnote is the obligatory \"not all the time\" acknowledgment. This isn't 100 percent of their writing on these subjects. But I'd peg it at 90 percent or so.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Activate your online access\n\nFrom China and the Middle East to immigration, all too many liberals have already moved inexorably rightward. Count on them to quietly support some of Trump's policies.\n\nFormer US president Donald Trump during a campaign event at Alro Steel in Potterville, Michigan, on August 29, 2024.\n\nThis article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com . To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com .\n\nLiberals hate Trump, no question about it. He's the definition of illiberal: authoritarian, racist, sexist, and downright nasty. Not only that, he's a living repudiation of the liberal delusion that America runs on meritocracy.\n\nBut you want to know a dirty, little secret? In back alleys, encrypted group chats, and off-the-record conversations, liberals will still support Trump on a case-by-case basis. Of course, they'd never vote for the guy, but they'll give two cheers for some of his policies.\n\nI discovered this ugly truth during Trump's last term while writing an article on the shift in US policy toward China from lukewarm engagement to hostile decoupling. The general consensus among the foreign policy elite was that, at least in terms of relations with Beijing, Trump was a useful idiot for slowing China's roll with harsh rhetoric and tariffs.\n\n\"Trump is a madman, but I want to give him and his administration their due,\" one prominent liberal intellectual told me . \"We can't keep playing on an unlevel playing field and take promises that are never delivered on. It's really China's turn to respond, and it's long overdue.\"\n\nIt wasn't just China. For years, liberals and conservatives alike were, for instance, pushing the concept of burden-sharing: getting US allies to cover more of the bill for their security needs. But it was only Trump who really made it happen by blackmailing NATO members and other US partners into doing so.\n\nSure, few warmed to the idea of the United States actually pulling out of NATO, but even many of our European allies, though they publicly grumbled, were secretly happy about The Donald's gaiatsu . That's the Japanese word for outside pressure that enables a leader to force through unpopular changes by blaming it all on foreigners. The self-described liberal leader of NATO, Dutch politician Mark Rutte, even came out in the open after Trump's reelection to praise the American president for making European countries more militarily self-sufficient.\n\nIt wasn't just liberals who thrilled to Trump's unorthodox foreign policy during his first term either. Some of those further to the left also embraced Trump the engager (with North Korea's Kim Jong Un), Trump the isolationist (and his threats to close US military bases globally), and Trump the putative peacemaker (for concluding a deal with the Taliban to end the US military presence in Afghanistan).\n\nTrump, in other words, was not just an unanticipated crisis; he was also an opportunity. Deep in their hearts, anyone unhappy with the status quo will support a disrupter. Quite a few Democrats disgusted with this country's border policies, inflation, and its coastal elites even crossed over to vote for Trump in November because they wanted change, regardless of the consequences.\n\nTrump 2.0 is going to be the same but worse, like a strong cheese voted out of the refrigerator only to grow ever more pungent as it moldered in a dark corner of Florida. The latest version of Trump has promised more violence and destruction the second time around, from mass deportations to mass tariffs. And he's planning to avoid appointing anyone to his administration who might have a contrary thought, a backbone to resist him, or the least qualification to enact sensible policy.\n\nIn the face of such a vengeful and truculent force returning to the White House, surely, you might think, it will be impossible to find any liberals embracing such anarchy the second time around.\n\nThink again. This is how American politics works, if only for liberals. The modern Republican Party routinely boycotts Democratic administrations: blocking Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination, working overtime to shut down the federal government, voting en masse against legislation it would have supported if introduced by a Republican administration. The MAGA crowd has, in fact, turned noncooperation into something of an art form.\n\nLiberals, on the other hand, pride themselves on bipartisanship, on getting things done no matter who's in power. So, inevitably, there will be cooperation with the Trump team as it sets about the \"deconstruction of the administrative state\" (as Trump cheerleader Steve Bannon once put it ). Worse, there will even be some silver-lining liberals (and a few leftists) who pull up a seat to applaud the wrecking ball-not, perhaps, for its wholesale destruction of neighborhoods, but at least for its demolition of a select number of buildings that they deem irreparable.\n\nEach time such destruction takes place, the self-exculpatory comment from such silver-liners will be: \"Well, somebody had to come along and do something!\" If Trump is the only tool in the governing toolbox, some liberals will indeed try to use him to pound in a few nails they think need hammering.\n\nIn his 2024 State of the Union address, Joe Biden argued that he did a better job than Donald Trump of standing up to China. He certainly devoted more Pentagon dollars to containing China. And not only did he not roll back Trump's tariffs on Chinese products, but he added some of his own, including a 100 percent tax on Chinese electric vehicles. Biden also made concrete moves to decouple the US economy from China's, especially when it came to the supply chains for critical raw materials that Beijing has sought to control. \"I've made sure that the most advanced American technologies can't be used in China,\" he insisted, adding , \"Frankly for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that.\"\n\nBiden's moves on China, from export controls and subsidies for chip manufacturers to closer military relationships with Pacific partners like Australia and India, received the enthusiastic support of his party. No surprise there: It's hard to find anyone in Washington these days who has a good word to say about engaging more with China.\n\nSo, when Trump takes office in January, he won't actually be reversing course. He'll simply be taking the baton-like stick from Biden while leaving all the carrots in the ground.\n\nThat said, Trump's proposed further spike in tariffs against China (and Canada and Mexico and potentially the rest of the world) does give many liberals pause, since it threatens to unleash an economically devastating global trade war while boosting prices radically at home. But trade unions backed by such liberals support such measures as a way to protect jobs, while the European Union only recently imposed stiff tariffs of their own on Chinese electrical vehicles.\n\nSo, yes, neoliberals who embrace free trade are going to push back against Trump's economic policies, but more traditional liberals who backed protectionist measures in the past will secretly (or not so secretly) applaud Trump's moves.\n\nOn taking office, Joe Biden rolled back his predecessor's harsh immigration policies. The rate of border-crossings then spiked for a variety of reasons (not just the repeal of those Trump-era laws) from an average of half a million to about 2 million annually. However, in 2024, those numbers plummeted , despite Trump's campaign claims-but no matter. By then, many Democrats had already been reborn as border hawks.\n\nThat new, tougher attitude was on display in executive actions President Biden took in 2024 as well as the border security bill that Democrats tried to push through Congress earlier this year. Forget about finding a path to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants who keep the American economy humming, Biden's immigration policy focused on limiting asylum petitions, increasing detention facilities, and even allocating more money to build Trump's infamous wall.\n\nAs Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, pointed out on the eve of the November election, \"What we are seeing is that the center of the Democratic Party is now adopting the same policies, the same postures, that MAGA Republicans were fighting for about six years ago.\"\n\nAnd yet such punitive policies still weren't harsh enough for MAGA Republicans and their America First followers. The bottom line was that immigration-averse voters didn't want to support Democrats pretending to be MAGA Republicans. When it came to the White House, they wanted the real thing.\n\nAs politics change hands in Washington next January, it's going to be difficult to find any Democrats who will support the mass detentions and deportations Trump is promising. Yet many liberals, like the unprecedented number of Latinos who pulled the lever for Trump in 2024, do want major changes at the border with Mexico. In Arizona, Democrat Ruben Gallego won a squeaker of a Senate election by emphasizing border security and even backing a border wall (in certain areas). Such liberal border hawks will be happy when the Republican president does the dirty work so that Democrats don't suffer the political fallout that is sure to follow.\n\nOn the face of it, the Abraham Accords were a liberal nightmare. The brainchild of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, they promised to repair relations between Israel and the major authoritarian regimes in the region: Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, Morocco, and Sudan. The deal was a reward for illiberal leaders, particularly Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. The primary losers would, of course, be the Palestinians, who would have to give up their hopes for a separate state in exchange for some Saudi handouts, and the Sahrawi people, who lost their claim to the Western Sahara when the United States and Israel recognized Moroccan sovereignty over the entire region.\n\nInstead of shelving the accords, however, the Biden administration pushed ahead with them. After roundly criticizing Saudi autocrat Mohammed bin Salman for, among other things, ordering the murder of a US-based Saudi journalist, Biden mended ties, fist-bumping that rogue leader, and continuing to discuss how and when the Kingdom would normalize relations with Israel. Nor did his administration restrict Washington's staggering weapons deliveries to Israel after its invasion and utter devastation of Gaza. Yes, Biden and crew made some statements about Palestinian suffering and tried to push more humanitarian aid into the conflict zone, but they did next to nothing to pressure Israel to stop its killing machine (nor would they reverse the Trump administration's decision on the Western Sahara).\n\nThe liberals who support Israel (come what may) like Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman , New York Representative Ritchie Torres , and the New Democrat Coalition in the House of Representatives are, of course, going to be enthusiastic about Trump's ever tighter embrace of Netanyahu next year. But there are also likely to be quiet cheers from other corners of the liberal-left about the harder line Trump is likely to take against Tehran . (Remember Kamala Harris's assertion during her presidential run that Iran was the main adversary of the United States?) The Arab Spring is long gone and a strong man in the White House needs to both schmooze with and go toe to toe with the strong men of the Middle East-or so many liberals will believe, even as they rationalize away their relief over Trump's handling of a thoroughly illiberal region.\n\nAnyone to the left of Tucker Carlson will certainly think twice about showing public enthusiasm for whatever Trump does. Indeed, most liberals will be appalled by the new administration's likely suspension of aid to Ukraine and withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, not to mention other possible harebrained maneuvers like sending US troops to battle narcotraffickers in Mexico.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / Vincent Bevins\n\nJeet Heer\n\nTrump will attract liberal support, however quietly or even secretively, not because of his bridge-building genius-in reality, he couldn't even get a bridge-building infrastructure bill through Congress in his first term-but because all too many liberals have already moved inexorably rightward on issues ranging from China and the Middle East to immigration. The MAGA minority has seized the machinery of power by weaponizing mendacity and ruthlessly breaking rules, in the process transforming politics much the way the Bolshevik minority did in Russia more than a century ago. In the pot that those Republicans put on the stove, the water has been boiling for more than a decade and yet the left-of-center frogs barely seem to recognize just how altered our circumstances have become.\n\nIn normal times, finding overlapping interests with your political adversaries makes sense. Such bedrock bipartisanship stabilizes fractious countries that swing politically from center left to center right every few years.\n\nThese are, however, anything but normal times and the second-term Trump team anything but center-rightists. They are extremists bent on dismantling the federal government, unstitching the fabric of international law, and turning up the heat drastically on an already dangerously overcooking planet.\n\nIn 2020, I raised the possibility of a boycott, divestment, and sanction (BDS) movement against the United States if Trump won the elections that year. \"People of the world, you'd better build your BDS box, paint 'Break Glass in Case of Emergency' on the front, and stand next to it on November 3,\" I wrote then. \"If Trump wins on Election Day, it will be mourning in America. But let's hope that the world doesn't mourn: it organizes.\"\n\nFour years later, Trump has won again. Do I hear the sound of breaking glass?\n\nHere, in the United States, a stance of strict nonengagement with Trump 2.0, even where interests overlap, would not only be a good moral policy but even make political sense. When things go disastrously south, laws are broken, and the government begins to truly come apart at the seams, it's vitally important that no left-of-center fingerprints be found at the scene of the crime.\n\nLet's be clear: The Trump administration will not be playing by the rules of normal politics. So, forget about bipartisanship. Forget about preserving access to power by visiting Mar-a-Lago, hat in hand, like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or the hosts of MSNBC's Morning Joe . \"Fascism can be defeated,\" historian Timothy Snyder wrote immediately after the November elections, \"but not when we are on its side.\"\n\nSo, my dear liberal-left, which side are you on?\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Activate your online access\n\nAs RFK Jr. shows, it's not just Republicans pushing anti-vax conspiracies. That's why the White House needs to take this issue much more seriously.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks at a Hispanic Heritage Month event at Wilshire Ebell Theatre on September 15, 2023, in Los Angeles.\n\nFor many readers of The Nation , skepticism about-or outright refusal to consider getting-a Covid-19 vaccine may seem like a phenomenon only found among Donald Trump's diehard MAGA fans. To some extent, that's accurate; polling suggests that Republicans are far more resistant to considering getting the Covid jab than other groups.\n\nBut historically, three things have generally been true about vaccines in the United States. Most Americans have long seen routine immunizations as beneficial. Most have also supported requiring children to get these shots before attending school. Yet there has always been a persistent minority of vaccine skeptics in this country-and it's not as easy to find a clear partisan divide among that group. To put it another way: Liberals can be anti-vaxxers too.\n\nWhile Democrats have remained relatively supportive of Covid-19 vaccination, the rise of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is proving that anti-vaccine sentiment has a lingering allure for some liberals and progressives in this country.\n\nJust in case it was unclear, let's repeat some basic truths. Vaccines are safe. They save lives. The Covid-19 vaccines in particular have saved millions of lives and prevented millions more hospitalizations. They are remarkably safe .\n\nIf there is a true scandal about Covid-19 vaccines, it's that 2.2 billion people remain unvaccinated around the world because the greedy pharmaceutical companies (often with the support of powerful governments) have forced poorer countries into unfair, predatory contracts rather than allow them to manufacture the vaccines at a lower cost.\n\nRFK Jr. has been trying to obscure the truth about vaccines since at least 2005 , peddling pseudoscience and conspiracy theories to anyone who will listen. It would be tempting to write him and his ilk off as cranks. But we ignore them at our peril.\n\nFirst, we have a large part of the Republican Party in lockstep against vaccination. Ron DeSantis may be the denialist in chief, but others are right behind him in their craven embrace of anti-vaccination policies. Second, RFK Jr. has some powerful allies in tech and finance-and when you're a Kennedy and you say you're running for president, you have a platform built into your patrimony to reach millions.\n\nThis makes 2023 a banner year for the anti-vax movement, with liberals, conservatives, libertarians, and big money coming together in a potent and toxic coalition.\n\nWhether the new Covid vaccine is useful to those already fully vaccinated and boosted and not affected by other factors that enhance the risk for serious disease is open for debate; most likely, there will be a small boost in protection for us . However, for the millions who have never had a full series of the original vaccine or any of the subsequent boosters, it could keep them out of the hospital, and for some it will be life-saving. Even if these individuals have had Covid, the immunity conferred by previous infections wanes, and relying on an infection as a way to prevent subsequent ones risks both acute and chronic complications of the disease. Getting vaccinated is a way to protect oneself safely without the dangers catching Covid entails.\n\nRFK Jr. is also dangerous because we are living in a country that has doubled and tripled down on a vaccine-only approach to the pandemic, making a commitment to these millions of under-vaccinated individuals especially critical. The Bridge Access Program of the Department of Health and Human Services is an important step forward in making these tools free to those who need them, but we need more than that. Yet, as Politico reports , the White House has been flummoxed by the rise of the anti-vaccine movement, and furthermore sees any new substantial focus on promoting vaccination as politically unviable, even as anti-vax sentiment now is starting to increase opposition to the standard childhood vaccines for other infections, risking progress not only on Covid but also dreaded diseases of the past.\n\nA decade and a half ago, candidate Barack Obama adopted the farm labor movement cry of ¡Sí se puede! -yes, we can-as his campaign slogan. The Biden administration at this moment in history seems to be in a no, no se podemos mood. The Politico article starkly framed the White House's policy with a quote from the inside on its approach to the attacks on the central feature of their Covid response: \"'There's a real challenge here,' said one senior official who's worked on the Covid response and was granted anonymity to speak candidly. 'But they keep just hoping it'll go away.'\" But, of course, RFK Jr. and Ron DeSantis are not going anywhere. Nor are the well-funded campaigns to spread misinformation and lies about vaccines. What we're left with again and again is a White House that gives up on basic public health principles as a matter of political expediency.\n\nIt's as if the only trick this administration knows when the going gets tough is to get horizontal, to roll over and play dead. Winter is on its way. Covid is surging . Flu and RSV are waiting in the wings. New outbreaks of childhood diseases -like whooping cough and measles-that we once thought vanquished are popping up around the country. Even polio appears to have gained a foothold in at least one community in 2022. We need the White House to stand up and provide leadership and stop whining about how hard it is to do the right thing in this political climate. Failure is not an option, because if President Biden leaves a political void around vaccines, the RFK Jrs. among us will happily fill it-and the consequences will be dire.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Trump asked Representative Mike Waltz, a retired Green Beret known for promoting the coldest of wars with China, to be his national security adviser. He also named Marco Rubio-another Florida Republican and one of the most trigger-happy options Trump could have picked-as his secretary of state.\n\nAnd what do you know? The liberal establishment is thrilled.\n\nThe American foreign policy elite, and many mainstream Democrats, immediately lined up to hail Trump's selection of Rubio, who holds hard-line views on Iran, China, Venezuela, and, in particular, Cuba. Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman was the first Democrat to express his support for Rubio's confirmation. \"Unsurprisingly, the other team's pick will have political differences than my own,\" Fetterman said in a post on X. \"That being said, my colleague @SenMarcoRubio is a strong choice and I look forward to voting for his confirmation.\" According to NBC News, some Democrats in Congress admit that they are \"pleasantly surprised\" by the \"caliber\" of some of Trump's picks, including Rubio.\n\nOne Democrat, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, didn't even try to contain his excitement. In an interview with NOTUS , Booker boasted about his friendship with Rubio. \"First of all, Marco Rubio is my friend ,\" Booker said. \"We've developed, over my 10 years here, a really good friendship. He is principled.\"\n\n\"I'm just happy for him and his family,\" he added. \"We're going to have hearings and I'm going to get a chance to talk to him. He has an understanding of foreign policy's nuances and complexities.\"\n\nArizona Senator Mark Kelly also praised his Republican colleague, saying Rubio's \"got a pretty good understanding of the threats we face.\"\n\nLiberal media elites were similarly jazzed. Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic , resurfaced a 2015 interview he conducted with Rubio, noting that \"you can see evidence of his consistently hardline approach to Iran.\" The new Trump cabinet, he added, \"could become a real nightmare for Tehran.\"\n\nPolitical scientist Ian Bremmer said Rubio and Waltz are \"serious\" and \"credible on foreign policy,\" adding that US allies around the world are \"feeling more comfortable with both of these announcements.\"\n\nThis euphoria may be nausea-inducing, but it shouldn't be too surprising. After all, to most mainstream US foreign policy figures and thinkers, a \"serious and credible\" foreign policy is one that reflects a commitment to maintaining US military and economic dominance over the planet. By that metric, Rubio is a splendid choice. He has never met a war he didn't love.\n\nDuring his first Senate run in 2010, Rubio defended the invasion of Iraq, long after most people had identified it as a catastrophe. As a member of Congress, he led the failed US effort to overthrow Venezuela's president, was a key Senate supporter of a \"maximum pressure\" Iran policy, and opposed withdrawing the United States from Syria and Afghanistan in 2019 when Trump was thinking about getting out. \"Now people may say what's wrong with this? Get out of Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, why are we fighting other people's wars?\" he said in a floor speech. \"We're not. This is not other people's wars. This is ours.\"\n\nSimilarly, Waltz has a long record of wanting to escalate conflicts that Trump himself has professed a desire to pull out of, like Afghanistan and Ukraine. In Congress, Waltz cosponsored legislation to pre-authorize war with China over Taiwan, voted against ending US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, and voted in favor of keeping the 2002 Iraq authorization for the use of military force.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump had a hostile approach to Iran and China, led sweeping sanctions campaigns, threatened nuclear war with North Korea, and much more. He was hard to pin down-making promises or somewhat vague plans on foreign policy issues, only to undermine himself or abruptly blow up the process.\n\nThis time around, Trump decided to ramp up the anti-war rhetoric on the campaign trail. While Kamala Harris spent the final weeks of the race campaigning with Liz Cheney, Trump was making the case that a Harris presidency would get us into World War III. Harris made the baffling decision to send campaign surrogates like Bill Clinton and Representative Ritchie Torres, a staunch zionist, to majority Arab-American precincts in Michigan. But Trump visited Dearborn in the last days of the race, declaring , \"You're going to have peace in the Middle East-but not with the clowns that you have running the U.S. right now.\" He also promised to end the war in Ukraine and appeared skeptical of defending Taiwan from China.\n\nAmericans are more tired of war than ever before and desperate for some kind of opposition to the US's bloodthirsty foreign policy-even if it comes in the form of these haphazard promises. Though Trump is not anti-war in any real ideological or moral terms, he has shown that he at least seems to understand the political downsides of protracted military engagements. Many of his most hawkish decisions were confined to quick actions, whether it was the brutal annihilation of the ISIS caliphate (and the civilians living there) or the assassination of top Iranian general Qassim Suleimani.\n\nThis is not the approach of the US foreign policy elite-which is why it's so telling that Rubio's selection in particular has been met with such praise. The Blob believes the United States needs a long-term military effort to try to contain China or potentially draw it into a conflict, even though these prolonged battles are politically unpopular. When liberal lawmakers like Booker or Fetterman are relieved about Rubio and Waltz's joining the cabinet, it's because they're relieved that there will be someone in the room who will be holding firm to the US's dedication to endless wars. When Rubio meets with outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Blinken-whose tenure has been as blood-soaked as anyone's-will no doubt express the same gratitude.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / Vincent Bevins\n\nJeet Heer\n\nHowever, Trump's decision to tap former representative Tulsi Gabbard as his director of national intelligence and Matt Gaetz as attorney general has the potential to create unpredictable dynamics if both are confirmed. Gabbard and Gaetz are controversial figures who have also been outspoken critics of US military intervention abroad, mass surveillance, and forever wars.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine more concerted opposition to the Rubio wing coming from within Trump's own cabinet, rather than from his ostensible political rivals. Democrats' embrace of his national security team reveals how little daylight exists between the most hawkish Republicans and so-called national security liberals. The future of Trump's foreign policy could be determined by who wins the fight for his favor:  the heterodox anti-intervention forces in his administration, or Rubio and his cross-party allies within Congress, Washington, and the wider Blob.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

A week before his 2009 inauguration, President-elect Barack Obama chose as his first high-profile social engagement a dinner party at George Will's house, where he was joined by William Kristol, Charles Krauthammer and David Brooks. Obama no doubt intended to demonstrate his desire to reach across the ideological divide and engage his neoconservative critics in a healthy debate. Conservatives saw a president they could roll. Part of the problem was Obama's misplaced confidence that he could heal the divisions forged in the Bush era. A second complication arose from his unique position as the first African-American president. But the fundamental problem was a much deeper one that, in retrospect, has come to define US politics in the Obama era and remains the greatest obstacle to liberal progress. The primary difference between liberalism and conservatism, at least in theory, is that the latter is an ideology and the former isn't. Conservatism, as Milton Friedman argued, posits that \"freedom in economic arrangements is itself a component of freedom broadly understood, so economic freedom is an end in itself.\" Liberalism, however, as Lionel Trilling observed, \"is a large tendency rather than a concise body of doctrine.\" And while John Kenneth Galbraith helpfully pointed out that only those programs and policies that honor \"the emancipation of belief\" are worthy of the term, liberalism, at bottom, is pragmatism. Conservatives desire low taxes and small government because this is how they define freedom. They like to pretend that liberals prefer the opposite in both cases, but the truth is that liberals are OK with whatever works. Our political dysfunction has many sources, but one way to describe our problem is this: we have allowed conservatives to define the terms of debate at a time when conservatives have lost all sense of moral, intellectual and especially practical responsibility. In The Liberal Imagination , Trilling famously complained that he could find \"no conservative or reactionary ideas in general circulation.\" What we had instead were \"irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.\" Conservatives subsequently invested a great deal of money to address this problem, and the result was the rise of a bevy of right-wing intellectuals-Friedman, James Q. Wilson, Alan Bloom and Gertrude Himmelfarb among them-able to offer arguments that liberals ignored at their peril.

Will, undoubtedly America's most prominent conservative intellectual, thinks that rape victims enjoy their \"privileges,\" that Ebola can be spread through the air, and that global warming is a hoax. Faced with the fact that 97 percent of climatologists have formed a scientific consensus about man-made climate change, he responded, \"Where did that figure come from? They pluck these things from the ether\"-as if his own purposeful ignorance were a counter to empirical data. Conservative \"wise man\" Bill Kristol has achieved this status by proving himself, time and again, to be the worst predictor in the history of the punditocracy. Kristol recently summed up his political philosophy in a debate about US policy in the Middle East with Laura Ingraham-herself a symbol of the decline of conservative thought-by asking, \"What's the harm of bombing them at least for a few weeks and seeing what happens?\" Charles Krauthammer's analyses evince a similarly reflexive belligerence, while David Brooks, believe it or not, is too liberal to qualify. Why do such smart guys say such stupid things? The answer lies in the locus of power in today's conservative movement. The Koch brothers make billions off the exploitation of carbon-producing fossil fuels, while donating more than $67 million to groups that deny the destruction it causes. This is to say nothing of the nearly $900 million they plan to raise for the Republican presidential nominee in 2016. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who handed out $150 million to the Republicans and related groups during the 2012 election cycle, believes the United States should drop an atomic bomb in the Iranian desert and say: \"See! The next one is in the middle of Tehran.\" Media mogul Rupert Murdoch thinks all the world's Muslims should be \"held responsible\" for \"their growing jihadist cancer.\" His networks and newspapers spread the idiotic calumny that the president is a secret Muslim and an undocumented alien who hates all white people (including, apparently, his own mother). Today's conservative intellectuals aren't even bothering to offer \"irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.\" Instead, they're making calculated attempts to undermine our democracy, exploiting and manipulating a public that has decreasing resources for the kind of reliable information that would lead to a pragmatic \"liberal\" response. It's time we woke up to that reality while we still have a country-and a planet-left to save.\n\nA week before his 2009 inauguration, President-elect Barack Obama chose as his first high-profile social engagement a dinner party at George Will's house, where he was joined by William Kristol, Charles Krauthammer and David Brooks.

Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who handed out $150 million to the Republicans and related groups during the 2012 election cycle, believes the United States should drop an atomic bomb in the Iranian desert and say: \"See!

Today's conservative intellectuals aren't even bothering to offer \"irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.\" Instead, they're making calculated attempts to undermine our democracy, exploiting and manipulating a public that has decreasing resources for the kind of reliable information that would lead to a pragmatic \"liberal\" response. It's time we woke up to that reality while we still have a country-and a planet-left to save.\n\nPart of the problem was Obama's misplaced confidence that he could heal the divisions forged in the Bush era. A second complication arose from his unique position as the first African-American president. But the fundamental problem was a much deeper one that, in retrospect, has come to define US politics in the Obama era and remains the greatest obstacle to liberal progress. The primary difference between liberalism and conservatism, at least in theory, is that the latter is an ideology and the former isn't. Conservatism, as Milton Friedman argued, posits that \"freedom in economic arrangements is itself a component of freedom broadly understood, so economic freedom is an end in itself.\" Liberalism, however, as Lionel Trilling observed, \"is a large tendency rather than a concise body of doctrine.\" And while John Kenneth Galbraith helpfully pointed out that only those programs and policies that honor \"the emancipation of belief\" are worthy of the term, liberalism, at bottom, is pragmatism. Conservatives desire low taxes and small government because this is how they define freedom. They like to pretend that liberals prefer the opposite in both cases, but the truth is that liberals are OK with whatever works. Our political dysfunction has many sources, but one way to describe our problem is this: we have allowed conservatives to define the terms of debate at a time when conservatives have lost all sense of moral, intellectual and especially practical responsibility.

Activate your online access\n\nA conversation with Samuel Moyn about the Cold War's profound and negative influence on the liberal worldview and his new book, Liberalism Against Itself .\n\nBefore the First World War, to be a liberal typically meant defending universal values and rationalism. Liberals had an optimistic view of human nature and believed in historical progress. The Second World War, the rise of facism, and the mobilization of a global military force to combat Nazism dealt a serious blow to this view. In its aftermath, new threats emerged in the form of Stalin's Soviet Union, Mao's China, and panic over the prospects of communism spreading around the globe. If liberalism had any chance of surviving, it would need to become more aggressive in its defense of freedom against the specter of communism. To the famous Cold War liberal intellectuals, liberal democracy was not predestined to succeed; it was fragile and in need of vigilant protection.\n\nIn his new book, Liberalism Against Itself , the Yale historian Samuel Moyn argues that at the very center of Cold War liberalism is a politics of fear-a fear that freedom might collapse into tyranny if a robust security state did not contain rival world powers. By examining the writings of Hannah Arendt, Judith Shklar, Gertrude Himmelfarb, Lionel Trilling, Karl Popper, and Isaiah Berlin, Moyn shows how Cold War liberalism turned against its 19th-century predecessor by morphing into a security doctrine rooted in this politics of fear. It's therefore little wonder, Moyn argues, that Cold War liberalism is experiencing a revival today, given liberal anxieties over a new cold war with China, calls for NATO expansion due to the war in Ukraine, and fears of growing domestic fascism. The Nation spoke with Moyn about the major lessons of his new book. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n-Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nDaniel Steinmetz-Jenkins: Do you have a working definition of \"Cold War liberalism\"?\n\nSamuel Moyn: Liberalism is a conversation that we cannot understand as a set of defining commitments once and for all time. All liberals past and future care about freedom, for example, but they defend it in radically different ways and often prioritize other values. For that reason, I focus on how liberals in the mid-20th century blew up one canon and built another. In his own time, John Locke had not been a liberal (or been seen as one for centuries), while the breakthrough of the French Revolution made self-conscious liberalism possible. In the memory of the 20th century, Locke was retroactively anointed the father of the tradition, and not for the reasons he had once mattered to Americans-justifying armed insurrection or Native expropriation. Meanwhile, the French Revolution was purged from liberal sources merely because the Soviet Union claimed its legacy too.\n\nBefore then, liberalism had actually learned a lot from Marxist pressure to be more egalitarian and attentive to the broadest conditions of freedom, long relying on government to serve diverse ends and not obsessed by the threat of the state's expansion or tyranny. But even while liberal politicians were building their own welfare states in practice, Cold War liberal theorists like Isaiah Berlin crafted an anti-Soviet form of the creed that relinquished much that had made liberalism more credible and progressive. This was a catastrophe, especially in the long run.\n\nDSJ: How is Cold War liberalism a deviation from its earlier predecessor? You point out, for instance, that much of 19th-century liberalism promoted laissez-faire economics and was inseparable from European imperialism. Are you saying that this tradition offers better resources for the challenges of today's world than Cold War liberalism?\n\nSM: Emphasizing the mutation of liberalism in the middle of the 20th century naturally raises the possibility that there are better things to find and recover in its past, given how its present is working out. This doesn't mean the book calls for a return to the 19th century. However, I do identify three features of that earlier liberalism worth reclaiming: its insistence on a highest good in life, as the first and main emancipatory political framework of modern politics; its commitment to some story of emancipation in history, orienting us between a past of less freedom and a future of more; and its agreement with Marxism that the conditions for the enjoyment of freedom and rights matter much more than their formal or legal annunciation. As you say, liberalism has always been haunted by its apology for the free market, but the Cold War liberals failed to defend the expansion of the state and the politics of redistribution that climaxed during their own lives. And while 19th-century liberals were often apologists for empire and all its violence, at least they had a program that was global in scale, in purporting to spread \"civilization.\" Early Cold War liberals, by contrast, treated \"the West\" as a kind of last redoubt of liberty, assuming global and non-white emancipation was a lost cause. Isn't that worse?\n\nDSJ: Usually, when we think of the Cold War liberal intellectuals, men are typically listed: Reinhold Niebuhr, Isaiah Berlin, Karl Popper, Raymond Aron, and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. With the exception of Berlin and Popper, however, you have assembled a different set that includes three women-namely, Hannah Arendt, Gertrude Himmelfarb, and Judith Shklar. You also have a chapter on Lionel Trilling. Why the different cast of characters?\n\nSM: I selected them to illustrate certain neglected perspectives on Cold War liberalism, and to give women their due as pivotal thinkers. They helped me build that story of deaccessioning prior liberal resources in order to seek new ones-like Christianity or psychoanalysis. Some are valuable for thinking through the Jewish background of the Cold War liberals or their global politics. All of them combine to illuminate how the priorities of Cold War liberalism shifted. It wasn't just a matter of a changing mood for liberalism, but one of abandoning past commitments in the presence of the Soviet foe in order to strip liberalism down to the defense of liberty.\n\nDSJ: Let's talk about the relationship between Cold War liberalism and neoliberalism via your chapter on the political philosopher and essayist Isaiah Berlin. He, of course, made a famous distinction between what he called \"positive\" and \"negative\" liberty. He argued that there must be some sphere in society in which individuals have the freedom of choice to make uncoerced decisions, an area of noninterference that he called \"negative liberty.\" And, on the contrary, he associated \"positive liberty\" with Soviet communists, \"utopians,\" and \"fanatics,\" as they promoted interfering in the lives of individuals in the name of achieving a deeper sense of freedom. Berlin's \"negative liberty\" certainly involved a defense of the free market. But he and his defenders have denied, however, that this amounts to a defense of neoliberalism, which has done so much to undermine the welfare state. Are they right? More generally, do you see a natural affinity between Cold War liberalism and neoliberalism?\n\nSM: I think it would be boring, not to mention mistaken, to approach thinkers in terms of their arguments alone. Berlin never did when writing the history of ideas himself. His essay on the two kinds of liberty was supposed to distinguish rather than endorse-but in real time, everyone understood that Berlin was championing liberty as noninterference from the state against the fraught and risky politics of self-realization that canonical earlier liberals like J.S. Mill and Alexis de Tocqueville believed in. It is true that Berlin was no neoliberal-though he was clearer about this point before and after the Cold War than during it. On the other hand, the Cold War liberals' failure to theorize social freedom through the state-of the very kind that liberals in practice were building during the only egalitarian and redistributive era in their history-was fateful. The overlap in theory between Berlin's libertarian posture and the neoliberal posture was enormous, and their hostility to the same earlier liberal traditions that revolved around statist progress was also shared in common. Neoliberalism came into being for lots of reasons, but Cold War liberalism left liberals out of position to defend against it.\n\nDSJ: Whereas many Cold War liberals and their descendants have claimed they reject neoliberalism, it's undeniable that many of them became integral to the neoconservative movement that found its voice with Ronald Reagan's election and reached its peak powers with George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq. You address the relationship between neoconservativism and Cold War liberalism in your chapter on the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb. How does what you describe as her \"Jewish Christianity\" prove key for understanding the relationship between the two?\n\nSM: Cold War liberalism and neoconservatism were not the same, but the one could lead to the other. Ironically, when Himmelfarb revived interest in the earlier Catholic liberal Lord Acton in the 1950s, she disputed Friedrich Hayek's appropriation of the same sage. (Hayek had once planned to call the Mont Pelerin Society the \"Acton-Tocqueville Society,\" before friends changed his mind.) She registered that Acton had even evolved into socialism in his later career. But because she used Acton to contest the legacy of the forms of 19th-century liberalism that the Cold War liberals repudiated-especially by emphasizing the murderous threat of state power and the role of Christianity in supposedly warding that threat off-Himmelfarb was a hair's breadth from neoconservatism from the beginning. She soon invented it, deserving as much of the blame as her husband, Irving Kristol, does. Without mentioning Himmelfarb, Melinda Cooper has brilliantly shown that Great Society liberalism was foiled by a radioactive brew of Christian morality for families and government rollback for markets.\n\nDSJ: The subject of race and Cold War liberalism is broached in your chapter on Hannah Arendt. Given the Trump presidency and the growing concerns over white supremacy and fascism, there has been a revival of interest in her famous book The Origins of Totalitarianism . Yet you say that she actually promoted \"white freedom.\" What do you mean by this?\n\nSM: Lots of scholars have already powerfully shown that Arendt's thought is haunted by a civilizational and more or less \"white\" understanding of freedom. Arendt lionized the American Revolution without mentioning slavery or the Haitian Revolution and then attacked the civil rights movement in her own time. I attempt to add that Arendt voiced a Cold War liberal skepticism about the global decolonization of the non-white world-the most emancipatory event of her time, and possibly of all time. It is the height of irony that Arendt, like the Cold War liberals with whom she fellow-traveled, so disdained global decolonization-apparently because they did not believe that non-white freedom was possible. Arendt, with her short-lived Zionism, also suggests that Cold War liberals could rescue earlier traditions of liberalism and tolerate its nationalistic and violent sides when it came to their fellow Jews in the Middle East. Zionism, it turns out, was the most Jewish thing about Cold War liberalism. But it also begs the question of why Cold War liberals were so libertarian at home and skeptical about other forms of popular self-emancipation on a global scale.\n\nDSJ: Let's turn to the present. What would you say to liberals today who believe it would be foolish to abandon the heritage of Cold War liberalism, given a new age of supposed fascist extremes?\n\nSM: Cold War liberalism reaps what it sows. It destroyed the potential of liberalism to be more believable and uplifting to enough people. It refused popular mobilization, even for liberal ends, building up the powers of the Supreme Court that reactionaries could and then did set out to capture for their own ends. Cold War liberalism turns out not to save liberalism from crisis, but to expose liberalism to permanent crisis. Why not try something else? You can fight fascism-Franklin Roosevelt did-without missing the chance, possibly the last one, to make liberalism credible. Some of the constant stream of enemies against whom Cold War liberals mobilize (communists, terrorists, populists, etc.) have to be made friends if liberalism is to survive. But there is an even more important reason to challenge and overcome what Cold War liberals did to their own tradition: It is about constructing a politics of hope. Liberalism ought to be restored as the philosophy of emancipation it should have been.\n\nDSJ: Supposedly, the neoliberal era is now fading away, even as pundits and scholars remain somewhat dumbfounded as to what is replacing it. Of course, some want to frame the Chinese-US rivalry and the Russia-Ukraine War in a Cold War light. I assume that you find this way of seeing things misguided. Why exactly?\n\nSM: Cold War restorationism after the Cold War has always been an appealing option, and it is not new. Since 1989, neoconservatives have championed it, and many liberal internationalists have done so too. By illegally invading Ukraine, Vladimir Putin-though he helms a second-rate power relative to the Soviet threat of old-has given Cold War liberal breviaries new currency. So has the bizarre decision of liberals to follow Donald Trump, whom they otherwise hate, into an elective confrontation with China. Only a few years ago, the credibility of Cold War liberalism was faltering because of the power of millennial critiques of capitalism and popular exhaustion with endless war. But I believe it will falter again, because Cold War liberalism's history shows that it does not have the ideas or the tools to overcome the very crises that its fans believe demand its perpetuation.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

One of the curiosities of Trump's worldview is that he regards traditional American allies as exploiters of the United States who deserve punishment: hence his trade wars against Canada, Mexico, and Europe, as well as his calls for Canada, Greenland, and Panama to be absorbed by the United States. This has been a boon to center-left parties that, previously facing right-wing populist insurgencies, now have the opportunity to recast themselves as defenders of the national patrimony.\n\nCanada is a particularly striking case. Until recently, the Liberal Party, which has governed since 2015 under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, was facing an electoral trouncing in the upcoming election. A decade in power had taken the sheen off Trudeau's boyish charm, with the lingering traumas of Covid disruption and inflation demoralizing Liberal Party voters and making swing voters receptive for a change. The Conservative Party of Canada (CPC), under the deft leadership of Pierre Poilievre, a whip-smart anti-woke troll in the manner of JD Vance, had crafted a powerful anti-system message : \"Canada is broken.\"\n\nBut once Trump started saying Canada has no reason to exist as a separate nation and should become the 51st state, the entire dynamic of Canadian politics was transformed. Broken or not, Canada had to be defended. And the Liberals were in a much better position to present themselves as the party of national unity in a crisis than the insurgent Conservatives, the social-democratic New Democratic Party (or NDP), or the separatist Bloc Québécois. Having governed for 70 years in the 20th century, the Liberals are known as Canada's \"natural governing party\"-the perfect party to rally behind in a crisis.\n\nOn February 19, after a quick party leadership race, the Liberals switched out Trudeau for a new leader, former banker Mark Carney, who embraced the mantle of being a national unity leader. During the turmoil, the Liberals have enjoyed a historic polling surge. As recently as January 20, the day of Trump's inauguration, the CPC enjoyed a massive lead over the Liberals: 44.8 percent to 21.9 percent according to the polling aggregator of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Since then, the polls have been upended, with Liberals leading, with 37.8 to 37.2 for the CPC. This improvement by the Liberals is largely driven by the collapse of support for the NDP and Bloc Québécois. The NDP had effectively been a junior partner to the Liberals since 2021, which saw the Liberals falling short of majority status and needing bolstering in Parliament. But the Trump threat undermined the NDP's claim that it deserved to be rewarded for pushing the Liberals to the left on policies like extending dental care.\n\nLeft-of-center voters, fearing Trump and thinking the CPC was too Trumpist for comfort, have rallied to the Liberal banner. The closeness of the current polling is deceptive, because support for the CPC is thick in rural areas and Western Canada, while the Liberals enjoy an enviable spread across the country that gives their votes more \"efficiency\" (to use the jargon of political science).\n\nGiven the polling surge and  current mood of anti-Trump Canadian nationalism, it wasn't surprising that on Sunday Carney called a snap election , to be held on April 28. The Liberals have good reason to expect a majority government, although given the briskness of Canadian election campaigns an upset can't be ruled out.\n\nBut winning elections is only part of politics; governing is equally crucial. While I don't doubt that the Liberals have an excellent shot of winning the election, my fear is that Carney's politics of centrist unity will fail to turn nationalist passion into policies that solve deep seated social and economic problems.\n\nInstead, Carney is likely to continue with the neoliberal weakening of state capacity which will make Canada vulnerable both to internal right-wing populism and also to attacks from Trump's expansionist agenda. In some ways, Carney is the Canadian version of Joe Biden in 2020: the safe placeholder candidate who promises a return to normality in troubled times. But just as Biden proved unable to master the moment, there is every reason to dread that Carney's politics of ancien régime restoration will simply delay the triumph of the far right.\n\nCarney is in every cell of his body a neoliberal technocrat-albeit a neoliberal who presents himself as possessing an enlightened social conscience. Born in 1965, Carney studied at Harvard and Oxford before working as for 13 years as a consultant for Goldman Sachs. In 2003 he joined the Bank of Canada and held a variety of government posts. In 2007, he became governor of the Bank of Canada. He went on to become governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020. Then he became vice chairman of the Brookfield corporation , a multinational valued at nearly $1 trillion (its New York holdings include Brookfield Place).\n\nGiven this background, it's not surprising that Carney's earliest moves involving making the Liberal Party, already not a firebrand party, even more centrist. His first act as prime minister was to remove the consumer carbon tax that he had previously supported as a market-friendly climate change solution. Then Carney canceled a proposed hike in the capital gains inclusion rate. Both these moves are sops to conservative voters, with the cancellation of the capital gains hike overwhelmingly benefiting rich taxpayers.\n\nWriting in Canadian Dimensions , James Hardwick noted that Carney, in his 2021 book , Value(s): Building a Better World for All , acknowledges major problems like climate change and economic inequality but insists that they can be solved by technocratic tinkering and improved social consciousness. Carney in his manifesto writes that \"individuals and their firms must rediscover their sense of solidarity and responsibility for the system. More broadly, by rebasing valuation on society's values, we can create platforms of prosperity.\"\n\nAs Hardwick observes, they lofty sentiments hardly address the scale of the problems facing Canada and the world:\n\nThis is the core of his vision for a better world. He sincerely believes it is possible to create an ethically responsible brand of neoliberalism.\n\nUltimately, Carney has no interest in challenging the power of corporate oligarchy; instead, he wants to use market incentives to encourage oligarchs to act in a pro-social fashion. He believes the excesses of capitalism can be reined in by creating the right measures and metrics and benchmarks.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nFeature / Jess McAllen\n\nElie Mystal\n\nOn Substack, the journalist Luke Savage provides an equally devastating analysis of the massive discrepancy between the current world crisis (a crisis that Carney understands as well as anyone) and his anemic solutions:\n\nLacking a serious analysis of power and simultaneously operating within the boundaries of the very system he is supposedly critiquing, Carney in turn leaves us with prescriptions that are both hazy and unsatisfying. Some moral persuasion here, a more ethically-conscious business class there, a few minor adjustments in state regulation, and-alakazam!-a kinder, gentler global capitalism awaits.\n\nTo get a feel for just how inadequate Carney's alternative to Trumpism is, it is worth watching an ad he posted on Saturday featuring the comedian Mike Myers. In the ad, Carney and Myers, both wearing patriotic hockey shirts, meet up in an ice rink and watch a hockey game. Carney quizzes Myers-Canadian-born, but currently a resident of the United States-about various aspects of Canadian popular culture. They banter about the children's show Mr. Dressup (which featured the puppets Casey and Finnegan), the rock band The Tragically Hip, and the Stompin' Tom Connor song \" Bud the Spud .\"\n\nFor Anglo-Canadians of a particular generation (40 and older) this ad is a wonderful trip down memory lane. It was much praised on social media . But the pop culture references in the ad will have little resonance to young people ( Mr. Dressup , Canada's counterpart to Mr. Rogers , last appeared on television in 1996), nor among many immigrants to Canada, nor among French-Canadians.\n\nIt's not just the narrow reach of the ad that is the problem. Carney's nationalism is nostalgic and bloodless. Early incarnations of Canadian nationalism have always involved robust collective state projects: the continent-spanning railway line of the 19 century, the creation of a national healthcare system, the bolstering of support for Canadian culture via a national broadcaster, the promotion of national bilingualism.\n\nIn the current crisis, economic turmoil might require similarly bold policies. A more visionary nationalism might push for strengthening our alliances with Mexico and the other nations of this hemisphere aside from the USA, bolstering our population by programs to recruit disaffected Americans, investing in high-speed rail and rebuilding our fraying healthcare system. As a neoliberal, Carney refuses to exercise the policy imagination the moment requires. Trump is a genuine fascist threat inside America who is also menacing Canada with talk of annexation. By doubting the reality of Canadian sovereignty and the security of its borders, Trump talks of his northern neighbor the same way Vladimir Putin speaks about Ukraine or Benjamin Netanyahu speaks about Gaza and the West Bank. A threat of this magnitude requires a fighting spirit, not a nostalgic one. You can't fight fascism by conjuring up memories of the TV puppets you loved as a child.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Activate your online access\n\nA HBO documentary series helmed by Lawrence Wright unknowingly paints a picture of a state incapable of understanding how radically it has changed since its hard-right turn.\n\nA distinguished writer sits in an East Texas diner, chatting with the director Richard Linklater: They shake hands with locals and talk about Linklater's family, the prison system, and the curious \"oppositional personality\" of radicals. Now, the writer is speaking in a museum gallery, his hands folded in his lap, explaining Texas's relationship to slavery: While images play of Black people in cotton fields, he says that the \"labor-intensive process\" created an \"investment\" in keeping slaves. Later, we see the same writer gazing at the commercial traffic flowing through the US-Mexico border, his graying eyebrows knitted in concern.\n\nThis man is Lawrence Wright, a longtime member of Texas's liberal intelligentsia who was recently designated with the role of guiding voice. Billed as the gimlet-eyed chronicler of Texas's influence, Wright translates and explains the complexities of the state for a national audience from his perch at The New Yorker . This role came to fruition with his 2018 book, God Save Texas , a semi-memoir that hopscotched through the state's history and present (from Spanish colonization and slavery to NAFTA and Donald Trump) to discern what draws people here and what gets them to stay. \"Texas is a part of almost everything in modern America,\" he writes, \"the South, the West, the Plains, Hispanic and immigrant communities, the border, the divide between rural areas and the cities-what happens here tends to disproportionately affect the rest of the nation.\" It's a big claim, but we like it that way. All politics is local, after all, but we're Texas .\n\nIn Wright's view, Texas has \"nurtured an immature political culture that has done terrible damage to the state and to the nation.\" Hard to argue with that. Ruled by Republicans since 1994, Texas has wiped away any remnants of the New Deal order, replacing it with a gutted social safety net, an expansive prison system, deepening inequality, and an ever-more-authoritarian conservatism. Riding a wave of anti-\"globalist\" populism while reaping the rewards of the international economy, the icons of Texas's hard-right turn-people like Governor Greg Abbott and Senator Ted Cruz-have grown increasingly unrecognizable to the liberals who believed that Ann Richards, the state's last Democratic governor, was a sign that the long arc of history bent toward progress. (Never mind that Richards vocally supported NAFTA and prison expansion.) The epitaph on her tombstone, which Wright visits at the end of his book, is from her 1991 inaugural address, which reads: \"Today we have a vision of Texas where opportunity knows no race, no gender, no color-a glimpse of what can happen in government if we simply open the doors and let the people in.\" Ms. Richards, I have some bad news.\n\nHow to make sense of a place so renowned for its callousness today, let alone make a home here? This isn't a question with a single answer, particularly for liberals shocked by each new right-wing transgression. Books like God Save Texas are attempts to narrativize this sense of displacement, pinpointing what sin must be atoned for-or at least understood-before reconciliation and progress can begin again. Now, with the help of HBO, Wright-in his role as producer-has passed the question to three Texan directors: the Oscar-nominated Richard Linklater, the Emmy-nominated Alex Stapleton, and the indie documentarian Iliana Sosa, each of whom unearths some of the contradictions and myths foundational to their home state and their respective hometowns. They do so with Wright's assistance; he appears on-screen with them at various times, asking questions and providing insights. The resulting three-episode docuseries, also called God Save Texas , is as wounded, inept, and passive as one might expect of the cultural representatives of an unmoored movement incapable of responding effectively to the deepening crises at the state's core.\n\nHBO originally greenlighted a project titled God Save Texas as a drama series in 2014, with the screenplay to be written by Wright based on his 2005 play Sonny's Last Shot. Wright had toyed with the script's basic shape since Richards was in office. It follows Sonny Lamb, a moderate Republican state representative who breaks with his party on questions of gay rights and campaign-finance reform. (Last year, a representative did break with her party on questions of LGBTQ+ rights-only it was a Democrat joining Republicans to limit access to trans healthcare.) Eventually, HBO fell out of love with the drama idea and fired the executive on the series, at which point Wright contemplated turning Sonny's story into a \"musical podcast.\" Thankfully, that never came to pass. Instead, he wrote a novel-call it a fantasy- Mr. Texas , published last year.\n\n\" This is what politics is really like, \" Sonny thinks to himself in the novel. \"It wasn't about doing good, it was about being less awful.\" Mr. Texas is billed as a comedy, but melancholy informs Sonny's political maneuvering. As a moderate Republican, Sonny knows that \"he would probably get primaried by one of the Nazi youth the dominionists were so capable of producing\" and that he could \"never pass for a Dem. Independents didn't exist.\" For Wright, therein lies the problem: no moderating force, no enlightened center! (For further evidence of this tendency of his, consider Wright's recent chummy contribution to an article by Joe Nocera in The Free Press , Bari Weiss's right-wing rag, where-from his vantage as a \"Pulitzer Prize-winning\" quoted source-he joins a chorus of wealthy conservatives to croak about the rise in \"lawlessness\" in Austin, apparently because police felt \"alienated\" by the protests in 2020 following George Floyd's murder.) HBO may have discarded the fictional conceit in favor of a documentary when it revived the God Save Texas title, but the series inspired by Wright's work is similarly blinkered: captured by a myth about the value of patient, incremental liberal politics that should be dead many times over by now but still lumbers on, permitting the right to determine the bounds of Texas liberalism. Indeed, for many longtime Texas liberals, politics froze in the 1990s. The rest of the world has drifted a long way since then, and it will continue to drift so long as we reach for old answers that have ceased to apply to what ails the state-and the country-today.\n\nHuntsville is a small East Texas town with seven nearby prisons and thousands of prisoners, among whom nearly 1,000 death-row inmates have been murdered. It also inspired some of Linklater's films-\"mostly comedies,\" he says somewhat shamefully. Many of his friends growing up here have either worked at a prison or spent time behind bars. Linklater excels at demonstrating the casual cruelty here, contrasting the prison town's brutality with the rural community's charm.\n\nIn one scene in Linklater's episode of the HBO series, families wait under the shade of old oak trees for their loved ones to be released. One child among them, waiting for his dad, tells Linklater: \"I haven't really been able to play football with anybody, because, like, my grandma's not really into football.\" As one might expect from the director of Boyhood , Linklater has an eye for moments like these, imbued with emotion even if sometimes his subjects can't quite find the words to express all they feel. With nearly double the running time of the other two episodes, Linklater has more expanse to let his subjects speak for themselves. We see college students walking to class while a prison siren blares, learn of inmates giving guards and their families free haircuts, and follow a corps of correction officers drawn from a growing community of African immigrants in search of stable jobs.\n\nBut when it comes time to think out loud about what changes to the prison system we in Texas might aspire to, Linklater approaches the task self-consciously. No documentary requires its makers to provide a comprehensive list of reforms, but when a solution is offered, it's worth asking where it leads and how it has informed the film's argument up to that point. We meet several prison guards, but special attention is paid to Fred Allen, who was responsible for restraining at least 130 death-row inmates for their executions-around 10 percent of all the executions in Texas. Allen reached a point where he simply couldn't keep going. \"You ain't got a right to take nobody's life, period,\" he says, but Allen still hasn't budged on the prison system as a whole. His preferred alternative to death row is life without parole, \"because that's the worst sentence that an individual can have.\"\n\nThis is the point of view Linklater adopts. \"There are sentencing options like life without parole,\" he submits, almost pleadingly, near the end of the episode. Within the structure of the documentary, the death penalty once appeared to be the cruelest part of an impossibly cruel institution. By the end, it has become the only part of the system that, at least for Linklater, could possibly be reformed-and even that isn't guaranteed. It's as if he's already tempered his proposal, certain it will be shot down anyway. Taken on their own, the documentary's images could argue beyond this rather tepid conclusion, and yet Linklater's scope appears squeamishly limited. Considering the prison-industrial complex, he tells Wright, \"I guess, on one hand, it's a blessing-it's the local economy, largely-but it is a bit of a curse.\"\n\nThis is putting it lightly. Even if we ended the death penalty tomorrow, Texas's incarceration rate would still be among the highest in the world-never mind the \"accidental\" death toll in the state's prisons. A 2014 report from the Prison Justice League, a prisoner-rights group in Austin, found that in one Huntsville-area prison, disabled prisoners suffered high rates of physical and sexual abuse inflicted by correction officers. Just last summer, at least 41 inmates in Texas died during a heat wave, including a few in Huntsville (more than two-thirds of our prisons have no air-conditioning in most living areas).\n\nWhile court-sanctioned murder may be the most outwardly abhorrent piece of our criminal-justice system here in Texas, to remove it while saying little about the many other indignities we visit disproportionately upon poor people behind bars is like smearing lipstick on a pig. History shows that the right will resist practically any \"bleeding heart\" change to the prison system (though it may be moved on fiscal grounds , provided the system itself remains intact) and is quick to roll back reforms if need be. To limit our political imagination-and thus, political will-based on the whims of the opposition is not only shortsighted but also self-defeating, and it shirks the desperate need to decide what Texas liberalism actually stands for. Is it merely tweaking the worst aspects of an abhorrent system, or something altogether different? Why isn't it possible to demand more?\n\nThis is the smothering effect of political loss after loss, which continues to constrict thinking in the series' next episode, \"The Price of Oil.\" Alex Stapleton, a biracial \"Texan in exile,\" returns to Pleasantville, a suburb of the Houston area that she grew up visiting on weekends. \"Where is the Black story in Texas,\" Stapleton asks toward the beginning, \"and where is the Black story when we talk about oil?\" She highlights how settlers mounted the Texas Revolution to keep their slaves. From there, we learn of the origin of Pleasantville: The neighborhood was built in the late 1940s for middle-income Black families, which gave residents access to the benefits of suburban living for the first time. Then, in the 1970s, the refineries expanded practically into their backyards.\n\nToday, chemical fires are common there, as are cancer, asthma, and other environmental harms. If you look at a map of toxic chemicals along the Houston Ship Channel, which is near the area in question, you'll notice a smattering of red, orange, and yellow warning signs. Stapleton is up-front about the havoc the petrochemical industry has unleashed on the Houston area. The heightened risk comes with few rewards for Pleasantville: Due to systemic racism in the oil industry and among oil-rich politicians, she says, \"my family today can continue to live in one of the wealthiest parts of the world without ever having the same opportunities.\" Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the fate of her great-aunt's home, which was damaged during Winter Storm Uri. Rather than attempt more expensive repairs, the local government provided only one option: to demolish the property and replace it with a smaller shotgun home. Meanwhile, the nearby fossil-fuel infrastructure, and the companies that run it, have remained intact.\n\nAnd yet, toward the end of the episode, Stapleton chooses an odd point of critique: \"Among the largest oil and gas companies in America, every CEO is white,\" she says. \"While other industries have been put on blast for their lack of diversity, the oil and gas industry has not had the same reckoning.\" Stapleton does add later that her community needs \"a seat at the table\" as the country \"entertains\" a green transition, but the only specific action she suggests is increasing the diversity on corporate boards.\n\nOne might say I'm taking the docuseries too literally, and my critiques of what is first and foremost a form of infotainment can't, or shouldn't, be held to the same standards as, say, an essay-but this is what's so galling about the tepid suggestions capping each episode. Consider the stakes: Supposing Chevron or ExxonMobil did face this DEI reckoning-what would actually change about the oil industry? The pollution would not stop, and even if conditions improved in Pleasantville, what about the rest of Texas, let alone the rest of the world? Standing at the base of the San Jacinto monument, which memorializes the Texas Revolution, Stapleton and Wright talk with their hands on their hips, contemplating the region's environmental situation. \"America obviously needs an energy source, and this is what it looks like,\" Wright says. \"I think the more we talk about Texas, the more complicated it seems.\"\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nComplicated, yes, but can the Bard of Texas not say more? Can infotainment, as it were, not approach these issues with some creative liberty? Instead, Wright and Stapleton bow their heads to the apparent nuance of it all, and Stapleton retreats to old ground: \"I want to document the history,\" she says, \"because that will live forever.\"\n\nIn many ways, Iliana Sosa's episode, \"La Frontera,\" is the prickliest of the three. Like Stapleton, she highlights the not-so-distant past, showing us how racist border policing has changed over time, and celebrates the community's resilience in spite of this. From the early 1900s, when people crossing over from Mexico were \"sanitized\" with Zyklon B-the same gas used in Nazi concentration camps a few decades later-Sosa shows us the plans to gentrify downtown El Paso ( helped along years ago, I should add, by then-City Councilman Beto O'Rourke). A marketing company commissioned by El Paso's city government labeled its current, largely Hispanic identity \"Old Cowboy,\" meaning \"male, 50-60 years old, gritty, dirty, [and] lazy.\" Illustrating this point was an accompanying photo of an old Hispanic man in a cowboy hat. \"That could be anybody's abuelito ,\" Sosa says. On the next slide, the company proposed marketing a new identity called \"New West\": It would be \"educated, entrepreneurial, bilingual,\" and modeled after Matthew McConaughey and Penélope Cruz, whose headshots accompany the text.\n\n\"We see so many depictions of the border, and I wanted to make sure that we were trying to do something different,\" Sosa recently told Texas Monthly . To do so, paradoxically, she draws on the well-trodden work of the influential 1980s-era Chicana scholar Gloria Anzaldúa and her concept of nepantla -an Aztec word referring to the unique space between two bodies of water-to explore identity in the El Paso/Ciudad Juarez borderlands. To say Anzaldúa's work is controversial is an understatement: In her 1987 Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza , Anzaldúa's most important book, she praises a Mexican eugenicist and uses his writings to inform her own. Still, what sets Sosa's episode apart, I think, is her honesty.\n\nShe comes to a realization near the end of the episode, at an event called Hugs Not Walls, which is hosted once a year to reunite separated families for around five minutes in the middle of the Rio Grande. The fences, surveilled heavily by the Border Patrol, are temporarily opened, and a team of volunteers installs a portable bridge. Lines form on either end, the US side in yellow, the Mexican side in blue. One by one, parents and children find each other, weep, and embrace. Watching this unfold, bitterness overtakes Sosa: \"Hugs Not Walls may offer these families a fleeting embrace, but it also feels like I'm witnessing a spectacle of human pain in lieu of any real solution,\" she says in a voice-over. That sentence rattled in my head for days after finishing these three episodes. God Save Texas , the title, is itself a plea for divine intervention, a symptom of learned helplessness, but Sosa's pronouncement may as well be the show's tagline.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

      "text": "Why Liberals Struggle to Defend Liberalism\n\n\"Don't mention the word 'liberalism,' \" the talk-show host says to the guy who's written a book on it. \"Liberalism,\" he explains, might mean Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to his suspicious audience, alienating more people than it invites. Talk instead about \"liberal democracy,\" a more expansive term that includes John McCain and Ronald Reagan . When you cross the border to Canada, you are allowed to say \"liberalism\" but are asked never to praise \"liberals,\" since that means implicitly endorsing the ruling Trudeau government and the long-dominant Liberal Party. In England, you are warned off both words, since \"liberals\" suggests the membership of a quaintly failed political party and \"liberalism\" its dated program. In France, of course, the vagaries of language have made \"liberalism\" mean free-market fervor, doomed from the start in that country, while what we call liberalism is more hygienically referred to as \"republicanism.\" Say that .\n\nLiberalism is, truly, the love that dare not speak its name. Liberal thinkers hardly improve matters, since the first thing they will say is that the thing called \"liberalism\" is not actually a thing. This discouraging reflection is, to be sure, usually followed by an explanation: liberalism is a practice, a set of institutions, a tradition, a temperament, even. A clear contrast can be made with its ideological competitors: both Marxism and Catholicism, for instance, have more or less explicable rules-call them, nonpejoratively, dogmas. You can't really be a Marxist without believing that a revolution against the existing capitalist order would be a good thing, and that parliamentary government is something of a bourgeois trick played on the working class. You can't really be a Catholic without believing that a crisis point in cosmic history came two millennia ago in the Middle East, when a dissident rabbi was crucified and mysteriously revived. You can push either of these beliefs to the edge of metaphor-maybe the rabbi was only believed to be resurrected, and the inner experience of that epiphany is what counts; maybe the revolution will take place peacefully within a parliament and without Molotov cocktails-but you can't really discard them. Liberalism, on the other hand, can include both faith in free markets and skepticism of free markets, an embrace of social democracy and a rejection of its statism. Its greatest figure, the nineteenth-century British philosopher and parliamentarian John Stuart Mill , was a socialist but also the author of \" On Liberty ,\" which is (to the leftist imagination, at least) a suspiciously libertarian manifesto.\n\nDiscover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.\n\nWhatever liberalism is, we're regularly assured that it's dying-in need of those shock paddles they regularly take out in TV medical dramas. (\"C'mon! Breathe, damn it! Breathe! \") As on television, this is not guaranteed to work. (\"We've lost him, Holly. Damn it, we've lost him.\") Later this year, a certain demagogue who hates all these terms-liberals, liberalism, liberal democracy-might be lifted to power again. So what is to be done? New books on the liberal crisis tend to divide into three kinds: the professional, the professorial, and the polemical-books by those with practical experience; books by academics, outlining, sometimes in dreamily abstract form, a reformed liberal democracy; and then a few wishing the whole damn thing over, and well rid of it.\n\nThe professional books tend to come from people whose lives have been spent as pundits and as advisers to politicians. Robert Kagan, a Brookings fellow and a former State Department maven who has made the brave journey from neoconservatism to resolute anti-Trumpism, has a new book on the subject, \" Rebellion: How Antiliberalism Is Tearing America Apart-Again \" (Knopf). Kagan's is a particular type of book-I have written one myself-that makes the case for liberalism mostly to other liberals, by trying to remind readers of what they have and what they stand to lose. For Kagan, that \"again\" in the title is the crucial word; instead of seeing Trumpism as a new danger, he recapitulates the long history of anti-liberalism in the U.S., characterizing the current crisis as an especially foul wave rising from otherwise predictable currents. Since the founding of the secular-liberal Republic-secular at least in declining to pick one faith over another as official, liberal at least in its faith in individualism-anti-liberal elements have been at war with it. Kagan details, mordantly, the anti-liberalism that emerged during and after the Civil War, a strain that, just as much as today's version, insisted on a \"Christian commonwealth\" founded essentially on wounded white working-class pride.\n\nThe relevance of such books may be manifest, but their contemplative depth is, of necessity, limited. Not to worry. Two welcomely ambitious and professorial books are joining them: \" Liberalism as a Way of Life \" (Princeton), by Alexandre Lefebvre, who teaches politics and philosophy at the University of Sydney, and \" Free and Equal: A Manifesto for a Just Society \" (Knopf), by Daniel Chandler, an economist and a philosopher at the London School of Economics.\n\nThe two take slightly different tacks. Chandler emphasizes programs of reform, and toys with the many bells and whistles on the liberal busy box: he's inclined to try more random advancements, like elevating ordinary people into temporary power, on an Athenian model that's now restricted to jury service. But, on the whole, his is a sanely conventional vision of a state reformed in the direction of ever greater fairness and equity, one able to curb the excesses of capitalism and to accommodate the demands of diversity.\n\nLink copied\n\nThe program that Chandler recommends to save liberalism essentially represents the politics of the leftier edge of the British Labour Party-which historically has been unpopular with the very people he wants to appeal to, gaining power only after exhaustion with Tory governments. In the classic Fabian manner, though, Chandler tends to breeze past some formidable practical problems. While advocating for more aggressive government intervention in the market, he admits equably that there may be problems with state ownership of industry and infrastructure. Yet the problem with state ownership is not a theoretical one: Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister because of the widely felt failures of state ownership in the nineteen-seventies. The overreaction to those failures may have been destructive, but it was certainly democratic, and Tony Blair 's much criticized temporizing began in this recognition. Chandler is essentially arguing for an updated version of the social-democratic status quo-no bad place to be but not exactly a new place, either.\n\nLefebvre, on the other hand, wants to write about liberalism chiefly as a cultural phenomenon-as the water we swim in without knowing that it's wet-and his book is packed, in the tradition of William James, with racy anecdotes and pop-culture references. He finds more truths about contemporary liberals in the earnest figures of the comedy series \"Parks and Recreation\" than in the words of any professional pundit. A lot of this is fun, and none of it is frivolous.\n\nYet, given that we may be months away from the greatest crisis the liberal state has known since the Civil War, both books seem curiously calm. Lefebvre suggests that liberalism may be passing away, but he doesn't seem especially perturbed by the prospect, and at his book's climax he recommends a permanent stance of \"reflective equilibrium\" as an antidote to all anxiety, a stance that seems not unlike Richard Rorty's idea of irony-cultivating an ability both to hold to a position and to recognize its provisionality. \"Reflective equilibrium trains us to see weakness and difference in ourselves,\" Lefebvre writes, and to see \"how singular each of us is in that any equilibrium we reach will be specific to us as individuals and our constellation of considered judgments.\" However excellent as a spiritual exercise, a posture of reflective equilibrium seems scarcely more likely to get us through 2024 than smoking weed all day, though that, too, can certainly be calming in a crisis.\n\nBoth professors, significantly, are passionate evangelists for the great American philosopher John Rawls, and both books use Rawls as their fount of wisdom about the ideal liberal arrangement. Indeed, the dust-jacket sell line of Chandler's book is a distillation of Rawls: \"Imagine: You are designing a society, but you don't know who you'll be within it-rich or poor, man or woman, gay or straight. What would you want that society to look like?\" Lefebvre's \"reflective equilibrium\" is borrowed from Rawls, too. Rawls's classic \" A Theory of Justice \" (1971) was a theory about fairness, which revolved around the \"liberty principle\" (you're entitled to the basic liberties you'd get from a scheme in which everyone got those same liberties) and the \"difference principle\" (any inequalities must benefit the worst off). The emphasis on \"justice as fairness\" presses both professors to stress equality; it's not \"A Theory of Liberty,\" after all. \"Free and equal\" is not the same as \"free and fair,\" and the difference is where most of the arguing happens among people committed to a liberal society.\n\nIndeed, readers may feel that the work of reconciling Rawls's very abstract consideration of ideal justice and community with actual experience is more daunting than these books, written by professional philosophers who swim in this water, make it out to be. A confidence that our problems can be managed with the right adjustments to the right model helps explain why the tone of both books-richly erudite and thoughtful-is, for all their implication of crisis, so contemplative and even-humored. No doubt it is a good idea to tell people to keep cool in a fire, but that does not make the fire cooler.\n\nRawls devised one of the most powerful of all thought experiments: the idea of the \"veil of ignorance,\" behind which we must imagine the society we would want to live in without knowing which role in that society's hierarchy we would occupy. Simple as it is, it has ever-arresting force, making it clear that, behind this veil, rational and self-interested people would never design a society like that of, say, the slave states of the American South, given that, dropped into it at random, they could very well be enslaved. It also suggests that Norway might be a fairly just place, because a person would almost certainly land in a comfortable and secure middle-class life, however boringly Norwegian.\n\nStill, thought experiments may not translate well to the real world. Einstein's similarly epoch-altering account of what it would be like to travel on a beam of light, and how it would affect the hands on one's watch, is profound for what it reveals about the nature of time. Yet it isn't much of a guide to setting the timer on the coffeemaker in the kitchen so that the pot will fill in time for breakfast. Actual politics is much more like setting the timer on the coffeemaker than like riding on a beam of light. Breakfast is part of the cosmos, but studying the cosmos won't cook breakfast. It's telling that in neither of these Rawlsian books is there any real study of the life and the working method of an actual, functioning liberal politician. No F.D.R. or Clement Attlee , Pierre Mendès France or François Mitterrand (a socialist who was such a master of coalition politics that he effectively killed off the French Communist Party). Not to mention Tony Blair or Joe Biden or Barack Obama. Biden's name appears once in Chandler's index; Obama's, though he gets a passing mention, not at all.\n\nThe reason is that theirs are not ideal stories about the unimpeded pursuit of freedom and fairness but necessarily contingent tales of adjustments and amendments-compromised stories, in every sense. Both philosophers would, I think, accept this truth in principle, yet neither is drawn to it from the heart. Still, this is how the good work of governing gets done, by those who accept the weight of the world as they act to lighten it. Obama's history-including the feints back and forth on national health insurance, which ended, amid all the compromises, with the closest thing America has had to a just health-care system-is uninspiring to the idealizing mind. But these compromises were not a result of neglecting to analyze the idea of justice adequately; they were the result of the pluralism of an open society marked by disagreement on fundamental values. The troubles of current American politics do not arise from a failure on the part of people in Ohio to have read Rawls; they are the consequence of the truth that, even if everybody in Ohio read Rawls, not everybody would agree with him.\n\nIdeals can shape the real world. In some ultimate sense, Biden, like F.D.R. before him, has tried to build the sort of society we might design from behind the veil of ignorance-but, also like F.D.R., he has had to do so empirically, and often through tactics overloaded with contradictions. If your thought experiment is premised on a group of free and equal planners, it may not tell you what you need to know about a society marred by entrenched hierarchies. Ask Biden if he wants a free and fair society and he would say that he does. But Thatcher would have said so, too, and just as passionately. Oscillation of power and points of view within that common framework are what makes liberal democracies liberal. It has less to do with the ideally just plan than with the guarantee of the right to talk back to the planner. That is the great breakthrough in human affairs, as much as the far older search for social justice. Plato's rulers wanted social justice, of a kind; what they didn't want was back talk.\n\nBoth philosophers also seem to accept, at least by implication, the familiar idea that there is a natural tension between two aspects of the liberal project. One is the desire for social justice, the other the practice of individual freedom. Wanting to speak our minds is very different from wanting to feed our neighbors. An egalitarian society might seem inherently limited in liberty, while one that emphasizes individual rights might seem limited in its capacity for social fairness.\n\nLink copied\n\nYet the evidence suggests the opposite. Show me a society in which people are able to curse the king and I will show you a society more broadly equal than the one next door, if only because the ability to curse the king will make the king more likely to spread the royal wealth, for fear of the cursing. The rights of sexual minorities are uniquely protected in Western liberal democracies, but this gain in social equality is the result of a history of protected expression that allowed gay experience to be articulated and \"normalized,\" in high and popular culture. We want to live on common streets, not in fortified castles. It isn't a paradox that John Stuart Mill and his partner, Harriet Taylor, threw themselves into both \"On Liberty,\" a testament to individual freedom, and \"The Subjection of Women,\" a program for social justice and mass emancipation through group action. The habit of seeking happiness for one through the fulfillment of many others was part of the habit of their liberalism. Mill wanted to be happy, and he couldn't be if Taylor wasn't.\n\nLiberals are at a disadvantage when it comes to authoritarians, because liberals are committed to procedures and institutions, and persist in that commitment even when those things falter and let them down. The asymmetry between the Trumpite assault on the judiciary and Biden's reluctance even to consider enlarging the Supreme Court is typical. Trumpites can and will say anything on earth about judges; liberals are far more reticent, since they don't want to undermine the institutions that give reality to their ideals.\n\nWhere Kagan, Lefebvre, and Chandler are all more or less sympathetic to the liberal \"project,\" the British political philosopher John Gray deplores it, and his recent book, \" The New Leviathans: Thoughts After Liberalism \" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), is one long complaint. Gray is one of those leftists so repelled by the follies of the progressive party of the moment-to borrow a phrase of Orwell's about Jonathan Swift-that, in a familiar horseshoe pattern, he has become hard to distinguish from a reactionary. He insists that liberalism is a product of Christianity (being in thrall to the notion of the world's perfectibility) and that it has culminated in what he calls \"hyper-liberalism,\" which would emancipate individuals from history and historically shaped identities. Gray hates all things \"woke\"-a word that he seems to know secondhand from news reports about American universities. If \"woke\" points to anything except the rage of those who use it, however, it is a discourse directed against liberalism- Ibram X. Kendi is no ally of Bayard Rustin , nor Judith Butler of John Stuart Mill. So it is hard to see it as an expression of the same trends, any more than Trump is a product of Burke's conservative philosophy, despite strenuous efforts on the progressive side to make it seem so.\n\nGray's views are learned, and his targets are many and often deserved: he has sharp things to say about how certain left liberals have reclaimed the Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt and his thesis that politics is a battle to the death between friends and foes. In the end, Gray turns to Dostoyevsky's warning that (as Gray reads him) \"the logic of limitless freedom is unlimited despotism.\" Hyper-liberals, Gray tells us, think that we can compete with the authority of God, and what they leave behind is wild disorder and crazed egotism.\n\nAs for Dostoyevsky's positive doctrines-authoritarian and mystical in nature-Gray waves them away as being \"of no interest.\" But they are of interest, exactly because they raise the central pragmatic issue: If you believe all this about liberal modernity, what do you propose to do about it? Given that the announced alternatives are obviously worse or just crazy (as is the idea of a Christian commonwealth, something that could be achieved only by a degree of social coercion that makes the worst of \"woke\" culture look benign), perhaps the evil might better be ameliorated than abolished.\n\nBetween authority and anarchy lies argument. The trick is not to have unified societies that \"share values\"-those societies have never existed or have existed only at the edge of a headsman's axe-but to have societies that can get along nonviolently without shared values, aside from the shared value of trying to settle disputes nonviolently. Certainly, Americans were far more polarized in the nineteen-sixties than they are today-many favored permanent apartheid (\"Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\")-and what happened was not that values changed on their own but that a form of rights-based liberalism of protest and free speech convinced just enough people that the old order wouldn't work and that it wasn't worth fighting for a clearly lost cause.\n\nWhat's curious about anti-liberal critics such as Gray is their evident belief that, after the institutions and the practices on which their working lives and welfare depend are destroyed, the features of the liberal state they like will somehow survive. After liberalism is over, the neat bits will be easily reassembled, and the nasty bits will be gone. Gray can revile what he perceives to be a ruling élite and call to burn it all down, and nothing impedes the dissemination of his views. Without the institutions and the practices that he despises, fear would prevent oppositional books from being published. Try publishing an anti-Communist book in China or a critique of theocracy in Iran. Liberal institutions are the reason that he is allowed to publish his views and to have the career that he and all the other authors here rightly have. Liberal values and practices allow their most fervent critics a livelihood and a life-which they believe will somehow magically be reconstituted \"after liberalism.\" They won't be.\n\nThe vociferous critics of liberalism are like passengers on the Titanic who root for the iceberg. After all, an iceberg is thrilling, and anyway the White Star Line has classes, and the music the band plays is second-rate, and why is the food French instead of honestly English? \"Just as I told you, the age of the steamship is over!\" they cry as the water slips over their shoes. They imagine that another boat will miraculously appear-where all will be in first class, the food will be authentic, and the band will perform only Mozart or Motown, depending on your wishes. Meanwhile, the ship goes down. At least the band will be playing \"Nearer, My God, to Thee,\" which they will take as some vindication. The rest of us may drown.\n\nOne turns back to Helena Rosenblatt's 2018 book, \" The Lost History of Liberalism ,\" which makes the case that liberalism is not a recent ideology but an age-old series of intuitions about existence. When the book appeared, it may have seemed unduly overgeneralized-depicting liberalism as a humane generosity that flared up at moments and then died down again. But, as the world picture darkens, her dark picture illuminates. There surely are a set of identifiable values that connect men and women of different times along a single golden thread: an aversion to fanaticism, a will toward the coexistence of different kinds and creeds, a readiness for reform, a belief in the public criticism of power without penalty, and perhaps, above all, a knowledge that institutions of civic peace are much harder to build than to destroy, being immeasurably more fragile than their complacent inheritors imagine. These values will persist no matter how evil the moment may become, and by whatever name we choose to whisper in the dark. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "How Liberals Talk About Children\n\nWhen Imre Kertész won the Nobel Prize in Literature, in 2002, I was twenty-two and deep in one of those unfortunate periods during which a young writer wants to be serious but doesn't quite know what that means. The young writer may, in such a phase, try to have strong, and usually negative, opinions about big prizewinners, aligning himself instead with more overlooked authors. But, when a new translation of Kertész's \" Kaddish for an Unborn Child \" was published a couple of years later, I picked it up. The narrator of the book, a novella-length lament, is a Holocaust survivor, as Kertész was. The prose is manic and unpleasant, like a raw and unedited rant; I found it both galling and thrilling. Even after years had passed, I couldn't shake its central question: should we bring children into a violent, genocidal world? The book answers with a famous repeating line: \"No!\"\n\nThe question, I admit, was an abstraction-a philosophical debate that I found interesting to consider but that I didn't apply, in any serious way, to my own life. Later, and in much the same way, I followed debates about anti-natalism spurred by the work of the South African philosopher David Benatar , who argues, in a seeming perversion of Buddhist thought, that it is immoral to have children because so much of life is suffering. Then, when the timing felt right, my wife and I had our first child. Six years later, we decided to have a second. We liked the idea of giving our daughter a sibling.\n\nThese weren't decisions based on a lot of rational calculation. We did factor in whether we could afford to have children, but even those considerations felt a bit post hoc-if we hadn't been able to provide for the kids and maintain our basic standard of living, we probably would've just convinced ourselves that we could, and we would have made do. Most couples, I suspect, make such decisions more or less this way, because there is never really a perfect time, and, unless you're fabulously wealthy, there is never really enough money. Child rearing, for us, is mostly pleasant, and largely straightforward; the kids have needs and we try our best to meet them. This is called a blessing and a privilege. It is also, for me, I've come to realize, called being a man. My wife thought much more about the ethical implications of having children than I did.\n\nA new book by Anastasia Berg and Rachel Wiseman, \" What Are Children For? ,\" is an engaging, literary investigation into why so many highly educated, financially comfortable women in the United States are ambivalent about having children, and how we should actually think about that decision. (I recently interviewed the authors on a podcast that I co-host .) To understand the reasoning of their contemporaries, Berg and Wiseman distributed surveys and conducted interviews with \"dozens of Zoomers, millennials, and Gen Xers.\" More than ninety per cent of their respondents had a college degree, they note, and nearly seventy per cent had a graduate degree. This focus on the middle and upper middle class might feel limiting, especially for a book with such an ambitious title, but the public conversation about the relative morality of having children has been shaped, to a great degree, by this demographic.\n\nWithin this larger discourse, Berg and Wiseman see a landscape of beleaguered people who have leaned a bit too far into their political and cultural beliefs, trading in the joys of life for an overly determinative belief that children will suffer inescapable misery. The thought of having children, in these mostly progressive circles, is often weighed against rising existential risk , whether stemming from climate change , the emergence of the far right, or even artificial intelligence. This, the authors point out, is a weird way to talk about kids. And they envision a near future in which that conversation becomes further polarized, with the anti-abortion right on one side and an increasingly anti-natalist left on the other. This outcome, they think, would be disastrous. \"Simply put,\" Wiseman writes, in the book's introduction, \"the question of whether or not to have a family is too important to allow it to be a casualty of the culture war.\"\n\nThe book sometimes feels a bit too online; the size of the anti-natalist movement, for example, which periodically rages on social media, looms larger in Berg and Wiseman's telling than I imagine it might in real life. But \"What Are Children For?\" wasn't written to win some erudite or deranged Twitter argument. Rather, Berg and Wiseman want to engage with anti-natalism in the context of a possible future in which the United States has as low a birth rate as that of Japan or South Korea. The American birth rate has declined for the past seventeen years, and keeps reaching new lows; the book can seem like a man-made dune before a hurricane.\n\nIt opens with an essay from Wiseman, who does not have children, and ends with an epilogue from Berg, who has two young children, charting a path from Wiseman's questions about what a happy family might look like to Berg's answers. In between, the concerns of women who think that they must delay or possibly forgo having children are seriously considered, discussed, and then gently, or sometimes forcefully, countered. It's not that Berg and Wiseman believe that everyone should have children. It's that they think the arguments against having children-beyond \"It isn't right for me\"-need a bit more friendly interrogation.\n\nFor instance, they discuss at great length the issue of financial precarity, and whether it should be a bar to having children. Many millennial women do not believe that they should have children until they can ably provide for them, a bar that tends to change across time. The authors acknowledge that millennials started their careers at a financial disadvantage from earlier generations, but point out that, in 2021, economists at the Federal Reserve \"found that millennials had 'staged a remarkable comeback,' increasing their median wealth by 29 percent between 2016 and 2019, with more 'time to gain lost ground.' \" Berg and Wiseman also cite several studies showing that millennials actually feel quite fiscally comfortable. \"As attractive as economics may be as a solution to the riddle of the growing ambivalence about having children, it is partial at best,\" they write. \"Many millennials are not as financially stressed as they are often assumed to be.\"\n\nNot content to leave it there, Berg and Wiseman also question the thinking behind the idea that it would be wrong to bring a child into a situation where they may experience financial hardship:\n\nThe banal correlation of socioeconomic status with expected welfare, combined with the assumption that the moral permissibility of having children correlates with their expected well-being, yields a startling conclusion: Having children can be justified in direct proportion to the social and financial security of their parents. According to this reasoning, a couple in Haiti will not only encounter greater material hurdles to providing their child with a good life than their counterparts in the United States; they are also less morally justified in having them in the first place.\n\nThe book is filled with dozens of similar blows to faulty logic; it is, perhaps more than anything, a book for lovers of sound reasoning. \"Slow love,\" the term sometimes given to an app-driven approach to dating in which people go through dozens or hundreds of suitors to try to find their perfect child-rearing partner, gets a similar treatment. \"It doesn't just threaten the possibility of finding love, which always involves the sacrifice of opportunities and exposure to chance,\" Berg and Wiseman write. \"It might actually stand at cross purposes with what many people still hope their relationships will eventually enable: serious commitment.\"\n\nThe book is best read, I think, as a corrective to liberal neuroses about having kids, one that feels necessary at a time when the right wants to dictate the terms of the family, whether through the banning of abortion or anti-trans legislation or what gets taught in schools . (It is also a good book for men like me, who might feel a bit too confident that our wives mirrored our own thoughtless and carefree entry into parenthood. And, to their credit, Berg and Wiseman convinced me that I should probably pitch in more when it comes to child care outside of meticulously planning my daughter's youth-soccer career.) \"Parents stand to gain many things from parenting a child-some will enjoy ethical growth, others artistic inspiration and intellectual insights; some will find spiritual liberation or just the permission to really take time off of work; others will find the pleasures of play, pride, love,\" Berg writes, in the book's conclusion. \"But to have children is to allow yourself to stand in a relationship whose essence is not determined by the benefits it confers or the prices it exacts. That's what it means for it to be not just another good among others. People say that having a child is a gift, but if that's true, it's not because it's like getting a gift. If having a child is a gift, it's because it's like giving one.\"\n\nBerg and Wiseman also implicitly ask a question that I have mulled for the past few years, and that may not have a satisfying answer. Are the sorts of people they interviewed-well-educated professionals who worry about climate change, and who have, perhaps, at some point in their lives, ripped open their hearts for all the suffering people of the world-capable of talking about what a good life for their children might be? In other words, can middle-class liberals describe their family values?\n\nThe standard liberal definition of family values is that all forms of love are worth protecting and celebrating. In this house, we believe , etc. Since families need support, the maximalist liberal vision promotes welfare programs, supplements for child care, and shared prosperity rooted in well-funded public schools and broader access to class mobility. American prosperity should not be cordoned off for people of certain races, gender identifications, or religions-it should be a collective endeavor. This is more or less what Joe Biden said in a speech about the American Families Plan, in 2021.\n\nProgressives generally approve of the social programs and expanded funding that Biden proposed in that plan. But, tellingly, he framed the need for them in economic and national-security terms, calling them an \"investment we need to win the competition with other nations for the future,\" and insisting that the U.S. was \"in a race\" in which \"the rest of the world has caught up to us.\" This competitive, economic logic has become endemic in the liberal and progressive circles that Berg and Wiseman address. Children are often talked about as if they are self-contained economies with huge expenditures-not to mention ones that threaten ecological balance and are probably doomed. In the course of my past few columns, I've tried to put my finger on what, exactly, feels alienating about modern, liberal, middle-class parenting. I keep coming back to the impression that we don't talk in a public and philosophic way about children as objects of love nearly as often as we describe them as obstacles or means to an end. Liberal writers and thinkers don't frequently opine on the joys of bearing and raising children, or the tremendous social good that it brings.\n\nConsider the discourse around public schools. Progressives will argue that public schools are necessary for fairness and social justice; they will rise up to protect public schools from book bans, curriculum mandates, and privatization. The case isn't exactly for public schools on their own but, instead, converts them into another battlefield where liberals, weary but dutiful, must once again beat back the right. But when was the last time you heard or read a full-throated case for the public school not merely as a necessity but as a great resource, a place where children can make friends with everyone within a community and where they can learn what we, apparently, have forgotten-that the problems of the burning world will not be solved by individuals? I imagine that many of the progressives whom Berg and Wiseman are writing for do not talk about schools in this way because, on a deeper level, they do not believe in this sort of collectivism. And I suspect that the negative language they often use about children serves to justify, and perhaps shield, their own selfish thoughts.\n\nThis is why \"What Are Children For?\" ultimately feels provocative, even if its scope does not extend much beyond the panicking class . We might know what children are for, and most of us, I imagine, understand why they are good. But do we know how to talk about our kids without apology, or feigned ambivalence, or as the causes and victims of one coming apocalypse or another? When our children do good, we bring up endless caveats about privilege; we are always aware of how lucky we are. And yet we also talk about children as impositions to whatever it is we imagined ourselves doing otherwise. Most parents, in my experience, do not actually think about their children in these ways-most are loving and appreciative. But our discourse about children suffers from a culture of perpetual alarm, theatrical stress, and doomerism. If the point of our politics is to promote a prosperity that can be shared by the children of every type of family, we should stop talking about children as the key to competition with the economic enemies of the United States, or as sites for endless optimization, or as impositions who need to be continually placed into a polite, deferential context. We should talk about them as a universal and immutable good. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Are Liberals to Blame for Our Crisis of Faith in Government?\n\nDo you trust the federal government? When voters were asked that question in December, 1958, by pollsters from a center now called the American National Election Studies, at the University of Michigan, seventy-three per cent said yes, they had confidence in the government to do the right thing either almost all the time or most of the time. Six years later, they were asked basically the same question, and seventy-seven per cent said yes.\n\nPollsters ask the question regularly. In a Pew survey from April, 2021, only twenty-four per cent of respondents said yes. And that represented an uptick. During Obama's and Trump's Presidencies, the figure was sometimes as low as seventeen per cent. Sixty years ago, an overwhelming majority of Americans said they had faith in the government. Today, an overwhelming majority say they don't. Who is to blame?\n\nOne answer might be that no one is to blame; it's just that circumstances have changed. In 1958, the United States was in the middle of an economic boom and was not engaged in foreign wars; for many Americans, there was domestic tranquillity. Then came the growing intensity of the civil-rights movement, the war in Vietnam, urban unrest, the women's-liberation movement, the gay-liberation movement, Watergate, the oil embargo, runaway inflation, the hostage crisis in Iran. Americans might reasonably have felt that things had spun out of control. By March, 1980, trust in government was down to twenty-seven per cent.\n\nEight months later, Ronald Reagan, a man who opposed the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and Medicare, which he called an attempt to impose socialism, and who wanted to make Social Security voluntary-a man who essentially ran against the New Deal and the Great Society, a.k.a. \"the welfare state\"-was elected President. He defeated the incumbent, Jimmy Carter, by almost ten percentage points in the popular vote. \"In this present crisis,\" Reagan said in his Inaugural Address, \"government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem.\"\n\nMeanwhile, government swung into action. Inflation was checked; the economy recovered. Watergate and Vietnam receded in the rearview mirror. Popular programs like Medicare and Social Security remained intact. For all his talk about reducing the size and the role of government, Reagan did not eliminate a single major program in his eight years in office.\n\nYet, during those eight years, the trust index never rose above forty-five per cent. And since Reagan left office, aside from intermittent spikes, including one after September 11th, it has declined steadily. In the past fourteen years, in good times and bad, the index has never exceeded thirty per cent.\n\nThe questionnaire used in the A.N.E.S. survey is designed to correct for partisanship. A typical preamble to the trust question reads, \"People have different ideas about the government in Washington. These ideas don't refer to Democrats or Republicans in particular, but just to the government in general.\" Still, when there is a Democratic President Republicans tend to have less faith in \"government in general,\" and Democrats tend to have more. But partisanship accounts only for changes in the distribution of responses. It doesn't explain why over all, no matter the President, the public's level of trust in government has been dropping.\n\nSo maybe someone is to blame. It is a convenience to reviewers, although not an aid to clarity, that two recent books devoted to the subject assign responsibility to completely different perpetrators. In \" At War with Government \" (Columbia), the political scientists Amy Fried and Douglas B. Harris blame the Republican Party. They say that \"the intentional cultivation and weaponization of distrust represent the fundamental strategy of conservative Republican politics from Barry Goldwater to Donald Trump.\" The principal actors in their account are Reagan and Newt Gingrich, who was Speaker of the House during Bill Clinton's second term as President.\n\nIn \" Public Citizens \" (Norton), the historian Paul Sabin suggests that much of the blame lies with liberal reformers. \"Blaming conservatives for the end of the New Deal era is far too simplistic,\" he says, explaining that the attack on the New Deal state was also driven by \"an ascendant liberal public interest movement.\" His principal actor is Ralph Nader . It's a sign of how divergent these books are that Gingrich's name does not appear anywhere in Sabin's book, and Nader's name does not appear in Fried and Harris's.\n\nNader became a public figure in 1965, when he published \"Unsafe at Any Speed,\" a book about automobile safety, a subject that had interested him since he was a law student at Harvard, in the nineteen-fifties. The book got a lot of attention when it was revealed that General Motors had tapped Nader's phone and hired a detective to follow him. He sued, and won a settlement, which he used to establish the Center for the Study of Responsive Law. In 1966, Congress passed the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which empowered the federal government to set safety standards for automobiles, a matter heretofore left largely to the states. Operating with a steady stream of ambitious students from élite law schools, known as Nader's Raiders, he then took on, among other causes, meat inspection; air and water pollution; and coal-mining, radiation, and natural-gas-pipeline regulation. Sabin credits these efforts with helping to pass the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act (1968), the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act (1969), the Clean Air Act (1970) and the Clean Water Act (1972), and the Occupational Safety and Health Act (1970), which created osha .\n\nThe key to all these successes, Sabin thinks, is that a new player arose in government policymaking: the public. People like Nader argued that government officials and regulatory agencies weren't an effective check on malign business interests, because they were in bed with the industries they were supposed to regulate. There was no seat at the table for the consumer, or for the people obliged to live with air and water pollution. The solution was the nonprofit public-interest law firm, an organization independent of the government but sufficiently well funded to sue corporations and government agencies on behalf of the public. The power of groups like the Audubon Society and the Sierra Club grew. By the nineteen-seventies, the environmental movement had acquired political clout. It helped that courts were willing to grant these groups legal standing.\n\nYou would think that congressional acts addressing workplace safety and pollution would have raised the level of trust in the federal government. The government was taking over from the states and looking out for people's health and welfare. And here is where Sabin's argument gets tricky. He says that liberal reformers assailed not only the industries responsible for pollution, unsafe working conditions, and so on but also the government agencies assigned to oversee them. The reformers essentially accused groups like the Federal Trade Commission of corruption. It was not enough for them to mobilize public opinion on behalf of laws that a Democratic Congress was more than willing to pass. They sought to expose and condemn the compromises that government agencies were making with industry.\n\nThe reformers had the effrontery of the righteous. One of the leading environmentalists in the Senate was Edmund Muskie. This wasn't an easy position. Muskie was from Maine, a state that was dependent on the paper-mill industry. But Nader and his allies attacked Muskie for giving out \"a 'business-as-usual' license to pollute.\" At a 1970 press conference to launch a book on pollution, \"Vanishing Air,\" a Nader ally said that Muskie did \"not deserve the credit he has been given.\" Sabin thinks that rhetoric like this made the public suspicious of \"government in general.\"\n\nIt is certainly true that distrust has been promoted from the left as well as from the right. Although distrust is higher among Republicans than among Democrats, the antiwar and the Black Power movements, in the nineteen-sixties, were \"don't trust the government\" movements. So are the \"defund the police\" movements of today.\n\nBut those were not the political causes of public-interest groups. Sabin, who plainly is sympathetic to these causes, thinks that the new breed of liberal reformers, with their hatred for compromise, made government look, at best, like a sclerotic and indifferent bureaucracy, and, at worst, like an enabler of irresponsible corporate practices at the expense of public health and welfare. The liberal reformers cast the federal government as an impediment to the public interest, Sabin concludes, and \"the political right ran with their critique, even if that was never their desire or intention.\"\n\nThat last hurdle is a little hard to clear. After all, the public-interest advocates wanted more government, not less. They wanted Congress to pass laws telling businesses what they could and could not do. They wanted national standards for clean air and clean water. Those are not things that Ronald Reagan wanted. Reagan set out to roll back liberal reforms. One of his first acts in office was to strip OSHA of much of its authority, and he appointed to federal agencies lawyers and lobbyists who had represented the industries those agencies were supposed to regulate. The most notorious of these appointees was probably Secretary of the Interior James Watt, a former president of an anti-environmentalist law firm called the Mountain States Legal Foundation. (An unstoppable fountain of gaffes, Watt was finally forced out after a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in which he said that an Interior Department panel conformed to affirmative-action requirements because \"I have a Black, I have a woman, two Jews, and a cripple. And we have talent.\" After resigning, he became a lobbyist.)\n\nLink copied\n\nWhy did Republican politicians settle on distrust of the federal government as a political platform? Fried and Harris do not believe that it was primarily the result of ideological conviction-the belief, for example, that markets are more efficient than planning is, or that people are better judges of their interests than the state is. They think it was strategic, and their research suggests three reasons. The first (in order of respectability) is that the Republicans were mostly the opposition party from 1933 to 1981. And since those were years in which the federal government enacted major social programs and regulatory policies, Republicans faced a choice between being a \"me too\" party and a party for people who dislike social programs and government regulation.\n\nSuch people do not all share the same ideology, however, and this is the second reason that Republicans adopted anti-government rhetoric. \"The anti-government message was the glue,\" Fried and Harris write. It created a coalition of business owners, fiscal conservatives, anti-Communists, social conservatives, evangelicals, and libertarians, all of whom had their own reasons for distrusting \"big government.\" In their view, it imposed costs on industry and interfered with the operations of the market; it blew up the deficit with tax-and-spend policies; it was socialistic; it usurped moral authority from local communities, banished religion from schools and public spaces, and trod on individual liberties. Republicans, in promising to reduce the government's interference in people's lives, could hope to win the votes of all these groups.\n\nBut \"don't trust the government\" is not exactly a galvanizing campaign slogan. Fried and Harris think that what made it speak to many voters, especially after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, was the implicit suggestion that social programs effectively transfer money from whites to Blacks and other minorities. Reagan's repeated invocations of the \"welfare queen\" showed how successful those appeals could be-\"welfare queen\" was immediately understood to mean \"Black.\" Fried and Harris point out that Reagan held a rally for his 1980 Presidential campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where three civil-rights workers had been murdered by authorities sixteen years before. That twice as many whites as Blacks live in poverty and more than half again as many whites as Blacks receive food stamps does not seem to have dented the conviction that the welfare state is taxpayer support for nonwhites-especially, in the Trumpian incarnation of this view, for nonwhite immigrants.\n\nMuch in the conservative attack on government is hypocrisy. Republicans are happy to have the state interfere in people's lives in ways they approve of. The classic example is restricting abortion. But they also support aggressive \"law and order\" policies, a strong national-security state, and (often) curbs on expression and the right to protest.\n\nAnd, as Fried and Harris have no trouble documenting, Republican leaders \"apply their anti-government principles inconsistently depending on whether they are in power and which of the institutions of national government they control.\" Republicans and the conservative media like to label Democratic acts and policies that they disapprove of \"unconstitutional.\" But, as the history of Supreme Court decisions and judicial ingenuity shows, the Constitution is a highly flexible instrument. When Congress is in Democratic hands, Republicans attack it as a left-wing cabal that runs roughshod over the Constitution, but when Congress is in Republican hands, as it was when Obama was President, Republicans proclaim that it must act as a check on the unconstitutional excesses of the President.\n\nToday, the chief anti-government claim, denied by only a tiny number of Republican politicians, is that the President is illegitimate, because his party stole the election. \"At War with Government\" shows us that this claim is the product of a sixty-year war waged by one political party against the integrity of America's political institutions. The stolen-election claim, after all, is only an amplified version of the birther claim against Obama, also designed to render the President illegitimate. It excuses Republicans from debating policy proposals or offering alternatives. They can be purely oppositional. Today, this is virtually the only platform the Party has left to stand on.\n\n\"Public Citizens\" and \"At War with Government\" are scholarly books, carefully researched and patiently argued. Still, they both feel a little narrowly focussed. For one thing, they tend to underplay the extent to which the American political system was designed by people who were distrustful of government. Fried and Harris mention the anti-Federalists, the politicians who opposed ratification of the new constitution on the ground that it made the federal government so strong that it would usurp states' rights. But a good deal of the Federalist Papers is devoted to assuring voters that the new constitution was designed to limit the powers of the national government.\n\nSuspicion of the central government may be the norm in American political life. The relatively few periods when the federal government expanded its power and enacted sweeping legislation are all marked by unusual circumstances: the Civil War, in the eighteen-sixties; the Depression and the Second World War, in the nineteen-thirties and forties.\n\nWhen Republicans (and Democrats like Bill Clinton) talk about \"big government,\" they are mostly alluding to another of these exceptional periods, the Lyndon Johnson Administration, of the mid-nineteen-sixties. G. Calvin Mackenzie and Robert Weisbrot pointed out, in \" The Liberal Hour \" (2008), that Johnson came to power in a time of almost fantastic economic growth. In the nineteen-fifties, disposable personal income increased by thirty-three per cent. In the nineteen-sixties, it increased by fifty per cent. It is a lot easier to enact popular programs and redistribute the wealth when the pie keeps growing.\n\nIn the 1964 election, Johnson won more than sixty per cent of the popular vote, running against Barry Goldwater, who warned that \"a government big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away.\" Voters chose not to heed that warning. Democrats gained thirty-seven seats in the House and added two in the Senate, giving the Party two-thirds majorities in both chambers, the largest it had enjoyed since the Roosevelt Administration. In a survey conducted after the election, less than twelve per cent of voters gave ideology-liberalism or conservativism-as a reason for their vote.\n\nThat Congress, the eighty-ninth, was one of the most productive in American history. It passed the Voting Rights Act, the legislative capstone of the civil-rights movement. It created Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities. It increased the federal minimum wage. It passed the Higher Education Act and provided federal aid to elementary and secondary education. It passed the Water Quality Act, the Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act, the Highway Beautification Act, the Highway and Motor Vehicle Safety Acts, the Demonstration Cities Act, the Clean Waters Restoration Act, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, and a major amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act. Does anyone seriously think that the country is not better off for what that Congress accomplished?\n\nSocial scientists often lament the diminishment of trust, both political and social-that is, our trust in other people, which has also declined. And it is probably true that high levels of trust enable governments to get more done. But, as Fried and Harris acknowledge, lack of trust does not correlate with apathy. The contrary may be the case. If you trust government to do the right thing most of the time, you may feel that you can check out. Often, lack of trust in the government is an incentive to act. The antiwar protesters in the Vietnam period were politically energized. So were the insurrectionists of January 6th. Both manifested high levels of distrust.\n\nNeither \"Public Citizens\" nor \"At War with Government\" is explicit about what voters actually mean when they are asked about trust. For example, how would the authors answer the trust question themselves? Highly educated people count skepticism a virtue. They typically would not report that they trust government, or any social institution, \"most of the time.\" What seems to make educated people uncomfortable, though, is the idea that the mass public shares this skepticism.\n\nBut mass publics, too, are trained to be skeptical. Consumer economies make them that way. Commercials sell products by encouraging consumers to be skeptical of the claims of competing products. Many incorporate a wink of knowingness-\"You get it that we are just trying to sell something here.\" Unquestioned trust seems unthinking, naïve. Does anyone trust Facebook? You're not supposed to trust corporate entities. So people say they don't.\n\nFinally, as with many histories of the postwar period, these books are distinctly U.S.-centric. American historians tend to explain social and political changes by telling a story about American events. Civil rights, Vietnam, the Warren Court, Watergate: these are endowed with great explanatory power. Yet faith in government has been declining not only in America but also in the other advanced industrial democracies since the mid-nineteen-sixties. No doubt each country has its own explanation of what went wrong. But Nader and Gingrich may simply be the local faces of changes in social attitudes that are, in fact, global. It seems, as a character in Joyce's \"Ulysses\" puts it, that history is to blame. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Ruben Gallego Thinks Liberals Shouldn't Panic\n\nThe Laken Riley Act , which requires the Department of Homeland Security to detain undocumented immigrants charged with even nonviolent crimes, was the first bill that President Donald Trump signed into law in his second term. Every Republican senator voted for the bill. A dozen Democrats, mostly from swing states, joined them, including the new Arizona senator, Ruben Gallego, who was a co-sponsor. Progressives such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York; Alex Padilla, of California; and Chuy García, of Illinois, opposed the Laken Riley Act because it requires the detention of people who've only been accused of crimes. Additionally, as Ocasio-Cortez argued in Congress, the bill will bring profits to private-prison corporations. But, for Gallego, his support for the act was one of the reasons that Arizonans sent him to Washington. He made immigration and border security a centerpiece of his campaign , and he was simply doing the job his constituents expected him to do.\n\nI first met Gallego late last year in Washington, D.C., not long after his election as Arizona's first Latino senator. He was also one of only four Democrats to win Senate races in states carried by Trump. He told me then that his positions on the border came from \"listening to the nonpolitical Latinos\" around him. Many had opposed previous restrictions on immigration but were now saying, \"No, I don't like what's going on at the border. That's chaos.\" When Gallego and I talked again, in late February, I asked him about the progressives who were mad at him for supporting the act. He said, \"I mean, look, these people are good-natured. They're not trying to be harmful or anything like that. But I think they are very much out of touch with people's understanding of the border situation.\" Gallego also believes they are wrong to assume that there will be widespread racial profiling or other abuses of the law, such as wanton arrests. \"There's a certain level of misinformation that's going both ways on this issue,\" he told me. Progressives are \"spreading fear saying that kids are going to be arrested and detained for shoplifting candy bars.\" In practice, he said, \"that's just not how the law works. And, instead of rationally talking about this, I think a lot of people just decided to do a knee-jerk 'Let's just stand up against Trump's first thing.' \"\n\nThe Lede Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nGallego is of the opinion that Democrats do not have much to gain from simply opposing Trump. He brought up the example of Trump and Elon Musk 's attack on U.S.A.I.D. In Arizona, he said, voters would care about mass layoffs of National Park Service employees because of the Grand Canyon, firefighters because of the threat of forest fires, and U.S.D.A. workers who are trying to stop the spread of avian flu. But \"no one's talking about the firings at U.S.A.I.D.,\" he told me, because they \"think we spend too much money on foreign aid.\" Instead, they're asking, \" 'How does this actually relate to me?' \" He added, \"The best way you can save U.S.A.I.D. and programs like that is to make the Republican position and Donald Trump's position unpopular by other means.\"\n\nGallego noted that, after Trump's first month in office, public-opinion surveys found that people were \"happy with what the President was doing but wished he would focus more on the cost of living.\" That's where Gallego is concentrating his criticism. \"For me,\" he said, \"resistance is making sure that people understand this Administration isn't doing anything to bring down the cost of living. Instead, they're doing basically everything to cut services to everyday Americans, gutting the poor so they can give tax cuts to the rich. That's the resistance I'm doing right now. And the more I do that, the more messages I can get out there, the weaker I can make this Administration, and the easier it is for us to protect a lot of these core services.\" Gallego has been arguing that the Administration's economic plans will result in cuts to Medicaid, Social Security, and veterans' benefits. His pragmatic approach to the Trump Administration is the one most Democrats seem to be taking, at least for now: collaborate when possible, and resist when necessary, if at all.\n\nFor most of his political career-three years in the Arizona state legislature, followed by a decade in the House of Representatives-Gallego was known as a progressive. The son of immigrants, his mother from Colombia, and his father from Mexico, Gallego graduated from Harvard , and then deployed to Iraq. He won his first election, in 2010, as part of a groundswell of opposition to Arizona's S.B. 1070, which required police to verify the immigration status of anyone they suspected of being in the country illegally. (It was signed into law but was partially struck down by the Supreme Court, in 2012.) \"Gallego was an important part of that movement. He got elected because of that movement,\" Héctor Sánchez Barba, the president and C.E.O. of Mi Familia Vota, a national Latino advocacy organization with headquarters in Arizona, told me. But in recent years, as Gallego performed on bigger stages, he began to critique certain positions held by progressive Democrats.\n\nThe day after the 2020 Presidential election, when many were surprised by Trump's relative strength among Latinos , Gallego railed on Twitter about the term \"Latinx,\" saying it should be abandoned. He caught heat from progressives but still repeated the argument in many different venues. On \" Real Time with Bill Maher ,\" he explained that it offended him as a native Spanish speaker to be told that \"my thinking about my language is wrong.\" To great applause, he added, \"I don't need to hear that. I love my culture. My language is part of my culture, and I'm not gonna have someone change that.\" For Gallego, this episode still contains an important lesson. \"I hate to harp on this,\" he told me, \"but years ago when I tried to take down 'Latinx,' everyone was like, 'What?' I'm, like, 'Why aren't you guys listening to people?' \"\n\nIn January, 2023, after Senator Kyrsten Sinema left the Democratic Party and registered as an Independent, Gallego announced that he would run against her. Then, earlier than many other Democrats, he began calling the situation at the border a \"crisis.\" In May, 2023 , he supported President Joe Biden 's decision to deploy more troops to the border and criticized the Biden Administration for being unprepared to manage the surge of border crossings that was expected after the end of Title 42 , which had restricted the flow of migrants. That October, following a sharp rise in the number of apprehensions, he chastised the Administration for not taking the needs of his constituents seriously enough. \"Arizona's border communities have been on the front line of this border crisis,\" he told Fox News. \"We've worked, again and again, to get the Administration to listen to their concerns.\"\n\nBy the time Sinema dropped out of the race, in March, 2024, Gallego had left the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Publicly, he said that he let his membership lapse because dues had gone up significantly. But he also stopped calling himself progressive. When NBC News asked him if he still embraced the label, he said, \"I consider myself an Arizona member of Congress who works across the aisle with everybody.\" Last summer, he was the only Democrat who co-sponsored a bill intended to expedite the hiring of Customs and Border Protection officers.\n\nIn Gallego's view, he defeated his Republican opponent, the right-wing former television anchor Kari Lake, by talking about immigration as Arizonans do, not as Fox News hosts do. In one of her campaign ads, she said, \"We're not safe because of our open borders. We must finish the wall and stop the invasion.\" Gallego told me that, in reality, \"Arizonans are, like, 'We want border security, we want immigration reform, we want border trade.' \" He spoke about the Arizonans who \"go to Los Algodones to fix their teeth.\" (The town, a short drive from Yuma, Arizona, is home to hundreds of dental clinics.) He also asked, \"How many parents send their teen-age kids driving alone to Rocky Point?\" That's the small Sonoran beach city known in Mexico as Puerto Peñasco, about a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Yuma, Phoenix, and Tucson. Gallego mentioned how Arizona border cities benefit from the constant flow of Mexican shoppers buying food, clothing, and electronics. Thousands of Mexican nationals cross the San Luis port of entry near Yuma every day, to tend to Arizona's winter vegetables, and many students cross from Sonora to Arizona to attend school.\n\nThe mayors of several border communities endorsed Gallego rather than Lake. What he's hearing most from those mayors now, he said, is panic about the prospect of tariffs on goods from Mexico. \"If the President continues to say, 'I'm going to raise tariffs, I'm not going to raise tariffs,' what's going to happen is Mexican businesses are just going to cut up their contracts with American businesses,\" he said. (Since I spoke with Gallego, Trump announced that the tariffs were on again, then, two days later, said they were off again-sort of. About half of all goods entering the United States from Mexico-those that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement-will be exempt from tariffs until early April, when the issue will be revisited.)\n\nFor decades, Democrats have relied on moral arguments-the human right to mobility, the political turmoil that causes migrants to flee their home countries, and the many contributions that undocumented immigrants make to the United States-to defend the rights of immigrants. Gallego has also made them, and he still supports comprehensive immigration reform and permanent legal status for DACA recipients and noncitizen veterans. But Democrats have become more reluctant to articulate a positive case for immigrants, and quicker to call out progressives for what sounds like unconditional support for all immigrants, all the time. In January, Trump suspended the asylum system at the southern border. Long before that, Gallego had argued that the asylum system was \"being abused\": that asylum seekers had learned how to exploit the system's loopholes and knew what to say in order to meet its criteria for admission. He told me, \"To deny that it's being abused, first of all, you're setting up the whole asylum system to fall, but also you're losing trust with anybody who can think of you as an even arbiter.\"\n\nFor Sánchez Barba, of Mi Familia Vota, the real problem isn't blind support for immigrants by progressives but that \" MAGA extremism kidnapped the issue of immigration.\" He continued, \"The reality is that this is a nation that is addicted to cheap, exploitable, and disposable labor. That's it. Democrats keep falling into the trap that Republicans laid on immigration and need to take a stronger stand to be the party of a rational approach to immigration. It's unacceptable that we haven't had a real conversation about legalization, even for the Dreamers.\" Gallego is \"going to be in the Senate for the next six years,\" Sánchez Barba told me, \"and this is a great opportunity for him to be the kind of leader our nation needs, to oppose an anti-immigrant agenda that doesn't make sense.\"\n\nRepresentative Delia Ramirez, from Illinois, also wants Democrats to be more assertive against Trump. \"Our constituents have asked Democrats to stand up and do more-to stop being the minority party and become the opposition party. Right now, we have to use EVERY tool at our disposal-from withholding votes to supporting organizations litigating in courts,\" she told me over e-mail. \"Waiting for the Trump Administration to continue harming our communities before we act fails our constituents and erodes trust in their elected officials.\"\n\nWhen Gallego and I spoke last year about Trump's mass-deportation plans, he told me that, in his view, \"targeting criminals\" will be \"universally popular.\" Yet, he added, \"if the net gets cast very wide, I think that's when you get problems. You start deporting Dreamers, you start separating kids from families-there's not a humanitarian approach to this. I think there's not going to be as much popular sentiment for that as they think.\" When we talked recently, he predicted that the Trump Administration would soon exceed its mandate on deportations: \"I think, at some point, the President is so obsessed with quotas and numbers and not actual effectiveness, they're going to end up going after some real mass-deportation numbers.\" In that case, he said, \"I think you're going to see the popularity of his immigration policies really slide.\"\n\nGallego also believes that the popularity of Trump's immigration policies will wane once Americans realize how much they cost. \" ICE is running out of money,\" he told me. \"They just borrowed another five hundred million dollars from appropriations-so they're actually literally doing catch and release now of people they have caught.\" As of last month, the agency's detention centers were nearly ten per cent over capacity, and it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars to open enough facilities to meet the Administration's goals. And the military flights to Panama, or Guantánamo , or perhaps to El Salvador-President Nayib Bukele offered up his country's biggest prison to house deportees from the United States-are much more expensive than the charter flights used during the Biden Administration. Trump has said that there will be \" no price tag \" on his deportation efforts; in practice, the endeavor could over time prove to be less popular than he believes.\n\nGallego said that he will resist Trump if his policies harm Arizona. He returned to the case of Yuma, which has a four-billion-dollar-per-year agricultural industry. So far, Trump has not impeded the flow of Mexican workers to the area, but, if he does, Gallego told me that he will blame the President and the Administration for costing Arizona jobs, hampering the state's ability to recruit companies to import their goods through Arizona, and creating such a choke point at the border that growers \"lose a lot of product in the summer, because it's so damn hot.\" He also argued that closing the border entirely would undermine Trump's America First agenda, because \"we as a government had said, 'Stop doing shit in Asia. Come back to the United States, or come near shore.' \" Tariffs could have a similar effect as border closings, if they decrease the flow of goods crossing the border in both directions.\n\nGallego's vision for the Democratic Party is more pragmatic than progressive. He would hold Trump accountable when his policies do not improve the lives of working-class voters, but also stand back and watch him implement them, at which point, he predicts, there will be backlash and political consequences. \"With birthright citizenship, he did it right away and has been quiet about it since,\" Gallego told me. \"He knows that it's not a very popular position.\" He sees similar consequences for foreign policy. \"They absolutely have destroyed our relationship with our North Atlantic partners, our European allies,\" he said. And, unlike Bill Clinton, who, Gallego said, reduced the size of the federal government in a \"very orderly manner,\" the Trump Administration is \"taking a meat cleaver to the federal workforce without actually looking at programs. They wanted to move so fast, but they moved in a dumb, dumb way-and ended up hurting a lot of their base, by the way.\" It could get to the point, Gallego argues, that it becomes \"politically unsustainable, going into an election year next year, to be supportive of policies that Donald Trump and the Republican Party are doing.\" The risk, of course, is that it doesn't-and that Democrats' passivity harms their credibility, too. Defining Democratic success as Republican failure isn't the same thing as charting a positive path forward for the country. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Liberals, Radicals, and the Making of a Literary Masterpiece\n\nA newly minted university graduate heads home after a long absence, to the delight and trepidation of his widowed father, who waits for hours at the station. At last, the son arrives, handsome and grown-up. The father is thrilled. But the son has brought with him a friend, a tall, brusque, fierce-looking young man. This friend is clearly the senior one in the relationship, and the two have returned from the university with all sorts of notions. They are \"nihilists,\" they tell the father. Their creed is to subject everything to withering scrutiny and critique. Things soon grow tense at the father's house. At dinner and tea, where they are joined by the father's well-dressed, old-fashioned brother, heated arguments break out. To make matters worse, the father's estate is not flourishing. The peasants don't like his new progressive management system. He was hoping his son would take an interest. Now he is not sure that he will.\n\nThis is the setup of Ivan Turgenev's \"Fathers and Sons,\" or, more literally but less accurately, \" Fathers and Children ,\" in a new translation by the husband-and-wife team of Nicolas Pasternak Slater and Maya Slater. The book was first published in 1862, in Russian, and the action takes place a few years earlier, in 1859, on the eve of the emancipation of the serfs and amid furious debates over the future of Russia.\n\nThe father on whose estate most of the action takes place is Nikolai Kirsanov; his son is named Arkady, and his son's friend, and the book's most vivid and memorable character, is named Bazarov. Bazarov is from a more modest background than Arkady-his father was an Army doctor, and he, too, has been trained in medicine-but he towers over his friend through his superior energy and intellect. He has built around his training a vast philosophical edifice. All that is not concrete and scientific is a distraction or, worse, an obfuscation; the country and its élites, like the Kirsanovs, are rotten; everything deserves to be torn down. \"Show me a single institution in our modern life,\" Bazarov says, \"which doesn't call for total, merciless destruction.\" Though the label \"nihilist\" was largely a function of censorship-in its absence, the young men in the novel could simply have called themselves \"revolutionaries\"-it very much captured the rising generation's iconoclasm and impatience.\n\nThe book caused a furor upon its publication. Young radicals felt targeted by the portrayal of Bazarov; liberals felt that the book gave the radicals too much credit; reactionaries believed that Turgenev had permanently discredited the revolutionaries. Turgenev found himself defending the book, in countless letters and conversations, against criticism from all sides. Meanwhile, St. Petersburg, then the capital, was burning. In May of 1862, just a few months after the publication of \"Fathers and Sons,\" a series of fires engulfed the city. The government blamed Turgenev's nihilists; a number of young people, including some of those with whom he had sparred in print, were arrested. Some thought that Turgenev had in effect denounced them. He had been spending long stretches in Europe; now, embarrassed and discouraged, he decided to return there. In the years to come, he spent less and less time in his native land.\n\nTall, handsome, rich, and easygoing-\"Nature has refused him nothing,\" was how Dostoyevsky put it-Turgenev was also indecisive, inconstant, maybe even a bit unreliable. More than any other figure in Russian literary history, he embodied the tragedy of the middle, the failure of the golden mean ever to take root on Russian soil. Both conservatives (including Dostoyevsky) and radicals despised him for his watery European ideals. He quarrelled constantly with Tolstoy, despite many ties of family and friendship. Because of his willingness to coöperate with a government investigation of émigré radicals, he was estranged for years from his old friend Alexander Herzen. His ability to see the many facets of every person and every issue-\"He felt and understood the opposite sides of life,\" in the words of Henry James, who got to know him in Paris-served him well as a novelist. But this ability was less desirable in a political ally, or even in a pal.\n\nTurgenev was born in 1818 in Orel, about two hundred miles south of Moscow, in a wealthy but unhappy aristocratic family. His father, Sergei, was a military officer from an old Russian family that had fallen on hard times. A fine figure of a man, Sergei married a woman, Varvara Lutovinova, who was six years his senior and very rich, with several thousand serfs working her land. Sergei made it clear, the Turgenev biographer Henri Troyat tells us, that he had no intention of being faithful to her. Varvara accepted this arrangement and took out her frustrations on her children and her serfs.\n\nSergei died when Ivan was in his teens, and he remained in Turgenev's memory a distant, slightly brutal figure. \"I have never seen anyone more exquisitely calm, more self-assured or more imperious,\" Turgenev wrote in the autobiographical novella \"First Love.\" \"At times I would watch his clear, handsome, clever face . . . my heart would tremble, my entire being would yearn towards him . . . then, as if he sensed what was going on within me he would casually pat my cheek--and would either leave me, or start doing something, or else would suddenly freeze as only he knew how. Instantly, I would shrink into myself, and grow cold.\" The work is about a teen-age boy on summer vacation with his parents who falls in love with a beautiful girl slightly older than himself, only to discover that she is already having an affair-with his father.\n\nTurgenev's mother, Varvara, was an even more insistent presence in his life. She came from a family of vicious landlords, and she more than kept up the tradition; she flogged and humiliated her peasants with alarming regularity. \"I acquired my early loathing of slavery and serfdom by observing the shameful environment in which I lived,\" Turgenev wrote. As he grew up and sought independence from his mother, including by living in Europe, she cut off his allowance; near the end of her life, she tried, unsuccessfully, to have her manager sell off and even ruin parts of the estate so as to devalue the prospective inheritance.\n\nTurgenev studied history and philology in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and then Berlin, where he imbibed Hegel and roomed with a fellow-aristocrat, the future anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. He began his writing career early on, with a few long narrative poems, and soon gained entry into the literary world of St. Petersburg-particularly the circle of so-called Westernizers who had gathered around the critic Vissarion Belinsky.\n\nThese years, in the eighteen-forties, were difficult ones, Turgenev later recalled; censors would leave writers' proofs marked up with red ink, \"as if bloodied.\" The start of Nicholas I's reign, in 1825, had been met by a failed uprising of Army officers who came to be known as the Decembrists; its ending, three decades later, was accompanied by the humiliating Russian defeat in the Crimean War. The intervening years were a period of intense repression and censorship. The generation that came of age with Turgenev was aware of Russian backwardness and subjugation, but did not know what to do about it, or even, under conditions of police surveillance, how to talk about it.\n\nOne solution was Herzen's: he went abroad, stayed there, and became the most influential Russian political writer of his age. But another solution was offered by Belinsky. A beloved figure and a tireless debater, Belinsky proposed to make literature and literary criticism a forum for the most important questions facing Russia and the world. Belinsky encouraged Turgenev's early writing efforts, and Turgenev adored him. In one typically self-effacing passage, Turgenev recalled Belinsky's passion for argument, and his own occasionally more earthly desires. \"After talking for two or three hours, my youthful flightiness would take over, I'd want to rest, take a walk, eat some lunch,\" Turgenev wrote. \" 'We haven't yet settled the question of the existence of God,' he once bitterly rebuked me, 'and you want to eat!' \" Belinsky had reason to sense that time was short: he was racked for years by consumption, which finally killed him at the age of thirty-six. Despite their temperamental differences, an admiration for Belinsky would continue to color Turgenev's writing throughout his life. The Russian edition of \"Fathers and Sons\" is dedicated to his memory.\n\nTurgenev's first sustained effort in prose, \"A Hunter's Notebook,\" usually translated as \" A Sportsman's Sketches ,\" begun in 1846 and published as a book in 1852, showed the imprint of Belinsky's ideas as filtered through the mind of a born aesthete. It recorded the stories Turgenev had witnessed or heard as he tramped about the countryside near his family estate, shooting birds. A number of the stories are about the relations between serfs and their masters. Without ever saying so outright, Turgenev makes it plain that most of the masters are self-satisfied and ignorant brutes, while the serfs are ordinary people trying to go about the business of life.\n\nThe book created a sensation when it was published. Though the stories were relatively light and seemingly harmless when read on their own, taken all together they conveyed just how barbaric and disfiguring an institution serfdom was. The censor who approved the collection for publication was removed from his post. The future Alexander II, at the time the grand duke, later said that the sketches had convinced him of the evils of Russia's peculiar institution. A decade later, he signed the declaration that emancipated all the serfs.\n\nEdmund Wilson, writing in this magazine in 1957, argued that in these stories Turgenev had invented a new literary form: \"No prose tale before Turgenev attempts, through sheer technical precision, not merely to tell a story but also to hit on the head a social and moral nail.\" Turgenev was helped in this early achievement by the censorship-he could not have denounced serfdom outright even if he'd wanted to-but it was also his natural inclination as a writer not to preach.\n\nTurgenev was thirty-three years old when \"A Sportman's Sketches\" came out, and life was good. His despotic mother had died two years earlier, and he inherited a fortune, which he used liberally: he liked to eat well, going so far as to acquire a well-known chef for a thousand rubles, and he didn't mind loaning money to his friends. Some people found him a little too eager to please, or distastefully vain; Tolstoy, who lived with Turgenev briefly in St. Petersburg, couldn't stand how much attention he paid to his own grooming. But, from another perspective, Turgenev was principled and brave. In 1852, he had his first serious run-in with the authorities, after publishing a too praiseful obituary of Gogol , whom many viewed as a satirist of tsarism. This, on top of the politics of his stories about serfs, was too much for Nicholas I. Turgenev was arrested and spent a month behind bars in St. Petersburg, after which he was confined to his estate. The arrest, and the publication of his book, catapulted him to the forefront of Russian literature. Dostoyevsky, just a few years younger than Turgenev, was then serving a much longer and harsher sentence in Siberia; Tolstoy, a decade younger than Turgenev, was still busy losing money at cards.\n\nTurgenev's novels and stories in the next few years were a great success. \" Rudin ,\" his first novel, painted a portrait of the idealistic but ineffectual intellectuals of the eighteen-forties, able to commit themselves neither in politics nor in love. (The title character, Dmitry Rudin, was based partly on Bakunin.) \"A Nest of Gentlefolk,\" a story of disappointed love, showed the old Russian nobility at their best, trampled in their finer feelings by less scrupulous people, but holding on to their morals and their dignity. Throughout this time, Turgenev also published stories and occasional essays. He was in his glory. \"His art answered to the demands of everyone,\" the great Russian literary critic D. S. Mirsky later wrote. \"It was the mean term, the middle style for which the forties had groped in vain. It avoided in an equal measure the pitfalls of grotesque caricature and of sentimental 'philanthropy.' It was perfect.\"\n\nThis love affair with the reading public could not last. The reception of Turgenev's next novel, \" On the Eve ,\" from 1860, was far less kind. Yet another tale about love and politics, this one begins with two young men, a sculptor named Shubin and a scholar named Bersenev, vying for the hand of a pretty young woman named Elena. She clearly prefers the serious Bersenev to the flighty Shubin, and all seems well except that Bersenev can't stop talking about his amazing friend from school, Insarov. Insarov is a Bulgarian exile and a revolutionary, biding his time in Russia until he can return to his home country and lead his people to throw off the yoke of the Turks. Bersenev is adamant that Elena should meet Insarov; when she finally does, she falls in love with him, and they run off to liberate Bulgaria together. Insarov dies on the way, but Elena goes on without him. No one from her family ever sees her again.\n\nPolitically minded young readers were disappointed-especially by Insarov's nationality. Why was he Bulgarian? \"We understand why he can't be Polish,\" the radical critic Nikolai Dobrolyubov wrote, alluding to the burgeoning movement for Polish independence from the Russian Empire. \"But why he isn't Russian-in that lies the entire problem.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nDobrolyubov's review of the novel was seventeen thousand words long and appeared in Russia's premier literary journal, The Contemporary , to which Turgenev had for years contributed and whose editor was a close friend. The journal had published \"A Sportsman's Sketches\" and his first two novels; it had also been Belinsky's home, and Herzen's, and Tolstoy's. But in the mid-eighteen-fifties, keeping up with advanced opinion, it had taken a sharp leftward turn. In this, it was led by two young literary critics, Dobrolyubov and Nikolai Chernyshevsky. Unlike Turgenev and Tolstoy and most other writers up to that time, Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky were not landed gentry; their fathers were priests, and both had graduated from divinity school. This set them apart socially, as well as politically, from the older literary generation.\n\nThe new radicals were impatient with their predecessors, and the death of Nicholas I and his replacement by Alexander II, a young, reformist tsar, only made them more so. As often happens, a little bit of reform led to calls for much wider reform. The younger generation was in no mood to wait on the Tsar's good intentions. They were revolutionaries, and said so over and over, in very long book reviews, of which Turgenev was increasingly the target.\n\nIn later years, Turgenev claimed that \"Fathers and Sons\" was inspired by an encounter with a young Russian doctor on a train; the doctor amazed Turgenev by caring much more about his plans for curing cattle diseases than about literature. But another model for Bazarov, which everyone recognized at the time, was Dobrolyubov, and by extension the other young radicals. Turgenev saw in them a crude but powerful materialism that counterposed the needs of the peasantry against the vague consolations of art. Turgenev's friend Belinsky had proclaimed that art must have a social purpose; the new radicals were sometimes willing to dispense with art altogether. As Bazarov says, \"A decent chemist is worth twenty poets.\"\n\nThe final piece of the novel's background was more personal than literary. Turgenev had never married. Like his earlier character Rudin, he had engaged in various flirtations that brought him to the brink of proposing-including with a sister each of Bakunin and Tolstoy-but he'd always pulled back. And, as was common, he had slept with serfs on his mother's estate. By far his longest-lasting attachment, however, was to a married woman named Pauline Viardot, a celebrated French opera singer whom he had met in St. Petersburg in the early eighteen-forties and then followed around Europe; he often lived in the Viardots' house, as a close family friend and occasionally Pauline's lover.\n\nBut he did, in his early twenties, have an out-of-wedlock child, a daughter, with a woman on his mother's estate. Unofficially, he acknowledged the girl and took on financial responsibility for her. When she was eight years old, he sent her to France to live with the Viardots. In the eighteen-fifties, when he himself started to make a home in France, he and his daughter, now named Paulinette, began to spend more time together. Turgenev found it frustrating work. \"She does not like music, poetry, nature-or dogs-and that is all that I like,\" he complained to a friend back in Russia. This did not make her a bad person, Turgenev went on. \"She replaces the qualities which she lacks by other, more positive and more useful qualities. But for me-between ourselves-she is Insarov all over again. I respect her, and that is not enough.\" The invocation of Insarov, the Bulgarian revolutionary from \"On the Eve,\" coupled with the date of this letter (October, 1860, as Turgenev was beginning work on \"Fathers and Sons\"), led at least one prominent Turgenev scholar to argue that \"Fathers and Sons\" is also a book about Turgenev's relationship with his daughter.\n\nThe book feels jagged at times. Bazarov insults and annoys the Kirsanov brothers-Arkady's father, Nikolai, and uncle, Pavel-and then grows bored and persuades Arkady to go into town with him. There they drink and eat and meet a pretty aristocrat named Odintsova, with whom they both fall in love. \"What a body!\" Bazarov remarks. \"I wish I had her on my dissecting table.\" She invites them to her estate. This part of the book, where Turgenev returns to the familiar ground of people sighing over one another, is the weakest. But then Bazarov and Arkady go visit Bazarov's family. It turns out that the fearsome Bazarov is worshipped by his parents. His mother breaks down in tears at the sight of him. His father annoys Bazarov with his solicitousness. When old Dr. Bazarov gets up the courage to ask Arkady what he thinks of his son, and when Arkady tells him honestly that he thinks Bazarov will be a famous man someday, the father is overcome with emotion. Naturally, Bazarov soon grows bored of his parents, and he leaves to see Odintsova and then even to visit the Kirsanovs again.\n\nThe fathers in \"Fathers and Sons\" are not the tyrannical or distant fathers of the previous generation-they are not Turgenev's father. Nor are they the vicious serf owners of \"A Sportsman's Sketches.\" They are loving, out of date, and ineffectual. In fact, they are liberals. And still they cannot communicate as they would like with their sons. Perhaps they are too soft. They spent their youth having long conversations about Hegel. Barred from genuine political action by an oppressive state, they turned in on themselves. When Bazarov sees Arkady's father reading Pushkin, he scoffs. For Turgenev, who as a student had twice caught glimpses of Pushkin in St. Petersburg before the poet's death, this was borderline sacrilege. But Bazarov is right! Maybe Nikolai Kirsanov should read something other than Pushkin while his estate falls into ruins.\n\nAnd what of the sons? Arkady loves his father and seeks to find common ground with him; in the end, he gets married, returns home, and takes up the management of the estate. As for Bazarov, and Turgenev's attitude toward him, you can see why people were confused. Bazarov is brilliant and dynamic; he says something interesting nearly every time he opens his mouth. He is also basically a decent guy-when he shoots Pavel Kirsanov in the leg after the older man challenges him to a duel, he immediately treats the wound. At the end of the book, he contracts typhus from a patient and dies, too young. (Dobrolyubov, Turgenev's literary tormentor, died of tuberculosis in late 1861.) There are many things in the book that call forth sympathy for Bazarov in the reader.\n\nAt the same time, Bazarov is unaccountably rude. He yawns in people's faces. (According to Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov had once cut short a conversation with the much older Turgenev, saying, \"Talking with you is boring me.\") Bazarov is also, for a guy committed to science and the revolution, very horny. Of just about every woman mentioned in his presence, he asks, \"Is she pretty?\" He might say in his defense that the question cuts through a lot of romantic mumbo-jumbo. \"Take a look at the anatomy of the eye,\" he tells Arkady. \"Where are you going to find that enigmatic glance you spoke of? It's all romantic rubbish, moldy aesthetic rot.\" (And then: \"Let's go and look at my beetle.\") But there are also direct political criticisms of Bazarov in the book. Much of the time, he speaks of the needs of the peasantry. He will dedicate his life to the people. Yet he is an élitist. Discussing with Arkady a silly progressive-minded aristocrat of their generation, Bazarov says, \"I need fatheads like him. It's not for gods to waste their time baking pots, is it now?\" Arkady is shocked. \"Only now,\" Turgenev writes, \"did he glimpse the bottomless depth of Bazarov's vanity.\" In the future, this vanity would reappear as Lenin's theory of the revolutionary vanguard.\n\nTurgenev was advancing, novelistically, a line of thought that runs through all his work. Beliefs are admirable, strong beliefs perhaps even more so. But there is a point at which belief can tip over into fanaticism. Turgenev had seen this with Belinsky, and in Bazarov he re-created and dramatized it. Bazarov loves nature but turns it into a science project, loves Odintsova but feels bad about it, and loves his parents but refuses to indulge this affection by spending time with them. All of this, from Turgenev's perspective, is a mistake. It's well and good, in other words, to talk about the existence of God and the future of the revolution, but you need to take a break for lunch.\n\nThe profound ambiguity of Bazarov's character opened him to multiple interpretations. Most of the radicals were insulted by the way he was depicted-by his failure in love, and his flaws, and the fact that, in dying, he ends up being no more effective than the liberal fathers he disdains. \"He is represented as a vulgar male animal,\" one radical wrote, \"who cannot keep his hands off any presentable woman.\" Reactionaries, including the secret police, were delighted by what they saw as Turgenev's biting satire. He has \"branded our adolescent revolutionaries with the caustic name of 'Nihilists,' \" one agent cheered in a report to his superiors. But there were some radicals, like the essayist Dmitry Pisarev, who embraced the label and Turgenev's depiction, calling themselves nihilists from there on out. Turgenev found limited understanding among his literary peers, but one notable figure, Dostoyevsky, was very taken with the portrayal of Bazarov. He wrote Turgenev to praise the book and later created an extreme version of Bazarov in the character of Raskolnikov, who murders a pawnbroker and her sister in \"Crime and Punishment.\"\n\nThe book's publication right as the radical movement reached its early apogee, as well as Turgenev's remarkable quality of insight, gives it an uncanny position in Russian literature and life. In the period of reaction that followed the fires of 1862, the revolutionaries whom Turgenev had in mind when he wrote the book were crushed. Chernyshevsky and Pisarev were both arrested and sent to prison, as Dobrolyubov no doubt would also have been, if he'd lived; Pisarev drowned, possibly on purpose, not long after his release, and Chernyshevsky, banished to Siberia for two decades, became a broken man. When their mantle was picked up by, among other people, Vladimir Lenin, it was with a more conspiratorial, more determined flavor. Lenin worshipped Dobrolyubov and Pisarev for their iconoclasm and admired Chernyshevsky's novel \"What Is to Be Done?,\" written in prison in response to \"Fathers and Sons.\" He had nothing but contempt for Turgenev. But think of Lenin's famous remark about music-that he loved listening to it but tried not to listen too much, since it made him want to pet people on the head, whereas now was a time to smash people's heads. Was he echoing Pisarev, or Chernyshevsky, or, in fact, Bazarov, who gives his final verdict on the liberal gentry in his farewell to Arkady?\n\nYou gentry will never manage to get beyond noble resignation or noble indignation, and those are no good to anyone. You won't fight, for instance-though you think you're such gallant fellows-but we want to fight. No! Our dust will burn your eyes out, our mud will spatter your clothes-you're just not up to our level, you can't help looking admiringly at yourselves, you enjoy scolding yourselves, but we're bored with all that. We need other people to attack! Other people to crush!\n\nIs it art if it makes everyone mad? Not necessarily, but in this case yes. The new English translation, at least the seventeenth, is workmanlike and literal, with some inspired moments. It is also highly readable, and can occasion another look at the book, for those who've read it before, or a first look for those who haven't. I was surprised at my own reaction. When I first read \"Fathers and Sons,\" I was in college; all I cared about were the sons, their willingness (in Bazarov's case) to die for their beliefs, their certainty. Reading the book again, twenty-five years later, I found myself rooting for the fathers. What might they do to bridge the divide? And why were their sons so mean to them, after all the fathers had done? Sure, they weren't perfect, but they were doing their best!\n\nThat, of course, I see now, is what the book is about. This rupture between parents and their children is what happens, over and over, with every new generation; there is nothing for it, no remedy, no answer. Who is right in \"Fathers and Sons\": the fathers or the sons? They're both right, and they're both wrong, and neither will ever understand the other.\n\nTurgenev never got over the stormy reception accorded \"Fathers and Sons\" in Russia. He was abroad when it was published and afterward returned rarely. After the publication of his next novel, \"Smoke,\" in 1867, a mild love story in which one of the characters is a fervently anti-Russian Russian émigré, he had a final falling-out with Dostoyevsky, who came to see him in Baden-Baden and then told friends that Turgenev had declared himself a German. Turgenev spent most of the eighteen-seventies in Paris, where he became close to Flaubert . He was always welcomed and admired in Europe, seen as the representative there of all Russian literature. But in Russia itself, for nearly two decades, he was out of favor.\n\nOnly toward the end of his life, when tastes back home began to change and some of the old arguments were forgotten, did Turgenev find a gentler reception on his infrequent trips to Russia. Students held celebratory banquets for him; two young men recognized him at a train station and bowed to him on behalf of the Russian people for his authorship of \"A Sportsman's Sketches.\" He died in France in 1883. Henry James attended the farewell ceremony at Gare du Nord, before Turgenev's body was sent back to Russia. Two years earlier, revolutionary terrorists had finally succeeded in assassinating Alexander II. Turgenev's funeral, in St. Petersburg, was a major cultural event, for which the police made scrupulous preparations, in case the creator of Bazarov might bring out a crowd of Bazarovs and cause a fuss. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Tips for White Liberals Who Want to Be Anti-Racist During Black History Month\n\nIf you are a well-meaning white liberal, you understand that the most vile ailment currently afflicting society is the scourge of anti-Black racism that is foundational to the history of America. As this racism is perpetuated through institutional and systemic structures, you know that it is your responsibility to wield your privilege to help cure our nation of this disease (because, ultimately, it's all about you).\n\nShop exclusively at Black-owned businesses.\n\nSure, as part of your anti-racism work, you've made a concerted effort to support more Black-owned businesses, but to what end? Black people in this country are still facing dramatic inequality, so it's time to kick it up a notch. From now on, every dollar you spend will be dedicated to making America a more just nation. If you're unable to find a Black-owned business to provide you with the goods or services you need, you'll just have to make sacrifices, as so many have before you in support of Black liberation. Can't find a Black jeweller? Guess you're not getting engaged. Can't find a Black exterminator? Guess those rats are your roommates now. Can't find a Black toothpaste manufacturer? Guess your breath is going to stink. But, when you're unwed and foul-breathed in your rat-infested home, you'll know that you did it all for justice.\n\nFigure out how to stop subconsciously feeling safer when the police are around.\n\nOf course you believe in defunding and maybe even abolishing the police. If you didn't, why would you have attended two B.L.M. protests? Even so, for some reason, seeing a police car roll through your neighborhood puts you at ease, makes you feel safe in the knowledge that, ultimately, you are protected. In these moments, remind yourself that not everyone feels this way by smacking your head and saying, \"No! Bad white privilege! Bad!\"\n\nForget that the N-word even exists.\n\nYou are aware that this word has been used as a harmful racial slur by those aiming to violently oppress African Americans, but has also been culturally reclaimed by Black people. Now that it is their word, as an active anti-racist, you know that you shouldn't say it, think it, or even know it. Find a way to wipe this word from your memory.\n\nMake an actual Black friend in real life.\n\nThis is the year that you finally remedy your greatest shame as a well-intentioned, anti-racist white liberal. It isn't your fault that there aren't any Black people in your office, your neighborhood, or at your rock-climbing gym; it's just the world you've circumstantially inherited. Nevertheless, this is unacceptable. How can you be someone who supports national diversity and inclusion when you don't even have it in your personal life? Fix this immediately.\n\nMake sure that the reason you have a Black friend isn't just to say that you have a Black friend.\n\nWhoa, slow down there, buddy! Before you jump into finding a Black friend, you need to make sure that you're not just forging a relationship based on tokenism and making yourself feel validated, as that would just be another way in which you're centering yourself within the narrative and attempting to use a Black person as a projection of your own self-fulfillment. So, you should make Black friends, but they should be real friends, but they should be Black, but they shouldn't be your friends just because they're Black. Basically, you should make friends with them and not even see their color. But you do. But you don't. Get it?\n\nFind out who Cedric the Entertainer is.\n\nYour lack of familiarity with this cultural icon is a huge blind spot.\n\nThank Black creators and artists for \"sharing their truth.\"\n\nIf you see a Black artist-or engage in any way with Black art or content-make sure to take a moment to thank said artist for sharing his or her truth. It doesn't matter what they've created-music, poetry, dance, a painting, a standup comedy act, a TikTok. Take a moment, either in person or via social media, to say something to the effect of \"Thank you so much for sharing your truth; your art is a beautiful jewel that enlightens us all.\" This is always helpful and never annoying.\n\nStop misusing A.A.V.E.\n\nYou may think that you're relating to today's youth, but you are well aware that you didn't grow up saying \"and that's on period!\" As cultures become more enmeshed, there is a certain amount of linguistic diffusion that occurs over time, but understand that you're doing more harm than good with your ironic \"yas queen\"s and \"it's giving\"s. Hearing you speak in a way that subtly mocks a race's vernacular is indeed not \"fleek.\" While you're at it, you should probably go ahead and look up the etymology of every common phrase you use.\n\nDonate to a mutual-aid fund.\n\nMutual-aid funds are one of the most direct ways to help those who are struggling within this white-supremacist, patriarchal, transphobic, ableist society. So make sure that you donate to some of them from time to time. You know, if you remember. No biggie!\n\nThings you could have done instead of checking your phone .\n\nI thought I would accomplish a lot more today and also by the time I was thirty-five .\n\nI am a Tinder guy holding a fish and I will provide for you .\n\nCircumstances in which I will not pet your dog .\n\nFake pandemic introvert vs. real introvert .\n\nOther hygge -like Scandinavian trends to make your sad life seem intentional .\n\nEnter the Cartoon Caption Contest for a chance to appear in the magazine.\n\nFollow @newyorkercartoons on Instagram and sign up for the Daily Humor newsletter for more funny stuff.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Do Democrats Need to Learn How to Build?\n\nI grew up in the late eighties and early nineties in a pair of functional redbrick postwar apartments on the fringes of New York City-first in a two-bedroom in an eight-story building in Inwood, on the northern tip of Manhattan, and then in a three-bedroom in a twelve-story building in Riverdale, in the West Bronx. Each had a coin-operated laundry in the basement. The Gordons, friends of my parents, lived on the nineteenth floor of a taller building a few blocks away in Riverdale, and from their little balcony you could look east across the borough and see low-rise brick buildings much like mine, in which hundreds of thousands of people lived, little yellow windows against the gray Bronx sky. \"They were basic,\" Samuel J. LeFrak, who built hundreds of such structures in Brooklyn and Queens, said of these apartments. \"The windows opened and closed. You opened them in the summer and you closed them in the winter.\"\n\nAt the time, the city's population wasn't quite eight million, but to my mother it was an article of faith that this was an undercount-that census-takers were too nervous to fully explore the poorest neighborhoods, that illegal immigrants hid from the survey, that the true figure must be at least nine. She taught in public schools in Washington Heights and East Harlem, and each fall immigrants from new countries enrolled in her class: Cuba, then the Dominican Republic, then Ecuador. The world was vast, and we had so many affordable apartment buildings. Surely New York City would grow.\n\nWhat has happened since then has been a sort of rupture in the laws of supply and demand. First, New York got safe, in the nineties, and then it got almost unfathomably rich. I still remember a conversation in the mid-aughts in which my friend Will, who had gone into real estate, told me confidently that Russian oligarchs were now buying property not just in lower Manhattan but in Brooklyn. This seemed impossible in the moment but within a few months was very clearly true. In a way that hadn't been the case in my childhood, the city had become an obviously desirable place to live. And yet it didn't get any bigger. Newcomers continued to arrive-according to official statistics, the city has become considerably less white-but they were balanced by departures. The view from the Gordons' balcony has not changed very much. In 2000, New York City's population was 8,008,278. In 2023, the Census Bureau estimated that it was 8,258,035. In a safe and prosperous quarter century, the most important city in the country has scarcely grown at all.\n\nDiscover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.\n\nFor some liberal journalists and researchers of my generation, the stagnation of American cities has become a fixation. The progressive metropolises we love the most, and where the highest-paying jobs are increasingly found, seem to be having the most trouble growing, perhaps because they have the most trouble building. In 2023, seventy thousand housing permits were issued in red-state metro Houston, and just forty thousand in metro New York, which has three times as many people. (In the San Francisco and Boston metro areas, there were even fewer.) When urbanists looked into why that was, they tended to find not a single cause but a constellation. The idealistic progressive laws of the seventies-those mandating environmental review, safety and anti-corruption standards, historic preservation, prevailing wages, and, most important, local power over zoning-had meant to protect small communities against moneyed interests. But they had been manipulated by homeowners and businesses, and used to block all kinds of new construction. Good intentions had paved the way to what the political scientist Francis Fukuyama termed a \"vetocracy.\" As the Times ' Ezra Klein and The Atlantic's Derek Thompson write of this regulatory pattern in their book \" Abundance \" (Avid Reader), \"Each individual decision is rational. The collective consequences are maddening.\"\n\nSometimes even the individual decisions are maddening. In San Francisco, anti-abortion activists stopped a clinic from being built by arguing that it would violate local standards for noise and traffic-because of the protests they themselves intended to organize. Residents also managed to obtain historic-preservation status for a laundromat in an effort to prevent its demolition. (Twenty-seven per cent of Manhattan is shielded from developers because of various preservation covenants.) A Los Angeles project to convert a polluted aircraft factory into apartments and shops was sued twenty times in twenty years, under the same law. In Maryland, homeowners organized a petition to stall construction on an apartment building in order to develop a parking lot.\n\nEven public projects tend to get snarled in the same vetocracy. Adding a kilometre of subway track in the United States now costs twice what it does in Japan or Canada, and six times what it does in Portugal; in the past fifty years, the inflation-adjusted cost of a mile of interstate highway has tripled. A forthcoming academic paper detailing the long-arc history of urban development and its opponents, by the law professors Roderick M. Hills, Jr., of N.Y.U., and David Schleicher, of Yale, is titled \"How the Gentry Won.\"\n\nThese urbanists have been inching toward the political center, seeing the logic in development and turning against some progressive icons. In \" Stuck \" (Random House), by Yoni Appelbaum, of The Atlantic , a chief villain is Jane Jacobs, the standard-bearer of Greenwich Village and a left-wing theorist of neighborhood living. But the need to build remained a niche obsession until the Biden Administration, when some of the same intellectuals noticed that efforts to construct a green-energy infrastructure were foundering on the same opposition. Three years after Congress authorized $7.5 billion to create a nationwide E.V. charging network, only two hundred and fourteen individual chargers were ready. In the mid-aughts, an entrepreneur named Michael Skelly conceived a plan to build a vast wind farm in the barren Oklahoma panhandle and sell the energy to the federal government's Tennessee Valley Authority. Skelly secured the Obama Administration's commitment to buy his energy, but in the course of a decade the project slowly collapsed, as state powers dawdled and eventually refused to issue the necessary permits. Anyone who had been politically invested in the attempts to build high-rises in West Harlem would have noticed a familiar pattern. \"We are at a moment of history,\" Skelly is quoted as saying in \" Why Nothing Works: Who Killed Progress-and How to Bring It Back \" (Public Affairs), by Marc J. Dunkelman, a research fellow at Brown. \" Robert Moses could come back from the dead and he wouldn't be able to do shit.\"\n\nThese three new books explore such decelerations, and seek to move from urbanism toward a more general political philosophy. Klein and Thompson are perhaps the most ambitious. \"For decades, American liberalism has measured its success in how close it could come to the social welfare system of Denmark,\" they write, but those efforts have been complicated by the difficulty of supplying enough housing, enough solar panels, enough of what people need. They're aiming for a \"change in political culture\" through which liberalism, which has long acted to pump the brakes on building things, now works to \"speed up the system.\" Klein and Thompson want a \"liberalism that builds,\" not just in housing and green energy but in artificial intelligence and in drug development, too, areas where they see similar patterns of stagnation. Their goals are broad. This group of policies, which they call the abundance agenda, offers, Klein and Thompson believe, \"a path out of the morass we're in. A new political order.\"\n\nIt is an interesting time for so many prominent liberal thinkers to focus on dynamism, since the Republicans who hold power in Washington are in an accelerationist mood, too. In many ways, the conservative argument is more straightforward. Abundance liberals might hope to turn the federal government into a weapon against local vetocracies; Trump's Republicans simply want to destroy it, so business can flourish. The DOGE blitz of the past month has already led to mass and scattershot layoffs and threatened agency closures at U.S.A.I.D., the F.A.A., the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Department of Education, and, though some of these efforts are being contested in court, more are in the offing. Even people within Trump's orbit who had been skeptical of Big Tech when he was out of power now see a future in it. In Paris this February, just a few weeks after being sworn in, Vice-President J. D. Vance addressed a summit on artificial intelligence. \"I'm not here this morning to talk about A.I. safety,\" Vance said. \"I'm here to talk about A.I. opportunity.\" America's response, he went on, could no longer be \"self-conscious\" or \"risk-averse.\"\n\nAbundance, for elected Democrats who have embraced it, has offered a politics of growth, and perhaps even risk, that they can get behind, since it centers on an energetic hands-on government rather than an unfettered free market. These causes have moved quickly toward the core of the Party's self-conception, and its plans. The top item on the Harris campaign's policy agenda was an expansion of housing. Ritchie Torres , a centrist Democratic congressman from the Bronx and a likely candidate for New York governor in 2026, said in January that \"the abundance agenda is the best framework that I've heard for reimagining Democratic governance.\" In California, Governor Gavin Newsom struck a similar theme. \"People are losing trust and confidence in our ability to build new things,\" he said. It isn't just the urbanists who blame liberals for the problems with building; some leading Democrats do, too. According to John Podesta, the White House chief of staff under Bill Clinton and a senior adviser to both Barack Obama and Joe Biden, \"We got so good at stopping projects that we forgot how to build things in America.\"\n\nThese Democrats might, like Appelbaum, be thinking about the consequences for working people of being stuck in place. Appelbaum is a lovely storyteller, and in this gentle book he emphasizes how much the historical ability of Americans to change their circumstances has depended on moving somewhere else, from John Winthrop to Hang Kie, the immigrant small businessman who fought the efforts of the citizens of Modesto to confine his laundry to the Chinese part of town through zoning. Appelbaum reserves a special animus for the conservative sentimentality over the small town, and he is disturbed by how many progressives, like Jacobs, sought to re-create it in the middle of cities. He thinks that Americans were once such great belongers-to the Tocquevillian bouquet of churches, civic leagues, bowling clubs-because we were newcomers, seeking to ingratiate ourselves, and that, as we've stopped moving, \"these structures have atrophied, leaving Americans alienated and alone.\" Appelbaum is clear about where the fault lies: one study he notes found that, as a city's voters grew ten per cent more liberal, it issued thirty per cent fewer housing permits.\n\nLink copied\n\nDunkelman supplies the political theory behind this phenomenon-\"Why Nothing Works\" is effectively a history of twentieth-century progressive policymaking. The high point, he thinks, was the ambitious conception of governance inscribed in Franklin D. Roosevelt 's second Inaugural Address: \"We are fashioning an instrument of unimagined power for the establishment of a morally better world.\" Dunkelman celebrates the creation of the Social Security Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (what a run!), and he sees the same \"Hamiltonian\" spirit in Dwight D. Eisenhower 's interstate-highway system. Cracks appeared in the sixties, Dunkelman thinks, as liberalism started to reflect the baby boomers' distrust of the establishment. He deftly maps how anti-poverty and then environmental policy were designed to empower local communities to resist outside forces, putting liberalism at the service of stymieing grand plans. (He also castigates Robert Caro's classic, critical book on Robert Moses for giving a generation of readers the misapprehension that aggressive building was a political vice rather than a virtue.) \"Why Nothing Works\" is blunt and exhortative-the word \"Hamiltonian\" appears on a hundred and twenty-five pages-but Dunkelman is making a subtle point about the interplay between cultural emotion and social design. He writes, \"Progressivism's cultural aversion to power has turned the Democratic Party-purportedly the 'party of government'-into an institution drawn almost instinctively to cut government down.\"\n\nPart of the political charge these three books carry comes from the clarity of their disavowals. The natural move for political writers is to blame the other side; the abundance faction says, \"This one's on us.\" But somewhere deep in their combined thousand pages I began to wonder whether the liberal self-blame isn't a little overstated. That so many leading Democrats are enthusiastic about their arguments somewhat undercuts the case. The pattern these writers identify is that wealthy or powerful interests hire lawyers to contest a new project, by using a mechanism designed by liberals in the seventies. The abundance advocates emphasize the problem of ideology, because of who usually wrote the rules, but what's happening is also, more simply, about wealth and power. When it comes to the expense of New York's subways, the latest studies identify some specific culprits: the city builds many more mezzanine levels in its stations than is the case in stations overseas, and it hires more consultants. How much of that is really about liberalism?\n\nThe situation is starker when it comes to climate policy. Klein and Thompson note that infrastructure projects have to navigate more than sixty separate review processes from federal authorities alone, and that does sound unnecessarily challenging-probably the Migratory Bird Treaty Act could be downshifted. But it's flatly ahistorical to think that liberals are mainly to blame for the halting progress of American climate policy. As Klein and Thompson acknowledge, Jimmy Carter put solar hot-water panels on the White House; Ronald Reagan took them down. Book deadlines being what they are, these works all to a degree reflect the Biden years, when the questions were about whether we'd get faster solar or slower solar, and whether the transition would be led by China or by us. But the 2024 election was a reminder of why it has been so hard for liberals to re-create the conditions of Roosevelt's second term, which he won in a 523-8 electoral-vote landslide. Our far more divided country disagrees about basic goals. Right now, half of it-the part in power-doesn't seem to want solar or wind energy on almost any timetable. It would prefer to burn more coal.\n\nOn June 11, 2023, a truck driver named Nathan Moody lost control on the Cottman Avenue exit off I-95 in northeast Philadelphia, overturning the eighty-five hundred gallons of gasoline his vehicle was carrying. It ignited, killing Moody and generating so much heat that the bridge beneath collapsed. The accident took place in an especially important spot in the highway system of the Northeast. (On drive-time traffic reports, \"backup at Cottman Avenue\" is something like \"delays on the Cross Bronx Expressway.\") Pennsylvania's newly elected Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro , staked his reputation on a quick rebuild; he gave nightly updates to the press and on TikTok, and got a camera rigged at the site so the public could follow along.\n\nAs Klein and Thompson tell the story, the key action happened within the state's Department of Transportation, whose secretary, Michael Carroll, took advantage of the Governor's emergency declaration to suspend rules he otherwise would have had to follow. Carroll picked contractors to do the work and agreed on a price without waiting for competing bids, authorized them to pave at night when rain forecasts would normally have halted work, and generally gave speed priority over the usual prudence. When he came across a team of workers disassembling a roadway sign by screwdriver so that it could be reused later, Carroll recalled, \"I said turn the machine on and knock the goddamn thing over.\" In twelve days, astonishingly, the bridge was rebuilt, and traffic resumed.\n\nIn their day jobs, as columnists and podcasters who began their careers online, Klein and Thompson have advanced a wonky tendency in political journalism: an interest in the details about how government programs work. As they have grown in prominence-during the Biden years, Klein's podcast became one of the main places in which the aims and judgments of liberalism were evaluated-they have helped impose a technocratic sensibility and seriousness on the political conversation, along with a particular interest in different forms of futurism. Klein and Thompson's influence is one good reason to see these books as blueprints for a political movement. \"Abundance\" is a fair-minded book, and it recognizes some of the trade-offs that come with redesigning government for dynamism. \"These were risks,\" Klein and Thompson acknowledge, of the choices Shapiro made to set aside safety and anti-corruption rules, and they quote Carroll: \"It could've gone badly, but it didn't.\" They write, \"The process Shapiro used would typically be illegal. Yet national Democrats and Pennsylvania voters alike loved it. What does that say about the typical process?\"\n\nA basic conviction of the abundance movement is that stagnation represents something like a national emergency, which may require the government to take risks and liberals to sideline their quest for a Scandinavian-style social democracy. Much of the second half of Klein and Thompson's book focusses on supercharging American science, and here the authors edge toward a more ideologically nebulous futurism. They envisage \"a new kind of entrepreneurial state,\" namely, \"the government as a bottleneck detective.\" They hope to ease the immigration of talented scientists, limit the paperwork required of federally funded investigators, and use government money a bit more like a venture fund does, coaxing along potentially ground-shifting ideas by setting up prizes and helping to guarantee markets. The discussion of artificial intelligence is brief; there's a much longer one on the N.I.H. \"The U.S. has thrown tens of billions of dollars annually into scientific discovery,\" Klein and Thompson write. \"But it hasn't brought as much progress as we'd expect.\" Of course, the past half decade has delivered the COVID vaccine, breakthroughs in immuno-oncology, and a new class of obesity drugs so effective that they seem to lower all-cause mortality. This is a disappointing level of progress? Compared with what?\n\nThe obvious candidate is China. It is China that has twenty-seven nuclear reactors under construction, compared with zero in the U.S., China whose artificial-intelligence and drug-development infrastructures have begun to rival our own and whose production of solar panels puts ours to shame. Perhaps, Klein and Thompson suggest, we should learn from the ways that Beijing's model is more efficient than ours. \"China can build hundreds of thousands of miles of high-speed rail in the time it takes California to fail to build hundreds of miles of high-speed rail,\" they write. \"China does not spend years debating with judges whether to move a storage facility. That power leads to abuse and imperiousness. It also leads to high-speed rail.\" There are ways in which the comparison with China makes sense and ways in which it doesn't-given that Americans, on average, are seven times as rich as their Chinese counterparts, it's not surprising that China might still be in more of a Robert Moses phase. But thrumming in the background of the abundance books is an almost rhythmic impatience with the pace of change and technology. The real question these authors pose for liberals is whether we feel it, too.\n\n\"The year is 2050,\" Klein and Thompson write, in the introduction to \"Abundance,\" imagining a scene. \"You open your eyes at dawn and turn in the cool bed sheets. A few feet above your head, affixed to the top of the roof, a layer of solar panels blinks in the morning sun.\" They conjure a tech-enabled green future: inside your refrigerator are apples, tomatoes, and eggplants, grown on a vertical farm \"mere miles away.\" There is chicken and pork in the fridge, but no live animals were needed to make it. An autonomous drone \"drops off the latest shipment of star pills\"-medicines that slow cellular aging and reduce overeating. \"Thanks to higher productivity from AI,\" workweeks shorten and weekends extend. \"How different this era is,\" Klein and Thompson write, \"from the opening decades of the twenty-first century, which unspooled a string of braided crises. A housing crisis. A financial crisis. A pandemic. A climate crisis. Political crises. . . . We knew what we needed to build to alleviate the scarcities so many faced and we simply didn't build it.\" They ask, \"Why?\"\n\nChoose to build, Klein and Thompson say, and liberals can have this future. Of course, Elon Musk 's Republicans want to build something similar, and so do the technocrats in Beijing: we may well get lives like those they imagine, and yet a less liberal or equitable society. In their evocation of a leisurely utopia a quarter century away, Klein and Thompson stray from the pragmatic matter with which the abundance movement began, of affordable housing in the middle-class parts of big, expensive cities-the orienting geography of the Democratic Party, the LeFrak City of the mind. It's good to ask how fast we will get a transformative future. But another question, one that has more traditionally preoccupied liberal politics, is whether we will get it in the Bronx. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Why liberals are bad at politics\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA new book explains why you, dear reader, are part of the problem.\n\nby Sean Illing\n\nIf you spend a lot of time consuming news, there's a good chance you're doing politics wrong.\n\nAnd you're not only doing it wrong, you probably also think you're doing it right, which means you're almost certainly making things worse.\n\nThis is the thesis of a new book called Politics Is for Power by Eitan Hersh, a political scientist at Tufts University. His book is half lament, half rallying cry. A self-identified liberal, Hersh tries to understand why the left stopped pursuing power and instead started treating politics more and more like a spectator sport.\n\nHe coins the term \"political hobbyism\" to capture the problem. \"We participate in politics by obsessive news-following and online slacktivism, by feeling the need to offer a hot take for each daily political flare-up, by emoting and arguing and debating, almost all of this from behind screens,\" Hersh says. Many of us think we're politically active - but in fact, we're doing little more than signaling who we are to other people. We may be emotionally invested in politics, but we're not actually committed to solving problems.\n\nI spoke to Hersh about how politics became mere sport for so many people, why it's particularly a problem on the left, and what he thinks people should do if they really want to organize and change the world around them.\n\nA lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.\n\nWhat is politics actually about for you?\n\nFor me, politics is about working with other people to influence the government. And you can influence the government by convincing people who they should vote for, or by interacting with politicians and lobbying them; in either case, you are getting these other people, whether they're politicians or citizens, to take some action they wouldn't otherwise take.\n\nThe problem is that this just doesn't describe how most people engage in politics. This is sort of the starting point of the book.\n\nWell, you go even further than that. You argue that liberals, in particular, are doing politics wrong.\n\nThe reality is that the people who spend the most time consuming news and arguing online are disproportionately college-educated white people, and right now that demographic is predominantly Democratic. This isn't to say that this sort of behavior doesn't happen on both sides, but it's mostly on the left.\n\nIn a lot of ways I'm liberal, but the message of the book is conservative in the sense that it's prioritizing local engagement over national engagement. I think we need more institutional engagement with religious organizations, for example. Some people see that as a conservative message, whereas I just think that's what building power requires.\n\nThe issue here is something you call \"political hobbyism,\" an approach to politics that has become dominant. Explain what that is.\n\nPolitical hobbyist is a catchall term for the person who spends a lot of time consuming news or signing online petitions or engaging online with people about this or that issue. They mistake this for actual politics, but it's not because it doesn't contribute to power-building.\n\nWhy not?\n\nWhen you're a hobbyist, you're learning the wrong information and practicing the wrong skills. You are typically learning about big national news items, and oftentimes it's just drama. So a hobbyist might learn all the details of the Mueller report and feel that's important to know and will spend hours and hours on it.\n\nBut then if you asked him how he could get involved on some issues of importance in his local community or in his state, or where the pressure points are in his community to influence government, he has no idea. He's just caught up in the national news cycle and he's not actually improving anything.\n\nThe hobbyist is also learning the wrong political skills. Online politics is all about provocation and signaling outrage. But changing people's minds, turning your vote into many votes, requires empathy and face-to-face engagement. Not only are you not doing this online or when watching cable news, you're learning exactly the wrong skill set.\n\nWhy are white, college-educated liberals most likely to engage in political hobbyism?\n\nThere are a few reasons. College-educated white people are likely to be in a social setting where they feel it's a civic duty to participate in politics and to stay informed. They might find learning political facts to be intellectually gratifying. At the same time, the status quo for white, college-educated Americans is pretty good. They have good jobs. They aren't being conscripted into military service like past generations.\n\nSo as much as they might lament polarization or despise this or that politician, they aren't willing to roll up their sleeves and build political power. It's only if you don't need more power than you already have that you could possibly conceive of politics as an at-home leisure activity.\n\nNo one is spending more time learning facts and consuming news than college-educated white men. But research on real engagement - volunteering for groups and campaigns - shows it's overwhelmingly women and disproportionately blacks and Latinos who are doing the real work of politics. Comfort with the status quo among college-educated whites, especially men, seems like the most likely explanation.\n\nAs to why this is more of a liberal problem than a conservative one, right now the white college-educated population is much more Democratic than Republican. Of course, there's plenty of hobbyism on both sides, but right now this group tends to lean Democratic.\n\nBut there are examples of genuine activism on the left, like Black Lives Matter protests or the Women's March or the airport protests over Trump's travel ban. Are these just exceptions to the rule, or do you not consider them politically impactful?\n\nThose are all, in their own ways, very useful and meaningful protests. Sometimes protests are strategic, and sometimes they're cathartic. The cathartic ones are organized quickly, and the goal is mostly to let off steam. But other times, protests really are strategic in terms of recruitment or raising awareness of an issue.\n\nI think of BLM protests as strategic in terms of raising awareness, but it's also just a first step. The long-term goals of that movement require people to actually engage in conversations with police departments about what those police departments are doing and how they're doing it. And it requires working on the ground wherever you live to push the right buttons.\n\nI want the political hobbyist to struggle with this question, as I did while writing it: If they attended a protest or a march, what was it for them? Was it cathartic, or was it the beginning of a concrete plan of action? If it was the former, then it was just hobbyism. If it was the latter, then great.\n\nWhat do political hobbyists get out of this kind of superficial engagement with politics? Emotional satisfaction? Is it about signaling who we are to other people?\n\nIt's a shortcut to engagement. You get to feel connected to a sense of community and a sense of mission without doing any heavy lifting, which is partly why online engagement is emotion-driven. If you feel angry at something from your couch, you feel somehow connected to it, even if you haven't done anything.\n\nYou're preaching boots-on-the-ground activism and face-to-face interaction, especially with people on the other side. What do you say to people who are cynical about the possibilities of persuasion , who feel like the chasm is so deep that it's no longer possible to engage with political opponents?\n\nI guess I would say that they're wrong. Most of the people you engage with in real life are not at all like the caricatures in your head or online. Most of the people you'll encounter in your neighborhood or in a community group aren't raving Alex Jones followers. In reality, most people simply aren't that invested and don't have deeply held positions, and they're open to persuasion if you're open to being kind to them.\n\nI'm curious why you think political hobbyism has become so common. What changes in the culture or political media ecosystem have pushed in this direction?\n\nI know you've written a lot about changes in media technology, and I think that has definitely made it easier to engage more shallowly. It's not any harder to go to a community meeting once a week today than it was 30 years ago, but it feels harder relative to the alternative.\n\nI also think that deliberate decisions by the political parties and by the federal and state governments have taken power away from local groups, have taken money away from grassroots organizing, and have favored consultant-driven activism that has probably created a scene that favors hobbyism.\n\nAnd look, I think a lot of people just don't have the energy or time to do real political work, which is hard and demanding. And plenty of people don't necessarily make a deliberate decision to not get involved; they just don't see any pathways to meaningful participation. That's very much part of the problem.\n\nThe right seems to understand power better than the left, or perhaps there's something about the nature of conservatism that lends itself to the sort of politics you're advocating.\n\nI think you're onto something there. A bottom-up approach to political change that focuses on the local stuff or the local institutions, like churches or gun clubs, is just more common on the right. We used to think more about grassroots organizing focused on unions, for example, but unions have collapsed while churches have gotten disproportionately Republican.\n\nAgain, some of the key demographics of the left, like college-educated white people, don't attend any religious services at the same rate of people on the right, and so there's less community engagement. And some of the paramount issues for the left, like race or climate change, feel like non-local problems, and that itself is a deterrent.\n\nI think it's important to say that some of the decline in organizing on the left is the result of conservatives actively destroying mediating institutions like labor unions, which helped organize working-class voters in this country for decades.\n\nYou're right that unions have been undermined. Conservatives have done a good job getting the government to not favor organized labor. But no one is stopping liberals from forming their own aid associations or from forming churches that speak to them, or by building community organizations.\n\nWhenever I talk about political hobbyism, people squirm to find reasons why it's someone else's fault. One of the reasons I did this uncomfortable thing for a political scientist, which is talk about my own political engagement, is so that I could tell the reader I know all of their excuses, because I made them all myself.\n\nWhat's your advice for people who want to get involved and help build political power?\n\nI think they get started by building a cell of friends to do it with them locally, and they should be thinking about how they can dedicate at least one night a week to this, or a certain number of hours. The mindset is not \"How can I influence the next election?\" The mindset has to be \"I'm entitled to my own vote, but how many more can I influence?\"\n\nI profile lots of people in the book who are taking this kind of approach and accomplishing amazing things. They're showing that if you can get 100 or 200 or 1,000 people to share your values and to cast a ballot or show up to an advocacy meeting, you really can make a huge difference.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nCovid-19 and the complex politics of fear.\n\nby Ezra Klein\n\nIn recent years, there's been an explosion of academic work on the psychological foundations of our politics. The basic theory goes like this: Some people are innately more suspicious of change, of outsiders, of novelty. That base orientation will nudge them toward living in the town where they grew up, eating the foods they know and love, worshipping in the church their parents attended. It will also nudge them toward political conservatism.\n\nThe reverse is true, too. Some people are naturally more oriented toward newness, toward diversity, toward disruption. That base orientation will push them to live in big cities, try exotic foods, travel widely, appreciate weird art, sample different spiritualities. It will also nudge them toward political liberalism.\n\nIn Predisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, and the Biology of Political Differences, John Alford, John Hibbing, and Kevin Smith summarize the evidence:\n\nNumerous studies have linked these personality dimensions to differences in the mix of tastes and preferences that seem to reliably separate liberals and conservatives. People who score high on openness, for example, tend to like envelope-pushing music and abstract art. People who score high on conscientiousness are more likely to be organized, faithful, and loyal. One review of this large research literature finds these sorts of differences consistently cropping up across nearly 70 years of studies on personality research. The punch line, of course, is that this same literature also reports a consistent relationship between these dimensions of personality and political temperament. Those open to new experiences are not just hanging Jackson Pollock prints in disorganized bedrooms while listening to techno-pop reinterpretations of Bach by experimental jazz bands. They are also more likely to identify themselves as liberals.\n\nResearchers have sliced, measured, and analyzed these psychologies through dozens of schemas. NYU's Jon Haidt is known for moral foundations theory , which emphasizes the value structures underpinning our political beliefs. Political scientists Marc Hetherington and Jonathan Weiler study \"fixed\" and \"fluid\" personalities. Michele Gelfand tracks \"tight\" and \"loose\" societies. Some scales measure \" openness .\" Others measure \" authoritarianism .\"\n\nBut all of them converge on the same psychosocial cleavage. Put simply, conservatives are psychologically tuned to see threat, and so they fear change. Liberals are tuned to prize change, and so they downplay threat.\n\n\"Liberalism and conservatism are rooted in stable individual differences in the ways people perceive, interpret, and cope with threat and uncertainty,\" write Christopher Johnston, Howard Lavine, and Christopher Federico in Open versus Closed.\n\n\"Of the many factors that make up your worldview, one is more fundamental than any other in determining which side of the divide you gravitate toward: your perception of how dangerous the world is,\" write Hetherington and Weiler in Prius or Pickup.\n\n\"Conservatives react more strongly than liberals to signs of danger, including the threat of germs and contamination, and even low-level threats such as sudden blasts of white noise,\" writes Haidt in The Righteous Mind .\n\nIf that's true, though, why is it conservatives who are downplaying the coronavirus, and liberals who are sheltering in fear of it?\n\nA virus isn't just any threat, some researchers say. It is the threat at the root of these psychological cleavages.\n\nInfectious disease has, historically, been humanity's most lethal foe. Our immune systems have evolved to protect us, but so, too, have our cultures, societies, and psychologies. As Haidt writes, \"It's a lot more effective to prevent infection by washing your food, casting out lepers, or simply avoiding dirty people than it is to let the microbes into your body and then hope that your biological immune system can kill every last one of them.\"\n\nTo some researchers, much of human civilization is a lightly disguised effort at pathogen avoidance: The purity laws of the Old Testament are, from this perspective, a spiritually branded public health campaign. Spicy foods are more common in pathogen-rich areas because they kill bacteria.\n\nHow a society treats strangers is of particular importance. Strangers carry novel pathogens, diseases to which you and your community have amassed no immunity. A mix of psychologies helps strike the right balance between being overrun by outsiders spreading infection and reaping the benefits of trade and cooperation.\n\nDozens of studies have confirmed the relationship between the rate of disease and political attitudes. For example, in a 2008 paper titled \"Pathogens, Personality, and Culture,\" Mark Schaller and Damian Murray showed that worldwide, people were less open, less extroverted, and more sexually conservative in regions rich with disease. In another study , Randy Thornhill, Cory Fincher, and Devaraj Aran found that a \"high prevalence of infectious disease\" regionally predicted more conservative political values. Gelfand has looked at US states and found the \"tightest\" political cultures are in the states \"with the most disasters and pathogen prevalence.\"\n\nBut here we are, in the midst of a pandemic, and it's conservatives seemingly dismissing the danger, opening states and counties prematurely, refusing to wear masks, waving off the deaths of older people as a small price to pay. \"One day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear,\" said President Trump.\n\nAnd, more often, it seems to be liberals who're locked in their homes, who are warning the worst is yet to come , who are shaming anyone who dares step foot on a beach or forgets to don personal protective equipment. A recent Pew poll showed 61 percent of conservatives fear that state restrictions won't be lifted quickly enough, while 91 percent of liberals worry they'll be lifted too quickly.\n\nThis is the opposite of what a straightforward read of decades of political psychology research would predict. Early in the pandemic, it was plausible to argue that the divide reflected the virus hitting blue cities first, and sparing red counties its punishments. But Covid-19 has made its way into Trump country, and at any rate, studies show that political beliefs are a more powerful driver of views on the virus than personal experience.\n\nSo I asked political psychology researchers: Why are liberals more afraid of the coronavirus than conservatives? And what does that say about political psychology more broadly?\n\nIn conversations with more than half a dozen political psychologists, three theories dominated.\n\nOne is that we aren't seeing anything unexpected at all. John Jost, at New York University, suggested that my reading of the reaction was mistaking its psychological foundations. Liberals were acting out of care, not fear. And conservatives are panicked, he suggested, but showing it in odd ways.\n\n\"The fact that liberals are taking the scientific evidence and medical recommendations seriously does not, in itself, mean that they are more threat sensitive than conservatives,\" he wrote over email. \"All of the liberals I know have been self-sequestering to 'flatten the curve' - to save other people's lives.\"\n\nAs for the right, \"some conservatives are denying and repressing fear, but that doesn't mean they are cool cucumbers. Fears of economic devastation (and the anger by conservative activists in Michigan and elsewhere) may even reflect displacement of the fear. For all we know, Americans who are explicitly denying the problem are experiencing (even) more stress and anxiety than those who are not.\"\n\nA second camp argued that the tension is real, but it was being swamped by partisanship. Perhaps, in laboratory conditions, conservatives would be more afraid of the virus. But politics doesn't play out in laboratory conditions. Trump is the leader of the Republican Party, and his decision to downplay the threat, his dismissal of masks, and his clear desire to reopen is the stronger signal.\n\n\"Yes, I would expect conservatives to be more worried about virus X coming in from abroad,\" said Haidt. \"When Obama was president and America was threatened by Ebola, it was conservatives freaking out, demanding a more vigorous government response to protect us, while Obama kept steady on following scientific advice.\"\n\nTrump, it's worth noting, was at the forefront of the Ebola panic. \"Ebola is much easier to transmit than the CDC and government representatives are admitting,\" he tweeted in October 2014. \"Spreading all over Africa - and fast. Stop flights.\"\n\nHere, though, it's been the opposite. \"Trump laid out his view of reality very early: This is nothing to worry about, it's a plot to discredit me, and it will magically go away,\" Haidt continued. Trump's leadership \"overwhelms the small average difference in disgust sensitivity which would, ceteris paribus, have Republicans more concerned about contagion.\"\n\nFederico made a similar point. \"Chronic sensitivity to threat, disgust, and disease is one factor that should influence concern about Covid-19, [but] it is not the only one. Partisanship itself is perhaps the most important factor in shaping how people respond to issues or public concerns.\"\n\nGelfand said much the same. \"Even though groups tighten up under threat, that signal can be weakened. Groups follow their leaders.\"\n\nThis would confirm what we've seen throughout the Trump presidency. A 2018 paper by Michael Barber and Jeremy Pope showed that the more conservative someone believed themselves to be, the more likely they were to follow Trump when he took an unexpectedly liberal position on an issue. Trump's connection with his base has often, well, trumped his heterodoxies.\n\nA third argument, which acts in some ways as a bridge for the first two, is that everyone was scared, but for conservatives, fear was coming out more through acts of xenophobia than epidemiology - in part because that's where fear of the virus and Trump's natural politics find harmony.\n\n\"I can't resist noting that current events are perfectly consistent with my claim that those on the right, and especially the Trumpian right, are not generically more threatened but rather only more attentive to those threats they believe to be emanating from human outsiders (defined broadly to include welfare cheats, unpatriotic athletes, norm violators, non-English speakers, religious and racial minorities, and certainly people from other countries),\" wrote Hibbing. \"Thus, disembodied threats such as climate change, Covid-19, and economic inequality are not primary sources of concern for them.\"\n\nThat would explain why Trump oscillates between downplaying the threat of the coronavirus and escalating tensions with China over its response to it. When Trump wants to bludgeon the Chinese, he plays up the threat of the virus; when it comes to domestic governance, he plays it down. More than 70 percent of Republicans now hold an \"unfavorable\" view of China, a doubling of anti-Chinese sentiment since George W. Bush's presidency.\n\n\"In some ways, this pandemic was tailor-built for right-wing xenophobia, and we are fortunate (thus far, at least) that Trump's response was to downplay it solely to keep the stock market from tanking completely,\" said Jost.\n\nAnd that \"thus far\" is ending quickly. \"The National Republican Senatorial Committee has sent campaigns a detailed, 57-page memo authored by a top Republican strategist advising GOP candidates to address the coronavirus crisis by aggressively attacking China,\" reported Politico , and Stephen Miller is using the coronavirus to push a broader anti-immigration agenda.\n\nHere's my view: Political psychology is like the soil in politics. There are differences in the liberal and conservative soil - particularly in how they view threat, change, tradition, outsiders, and diversity - so different kinds of politicians, tactics, and movements take root on the two sides.\n\nTrump is, at his core, a suspicious, threat-oriented, traditionalist figure - he's nostalgic for the way things were, hostile to outsiders, angry over demographic change (he's even, in normal times, a germaphobe ). There's a reason he took root in conservative soil.\n\nBy contrast, former President Barack Obama is optimistic, cosmopolitan, and temperamentally progressive - he looks at change and sees hope, he looks at other countries and sees allies, he sees diversity as a strength. There's a reason he took root in liberal soil.\n\nBut once a politician captures a party, other dynamics take over. For one thing, partisans trust their leaders and allied institutions. Very few of us have personally run experiments on the coronavirus, or gone around the world gathering surface temperature readings over the course of decades. We have to choose whom to believe, and once we do, we're inclined to take their word when describing contested or faraway events.\n\nFor another, we all fall prey to motivated reasoning, in which we shape evidence, arguments, and values to align with our incentives. As Upton Sinclair said, \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\"\n\nMany Republican officeholders, led by Trump, think the coronavirus threatens their reelection because the lockdown threatens the economy. As such, they're motivated to believe that reopening the economy sooner is better, and attracted to evidence and arguments that support that position. Sometimes that means downplaying the coronavirus. Sometimes that means accepting its risk but suggesting the costs of reopening are worth it . In both cases, the argument is working backward from the desired conclusion.\n\nThe political tragedy for the Republican Party, and the actual tragedy for America, is that the politics and the substance here should have been aligned. If Trump had taken the disease seriously from the outset and mounted a competent and consistent response, his approval ratings would be higher today, and the country would be in a better position to reopen safely, and sooner. As it is, Trump has been denied the polling bounce other governors and world leaders have seen, and he's split his own coalition, forcing them to choose between their fear of the disease and their trust in him.\n\n\"The thing people often miss about moral foundations theory is that the foundations are just foundations,\" says Haidt. \"People don't live in the foundation of their house. A house must be built upon those foundations. Moral and political entrepreneurs build structures, over time, and invite people to live in them.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nCutting red tape is a social justice issue.\n\nby Eric Levitz\n\nWhen a Democrat contemplates their nation's biggest problems today, minimum lot sizes in suburban housing codes probably don't rank very high on the list.\n\nAfter all, the US president is a reality star turned insurrectionist , who's ordering investigations of his political enemies , subverting court orders , gutting entire federal agencies , and fomenting a global trade war. To many liberals, this may not feel like a moment for turning inward and sweating the details of blue America's permitting regulations.\n\nBut a new book asks Democrats to do precisely that. In Abundance , journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson catalog American liberalism's failures to deliver material plenty - the housing shortages that plague blue cities, the green infrastructure that congressional Democrats funded but then failed to actually build , the high-speed rail system that California promised but never delivered . Klein and Thompson argue that these disappointments have a common source: Since the 1970s, American liberals have been more concerned with obstructing harmful economic development than promoting the beneficial kind. Democrats have prioritized process over outcomes and favored stasis over growth, most notably through their support for zoning restrictions, stringent environmental laws, and attaching costly conditions to public infrastructure spending.\n\nTo revitalize American progressivism, they sketch an \"abundance agenda\": a series of regulatory reforms and public investment programs aimed at facilitating higher rates of housing development, infrastructure construction, and technological progress.\n\nKlein and Thompson speak for a broader faction of \"abundance liberals,\" which encompasses the Yes in My Backyard (YIMBY) movement, various pro-innovation think tanks, and scores of commentators. In addition to Abundance , the faction has recently produced two other books outlining its critique of American liberalism's evolution since the 1970s, Why Nothing Works by Marc Dunkelman and Stuck by Yoni Appelbaum .\n\nIt is surely true that blue states' governance failures are not this moment's most pressing crisis. But Democratic areas' inability to avert cost-of-living crises - or to build infrastructure on time and budget - is a political liability for the party. Such mismanagement has not only called liberals' competence into question, but also chased millions of people out of large blue states and into red ones over the past 10 years.\n\nCalifornia and New York have been shrinking while Florida and Texas have been growing - trends that will make it much harder for Democrats to win the Electoral College or Congress after the 2030 census. Disempowering an increasingly authoritarian GOP should be Democrats' top priority in 2025. But bringing abundant housing, energy, and infrastructure to blue states is conducive to that task. This makes Klein and Thompson's analysis politically relevant.\n\nNevertheless, not everyone on the left buys what they're selling. And Abundance has some real flaws.\n\nIn their concern with winning over progressive skeptics, Klein and Thompson sometimes elide the genuine tradeoffs between their vision and progressive ideology. For example, while they lament the stifling impact of various environmental regulations on housing and clean energy construction, they're cagey about precisely how, and how much, they want to change such laws. Rather than stating plainly that they're willing to reduce regulatory obstacles to fossil fuel infrastructure for the sake of abetting the build-out of renewables - a position Klein, who was a co-founder of Vox, has endorsed in his New York Times column - they argue that going into details about how environmental laws should be amended would be beside the point, since \"no individual law\" would solve all the problems they identify and \"What is needed here is a change in political culture, not just legislation.\" Such slipperiness may make Abundance more palatable to progressives, but also invites distrust.\n\nThis said, much of the left's criticism of abundance liberalism is off-base and unfair. One especially prominent charge is that the abundance agenda entails a retreat from the progressive movement's commitments to economic justice and equality. In this account, Klein and Thompson want Democrats to stop catering to the particular needs of poor and working-class Americans - through expansions of social welfare programs or labor regulations - and start concentrating on maximizing economic growth.\n\nThe New Yorker's Benjamin Wallace-Wells writes that the abundance movement views stagnation as a \" national emergency \" that requires \"liberals to sideline their quest for a Scandinavian-style social democracy.\" And he fears that the pursuit of Klein and Thompson's vision could yield a less equitable society.\n\nWallace-Wells nevertheless endorses some aspects of the abundance agenda. Other critics are less measured. Dylan Gyauch-Lewis argues in the American Prospect that abundance liberals prize \"growth above all,\" and that their ideology is merely a repackaging of \"free-market dogma.\"\n\nLikewise, The Baffler's Alex Bronzini-Vender derides the abundance agenda as a \"Koch-funded initiative\" aimed at \"reversing the Democratic Party's skepticism of neoliberal orthodoxy.\"\n\nThese criticisms are off-base in more ways than one.\n\nFirst, it's simply not true that Klein and Thompson call on liberals to abandon welfare state expansion or to pursue growth at all costs. They explicitly state that \"redistribution is important\" - their argument isn't that expanding the safety net is undesirable, but rather, that doing so is insufficient for maximizing ordinary Americans' living standards.\n\nFurther, Abundance argues that the federal government should play a larger role in managing the economy, so as to accelerate the development of socially valuable technologies and steer economic growth in an ecologically friendly direction. To say that Klein, Thompson, and other abundance liberals are free market dogmatists because they oppose some regulations is a bit like saying Joe Manchin is a Stalinist because he opposes Medicare cuts.\n\nBut those who critique the abundance agenda on egalitarian grounds are making a more fundamental analytical error: Combating regulatory obstacles to housing construction, infrastructure, and energy production is not just compatible with prioritizing the interests of working-class Americans; it is synonymous with that task. An economic system biased toward scarcity and stagnation is one that serves the already comfortable better than the disadvantaged.\n\nThe left's suspicions of abundance liberalism are understandable. On a variety of fronts, Klein and Thompson call for paring back rules and regulations that are coded as progressive, in the name of abetting faster economic development. The left is used to denouncing this general proposition.\n\nYet abundance liberals are not calling on Democrats to forsake genuinely progressive restrictions on production, such as the Clean Air Act or minimum wage, for the sake of maximizing GDP. Rather, they are imploring their party to judge regulations on the basis of results rather than vibes. Rules that ostensibly subordinate free markets to the public good - but actually undermine ordinary Americans' living standards - are not worth defending.\n\nSuch regulations fall into a few broad categories.\n\nOne consists of seemingly progressive - but ultimately counterproductive - mandates appended to public spending. In recent decades, liberals have gotten accustomed to using government-funded projects as vehicles for delivering \"wins\" (however minor or symbolic) to their coalition's myriad stakeholders. Yet as Democratic legislators multiply the number of different causes a discrete project is supposed to serve, they often undermine their policy's core purpose.\n\nSan Francisco's approach to public housing is one of Abundance 's signature examples of this phenomenon. The Golden Gate City suffers from one of the highest homelessness rates in the United States. Increasing the supply of publicly subsidized housing should therefore be one of its government's priorities.\n\nYet the city's public housing policy is not designed to maximize the number of affordable homes in San Francisco - but rather, to build some affordable homes, while promoting small businesses, signaling concern for disabled people, improving the aesthetic quality of the city's architecture, increasing employment among local construction workers, and furthering a wide array of other liberal causes.\n\nThe rules that San Francisco has attached to its affordable housing program may sound progressive on their face. The city reserves publicly subsidized housing contracts for small builders, in a bid to combat the power of big developers. It also requires public housing projects to pass a review by the Mayor's Office of Disability and the San Francisco Arts Commission, hire locally, buy power from the city's public utility, and meet a panoply of other criteria.\n\nBut each of these provisions increases the costs of construction. Prohibiting large contractors from building affordable homes leads to delays, as there are only so many small construction companies in the Bay Area and each has limited capacity, by definition. Ensuring that housing is accessible for the disabled is surely vital. Yet all housing projects in the United States must already be compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act; mandating an additional review by the San Francisco Mayor's Office just adds a redundant layer of bureaucratic processing. And while pretty buildings are preferable to the alternative, when thousands of San Franciscans are going unhoused, architectural aesthetics should take a backseat to rapidly growing the affordable housing stock.\n\nTaken together, these little rules add tens of millions of dollars to the price of every affordable housing project in the city. The typical publicly subsidized apartment building in San Francisco takes more than 6 years to build and costs more than $600,000 per unit. By contrast, a private philanthropy in the city recently erected 145 studio apartments for the chronically homeless in three years, at a cost of just $400,000 per unit. This efficiency is derived largely from the fact that privately funded housing projects don't need to comply with as many requirements as public projects do.\n\nSaying that San Francisco should cut red tape in its affordable housing program may sound like a conservative sentiment. But in its actual effects, that red tape is reducing the supply of affordable housing while reinforcing the impression that the government cannot build things as competently as the private sector. These do not seem like progressive outcomes.\n\nAbundance liberals tell a similar story about zoning restrictions.\n\nAmerican municipalities in general - and Democratic ones in particular - heavily restrict the types of housing that the private sector can build. It is illegal to construct anything but a detached single-family home on roughly 75 percent of America's residential land. Local laws add various other cost-increasing limitations on housing development, from large minimum lot sizes to parking mandates to design requirements.\n\nThe progressive case against restrictive zoning is straightforward: Affluent suburbs use single-family zoning to keep out working-class families, who might be able to afford an apartment in their municipalities but can't shoulder the expense of a large house with a yard.\n\nMore broadly, making it illegal to build multi-family housing in most of the country ensures scarcity. According to some estimates, America has 4.5 million fewer homes than its people require. This shortage increases the value of our nation's existing housing stock - which is good for homeowners and landlords but bad for renters. A policy that benefits those who own property at the expense of those who don't is regressive by any definition.\n\nMany progressives have accepted the force of this argument. But some further to the left still disdain the push to liberalize zoning laws. And their aversion to that project is not difficult to understand. The idea that one of America's biggest economic problems can be mitigated by loosening restrictions on free enterprise is ideologically unpalatable for many.\n\nBronzini-Vender's essay in The Baffler well illustrates many leftists' allergy to this argument. In it, he argues that abundance liberals are selling the public a fiction: Unleashing homebuilders from \"zoning regulations\" would increase Americans' living standards, since the \"private sector would supply more goods at lower costs- if only it could .\"\n\nHe suggests this simply is not plausible and \"betrays a deep misunderstanding of capitalist production\": Firms do not want prices to fall as that would erode their profit margins, so they will choke off production long before it starts substantially increasing affordability.\n\nThere are a few problems with this reasoning. The first is empirical. Capitalist production has, in fact, routinely yielded more goods at lower costs. Since 2000, the prices of durable consumer goods in the US have fallen by roughly 25 percent .\n\nAnd in the realm of housing specifically, zoning reforms have led to increased production and greater affordability . In Minneapolis, the lifting of various zoning restrictions in 2018 was followed by a surge in housing construction and a decline in the city's median rent: Adjusted for local earnings, a home in Minneapolis was 20 percent cheaper in 2023 than it had been in 2017. In New Zealand, the city of Auckland's experiment with zoning liberalization yielded similar results.\n\nThe second problem with Bronzini-Vender's argument is theoretical. It assumes that the only way capitalist competition can yield lower prices is by forcing companies to accept lower profit margins. And since developers do not want their profits to fall, he reasons that they will tacitly collude to limit housing production, irrespective of zoning laws.\n\nThis is not a sound economic analysis. If you reduce how much it costs to produce a unit of housing - by legalizing apartment buildings or eliminating expensive regulatory requirements - then developers can charge lower prices while keeping their margins constant.\n\nFurther, firms can outcompete each other on price - without forfeiting profitability - if they increase their productivity. Durable goods have not become cheaper over the past quarter century because manufacturers and retailers have become more altruistic or less profitable, but rather because they've increased the amount of stuff they can supply per worker hour. (Some of this productivity increase is the result of outsourcing production to low-wage countries, but much of it is from innovations in production and logistics.)\n\nThe National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the federal government to draft statements analyzing the environmental impacts of its decisions. When the law was first enacted, these statements were as short as 10 pages. Today, the average one is 600 pages long.\n\nAs Klein and Thompson note, between 1935 and 1970, construction productivity steadily rose in the US. But over the past half-century, it has actually fallen. Zoning reform could plausibly reverse that trend by making it easier to mass produce sections of housing in factories, a process known as modular construction ; as is, in order to conform with housing regulations, builders typically need to construct homes almost entirely onsite.\n\nMere deregulation will not ensure universal housing affordability. It will never be profitable to provide housing to low-income people, in the absence of public subsidies. And the private sector is liable to underproduce housing for middle-income people as well. The government can help fill in these gaps by creating public developers , which build market-rate housing and then reinvest their proceeds into new construction (the left flank of the abundance movement has been popularizing the public developer model for years now).\n\nNevertheless, the private sector could produce far more housing than it does, were it not for regulatory restrictions. A freer housing market would therefore make America richer and more equal. This fact may make some progressives uncomfortable. But defending our favorite ideological abstractions should not take precedence over improving people's lives.\n\nMost controversially, abundance liberals argue that some environmental regulations are undermining shared prosperity, trust in government, and the green transition.\n\nTheir complaint is not with environmental laws that directly constrain pollution, such as the Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act. The issue lies primarily with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its state-level equivalents. NEPA does not actually ban any pollutant or set any specific constraints on industrial production. Rather, the law mandates a process: Federal bureaucracies need to consider the environmental impact of their decisions, and draft statements outlining those impacts.\n\nAs Dunkelman explains, the law was intended merely to encourage government agencies to contemplate ecological concerns before greenlighting various projects, not to reduce their autonomy over such decisions. But activist lawyers took an expansive interpretation of the statute: In their view, if the government's environmental impact statement underestimated the ecological implications of a given project, then private citizens and community groups could sue to block that project in court. And a series of judicial rulings enshrined this interpretation of the law.\n\nMany states proceeded to draft their own versions of NEPA, some of which applied its requirements to private projects as well as public ones. The effect was to render economic development of all kinds slower and more expensive. To ward off litigation, governments were forced to make their environmental impact statements lengthy and exhaustive: When the law was first enacted, those statements were as short as 10 pages. In 2022, the average one ran 600 pages long and took four and a half years to complete.\n\nAnd once completed, those statements still need to make it through a legal gauntlet before the ground on a given project can actually be broken.\n\nAll this has made building infrastructure in the US radically more expensive. Between the 1960s and 1980s, the cost of building a mile of interstate highway in America tripled . Mass transit was similarly impacted. It cost New York $2.6 billion to construct each mile of its Second Avenue Subway. By contrast, at around the same time, social democratic Copenhagen built a rail line for just $323 million per mile, and Paris built one for $320 million per mile.\n\nNEPA and its state-level equivalents also inhibit housing construction: In Berkeley, California, locals delayed the building of new undergraduate dorms through a three-year-long lawsuit, in which they argued that the project violated the California Environmental Quality Act, since enabling more college students to live in Berkeley would increase noise pollution.\n\nThis state of affairs undermines trust in the public sector's competence, while making infrastructure and housing more expensive, raising tax burdens, and slowing economic growth.\n\nThe Democratic Party's complacency about these outcomes bespeaks an insensitivity to working-class priorities and interests. According to some leftwing narratives, Democrats took an ideological turn in the 1970s, one that led them to sacrifice the interests of blue-collar Americans to the pursuit of \"growth at all costs.\" But on some policy fronts, this gets the story backward. Democrats became less committed to economic growth in the seventies, largely because they started prioritizing educated middle-class people's ideological and quality-of-life concerns over the material interests of working people.\n\nThe environmental movement of the 1970s was overwhelmingly comprised of economically comfortable college graduates, many of whom regarded economic growth as undesirable and unsustainable , a position rejected by the vast majority of working-class voters. As political scientist Ronald Inglehart showed, blue-collar Americans were much less likely than their more affluent compatriots to prioritize environmental concerns over economic ones .\n\nAnd working-class voters' priorities were well-founded: The costs of a regulatory system biased toward stasis and scarcity are more burdensome for those who do not yet enjoy material security than for those who do. As civil rights icon and trade unionist Bayard Rustin lamented in 1976, \"the vanguard of the environmental movement , themselves members largely of the upper classes, have often sought policies that are clearly detrimental, and in some cases-the growth controversy being the most significant example-destructive to the needs of those less better off.\"\n\nMany of the environmental movement's achievements were laudable, and greatly improved and extended the lives of ordinary Americans. And the harms of NEPA aren't all attributable to earnest environmentalists: Well-heeled interests have exploited the law to obstruct all manner of economic development. Yet refusing to pare back the scope of NEPA and similar laws in light of such abuse was a choice - one that constrained economic opportunity and diminished the federal government's capacity to build public works.\n\nWhat makes NEPA and its ilk particularly perverse in the present moment, however, is that they are making America's greatest ecological challenge - climate change - more difficult to meet.\n\nThe reason for this is simple: Building a clean energy economy requires constructing gargantuan amounts of new infrastructure (vast solar installations, wind farms, transmission lines, and geothermal plants, among other things). Maintaining a carbon economy, by contrast, requires building scarcely any, since the existing energy system is built around the needs and capacities of fossil fuels. A regulatory regime that favors the status quo is therefore one that favors fossil fuels. As of 2021, NEPA reviews were holding up twice as many green projects as carbon energy ones . According to an analysis cited by Klein and Thompson, 95 percent of energy projects that are looking to connect to the grid - but which are as yet obstructed by permitting - consist of solar, battery storage, or wind power.\n\nPro-growth deregulatory policies are not sufficient for achieving shared prosperity. Indeed, such proposals aren't even adequate for realizing Klein and Thompson's vision for \"abundance,\" which also entails increasing government funding for technological development, among other things.\n\nBut loosening some regulatory restrictions on housing and infrastructure development would directly advance many progressive economic goals - while indirectly making it easier to expand the social welfare state. After all, higher economic growth translates into higher government revenues, which can then be redistributed to the economically disadvantaged. The abundance agenda is also compatible with increasing workers' bargaining power through sectoral bargaining (even as there exist some genuine conflicts between the narrow interests of discrete unions and the achievement of material plenty).\n\nAbundance is directed at a progressive audience and aimed at winning an argument internal to blue America. In the current moment, this may strike some readers as myopic. Even if all progressives decided tomorrow to prioritize making it easier for the federal government to do big things, Elon Musk would still be gutting its capacity to execute its most basic functions . Even if permitting issues weren't stymying the green transition, Donald Trump would be .\n\nAnd Klein and Thompson do not fully grapple with the challenge that the GOP's radicalization poses to their ambitions. Much of the abundance agenda is aimed at increasing the administrative state's power, at the expense of the judiciary's. This strikes me as indispensable for realizing liberalism's long-term goals. But today, it would entail giving Trump and Musk an even freer hand to reshape government to their reactionary whims.\n\nNevertheless, abundance liberalism remains relevant. The MAGA movement is not the reason why New York can't build enough housing , California can't build high-speed rail , and Massachusetts can't build a transmission line between its cities and Quebec's hydropower plants. Democrats have full control of government in some of America's largest and wealthiest states. They have the power to prove that they can deliver rising living standards and falling costs for ordinary people.\n\nThere are many reasons why blue states have had such limited success on these fronts. But one is that progressives have not mounted a unified front against zoning restrictions that help landlords gouge tenants, environmental laws that enable rich NIMBYs to block renewable energy, and liberal policies that seek to advance so many disparate priorities that they end up achieving none. With any luck, Abundance will bring us a little closer to such a consensus.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nCritics on the left and right are waging war on liberalism. And liberals don't seem to have a good defense.\n\nby Zack Beauchamp\n\nShortly after its post-World War I creation, the foundations of Germany's Weimar Republic began to quake. In 1923, Hitler staged an abortive coup attempt in Bavaria, the so-called Beer Hall Putsch - a failure that nonetheless turned Hitler into a reactionary celebrity, a sign of German discontent with the post-war political order.\n\nOne contemporary observer, a legal theorist in his mid-30s named Carl Schmitt, found the seeds of the crisis within the idea of liberalism itself. Liberal institutions like representative democracy, and the liberal ideal that all a nation's citizens can be treated as political equals, were in his view a sham. Politics at its core is not about compromise between equal individuals but instead conflict between groups.\n\n\"Even if Bolshevism is suppressed and Fascism held at bay, the crisis of contemporary parliamentarism would not be overcome in the least,\" he wrote in 1926. \"It is, in its depths, the inescapable contradiction of liberal individualism and democratic homogeneity.\"\n\nSchmitt's critique of liberalism proved terrifyingly accurate. The struggle between the Nazis and their opponents could not be resolved through parliamentary compromise; the Weimar Republic fell to fascism and took the rest of the continent down with it.\n\nI've been thinking about Schmitt a lot lately. Not about his dark fate - he became an enthusiastic Nazi - but instead about his prescience. Schmitt saw something in German politics, deep flaws in its liberal order, before they became obvious to other political observers and ordinary citizens. His philosophical critique predicted political reality.\n\nSchmitt haunts our political moment because we are seeing a flowering of criticism of American liberalism. In recent years, serious thinkers on both the left and right have launched a sustained assault on the United States' founding intellectual credo.\n\nThese criticisms do not arise in a vacuum. They stem from real-world crises, most notably the 2008 Great Recession and the rise of far-right populists like Donald Trump to power. These shocks to the system show, in the eyes of liberalism's contemporary critics, that something is profoundly wrong with the fundamental ideas that define our politics. It is a belief that \"the liberal idea has become obsolete,\" as Russian President Vladimir Putin recently declared .\n\nUnlike Schmitt and Putin, the intellectual critics of liberalism opponents do not typically challenge democracy itself. But they are united in believing that American liberalism as currently constituted is past its expiration date, that it is buckling under the weight of its contradictions. Their arguments tap into a deep sense of discontent among the voting public, a collapse of trust in the political establishment, and a growing sense that institutions like Congress aren't delivering what the public needs.\n\nOn the right, the anti-liberals locate the root of the problem in liberalism's social doctrines, its emphasis on secularism and individual rights. In their view, these ideas are solvents breaking down America's communities and, ultimately, dissolving the very social fabric the country needs to prosper.\n\nLiberalism \"constantly disrupts deeply cherished traditions among its subject populations, stirring unrest, animosity, and eventually political reaction and backlash,\" Harvard law professor Adrian Vermeule , one of the most prominent of the reactionary anti-liberals, said in a May speech.\n\nLeft anti-liberals, by contrast, pinpoint liberal economic doctrine as the source of our current woes. Liberalism's vision of the economy as a zone of individual freedom, in their view, has given rise to a deep system of exploitation that makes a mockery of liberal claims to be democratic - an oppressive system referred to as \"neoliberalism.\"\n\n\"Neoliberalism in any guise is not the solution but the problem,\" Nancy Fraser , a professor at the New School, writes. \"The sort of change we require can only come from elsewhere, from a project that is at the very least anti-neoliberal, if not anti-capitalist.\"\n\nThe defenses from America's liberal intellectual elite have been weak at best. The most prominent defenses of liberalism today are either laundry lists of its past glories or misplaced attacks on \"identity politics\" and \"political correctness,\" neither of which are adequate to the challenge presented by liberalism's newly vital critics on the reactionary right or socialist left.\n\nIf liberalism is to endure, liberals have to join the fight. And that starts with understanding why liberalism is in trouble - and just what, exactly, it's up against.\n\nFor a word that's so omnipresent, liberalism is notoriously difficult to define.\n\nIn the context of political philosophy , liberalism refers to a school of thought that takes freedom, consent, and autonomy as foundational moral values. Liberals agree that it is generally wrong to coerce people, to seize control of their bodies or force them to act against their will (though they disagree among themselves on many, many whys and hows of the matter).\n\nGiven that people will always disagree about politics, liberalism's core aim is to create a generally acceptable mechanism for settling political disputes without undue coercion - to give everyone a say in government through fair procedures, so that citizens consent to the state's authority even when they disagree with its decisions.\n\nThis foundational liberal vision is typically associated with a group of European and American thinkers - from John Locke in the 17th century to John Rawls in the 20th - and thus often treated as a Western political inheritance. But seeing liberalism as a product of a particular cultural tradition is a mistake.\n\nAs Amartya Sen argued in a brilliant 1997 essay , many of the core principles we identify with liberalism today - religious toleration, popular sovereignty, equal freedom for all citizens - can be found in writings from pre-modern Europe, the ancient Buddhist tradition, and a 16th-century Indian king, among a range of sources. Liberalism has taken root in diverse societies across the globe today, from Japan to Uruguay to Namibia.\n\nSen's paper suggests that instead of defining liberalism by books written by dead white men, it makes more sense to treat it as a set of parts: a grouping of principles and animating ideas that, when combined, add up to an overarching framework for understanding political life.\n\nOf these components, at least four political principles are common to the various species of liberalism (all of which relate to its core moral premise about freedom). They are familiar to most citizens in liberal regimes: democracy, the rule of law, individual rights, and equality.\n\nThese ideas - the minimalist core of liberalism - are so foundational to political life in advanced democracies that they're simply taken for granted, with debates about public policy taking place inside liberalism's parameters.\n\nBush-era American conservatism was a right-wing species of liberalism; what Americans call \"liberalism\" is a relatively modest form of left-liberalism. Germany's Christian Democrats, India's Congress, Cape Verde's PAICV, and Argentina's Republican Proposal are politically diverse parties, some more conservative by their country's standards and others more left-leaning, but they're all broadly liberal.\n\nTo challenge liberalism is thus to not merely engage in ordinary political argumentation. It is to call into question the entire operating system that defines the world's democracies. It is, by its nature, a radical claim.\n\nBut these are radical times. Several trends and shock events have combined to create a sense of rolling crisis. This certainly traces back to the Great Recession; arguably, it began as far back as the 9/11 attacks. But what's clear is that liberalism's peril became acute in 2016, when the twin shocks of Brexit and Trump proved that illiberal right-wing populism had emerged as a serious challenge to liberal hegemony.\n\nBy one count, illiberal right-wing populists controlled the governments of least 11 different countries in 2018; in 1990, they controlled none. Trump is the most famous example, but he has peers in countries as influential as Brazil and India. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has openly described his political vision as \"illiberal,\" essentially dismantled Hungarian liberal democracy ; Poland's ruling Law and Justice party is well on the way to doing the same . Combine these outright victories with the rising popularity of far-right parties in many other European countries, and it looks like liberalism is at risk of being overthrown by the voters that it's supposed to be serving.\n\nThe rise of such a challenge to liberalism has highlighted how the liberal status quo has failed to deliver, particularly in the wealthy West. Across the OECD , the top 10 percent makes over nine times per year as much as the bottom 10 percent. Metrics of trust in a range of governmental institutions - legislatures, courts, civil service - are falling across advanced democracies . In the United States specifically, deaths from alcohol abuse, drug overdose, and suicide have reached all-time highs .\n\nThese are just a few of the doleful indicators , numbers that paint a gloomy picture of the political status quo in liberalism's strongholds and especially the United States. If life under liberalism is getting worse for a lot of people, is it possible that the idea really has outlasted its usefulness?\n\nModern anti-liberals, both on the right and the left, take the notion that the status quo is broken as their starting point.\n\nThose on the left argue that liberalism's failures were eminently predictable, the inevitable product of contradictions within liberalism long identified by critics in the Marxist tradition - that between the liberal commitment to egalitarian democracy and a vision of the market as a zone of individual freedom.\n\nThe Indian essayist Pankaj Mishra captured this argument particularly well in an interview with the LA Review of Books :\n\nLiberal capitalism was supposed to foster a universal middle class and encourage bourgeois values of sobriety and prudence and democratic virtues of accountability. It achieved the opposite: the creation of a precariat with no clear long-term prospects, dangerously vulnerable to demagogues promising them the moon. Uncontrolled liberalism, in other words, prepares the grounds for its own demise.\n\nThe core concepts of the leftist narrative have been worked out for decades by Marx-influenced scholars like the University of Pennsylvania's Adolph Reed Jr. , the New School's Nancy Fraser , and the City University of New York's David Harvey . It's become prominent thanks to the emergence of vibrant leftist magazines like Jacobin and its adoption by prominent public intellectuals like Mishra.\n\nThe current crisis of liberalism, according to this narrative, dates to (roughly) the 1970s. Around then, governments across the Western world began deregulating their economies, selling off state-owned industries, and privatizing core government services. This turn towards economic \"neoliberalism,\" as leftists termed it, was not just a matter of economic policy, but rather a comprehensive ideological and philosophical project.\n\nUnder neoliberalism, the logic of the market becomes \"an ethic in itself, capable of acting as a guide to all human action, and substituting for all previously held ethical beliefs,\" Harvey writes in his book A Brief History of Neoliberalism . \"It has pervasive effects on ways of thought to the point where it has become incorporated into the common-sense way many of us interpret, live in, and understand the world.\"\n\nNeoliberalism, in this line of thinking, became dominant on both sides of the political aisle. Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were neoliberals; so too were Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. Their agenda of tax cuts, \"welfare reform,\" and deregulation created the rapid increase in inequality since the 1970s , giving rise to a political and economic model rigged in favor of the rich.\n\nThe critique of neoliberalism is not new, but it has gained currency in the last decade or so. The Great Recession can be blamed on neoliberal financial deregulation , the Eurozone crisis on neoliberal austerity , and the rise of Trump and right-wing extremists as a backlash to neoliberal free trade agreements and neoliberal indifference to rising inequality .\n\n\"Here is what we need to understand: a hell of a lot of people are in pain. Under neoliberal policies of deregulation, privatisation, austerity and corporate trade, their living standards have declined precipitously,\" leftist author Naomi Klein writes in the Guardian . \"Donald Trump speaks directly to that pain. The Brexit campaign spoke to that pain. So do all of the rising far-right parties in Europe.\"\n\nNow, it's possible to oppose \"neoliberalism\" without opposing \"liberalism\" per se. But liberalism's left-wing critics disagree; they claim that neoliberalism is not a distortion of liberalism, but rather its true face.\n\nLiberalism's core error, in this view, comes from a mistake in its vision of democracy. Liberals support democracy as a matter of principle, believing that individuals have a right to shape decisions that affect their lives in deep and important ways. But liberals curiously excludes parts of economic life from this zone of collective self-determination, seeing the market as a place where people have individual but not collective rights. Liberalism sees nothing wrong with the heads of Amazon and Facebook making decisions that have implications for the entire economy.\n\nSo long as capitalists are free from democratic constraint, leftists argue, liberal democracy is on dangerous footing. The super-rich use the power their accumulated wealth provides to influence political life, rearranging policy to protect and expand their fortunes. The rise of neoliberalism is, per the socialist writer Peter Frase , this process in action: proof that capitalism will invariably corrupt liberalism's promise of freedom and equality.\n\nFor all their anti-liberal rhetoric, virtually none of today's serious left critics of liberalism are Stalinists or Maoists - that is, opponents of democracy itself. They believe in liberal rights like freedom of expression, and pursue their revolutionary agenda through social organizing and democratic elections.\n\nThey champion Sen. Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign, despite the fact that the policies he advocates stop well short of democratizing the workplace or abolishing capitalism. That's because they see the electoral victory of an avowed \"democratic socialist\" and policies like Medicare for All as the beginning of a long process, necessary steps for replacing eventually capitalism with something better.\n\nMany of the sharpest left-wing critics of liberalism do not frame themselves as opponents of liberal democratic ideals. Rather, they argue that they're the only people who can vindicate liberalism's best promises.\n\n\"In describing my own political trajectory, I often talk about my parents' liberal politics, and my own journey of discovery, through which I concluded that their liberal ideals couldn't be achieved by liberal means, but required something more radical, and more Marxist,\" Frase writes . \"That's what I'd call socialism, or even communism , which for me is the ultimate horizon.\"\n\nThe right's attack on liberalism is even more sweeping than the left's.\n\nConservative anti-liberals question not only freedom in the economic sphere, but the value of pluralistic democracy itself - arguing that core liberal ideals about tolerance and equality actually produce an insidious form of tyranny that destroys communities and deadens the human spirit.\n\nThe key proponents of this view are heavily (though not exclusively) Catholic; many draw from their faith's long tradition of anti-liberal thought. They have a small presence in the academy - Notre Dame political theorist Patrick Deneen and Harvard legal scholar Adrian Vermeule, for example - but are much less visible in the professoriate than socialists.\n\nThe right-leaning anti-liberals are more often found in the punditry, conservative think tanks, and even in the ranks of actual political parties (particularly in Europe). The Christian publication First Things is a particular hub of media activity for these anti-liberals, as is the American Conservative magazine. Sympathetic writers can be found at outlets ranging from the New York Times to National Review to the New York Post . Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) is a conservative anti-liberal; on the far right, anti-liberals include Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Polish European Parliament member Ryzard Legutko.\n\nThe right's starting point is the same as the left's: our society is in dire straits, and liberalism is to blame. Like the left, they see the untrammeled market as part of the problem, a decisive break with the libertarianism or \"classical liberalism\" favored by traditional American movement conservatives and European right-wingers in the mold of Margaret Thatcher . The economic split has produced more than a little infighting in conservative ranks.\n\nBut conservative anti-liberals are not content with rubbishing libertarianism and other liberal economic doctrines. The real error, in their view, goes even further back - all the way down to liberalism's core ideas about individual freedom and choice.\n\nLiberalism's foundational premise is that the government must defend liberty: that people should be free to choose their paths in life, and that the state's role should first and foremost be protecting and enabling the exercise of this freedom. Conservative critics believe this basic liberal picture is rooted in a false, impoverished view of human life - there is not, and never has been, such a thing as freely choosing, autonomous individuals.\n\nActual people are embedded inside social relations and identities - most notably, family, faith, and community - without which they lack meaning and purpose. Liberalism elevates the will of the individual at the expense of these pre-political bonds.\n\n\"For decades now our politics and culture have been dominated by a particular philosophy of freedom,\" Hawley writes in an essay published by Christianity Today . \"It is a philosophy of liberation from family and tradition, of escape from God and community, a philosophy of self-creation and unrestricted, unfettered free choice.\"\n\nThe pursuit of profit erodes social ties, creating incentives for people to pursue their self-interest rather than build families or embed themselves in communities. Young people leave their small towns in search of career and meaning in anonymous big cities, destroying the communal ethos that allowed people to feel happy and secure. Rising inequality chips away at the bonds of social solidarity, hollowing out the middle class and placing deep barriers between citizens.\n\nLiberals use the state to try and address the market's failures, providing services like welfare payments and health care. But such efforts, conservatives argue, usurp functions that used to belong to community and church - further weakening those key sources of meaning and identity.\n\n\"The political project of liberalism is shaping us into...increasingly separate, autonomous, non-relational selves replete with rights and defined by our liberty, but insecure, powerless, afraid, and alone,\" Deneen, probably the sharpest of these conservative anti-liberals, writes in his book Why Liberalism Failed .\n\nThis destruction of community, conservative anti-liberals believe, can be seen in the big-picture numbers. Across liberal societies, religious attendance has fallen, social clubs like the Elk Lodge are declining, divorce rates have risen, and birth rates are shrinking. Liberalism's separation of individual from community and security leaves its subjects angry and alone, turning to demagogues because no one else is channeling their rage at a failing status quo.\n\nBut what has really set off reactionary anti-liberals has been the state enforcement of liberal social mores.\n\nThey believe that liberalism's vaunted neutrality - its claim to respect all citizens' freedom to follow their own paths in life - is a sham. Liberalism can only truly tolerate belief systems that cohere with its vision of freedom, and will actively attempt to stamp out worldviews that it concludes are hostile to that ideal. In the right anti-liberal imaginary, liberal tolerance is fundamentally intolerant.\n\nHence attempts to force Hobby Lobby's insurance to cover birth control and Christian bakers to make cakes for gay weddings . Hence the rise of \"political correctness\" and the LGBT movement's attempts to challenge the allegedly foundational concept of the gender binary. Eventually, these conservatives believe, liberalism's quest to make everyone free could culminate in wiping out traditional Christianity and conservative society altogether.\n\n\"The need for building a liberal-democratic society ... implies the withdrawal of the guarantee of freedom for those whose actions and interests are said to be hostile to [liberalism],\" Legutko, the Polish member of European Parliament, writes in his influential book The Demon in Democracy .\n\nSo if liberalism is a mortal threat to the West, what's the right-wing alternative?\n\nThere are, broadly speaking, two schools of thought: localism and nationalism.\n\nThe localist view, advocated by Deneen and the American Conservative's Rod Dreher, suggests that national politics should not be the focus of anti-liberals' energy (at the moment, at least). They advocate instead focusing on engaging in small-scale experiments and community building that can restore what liberalism has destroyed, providing islands of stability for traditional Christians amid the secular storm raging nationwide.\n\n\"Such communities of practice will increasingly be seen as lighthouses and field hospitals to those who might have once regarded them as peculiar and suspect,\" Deneen writes. \"From the work and example of alternative forms of community, ultimately a different experience of political life might arise.\"\n\nThe nationalist view, by contrast, argues for recapturing the state and remaking it on avowedly illiberal lines - constructing a state that rebuilds national communities by opposing international capital and secular liberalism alike.\n\nThe Orbán government in Hungary is an example of this agenda in action. Hungary's leader has banned the teaching of \"gender ideology\" in universities, cracked down on non-European immigration, passed financial incentives aimed at getting Hungarian women to have more babies, and redefined Hungary's regime as both as a \"Christian democracy\" and an \"illiberal democracy.\"\n\nAn even more radical version, advocated most prominently by Harvard's Vermeule, is something called \"integralism\" - an obscure Catholic doctrine that essentially amounts to the abolition of the church/state distinction and the replacement of liberal democracy with an avowedly Catholic regime .\n\nThese integralists reject the label of \"theocracy\" for their ideal government. But they do hope the current system can be transformed from within, the ultimate aim being a state that promotes a religiously defined \" Highest Good \" rather than liberal autonomy.\n\nVermeule specifically \"hopes for eventual integration effected from within institutions,\" starting by influencing of \"executive-type bureaucracies\" rather than through outright winning elections. It's a way of shaping the future, of laying the groundwork for a Catholic world after \"liberalism's eventual disappearance.\"\n\nDespite all of its problems, I still believe in liberalism. Its core philosophical doctrines are correct: The aim of politics should be ensuring individuals are free to live according to their \"plan of life\" (a term taken from John Rawls , the liberal philosophical giant of the 20th century). Core liberal institutions, like an expansive slate of individual rights and a social democratic mixed economy, are vital to human flourishing.\n\nBut despite my deep faith in liberalism, I've recently found myself more frustrated by reading fellow liberals than the illiberals attacking us.\n\nMany modern liberals, including some brilliant and well-regarded thinkers, do not seem up to the task of defending liberalism from its newest wave of critics. They lean on old arguments persuasive largely to other liberals, doing little to counteract the narrative of crisis from which the new illiberalism gets its force. It feels like the liberalism we have is musty, grown soft from its Cold War victory and unwilling to grapple with an opposition very different from what came before it.\n\nThe first of these unsatisfying arguments, which I associate most closely with Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, is that the narrative of a world in crisis is simply wrong. On every conceivable metric, the world is getting better - extreme poverty is declining, life expectancy is going up, deaths from war and violence are on the decline. If things are generally doing well, where's the need for radical change?\n\nI happen to find the data behind this view persuasive, and indeed have argued that it's a compelling case for cautious optimism about humanity's future. It's not, however, a particularly good defense of liberalism at the moment.\n\nMost of the current global improvement is happening in the developing world; the biggest recent jumps in global life expectancy largely come from these countries, including authoritarian states like China. By contrast, conditions in richer liberal democracies are getting worse on a bevy of different metrics. The data on global improvement is hardly making the case for liberalism in its historical bastions.\n\nEven if you buy that liberalism is responsible for improvements for people living in the developing economies, it's not clear if it can keep this progress going. The damage done by our new demagogues and the looming threat of climate change could end up reversing worldwide progress against untimely death and poverty.\n\nBut most fundamentally, liberalism's defenders need to meet people where they are. And Pinker's metrics notwithstanding, a lot of people really feel like the political status quo is failing them. The illiberals are explaining why that is; liberals are trying to talk them out of it. This won't work, no matter how many statistics on infant mortality in sub-Saharan Africa liberals marshal.\n\nThe second unsatisfying liberal argument is that liberalism may not be perfect, but it has a long history of repairing itself. This is one of the central arguments in Adam Gopnik's A Thousand Small Sanities , the New Yorker correspondent's book-length defense of his liberalism.\n\n\"The liberation of women, the emancipation of slaves and then of the racially oppressed, the recognition of the rights of sexual minorities - these are all the unique achievements of liberal states, engineered by liberal activists, all things that have never happened before in history,\" Gopnik writes.\n\nBut saying that liberalism can repair itself isn't the same thing as explaining how it can do so right now. The victory of the suffragettes is cold comfort for women fighting for equal pay; claiming that liberalism abolished Jim Crow does nothing to tell us how it will fix the new Jim Crow . Gopnik's argument is more of a testament of faith in liberalism rather than an effort to chart a way through the current crisis.\n\nThe third and final unsatisfying liberal response, the one that frustrates me the most, is lashing out at the wrong enemies.\n\nOne of the most common genres in modern American punditry is the attack on \"identity politics\" and \"political correctness.\" Liberalism's defenders on both the center-left and center-right frequently pinpoint today's young people and college kids, with their \"trigger warnings\" and \"safe spaces\" and gender-neutral pronouns, as being a looming threat to free speech and core liberal values - the tip of a spear aimed at the multicultural left.\n\nBooks like The Once and Future Liberal , Columbia professor Mark Lilla's post-Trump opus, argue for a need to move beyond \"identity liberalism\"; liberal essayists warn that practitioners of \"identity politics\" are corroding the soul of American liberalism.\n\n\"The modern far left has borrowed the Marxist critique of liberalism and substituted race and gender identities for economic ones,\" Jonathan Chait wrote in a 2015 New York magazine feature. \"While politically less threatening than conservatism (the far right still commands far more power in American life), the p.c. left is actually more philosophically threatening. It is an undemocratic creed.\"\n\nBut there is scant persuasive evidence that America's young left-wing activists are turning against free speech or other core liberal values. The argument also betrays a misunderstanding of the relationship between identity politics and Marxism , as well as an underestimation of the degree to which right-wing anti-liberalism has become a part of the modern Republican Party.\n\nMost importantly, the liberal war on identity politics is a mistake philosophically. It misunderstands the rising energy surrounding identity issues as a threat to liberalism when it's actually sowing the seeds of liberal renewal.\n\nOne of liberalism's historical sources of strength is seeing the world for what it is, adapting its doctrines to fit changing realities rather than trying to make the world fit an older version of liberalism. Modern liberals need to do the same with the problems raised by its current critics. They - we - need to recognize that there are serious flaws in liberalism as it exists. Leftists are correct that neoliberal faith in the market was far too devout; conservatives are right that liberals have been too inattentive to the importance of community.\n\nBut liberal adaptation to change is not merely a process of self-flagellation. It also involves identifying what new ideas are bubbling up that can be adapted to strengthen liberalism, pinpointing the raw materials for generating enthusiastic new liberal movements and visions. The obsessive focus on a handful of overeager college organizers and professors is a mistake; it obscures the undeniable fact that organization around group identity has helped create a number of vital political movements that are defending liberalism's central component parts.\n\nThink about the Movement for Black Lives, dedicated to liberal ideals of equal citizenship and non-coercion. Think about the fact that roughly 4 million Americans around the country turned out for the 2017 Women's Marches, using a call for women's equality as means of organizing against Trump's threat to American democracy more broadly.\n\nThink about the #MeToo movement's role in fighting back against a pervasive source of unfreedom and inequality. Think about the backlash to Trump's travel ban and family separations, how young people around the world are using their generational identity to mobilize around climate change, and how laws aimed at repressing minority voters have become a rallying cry for the defense of free and fair elections .\n\nThe people doing the work to defend equality, freedom, and democracy today base their activism on the experiences of specific identity groups. They tend to use specific oppressions as a jumping-off point, weaving together different groups' experiences into a tapestry of solidarity. Particularism is not isolating, but rather a means of generating a broad-based critique of social inequalities that can improve democracy for all.\n\nLiberals will not succeed by tut-tutting activists who care about the oppression of their own communities. They succeed by developing a vision of liberalism that harnesses activists' energy and sense of injustice.\n\nThe defense of liberalism begins by recognizing that there is a crisis, that anti-liberals are once again asserting themselves intellectually in ways that should worry liberalism's defenders. It will triumph by seeing the world for what it is, and changing liberalism to meet it - not by insisting on arguments well past their expiration date.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Why did liberals win so many cases before a conservative Supreme Court?\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe Court's term included several surprisingly liberal decisions. Don't expect many of them to last.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nLast October, when the Supreme Court began its term, liberals had good reason to be despondent.\n\nThe Court's most recent term, which ended Thursday, was the first full term since Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a staunch conservative, replaced his more moderate predecessor Justice Anthony Kennedy. It was also the first term where Kavanaugh helped select every case that would be heard by the justices.\n\nBy all outward signs, the Court's conservative majority approached its docket like they were children turned loose in a toy store . The Court planned to hear a case that presented an existential threat to the right to an abortion . It seemed likely to shut down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program - which benefits hundreds of thousands of immigrants - potentially doing so permanently, so that no future president could revive it. And the Court appeared ready to expand the Second Amendment , a longtime project of Kavanaugh's.\n\nIn the end, the Court took a far more measured approach to each of these cases. The right to terminate a pregnancy survives , although Chief Justice John Roberts signaled pretty clearly that it is unlikely to survive much longer. DACA also survives, although only due to a paperwork error that the Trump administration may correct. The guns case ended, not with a bang but with a whimper .\n\nThis is still an extremely conservative Supreme Court. The just-completed term was a disaster for voting rights . It imposed significant new limits on Congress's ability to investigate President Trump. The religious right walked away with several big victories . The Court opened up a new front in the war on Obamacare .\n\nBut the Court also showed that there is at least some daylight between its interpretations of the law and the policy preferences of the Republican Party.\n\nA partial explanation for the liberal victories this term is that conservative advocates got ahead of their skis. As Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, wrote in 2015 - the last time the Court had a surprisingly liberal term - \"the court's recent decisions may reflect a change in the cases being considered by the court rather than a shift in the preferences of the justices.\"\n\nWhen the Court moves rightward, conservative advocates are more likely to bring dubious cases - and conservative lawmakers are more likely to enact laws of dubious constitutionality - out of a belief that an ideologically sympathetic Court is likely to rule in their favor. Liberal lawyers, meanwhile, will be more likely to avoid federal court unless they are sure their arguments are airtight. As a result, the Supreme Court will tend to hear weaker claims from conservatives and stronger claims from liberals.\n\nAdditionally, at least two members of the Court - Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch - do not always share the same ideological commitments as their fellow Republican justices. Roberts is less active with movement conservatism than his four most conservative colleagues. And Gorsuch's commitment to a particular method of deciding cases sometimes overrides his conservative preferences.\n\nBecause Republicans control only five of the nine seats on the Supreme Court, conservative advocates often need to win the vote of every single conservative justice in order to prevail. So if either Roberts or Gorsuch is unpersuaded by a conservative argument, that's frequently enough to hand a loss to that argument's proponents.\n\nHere's a good rule of thumb for new law school graduates: It's a bad idea to make a case that is literally identical to one that you recently lost in the Supreme Court. Yet that's more or less what anti-abortion advocates did in June Medical Services v. Russo .\n\nIn Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt (2016), the Supreme Court struck down a Texas law requiring abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital - a credential that is very difficult for abortion doctors to obtain and that does little or nothing to improve health outcomes. June Medical asked the Supreme Court to uphold a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. As Justice Stephen Breyer noted in his June Medical opinion, the two laws were \"almost word-for-word identical.\"\n\nConservatives undoubtedly hoped that, with Kennedy, who joined the majority in Whole Woman's Health , no longer on the Court, they could get a different outcome in an interchangeable case. But Roberts was unwilling to endorse such an attempt to treat his Court as a purely political body. \"The result in this case is controlled by our decision four years ago invalidating a nearly identical Texas law,\" Roberts concluded in an opinion that reluctantly agreed to strike down the Louisiana law.\n\nMuch of Roberts's opinion laid out his objections to the Court's existing abortion rights cases, so Roberts remains likely to uphold significant restrictions on abortion in the future. He's just not willing to uphold the exact same law that the Court struck down a few years earlier.\n\nSimilar things can be said about Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California , where Roberts joined his four liberal colleagues in holding that the Trump administration didn't complete the proper paperwork when it decided to terminate the DACA program, which allows nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants to live and work in the United States. The nation's highest court typically does not exist to excuse high-level government officials who do not want to do their homework.\n\nIf the Trump administration wanted to end DACA, it should have just fixed its paperwork error, rather than spending years litigating this case through the federal court system.\n\nAnd then there's Trump v. Vance , where the Supreme Court held that the president of the United States does not enjoy total immunity from state criminal investigations. Many of Trump's legal arguments in this case were so absurd that they bordered on self-parody .\n\nNone of this means that conservative lawyers have nothing to gain from bringing audacious arguments to a conservative Court. Twenty years ago, many justices believed that it is unconstitutional for the government to fund religious schools. But in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue , the Supreme Court held this term that states are required to fund such schools if they provide similar funding to secular private schools.\n\nSimilarly, in Trump v. Mazars , the president sought new protections against congressional immunity that were entirely at odds with existing precedents. He won anyway , although the Court didn't go quite as far as Trump's lawyers asked it to go.\n\nNor did conservatives really lose anything meaningful in June Medical , Regents , or Vance . Roberts is still likely to uphold nearly any anti-abortion law that's brought before him. The paperwork error in Regents can be cured. And Vance largely just maintained a status quo that says the president isn't completely above the law.\n\nBut if conservatives ask for too much, too fast from this Supreme Court, they will eventually find the justices' limits.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, Chief Justice Roberts had just celebrated the second anniversary of his appointment as the nation's highest-ranking judge when he delivered the \" 7th Annual Barbara K. Olson Memorial Lecture \" to the conservative Federalist Society. According to the society's website, that was the last time the chief justice spoke to this organization, which forms the locus of legal conservatism within the United States.\n\nIn this sense, Roberts is quite unlike his four Republican colleagues. Justices Clarence Thomas , Samuel Alito , Neil Gorsuch , and Brett Kavanaugh are all frequent speakers at the Federalist Society's events - both Gorsuch and Kavanaugh took a victory lap at the society's annual black-tie dinner not long after their confirmation to the Supreme Court. Indeed, the Court's rightmost justices frequently attend this dinner even when they are not on the speaking program and are just there to enjoy a meal with friends.\n\nIt's hard to minimize the importance of the Federalist Society, which plays an outsize role in selecting President Trump's judicial nominees , and in maintaining ideological discipline among conservative legal elites.\n\nResearch shows that sitting justices are \"very prestige hungry\" and they \"care a lot about their reputations,\" according to Maya Sen, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government who studies the Supreme Court. The justices, Sen told me, \"want to be viewed well by their peers\" within the elite echelons of the legal profession, a privileged cohort that includes many \"liberal academics.\"\n\nThe Federalist Society, moreover, was born out of many conservative legal elites' perception that their ideas were not taken seriously within the legal profession and especially within academia. As then-Solicitor General Ted Olson told the Federalist Society in 2002, \"the best measure of our success is the sound of gnashing teeth and lamentations by those who feel threatened\" - he then proposed a toast to the society \"for sowing such delightful despair among the legal, political and academic establishment .\"\n\nAt the same event, Federalist Society president Eugene B. Meyer complained that conservatives on law school campuses \"have trouble finding faculty advisers\" and that \"certain ideas are not being heard in law schools.\"\n\nThe Federalist Society, according to Sen, creates a \"safe space\" for conservative lawyers - up to and including sitting Supreme Court justices - where they can feel professionally validated without having to seek such validation from the kind of liberal thinkers who often fill the pages of the Harvard Law Review.\n\nThe society succeeds not just by doling out plum jobs to loyal conservatives, but also by satiating its members' very human need to feel loved and respected by their professional colleagues - by surrounding those members with colleagues who love and respect people who advance conservative causes.\n\nAmanda Hollis-Brusky, a politics professor at Pomona College and the author of Ideas with Consequences: The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution , agreed that Roberts's apparent distance from the Federalist Society distinguishes him from his fellow Republican justices, but she added that she's not sure if Roberts's cooler relationship with the powerful conservative organization is a \"cause or an effect\" of the fact that he sometimes votes to the left of justices like Alito or Kavanaugh.\n\nHollis-Brusky pointed to Roberts's vote to uphold most of the Affordable Care Act in NFIB v. Sebelius (2012) as the \"first time that Roberts deviated from what was clearly the Federalist Society's preferred outcome.\" Roberts's decision to keep Obamacare alive, she says, may have created a rift between the chief justice and the society.\n\nOnce a rift forms, it can be self-reinforcing. Roberts's vote at NFIB may have alienated him from conservative legal elites, but that makes it less likely that he'll seek validation from them in the future, which in turn makes it less likely that he'll vote with his fellow Republicans.\n\nHollis-Brusky also pointed to another factor that may drive Roberts's occasional flirtations with the left. Justice Kennedy, she noted, voted more conservatively when Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was the Court's \"swing\" justice - the justice in the Court's ideological center - than he did when Kennedy took up the \"mantle\" of the swing vote. It's possible that Roberts feels the same pressure now that he's at the Court's center. And this pressure may be accentuated because of his role as chief justice.\n\nIt is, after all, the \"Roberts Court,\" not the \"Alito Court\" or the \"Kavanaugh Court,\" that historians will write about if this age is remembered as an era of unbridled judicial partisanship.\n\nYet, whatever the reason for Roberts's relative moderation, there are some outward signs that Roberts's own Republican colleagues view him as an unsteady ally.\n\nWhen the term began, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. City of New York appeared likely to be a landmark Second Amendment case that would expand the scope of that amendment well beyond its current bounds, but the case fizzled due to a jurisdictional problem and wound up having little to say about gun rights.\n\nJustices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh have all, at various times , called for the Court to take a more expansive approach to the Second Amendment. And, when the New York State Rifle case reached its anticlimactic conclusion, Kavanaugh even called upon his Court to take up \"one of the several Second Amendment cases with petitions for certiorari now pending before the Court.\" The Court decided to turn away all these cases .\n\nIt only takes four votes for the Court to hear a case, which means that Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh could have joined together to hear any case they wanted. It's likely they decided not to hear another guns case because they were unsure if Roberts was on their side.\n\nIn several other cases, Justice Alito did not hide his rage at decisions where Roberts joined the liberals. He claimed that the June Medical decision \" twists the law .\" And, in an unusually angry dissent, Alito described a landmark LGBTQ rights decision , which Roberts joined, as \"deceptive\" and \"preposterous.\"\n\nNone of which means that Roberts isn't an extremely conservative justice. On voting rights, in particular, he is as doctrinaire a conservative as they come. He joined several decisions this term that will make it difficult - and potentially dangerous - for many voters to cast a ballot during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut Roberts, according to Hollis-Brusky, also appears concerned that his Court should not appear to be the \"handmaiden of the Trump administration.\"\n\n\"It's not that he's become a raging liberal, by any means,\" said Hollis-Brusky, but at least he can claim that \"he's beholden to no one.\"\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, meanwhile, voted with the liberal justices in two major cases: Bostock v. Clayton County , which held that the federal ban on \"sex\" discrimination in employment encompasses anti-LGBTQ discrimination; and McGirt v. Oklahoma , which establishes that a huge swath of land encompassing half the state of Oklahoma is what federal law anachronistically refers to \"Indian country\" - Native American reservations where tribal governments retain considerable sovereign authority.\n\nGorsuch is much more conservative than Roberts. Indeed, on some important issues, he is probably the most conservative justice to sit on the Supreme Court since the Great Depression. But Gorsuch is also one of the Court's proudest evangelists for \"textualism,\" the belief that, in his words, a law should be read according to its \"ordinary meaning at the time of its enactment.\" And his commitment to this method of interpreting federal laws sometimes overcomes his commitment to conservatism.\n\nFrom a textualist perspective, Bostock was an easy case. As Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, told me, \"if it were possible (which of course it's not) to disregard the fraught social and political context of the case, Bostock would be an entirely unremarkable decision, doctrinally speaking.\"\n\nThe case involves Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination \" because of [an employee's] race, color, religion, sex, or national origin .\" As Gorsuch wrote in Bostock , a ban on \"sex\" discrimination necessarily encompasses anti-LGBTQ discrimination simply as a matter of textual interpretation:\n\nConsider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer's mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague.\n\nSimilarly, if an employer \"fires a transgender person who was identified as a male at birth but who now identifies as a female\" but also \"retains an otherwise identical employee who was identified as female at birth,\" that employer is engaged in sex discrimination. \"Again,\" Gorsuch wrote, \"the individual employee's sex plays an unmistakable and impermissible role in the discharge decision.\"\n\nYet if you attended the oral argument in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. EEOC , a companion case to Bostock that was argued the same day, you could watch Gorsuch's struggle between his textualist methodology and his conservative political views play out in real time. \"Assume for the moment I'm ... with you on the textual evidence,\" Gorsuch told the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer arguing in favor of transgender rights. Should courts \"take into consideration the massive social upheaval that would be entailed\" in a judicial decision prohibiting anti-LGBTQ employment discrimination?\n\nUltimately, however, Gorsuch's commitment to textualism overcame his apparent belief that LGBTQ equality could trigger \"massive social upheaval.\"\n\nA similar dynamic played out in McGirt , where the state of Oklahoma claimed that if half of its lands were held to be tribal reservations, such a decision \"would decimate state and local budgets\" because \"the State generally lacks the authority to tax Indians in Indian country.\"\n\nBut Gorsuch wrote that such consequences are irrelevant. \"Dire warnings are just that,\" according to Gorsuch's majority opinion in McGirt , \"and not a license for us to disregard the law.\"\n\nThe fact that Gorsuch is so committed to a particular methodology that he's sometimes willing to break with his fellow Republicans is significant, but it would be an enormous mistake for liberals to think of Gorsuch as an ally, or even as a swing vote.\n\nAt the time of his nomination to the Supreme Court, Sen told me, empirical studies placed Gorsuch at the 85th percentile of conservatism among his colleagues on the federal bench. And this rough empirical measure misses much of the nuance of his opinions.\n\nWhen Gorsuch swings right, he frequently swings hard to the right. For example, he is the strongest proponent of the \" right to contract \" - often a euphemism for employers' right to exploit their employees - to sit on the Supreme Court since the Franklin Roosevelt administration. In the past, this discredited \"right\" was used to strike down minimum wage laws and laws protecting workers' right to unionize, among many other things, on the theory that the right to contract includes the \"right\" to agree to be paid insignificant wages, or the \"right\" to sign away your ability to join a union.\n\nSo long as the Court's current panel of nine justices sits, in other words, conservatives have a lot to gain - and liberals have a lot to fear - from the Supreme Court. The lesson of this past term is not that the Court is liberal. It's that conservatives cannot expect to win every single case they bring, no matter how weak their arguments.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nProgressives need an accurate autopsy of Kamala Harris's campaign, not an ideologically convenient one.\n\nby Eric Levitz\n\nOn November 5, Americans elevated a reactionary authoritarian to the presidency - again.\n\nAfter attempting to overturn an election , fomenting an insurrection , becoming a convicted criminal, and baselessly accusing an immigrant community of eating house pets, Donald Trump not only won a second lease on the White House, but he did so with a plurality of the popular vote - while Republicans took control of both congressional chambers.\n\nLiberals may be feeling a sense of déjà vu. But this is not 2017 all over again. It is something worse.\n\nOver the past eight years, Trump has remade the Republican Party in his image. In Congress, his intraparty critics have almost all decamped for the private sector or knelt to kiss his ring . In the executive branch, the \" adults \" are no longer \"in the room \": Awed by his own power and unprepared to staff an administration, Trump leaned on many relatively mainstream advisers in his first term. This time around, he and his allies have assembled a cadre of loyalists, some of whom have won Cabinet nominations (alongside some more conventional Republicans).\n\nMeanwhile, conservatives have consolidated their grip on the Supreme Court, slashed the Democrats' advantage with Hispanic voters , and fortified the GOP's strength with the non-college-educated electorate , realignments that threatened the Democratic Party's capacity to wield federal power.\n\nAll this amounts to a catastrophe for anyone who values liberal democracy, egalitarian economic policy, and social equality for all marginalized groups. As someone who has spent the past decade advocating for more expansionary immigration policies, a larger social safety net, criminal justice reform, and decarbonization, it is difficult to see my country embrace a man who evinces contempt for all of those causes.\n\nIn the face of this calamity, Democrats must develop a clear-eyed understanding of how they got here and chart a plausible path back to the country they want to live in.\n\nThis newsletter - The Rebuild - aims to aid in that project. In weekly installments, I'll try to offer some insight into how Democrats lost their national majority, as well as what we - people who care about advancing progressive change - must do to become more effective moving forward.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.\n\nAnswering those questions will require Democrats to analyze their predicament with open minds. If we seek ideologically comforting explanations for the party's problems - rather than empirically sound ones - the coalition will march deeper into the wilderness.\n\nUnfortunately, in the wake of Vice President Kamala Harris's loss, virtually every Democratic faction has produced its share of motivated reasoning. In future newsletters, I plan to take issue with some centrists' analysis of the party's difficulties. But today, I want to explain why I worry that the left is allowing wishful thinking to cloud its vision of political reality.\n\nSince November 5, some progressives have drawn a sweeping lesson from Trump's second victory: Harris's loss proves Democrats gain little from \" moderation \" or \" centrism \" and must \" embrace radical policies \" in order to compete. I admire many of the writers making this argument. But their confidence in this narrative strikes me as wildly unfounded.\n\nIt is true that Harris pivoted to the center on border security, crime, and, to a lesser extent, economics. There are plenty of sound arguments - both moral and political - against Democrats moderating on specific issues. Yet it's hard to see how anyone could be confident that Harris lost because she moderated, much less that her loss proved that moderation is electorally counterproductive as a rule.\n\nTo name just a few reasons for doubting those premises:\n\nMy aim here is not to argue that Democrats must pivot to the center on all issues. I don't think they should. I do think that the party needs to moderate its image nationally, if only to better compete for Senate control. But I'm still gathering my thoughts on how precisely they should pursue that task and will elaborate on them in future newsletters.\n\nFor now, my point is simply that there is little basis for confidence that Harris lost due to excessive moderation, or that Democrats would benefit electorally from becoming broadly more left-wing. The fact that many on the left nevertheless evince such certainty is therefore disconcerting.\n\nBeing progressive, in the best sense of that term, means putting the interests of the most vulnerable above one's own comfort - whether material or ideological. And right now, America's most disempowered constituencies have a strong interest in Democrats ousting reactionaries from power. If the party substitutes wishful thinking for unblinkered analysis, they will have a harder time accomplishing that task.\n\nSign up for The Rebuild to get stories like this delivered straight to your inbox every Friday.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

      "text": "A historian's advice to the Democrats trying to build stuff\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWhat supply-side liberals can learn from the past\n\nby Rachel Cohen\n\nThese days, political leaders and commentators talk often about \" industrial policy \" and stimulating supply in the economy, rather than just demand. Whether it's to spur new construction to tackle the nation's affordable housing crisis, or decarbonize the country through clean energy tax credits , or pour subsidies into a nascent US microchip sector , policymakers have paid a lot more attention to the idea of government playing a more proactive role in private-sector development.\n\nBut central to the debate over this idea known as \"supply-side liberalism\" is whether the government should attempt to do more on top of these efforts to stimulate businesses, like leveraging public subsidies to strengthen unions and environmental protections, or helping women and people of color access new jobs and opportunities.\n\nCritics of this latter approach say a government that tries to do too much at once will inevitably do nothing at all , and that if we want a public sector that can actually deliver at scale, we'll need to cut red tape, stay laser-focused on production, and resist pressure from clamoring interest groups. Others say bringing interest groups along and fighting for progressive goals while boosting industrial production is essential. \"The answer is not a liberalism that builds, but a liberalism that builds power,\" argued American Prospect editor David Dayen earlier this year, in an essay defending a more multifaceted approach, calling them \"mutually reinforcing.\" Brent Cebul , a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania, offers some new perspective to this often intractable-seeming debate. The author of Illusions of Progress , a book that traces earlier iterations of \"supply-side liberalism\" throughout the 20th century, Cebul argues that a government hoping to march forward on economic objectives under the belief it can circle back later to tackle social problems should expect to find those social problems in much worse shape. He thinks the key to doing both at once involves ensuring everyone can claim some semblance of victory.\n\nSenior policy reporter Rachel Cohen talked with Cebul about his research and how Democrats interested in leveraging markets might avoid some of the mistakes of the past. Their conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n-\n\nRachel Cohen: Your book focuses on something you call \"supply-side liberalism\" - an idea you trace back to the 1930s. Can you briefly explain what you mean by the term?\n\nBrent Cebul: So \"supply-side conservatism\" is about cutting taxes and regulations in hopes that economic growth will trickle down. In broad strokes what I mean by \"supply-side liberalism\" is structuring markets to deliver social goods rather than the state delivering them directly itself. In the book, I walk through a handful of different ways in which, beginning in the New Deal, liberals sought to stimulate markets to ensure market activity.\n\nRachel Cohen: Is that the same thing as \" neoliberalism ,\" which people typically trace back to the 1970s? Or is it an earlier descendant?\n\nBrent Cebul: So the way I think about its relationship to neoliberalism is the supply-side liberalism I write about was always embedded in a broader set of social aspirations that New Dealers and mid-century liberals pursued, that contained some more universal-style benefits, like Social Security. Eventually, in the 1960s, we get Medicare and Medicaid. Part of what I try to show in the book is that by the 1970s and 1980s, in the wake of the 1970s' fiscal and political crises, a new generation of Democrats start using some of these same supply-side ideas to basically shear off some of the more progressive universal direct budget items.\n\nThe case that I use in the 1990s, in particular, is welfare. Bill Clinton replaces Aid to Families with Dependent Children , and takes the same money that would have gone to support mothers to instead subsidize businesses that hire people who are coming off welfare rolls. Part of what I try to show is that the logic and tools of Clinton's policy are similar to the supply-side liberalism of the earlier 20th century, but the tools are turned back on the liberal state itself in an effort to drain the politics out of welfare.\n\nRachel Cohen: Today we have an emergent intellectual movement calling themselves supply-side liberals, or supply-side progressives, organizing around what they call an \" abundance agenda .\" Led by people like Vox co-founder Ezra Klein , they're calling for more housing, transit, more stuff in general, and say they want to help make democratic governments more effective and nimble. Do you see this movement as part of the same supply-side lineage you trace?\n\nBrent Cebul: I do think that they see a similar sort of market-sculpting role for government to play, and I think there's a similar developmental pragmatism that defines both of these periods, which is making the best of what the constitutional federal structure will offer.\n\nI think in both cases, there's much to commend that outlook for in terms of recognizing the ways in which the government can actually play a remarkably innovative role in creating new markets. And what I think they recognize is that there are vast sectors of business that, despite all the ideological pronunciations against government and regulation, are absolutely happy to take subsidies. I think that's actually a really crucial insight for liberalism in general, and just the rediscovery of the potential for partnerships between the liberal state and business is really promising.\n\nRachel Cohen: What lessons or historical advice would you give to this modern-day supply-side liberal movement? Are there any mistakes you think they should work to avoid or be mindful of?\n\nBrent Cebul: Where they risk repeating the same kinds of mistakes as liberals going back to the New Deal is if they are less willing to impose certain types of progressive regulations along with those subsidies. The classic case recently is the resistance to using green subsidies, electric car subsidies, to stimulate union employment. My historical assumption is basically that if the subsidies are good enough, businesses will go along with that. And I think there's a liberal tendency to sort of negotiate down before you've even had the hard conversation with the businesspeople or your opposition. And so the historical lesson from this is there's been in the past an unwillingness to really include protections for minority constituencies in communities all across the country.\n\nI think liberals sell themselves short if they don't demand more. One example I talk about at the end of my book is the number of businesses like Steris that received venture capital startup funds from the federal government and have now done things like tax inversions.\n\nRachel Cohen: Can you say more about what you mean by demanding more?\n\nBrent Cebul: One of the things that you often saw in the 1980s and '90s with the neoliberal generation of Democrats is this sort of hard-nosed language around economic growth, that it's more important than social values at the moment, and once we get our economic house in order then we'll be able to deal with these downstream social issues. And surprise, it turns out they're completely inextricable from each other. And if you only focus on the economic, then you're largely going to entrench and worsen the social issues.\n\nSo they just have to be dealt with at the same time, and what I would say is that subsidizing economic growth actually gives the state leverage to pursue some of the social goals if they choose to take advantage of it. I think that's precisely one of the things that the Roosevelt administration bumbled its way into. I don't think it's an accident that they were able to get a whole lot of their social programs through in the 1930s at a moment when all of these local Chambers of Commerce were also feeding at the trough of federal subsidies.\n\nRachel Cohen: Your book is called Illusions of Progress . Can you talk about the title?\n\nBrent Cebul: The illusion is that by putting businesspeople in the cockpit of momentous federal programs that you're going to be able to deliver broader gains for the poor and the racially and socially marginalized.\n\nRachel Cohen: You describe how Black Americans started to demand \"administrative enfranchisement\" in new federal programs. Can you talk briefly about what happened?\n\nBrent Cebul: Cities are so dependent on property values for property taxation, which is their lifeblood. So very early in the New Deal, urban governments started using the Public Works Administration, the Works Progress Administration, and the housing programs as an excuse to clear out what they viewed as \"decadent communities\" - meaning Black communities that didn't have very high property values and were perceived as being a sort of net drain on city services. So under the aegis of the New Deal, and its subsidized labor programs, all these local governments started clearing Black neighborhoods, and as early as 1937 the NAACP and local Black political leaders are calling for a seat at the table to help determine how these really momentous federal programs are being handled at the local level.\n\nWhat I tried to show is that protesting urban renewal was central to what the civil rights movement was up to, no matter where you look.\n\nRachel Cohen: So how do we go from that pursuit of \"administrative enfranchisement\" to where we are today, where it feels like powerful interests and lobbyists so often monopolize this community input process?\n\nBrent Cebul: What happens in the 1960s is totally fascinating, because the community action programs in the War on Poverty had this incredibly radical idea, which is what they call \"maximum feasible participation\" - that they're going to allow local community groups to apply for federal community development funds, to do a whole range of things from opening community centers, to job training programs, to even, you know, opening a McDonald's franchise in one case. But then marginalized community members start using it to protest local business, and people's domination of the local political scene, and almost immediately the Lyndon Johnson administration moves to bring local businesspeople back in to lead these very programs. And so what I tried to show in the book is that the actual maximum feasible participation principle gets kneecapped really quickly.\n\nBut the participatory principle itself sort of retains this sort of curious half-life, really up until today, where the federal government, local governments, and businesspeople learn that they need to have something that looks and feels like participation for marginalized people, but by the 1980s it's really about managing their participation - getting them to buy in on various austerity measures by choosing where the cuts are going to be made, that sort of thing. So to your point, more mobilized interests have since been able to capitalize on those same practices and to actually implement their vision or block programs that they might otherwise not have been able to do without this \"participation.\"\n\nRachel Cohen: After studying these periods, do you have any thoughts on how we can better bring in community participation or administrative enfranchisement without getting ensnared in the kind of co-optive politics and NIMBYism we see today?\n\nBrent Cebul: One of the things that I think Lyndon Johnson failed to do in the 1960s was to anticipate the blowback he was going to get for the community action program. As a result, he didn't realize that it would have benefited him to buy off the local businesspeople by having a commensurate program for them. So one of the things I would urge modern-day supply-side liberals to do is to have as capacious a range of potential beneficiaries of any given program as possible, and to make sure that you're being careful that there isn't, you know, jealousy structured by the programs.\n\nThere's obviously going to be competition and jealousy anyway, and there are going to be normative claims about who should and shouldn't be getting federal aid and there are going to be scandals, but I think you could turn the temperature down on that if you're willing to build a big enough bill and a big enough boat.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nModern liberalism is weak and under siege. Its path to revival is clear - if liberals are willing to take it.\n\nby Zack Beauchamp\n\nAmerican liberalism is in desperate need of renewal . Its ideas too often feel stale, its nostrums unsuited to beating back the authoritarian populist tide.\n\nYet there is an opportunity for revival - if liberals are willing to more forthrightly embrace the politics of identity.\n\nTo many liberals, such a suggestion will sound like blasphemy. Since mere days after Donald Trump's 2016 victory, an unending stream of op-eds and books have accused \"identity politics\" - defined loosely as a left-wing political style that centers the interests and concerns of oppressed groups - of driving the country off a moral and political cliff.\n\nThese critics accuse identity politics of being a cancer on the very idea of liberalism , pulling the mainstream American left away from a politics of equal citizenship and shared civic responsibility. It is, moreover, political suicide, a woke purism that makes it impossible to form winning political coalitions - evidenced, in critics' minds , by the backlash to Sen. Bernie Sanders's embrace of the popular podcast host Joe Rogan .\n\nThe idea that identity politics is at odds with liberalism has become conventional wisdom in parts of the American political and intellectual elite . Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker has condemned contemporary identity politics as \"an enemy of reason and Enlightenment values.\" New York Times columnist Bari Weiss argues that the \"corrupt identity politics of the left\" amounts to a dangerously intolerant worldview. And New York magazine's Andrew Sullivan claims the \"woke left\" seems \"not to genuinely believe in liberalism, liberal democracy, or persuasion.\" This line of thinking is practically the founding credo of the school of internet thought known as the Intellectual Dark Web .\n\nIt is also deeply, profoundly wrong.\n\nWhat these critics lambaste as an attack on liberalism is actually its best form: the logical extension of liberalism's core commitment to social equality and democracy, adapted to address modern sources of inequality. A liberalism that rejects identity politics is a liberalism for the powerful, one that relegates the interests of marginalized groups to second-class status.\n\nBut identity politics is not only important as a matter of liberal principle. In the face of an existential threat from right-wing populists in Europe and the United States, liberals need to harness new sources of political energy to fight back. This is not a matter of short-term politics, of whether being \"too woke\" will help or hurt Democrats in 2020, but a deeper and more fundamental question: what types of organizations and activist movements are required to make liberalism sustainable in the 21st century. And there is good reason to believe the passions stirred by identity politics can renew a liberalism gone haggard.\n\nTo say that liberalism and identity politics are at odds is to misunderstand our political situation. Identity politics isn't merely compatible with liberalism; it is, in fact, liberalism's truest face. If liberalism wishes to succeed in 21st-century America, it shouldn't reject identity politics - it should embrace it.\n\nAll politics is, in a certain sense, identity politics . Every kind of political approach appeals to particular aspects of voters' identities; some are just more explicit than others.\n\nBut critics of identity politics have a very particular politics in mind - a mode of rhetoric and organizing that prioritizes the concerns and experiences of historically marginalized groups, emphasizing the group's particularity.\n\nTo understand why this kind of identity politics is so controversial - and what its critics often get wrong about it - we need to turn to the work of the late University of Chicago philosopher Iris Marion Young.\n\nIn 1990, Young published a classic book titled Justice and the Politics of Difference . At the time, political philosophy was dominated by internal debates among liberals who focused heavily on the question of wealth distribution. Young, both a philosopher and a left activist, found this narrow discourse unsatisfying.\n\nIn her view, mainstream American liberalism had assumed a particular account of what social equality means: \"that equal social status for all persons requires treating everyone according to the same principles, rules, and standards.\" Securing \"equality\" on this view means things like desegregation and passing nondiscrimination laws, efforts to end overt discrimination against marginalized groups.\n\nThis is an important start, Young argues, but not nearly enough. The push for formally equal treatment can't eliminate all sources of structural inequality; in fact, it can serve to mask and even deepen them. Judging a poor black kid and a rich white one by the same allegedly meritocratic college admissions standards, for example, will likely lead to the rich white one's admission - perpetuating a punishing form of inequality that started at birth.\n\nYoung sees an antidote in a political vision she developed out of experiences in social movements, which she calls \"the politics of difference.\" Sometimes, Young argues, achieving true equality demands treating groups differently rather than the same. \"The specificity of each group requires a specific set of rights for each, and for some a more comprehensive system than for others,\" Young writes. The goal is identity consciousness rather than identity blindness: \"Black Lives Matter\" over \"All Lives Matter.\"\n\nShe did not like using the term \"identity politics\" for this approach, arguing in her 2000 book Inclusion and Democracy that it was misleadingly narrow. But two decades later, what she sketched out is what we understand \"identity politics\" to mean.\n\nYoung's philosophical precision allows us to understand what's distinctive about contemporary identity politics. It also helps us understand why critics see it as such a threat.\n\nIdentity politics' dissatisfaction with formal equal treatment is, in their view, fundamentally illiberal. Its emphasis on correcting structural discrimination can morph into a kind of authoritarianism , an obsession with the policing of speech and behaviors (especially from white, straight, cisgender men) at odds with liberalism's core commitments to individual rights, so the critics fret. They see college students disinviting conservative speakers for being \"problematic,\" or \"canceling\" celebrities who violate the rules of acceptable discourse on race or gender identity, as evidence that identity politics' fundamental aim is overturning liberalism in the name of equality.\n\nThis approach is not only illiberal, the critics argue, but self-defeating. The more emphasis that is placed on the separateness of American social groups, the less space there is for a politically effective and wide-ranging liberalism.\n\n\"The only way to [win power] is to have a message that appeals to as many people as possible and pulls them together,\" Columbia professor Mark Lilla writes in his recent book The Once and Future Liberal . \"Identity liberalism does just the opposite.\"\n\nMany of these critics see themselves as coming from a relatively progressive and firmly liberal starting point. They tend to profess support for the ideals of racial or gender equality. What they can't abide is a political approach that emphasizes difference, shaping its policy proposals around specific oppressions rather than universal ideals.\n\nIt is a philosophical argument with political implications: a claim that the essence of identity politics is illiberal, and for that reason its continued influence on the American left augurs both moral and electoral doom.\n\nIt's hardly absurd for someone like Lilla to see tension between liberalism and identity politics. Young herself described the politics of difference as not a species of liberalism but a challenge to it.\n\nBut her stance notwithstanding, political philosophers have come to see the politics of identity as part of a vibrant liberalism. In 1998, Canadian scholar Will Kymlicka identified an \" emerging consensus \" among political philosophers on what he calls \"liberal multiculturalism,\" the idea that \"groups have a valid claim, not only to tolerance and non-discrimination, but also to explicit accommodation, recognition and representation within the institutions of the larger society.\"\n\nIf we examine liberalism's core moral commitments, Kymlicka's consensus shouldn't be a surprise.\n\nThe quintessential liberal value is freedom. Liberalism's core political ambition is to create a society where citizens are free to participate as equals, cooperating on mutually agreeable terms in political life and pursuing whatever vision of private life they find meaningful and fulfilling. Freedom in this sense cannot be achieved in political systems defined by identity-based oppression. When members of some social groups face barriers to living the life they choose, purely as a result of their membership in that group, then the society they live in is failing on liberal terms.\n\nIdentity politics seeks to draw attention to and combat such sources of unfreedom. Consider the following facts about American life:\n\nThere is no law saying black people can't own houses, that women married to men must do the cooking and cleaning, or that LGBTQ teens must harm themselves. These problems have more subtle causes, including legacies of historical discrimination, deeply embedded social norms, and inadequate legislative attention to the particular circumstances of marginalized groups.\n\nIdentity politics' focus on the need to go beyond anti-discrimination works to open new avenues for dealing with the insidious nature of modern group-based inequality. Once you understand that this is the actual aim of identity politics, it becomes clear that critiques of its alleged authoritarianism miss the forest for the trees.\n\nIt is of course true that one can point to illiberal behavior by activists in the name of identity politics: Think of the student group at the City University of New York that attempted to shout down a relatively mainstream conservative legal scholar 's lecture out of hostility to his views on immigration law. But instances of campus intolerance are actually quite uncommon , despite their omnipresence in the media, and the idea that a handful of student excesses represent the core of \"identity politics\" is a mistake.\n\nOne can say the same thing for social media outrages. It's certainly true that many practitioners of identity politics send over-the-top tweets or pen Facebook posts calling for people to be fired without good cause. It's also true that some practitioners of every kind of politics do these things. Holding up an outrageous-sounding tweet as representative of the allegedly authoritarian heart of identity politics is a basic analytical error: confusing a platform problem, the way social media highlights the most extreme versions of all ideologies , with a doctrinal defect in identity politics.\n\nMerely because a liberal movement contains some illiberal components doesn't make it fundamentally illiberal; if it did, then slave-owning American founders and bigoted Enlightenment philosophers would have to be booted out of the liberal canon.\n\nThe key question is whether the agenda and aims of identity politics' adherents advance liberal freedom compared to the status quo. On this point, it's clear that the practitioners of \"identity politics\" are on the liberal side.\n\nIn recent years, we have seen champions of identity politics rack up impressive accomplishments - victories like defeating prosecutors with troubling records on race at the ballot box , getting sexual assault allegations taken seriously in the workplace , and securing health care coverage for transition-related medical care .\n\nThese are hardly examples of woke Stalinism. They are instead victories of liberal reform and democratic activism, incremental changes aimed at addressing deep-rooted sources of unfreedom.\n\nTime and again throughout American history, from abolitionism to the movement for same-sex marriage, members of marginalized groups have refused to abandon liberalism's promises. They put their lives on the line, risking death on Civil War battlefields and in the streets of Birmingham, in defense of liberal ideals. When they demanded change, they won it through the push-and-pull of democratic politics and political activism that constitute the heart of liberal praxis. In essayist Adam Serwer's evocative phrasing : \"The American creed has no more devoted adherents than those who have been historically denied its promises.\"\n\nToday's practitioners of identity politics are the proper heirs to this tradition. Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, one of the most prominent defenders of \"identity politics\" in American public life, has devoted her post-election career to an unimpeachably liberal cause - fighting restrictions on the franchise, particularly those that disproportionately affect black voters.\n\nIn a recent Foreign Affairs essay , Abrams made the case that one of the central aims of identity politics is bolstering liberalism - that it is \"activism that will strengthen democratic rule, not threaten it.\" In Abrams's view, the persistence of structural oppression, and in particular the Trump-era backlash to social progress, requires careful attention to identity, and in particular what marginalized groups want from their political elites.\n\n\"By embracing identity and its prickly, uncomfortable contours,\" Abrams wrote, \"Americans will become more likely to grow as one.\"\n\nThe critics of identity politics have another complaint: that its hold on the Democratic Party can only lead to electoral perdition. Abrams, as inspirational as many find her, did lose the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial race. Maybe identity politics can be defended theoretically but in practice alienates too many people to be put in practice.\n\nIt's possible to challenge the specifics of these arguments. Abrams didn't win, but it was a very tight loss in a historically red state (in fact, 2018 was the closest Georgia gubernatorial election in the state in more than 50 years ). And you can point to many examples that go in the other direction - at the local , state , and national levels.\n\nBut it would be myopic to tie ourselves up in these near-term (and frankly inconclusive) tactical arguments. We have a broader crisis to worry about.\n\nDebating the interests of the Democratic Party confines the imagination; rising illiberalism in the United States is a deeper problem than the Trump presidency. To reckon with it, we need to take a longer view, looking at the beliefs and sources of activist energy that define the contours of what's possible in American electoral politics.\n\nSince World War II, liberalism and its core beliefs about rights and freedom have served as something like the operating system for democratic politics. But in recent years, this consensus has come under severe stress. Elite failures and global catastrophes - particularly the one-two punch of the financial and refugee crises - have caused Western publics to lose faith in the liberal order's guardians. Illiberal right-wing populism has emerged as a potent alternative model. The West's fundamental commitment to liberalism is coming into question.\n\nLiberals are in the midst of war - and in it, giving up identity politics amounts to a kind of unilateral disarmament. Today's political contests, in both the United States and Europe, are increasingly defined by conflict surrounding demographic change and the erosion of traditional social hierarchies. These are the central issues in our politics, the ones that most powerfully motivate people to vote and join political organizations.\n\nThe anti-liberal side has pegged its vision almost entirely to backlash politics, to rolling back the gains made by ethnic and racial minorities , women , and the LGBTQ community . The challenge for liberals is not primarily winning over voters who find that regressive vision appealing; no modern liberal party can be as authentically bigoted as a far-right one. At the same time, liberals should not write off entire heterogeneous demographic blocs like \"the white working class\" as unpersuadable. Instead, the main task of liberal politics should be mobilizing those from all backgrounds who oppose the far-right's vision - knitting together in common cause a staggeringly diverse array of people with very different experiences.\n\nThe 2017 Women's March is a concrete example of how identity politics can help in this struggle.\n\nThe march was billed, at the time, as both an expression of feminist rage and the major anti-Trump action the weekend of the inauguration. Some liberal identity skeptics fretted that these goals were antithetical; that the particularism of the event's feminist rhetoric would end up dividing the anti-Trump coalition.\n\n\"I think many men assume the 'Women's March' is supposed to be women-only, which is why it was a bad name for the main anti-Trump march,\" New York magazine's Jonathan Chait wrote . \"There are many grounds on which to object to Trump. Feminism is one. I think [the] goal should be to get all of them together.\"\n\nChait's concerns were clearly unfounded. The 2017 Women's March was by some estimates the largest single day of protest in US history , with somewhere in the range of 3 million to 5 million people attending the various marches nationwide. Feminism, far from being a divisive theme, served to mobilize large numbers of people to get out and demonstrate against America's illiberal turn.\n\nBut what happened next is particularly interesting: The experience of attending Women's Marches seems to have galvanized a significant number of people - overwhelmingly women - to engage in sustained activism for both gender equality and the defense of liberalism more broadly.\n\nIn the years following the 2017 demonstrations, Harvard researchers Leah Gose and Theda Skocpol conducted extensive fieldwork among anti-Trump activists. They found that the march helped mobilize many new activists - the bulk of whom were middle-class, educated white women in their 50s or older. \"Following the marches,\" they found, \"clusters of women in thousands of communities across America carried on with forming local groups to sustain anti-Trump activism.\"\n\nThe Women's March seems to have played a crucial role in turning these women into activists who not only opposed Trump but aimed to defend liberalism's promise of equal freedom. Activists interviewed by Gose and Skocpol frequently cited a concern for the health of American democracy as a reason for their engagement. Despite being heavily white, they also worked on issues that are of particular concern to racial minorities - organizing against (for example) the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and child separation.\n\n\"As before throughout American history,\" Gose and Skocpol write, \"women's civic activism may revitalize democratic engagement and promote a new birth of responsive government in communities across the land.\"\n\nIn a recent working paper, political scientist Jonathan Pinckney took a close look at the impact of the Women's March on three metrics: increase of size in Democratic-aligned activist groups, ideology of Democratic members of Congress, and the share of the Democratic vote in 2018. He found that areas with larger attendance at the 2017 marches later saw \"significantly increased movement activity, left-ward shifts in congressional voting scores, and a greater swing to the Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections.\"\n\nThe Women's March itself seems to have largely petered out, succumbing to fatigue and leadership infighting . But its true legacy will be the activist networks it helped create, ones that contributed to sustained and impactful challenges to an illiberal presidency.\n\nThis kind of thing is what, in the long run, liberalism needs: a way to make its defense fresh and exciting, mobilizing specific groups toward the collective task of defeating the far right. Doing so will require meeting people where they are, engaging them on the identity issues that matter deeply and profoundly. Knitting this latent energy into a durable and electorally viable coalition will be the work of a generation, but it's hard to see how American liberalism can get off its heels without trying.\n\nIt's true, of course, that the interests of members of marginalized groups are not always aligned, and that such groups also contain a lot of internal disagreements and diversity. There are always hard questions regarding building coalitions. Should Sanders have denounced Joe Rogan' s endorsement? Is former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's dubious record on race and policing disqualifying? These are important questions, and there will be more like them. They will lead to more fights among liberals and the broader left.\n\nBut political factions of all ideologies have to make tough judgment calls when it comes time to engage in electoral politics, and there's nothing about identity politics that makes it uniquely poorly suited to the task.\n\nWhile the politics of difference is attuned to the specific experiences of social groups, it also contains a universalizing impulse: a sense that all structural injustices - stemming from racism, sexism, class structure, or whatever - are to be opposed. There's a core commitment to solidarity, to not only listening to the members of other groups but seeing their struggle as linked to your own.\n\n\"Having to be accountable to people from diverse social positions with different needs, interests, and experience helps transform discourse from self-regard to appeals to justice,\" Young writes in Inclusion and Democracy .\n\nAn anti-oppression framework gives people a moral language for articulating their disagreements and perspectives, for constructing a sense of unity and shared purpose out of difference. That we're having these conversations at all, and are agonizing over what exactly our liberalism should look like, is all to the good - because rebuilding liberalism around anti-oppression values, no matter how difficult it might seem in the moment, is its best hope for an enduring revival.\n\nIf all of this is right, and liberalism needs identity politics not just to survive but to succeed, then an obvious question looms: How can it be adapted to take issues of identity more seriously? What might the ideals and aspirations of an identity-focused liberalism be, and how might it imagine making them possible?\n\nOne good place to start is the work of CUNY philosopher Charles Mills. Mills's most famous book, The Racial Contract (1997), is a fundamental critique of the Enlightenment political tradition, arguing that racist attitudes expressed by philosophical giants like Immanuel Kant are not some alien parasite on their theories, but vital to their intellectual enterprises.\n\nIt's the kind of thoroughgoing dissection you might expect from a socialist or black nationalist, someone willing to scrap liberalism altogether. Yet at the end of his most recent book, Black Rights/White Wrongs , Mills explains that his project is not aimed at supplanting liberalism but rather rescuing it - by developing what he calls \"black radical liberalism.\"\n\nCentral to black radical liberalism is the idea of \"corrective justice\": the notion that liberalism as it has been practiced historically has fallen badly short of its highest ideals of guaranteeing equal freedom, and that the task of modern liberalism ought to be rectifying the racial inequalities of its past incarnations.\n\nMills's approach is refreshing because it moves beyond the strange conservatism in so much liberal writing today. His work is not an uncritical valorization of the Enlightenment nor a paean to dead white thinkers ; it does not aim to Make Liberalism Great Again. It is instead a harshly critical account of liberalism's history that nonetheless aims to advance liberalism's core values and secure its greatest accomplishments.\n\nThe animating force of identity politics, what gives it such extraordinary power to mobilize, is deep wells of outrage at structural injustice. Millions of people see the cruelties of the Trump administration - its detention of migrant children in camps, the Muslim ban, the plan to define transgender people out of existence by executive fiat, the president's description of Charlottesville neo-Nazis as \"very fine people\"- and want to do something.\n\nToday's liberals often focus their arguments on bloodless abstractions like \"democratic norms\" and the \"liberal international order.\" I don't deny that these things are important; I've written in their defense myself.\n\nBut people aren't angry about norm erosion in the way they are about, say, state-sanctioned mistreatment of migrant kids. By making identity politics something not outside of liberalism but at the center of it, liberals can enlist the energies of identity to the defense of liberalism itself.\n\nDoing that successfully requires a level of Millsian radicalism. While this sort of identity liberalism would not reject the accomplishments of the past, it requires admitting their insufficiency. It means accepting that liberalism is a doctrine that has failed in key ways, and that repairing its errors requires centering the interests of the groups that have been most wronged. It means appealing to the specificity of group experiences, while also emphasizing their shared interests in the twinned fights against oppression and for liberal democracy.\n\nThis approach will require compromises from some mainstream liberals, who will need to start welcoming in people and ideas they might not like. They'll need to get over squeamishness about student activists and their pain regarding political correctness, to recognize that their vision of balancing competing political interests won't always win out. That's not to say they can't argue for their ideas; this type of liberal can and should be entitled to make the case for more cautious political approaches. But liberals need to stop trying to play gatekeeper, to banish ideas like intersectionality to the illiberal wilds.\n\nBecause the practitioners of identity politics are not illiberal. They are, in fact, some of the best friends liberalism has today.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA new case for socialism reveals the ways liberals and socialists need each other - and why they have so much trouble getting along.\n\nby Zack Beauchamp\n\nPrior to 2016, a video of an avowed Marxist praising a Democratic candidate would have been fodder for attack ads.\n\nBut last week, senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders tweeted a video endorsement from Bhaskar Sunkara, the editor of the Marxist magazine Jacobin. In it, Sunkara casts the Sanders campaign as not just about 2020 but a broader campaign to remake America along socialistic lines.\n\n\"This is a project,\" he says, \"to remake America and American politics.\"\n\nThere's no doubt, between Sanders and superstar Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that socialism is having a moment. The Democratic Socialists of America went from having 8,500 members in fall 2016 to more than 50,000 members in fall 2018. The new socialist movement's hub in Brooklyn has been the subject of glossy magazine features ; its fans, denoted by a red rose emoji in their Twitter handles, are inescapable on the platform.\n\nIn this movement, Sunkara is something like a head convener or ideologue. He founded Jacobin in 2011, way before socialism was cool again, in an effort to repopularize the moribund American left. Today, it's the leading left publication in the country, a place where socialists publish dispatches from across the world and debate proposals for a post-capitalist future.\n\nIn an attempt to take this left revival a step further, Sunkara has just published a new book, The Socialist Manifesto . The name makes the ambition of the slim 243-page volume plain: Sunkara's aim is to write both a history of socialism and a blueprint for its future, a road map to guide activists looking to end capitalism and replace it with something other than Soviet-style communism. The book's penultimate chapter, \"How We Win,\" is literally a 15-point plan for a democratic overthrow of American capitalism.\n\nThe book is a testament to the self-confidence of the new American socialist movement, a group certain of its rightness and uninterested in compromising on its radical ends. The ambition and excitement of the movement, and its youthful members (Bernie aside), pulses through this and most other new socialist texts.\n\nYet there is a specter haunting The Socialist Manifesto : the specter of liberalism.\n\nThe deep tension between left-liberalism, aimed at reforming capitalist liberal democracy, and socialism, aimed at overthrowing it entirely, has defined the politics of the left for well over a century. Sunkara's book pores over details of this tension in the past, including debates between reformists and radicals in places ranging from 19th-century Germany to 20th-century America. But it is comparatively muted on the debate's present and future.\n\nThis is a shame. The truth is that liberals, currently at their weakest and most defensive since the end of the Cold War, have a lot to learn from the energy and ideas of socialists like Sunkara. They don't need to join the socialist movement, but they do need to treat it respectfully - and study what makes it so vital today.\n\nMeanwhile, although socialists have found real success pressuring liberals from the outside, it's not nearly enough to achieve their ambitious goals. If socialists want to actually help shape policy in the short term, they can't just write manifestos and mean tweets. They need to form a broad political coalition to work with them on everything from union actions to battles over legislation in Congress.\n\nLiberals and socialists today need each other, whether they like it or not. The question raised by the rise of the modern left is whether the fundamental intellectual tensions between left-liberalism and socialism, together with more than 100 years of historical conflict, can prevent the formation of a new popular front .\n\nThe Socialist Manifesto is an odd book.\n\nIt opens with a hypothetical chapter about an idyllic America transformed by a socialist party led by Bruce Springsteen, mostly told from the perspective of a worker at Jon Bon Jovi's father's curry pasta sauce bottling plant .\n\nThe bulk of what comes after that is not a manifesto at all. It's mostly a recounting of the socialist movement and its offshoots, from Marx and Engels forward. Sunkara, to his credit, doesn't shirk from examining the dark times of Stalin and Mao, even conceding that \"we cannot claim that the excesses of Maoism had nothing to do with Marxism.\"\n\nHowever, the essential theme of the book is that Marx and the movements he inspired were largely right, and that the Soviet Union and Maoist China were authoritarian deviances from an ideology that is, at its core, democratic and liberatory. \"Today there is much talk of 'democratic socialism,' and indeed I see that term as synonymous with 'socialism,'\" he writes.\n\nSo how does one revive American socialism in the 21st century - and prevent a rerun of the failures of the 20th?\n\nSocialists need to start, Sunkara writes, by electing Bernie Sanders president, then quickly pass policies like Medicare-for-all that push the US toward a more centralized model of social democracy. Other goals include abolishing the Electoral College, rewriting the Constitution to allow for amendments by referenda, and replacing the House and Senate with a \"proportionally elected unicameral legislature.\"\n\nBut socialists need to go deeper than all that, in Sunkara's view. \"Democratic socialists must secure decisive majorities in legislatures while winning hegemony in the unions,\" he writes. To do that, they create \"a new generation of nonsectarian socialist organizers,\" embed them in \"working class\" professions like education and health care, and create a new \"workers' party\" that pushes Democrats to the left and eventually becomes \"a completely independent, democratic socialist ballot line.\" Only then, he believes, will it be possible to fully transition from capitalism to a bright socialist future.\n\nSome of these objectives (electing Sanders) are more immediately plausible than others (getting rid of the House and Senate). On the whole, though, enacting this agenda is the work of a generation, if not multiple generations. Yet the problems Sunkara identifies as the motivation for socialism - he claims it can cure poverty, economic exploitation, climate catastrophe, and even nationalist wars - cannot wait decades.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is still under attack , with millions standing to lose their health care. Major climate change action has to happen in the near future to prevent irreversible, devastating warming. The Trump administration is slouching toward war with Venezuela and Iran . Sunkara himself admits some response to this kind of immediate problem is necessary.\n\n\"It is possible to achieve certain socialist goals within capitalism,\" he says. \"Fighting climate change can't wait until 'after the revolution.'\"\n\nBut how are socialists going to achieve those goals when the largest socialist movement in America, a country of 330 million people, is 50,000 strong? How do you fight the immediate battles while still waging the larger war?\n\nThe Socialist Manifesto doesn't have much to say on this question. But there's an obvious answer: Socialists need to find a way to work with the liberals who dominate the country's major center-left party. For socialists to achieve their immediate goals, to stave off disaster and start moving the country in their direction, there's no alternative to some kind of popular front with liberals in a series of immediate, practical fights. It's not enough to push liberals to the left; you also need to help left-liberals beat the right and muscle broadly left-wing policy ideas through actual legislatures.\n\nBut can this alliance really happen?\n\nThe modern American left seems to treat \"liberals\" and \"liberalism\" as enemies rather than partners. Left Twitter personalities and publications are constantly denouncing the timidity and perfidy of liberals; the need to move \"beyond liberalism\" is a popular theme (that's to say nothing of bromides against \"neoliberalism,\" a separate but oft-conflated beast ).\n\nSunkara's book is more restrained but still a bit cutting. The book never defines \"liberals\" or \"liberalism\" as terms, nor engages with their political tradition in any sustained way. But it's lightly peppered with derisive references to them. Liberals are castigated for everything from failing to vigorously oppose World War I to watering down the Black Lives Matter movement; liberalism is described as \"inadequate\" to 19th-century German workers' needs and decried for its \"mendacity\" in early-20th-century Russia.\n\nThose good things accomplished under capitalism - the American and European welfare states, most notably - are credited to social democrats, presented as offshoots of the Marxist tradition. But social democracy is, at its core, a movement that marries socialist concerns about the misery caused by capitalism to liberal reformism. What is social democracy if not the left pole of liberalism?\n\nAs a liberal myself, I'm tempted to hit back even harder at Sunkara and the rest of modern left's attacks on liberalism. The world's most important Marxist states have all descended into authoritarianism, whereas the world's freest and most egalitarian countries are all liberal democracies. Modern socialist intellectuals and publications - including Sunkara's Jacobin - have celebrated Hugo Chávez, the late Venezuelan socialist leader whose policies dismantled the country's democracy and destroyed its economy . The nightmare in Venezuela goes curiously unmentioned in The Socialist Manifesto.\n\nBut my impulse here is part of the problem: It's not just socialists who have a tendency to take gratuitous shots at their natural allies. Punching left is a time-honored tradition among liberals, especially in relatively right-leaning America. It's partly a way to signal \"seriousness\" to moderates and conservatives, but only partly. The liberal-socialist disagreement stems from deep-seated philosophical disagreements.\n\nLiberals prioritize individual rights and formal democratic freedoms over economic equality, concerned that the socialist dream of \"class warfare\" is inimical to a society that depends on mutual cooperation and tolerance. Liberals focus on injustices that they believe undermine the foundational promises of this system, like racism and extreme economic inequality, rather than overturning the economic class system entirely.\n\nSocialists believe that liberals are entranced by \"bourgeois democracy,\" blind to the ways private ownership of the means of production makes reform inadequate and meaningful democracy impossible. The liberal idea of democracy under capitalism is naive, they say, when inequality inevitably leads to the rich functionally purchasing control of the political system. Society is at its heart a negative-sum contest between classes, where the rising clout of capital invariably ends up hurting the poor and working class.\n\nObviously, these are stylized summaries of profoundly complicated political visions. But at their core, they speak to the ways that cooperative-minded liberals and conflict-minded socialists disagree - and why they see each other as so threatening.\n\nYet these big-picture disputes aren't really relevant to the policy debates in America today, even the ones that split the Democratic party.\n\nMedicare-for-all wouldn't threaten capitalism, as Britain's National Health Service shows. Raising the marginal income tax rate on top earners up to 70 percent, as AOC has proposed, is just a return to pre-Reagan levels. Even the Green New Deal, the most ambitious set of left-leaning policy proposals in recent history, wouldn't shake American capitalism to its core.\n\nModerates and conservative Democrats, like former Vice President Joe Biden, oppose these ideas - but that's hardly the orthodox liberal position today. Left-liberals like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a self-described \"capitalist,\" are on board with these ideas or similar versions of them. Even less left-wing Democrats than Warren, like Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, have stated their support for some of them.\n\nThe bitter tone of the liberal-socialist divide has little do with policy. Outright socialization of the economy isn't really on the agenda at the moment. Rather, it stems from decades of fighting over first principles, historical grievances, and fundamentally contradictory worldviews - a visceral set of disagreements that limit cooperation even when they share significant immediate political interests.\n\nBut why should liberals care about Sunkara's book - or the critique from the socialist left at all - given their vast numerical superiority? Twitter isn't real life , after all, and Biden is beating Sanders by a fairly wide margin in the most recent polls . Why shouldn't liberals just dismiss Sunkara and his fellow travelers as gadflies?\n\nWell, for one thing, it seems like some of the socialist critiques of mainstream liberalism have been proven right.\n\nSocialists have long argued that the Democratic attempt to appease Republicans by pursuing redistributive ends through market means would neither win stable conservative support nor do nearly enough to tackle entrenched economic inequality in the United States. They were correct on both counts, for reasons best explained by center-left UC Berkeley economist Brad DeLong.\n\nLeft-liberals, DeLong concluded, need to give up on the dream of an alliance with the center right, and start building a new policy agenda that can accommodate political visions to its left. This isn't to say that Democrats should all join the DSA or start deferring to socialists on all policy questions - liberals still tremendously outnumber socialists, after all.\n\nRather, Democrats ought to make a more social democratic vision their political center of gravity, becoming more comfortable with direct state intervention in the economy instead of ginning up complex market mechanisms for accomplishing left-wing ends. That means more ideas like Medicare-for-all and the Green New Deal, fewer like Obamacare and cap and trade.\n\nLiberals also need to learn from socialists in another, less tangible way.\n\nThe truth is that liberalism today is boring. Its exponents tend to be older and its ideas stale, seemingly fighting the same Cold War battles 30 years past their expiration date. This is partly the result of Democratic policy and electoral failures - the 2016 election was a body blow to standard-issue Democratic liberalism - but also a result of its ideological success. Liberalism has so thoroughly defined the Democratic Party for so long that for many people, it's difficult to get excited about it.\n\nWhat's more, liberal intellectuals have entered into a kind of defensive crouch. When faced with a resurgent right - Donald Trump in America and far-right parties in Europe - they tend to speak in generic bromides about the value of bloodless abstractions like the \"liberal international order,\" or wring their hands and wonder if the right has a point about immigration . Their work too often feels either staid or accommodationist, either mere rearguard defenses of a flawed status quo or worryingly willing to accommodate the raw racism and xenophobia at the heart of the resurgent right.\n\nSocialists, by contrast, are full of energy and confidence. To read The Socialist Manifesto or any other major works of the modern left is to be immersed in a movement sure of its own moral worth, clear on what it believes in and willing to fight for it. Twitter seems filled with socialists not only because they're disproportionately represented among the kinds of people who tweet, but also because they have a passion for their ideals that so many liberals today seem to lack.\n\nThis is what American liberals need to learn from. They need to not shun socialist intellectuals like Sunkara but study them. To learn how they fight for their ideas, and work out a vision of liberalism that feels like it's worth fighting for.

      "text": "Democrats should start accepting pro-life liberals like me\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt's lonely being a pro-life progressive.\n\nby Patrick Day\n\n\"Can you be a Democrat and the support of the Democratic Party if you are pro-life?\" Chuck Todd asked Nancy Pelosi on Meet the Press in late April. In that moment the air turned thin in my lungs. Chuck Todd was asking if I was allowed to be a Democrat.\n\nIt took Pelosi less than a second to respond to the question: \"Of course. Of course. I have served many years in Congress with members who have not shared my very positive - my family would say aggressive - position on promoting a woman's right to choose.\"\n\nI exhaled. My body calmed. Nancy Pelosi, the spokesperson for the party, says I'm allowed to be a Democrat. I love my party, I love what Democrats stand for. I love the warm embrace of fighting together with other members of the party.\n\nIt's not often that I feel accepted by my party. In fact, the best way I've found to live as a pro-life Democrat is just to avoid the topic. Most of the people I'm surrounded by in liberal, cosmopolitan Seattle are progressives, so once people know how I feel about abortion, they want to \"help me\" - meaning fix me. Then there's the lack of acceptance among my Christian community. I've been in the middle of a conversation with a conservative Christian friend where he just stops, mid-sentence, and says, \"we really need to talk about you voting for Democrats.\"\n\nPelosi then proceeds to talk about how \"it's our values that unify Democrats.\" I want to hug Nancy Pelosi, I want to cry on her shoulder. I post Nancy Pelosi's interview on Facebook. It's not well-received. My wall rapidly descends into bitterness, name-calling, other people fighting over whether I am allowed to be a Democrat.\n\nI just watch in horror, and remember why I don't post about abortion. I search the media for voices who champion Pelosi's call for unity. I find none: Mostly it's just conservative sites mocking Pelosi as a hypocrite. I begin to wonder if the detractors are right. Is there no place for me in the American political conversation?\n\nFirst, it needs to be understood that my view on politics is rooted in my faith. One core principle of that Christian faith is that every human is an eternal being who was created with purpose, by a reasoning mind. You and I aren't random. A creator looked at the world and designed each of us with a purpose to do something in this world: that includes my children, my co-workers, a homeless woman next to me on the bus, a bike mechanic in a tiny village in Uganda. We all have purpose. I also don't think Christianity has a monopoly on that idea; I have agnostic and even atheistic friends who agree with parts of this.\n\nBecause of that core belief about humanity:\n\nThere are other issues where I fall in line with progressives, such as international diplomacy, foreign aid, gun control, and the death penalty.\n\nIt's clear from these views that I'm a Democrat. But when it comes to abortion, things get more complicated.\n\nTo me, the abortion argument is about an ethical line we draw in pregnancy between pre-human and human life. Where exactly we each draw that line where things get fuzzy.\n\nMany people who have faith in the divine believe humans have a soul, and many of those people ascribe a soul very early in the process, conception being most common. But I really believe it comes down to that pesky line. The problem is, there is very little hope either side is going to prove their line is drawn at precisely the right moment. I don't know when a human gains a soul. I have some ideas based on my faith, but I can't tell you for certain. So in my case, because I don't know, I've decided to err on the side of life.\n\nA pro-choice person might argue that the focus should be on the woman, her choice, and the government's intervention in that personal choice. As a man, I've never personally been thrust into those hard decisions, but I've heard tough stories from women brave enough to share them.\n\nBut as unscientific as this might seem, I believe that the collection of cells formed at conception is a person. What I see in the unborn and in all of us is a soul, a purposed creation, a divine eternal being, more valuable than the entire US military budget. I'm not asking you to accept that premise, but if we could just begin to understand why we disagree, and find some respect for each other's perspective, it could be a first step.\n\nI'm hoping you can see that the reason I am pro-life is also the reason I am a Democrat. But in 2017, there is little room for nuance in politics. I feel like I am constantly prodded by both my Democratic and pro-life friends to see \"whose team I'm really on.\"\n\nEvery year, the partisanship seems to get worse, and I feel more alone and tired grappling with my political identity. It feels like complex views that break from the party are acceptable for other topics - you can break with your party on support for a minimum wage, or supporting or opposing the surveillance state.\n\nI often feel that the labels themselves, \"life\" and \"choice,\" exacerbate these divisions. Too often, I hear someone say \"I am pro-life\" and the response they get is \"You mean anti-choice\" and then they start arguing over the labels, rather than ever really talking about what we believe in or what we have in common.\n\nMany of my Democrat friends like to taunt pro-life people on their social media feeds. \"If they are pro-life why aren't they supporting health care,\" they'll post, or \"If they are so pro-life, how come they support the death penalty?\" Whenever I see one of these posts, I want to shout through the screen to my friend: \"I'm right over here!\"\n\nI also feel isolated within the Christian community for being a Democrat. It was particularly potent during the 2016 election. When the Access Hollywood tape came out in which Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women, I saw members of my church defending Trump. It felt eerily similar to how I felt when the backlash to the Pelosi and Sanders comments happened.\n\nI am the only Christian on a great many of my friends' Facebook feeds, and I am also the only Democrat on a great many other Facebook feeds. What I see is a need to stop taunting pro-life people. I believe there are politicians who are afraid of the people uniting on these issues because if we did, we could make radical progressive change.\n\nI know some pro-life women who voted democratic for the first time in 2016. These newly minted pro-life liberal women desperately wanted to be part of the Women's March in January, but didn't go. I believe the Women's March would have included them, but I understand that the organizers didn't want to come across as if they were supporting something they did not. But these friends didn't want to march with pro-life signs or cause arguments. They just wanted to go lock arms with their sisters and feel united. Instead they stayed home, feeling very alone.\n\nAs a pro-life Democrat, I don't support overturning Roe v. Wad e or criminalizing abortions. Generally I believe forcing morality onto a public via law doesn't work well. Laws can't change hearts. In fact, they usually calcify them.\n\nWithin the Democratic Party I support initiatives that slow down the rate of abortion, and maybe over time soften some hearts to be just a little more open to a pro-life stance. In the Democratic chorus of \"safe, legal and rare,\" I try to be the voice of rare. Many of my pro-choice friends have told me they feel the same way.\n\nSo, I support reform and growth in foster and adoption programs and substantial support for single mothers and those who choose to adopt. I support better sex education programs and access to contraception and any other preventative measures. Legalized abortion helps create economic equality and freedom for women, particularly the most disadvantaged women - it's important to me to find solutions for this that don't involve abortion, like free daycare and offering the best maternity and paternity support in the world.\n\nI'm hoping that one day Americans decide abortion has created enough social division, and we invest the resources to find a different way. I like to imagine a world where every conceived child can come to term. Where this issue is obsolete and we look back on this time as being trapped between bad decisions, so we used an expanded social safety net and advances in science to rise above it. Maybe it's impossible, but I'd at least like to try and find out.\n\nIn the meantime, if you are a Democrat, know that I stand with you, and if you are pro-life know that I hear you, and if you are a pro-life Democrat, please know, you are not, in fact, alone. Speak out, be heard, don't be afraid.\n\nPatrick Day grew up in Baltimore before moving to Seattle where he is currently part-owner of a small business.

The more strongly a person's brain reacted to seeing disgusting images, the more likely they were to hold conservative views.\n\nThe same discrepancy did not exist in their responses to positive images.\n\nThe authors point out in the paper, published in the journal Current Biology , that this is the first brain study to find multiple points of differentiation in activity when comparing the emotional processing of images in liberals versus conservatives. Several parts of the brain lit up in conservatives, while others were activated in liberals.\n\nP. Read Montague and his coauthors wrote in the study that their results \"invite the provocative claim that neural responses to nonpolitical stimuli (like contaminated food or physical threats) should be highly predictive of abstract political opinions (like attitudes toward gun control and abortion).\"\n\nIndeed, watching the brain's reaction to a single disgusting image was sufficient to guess each subject's political orientation. Montague said in the press release, \"I haven't seen such clean predictive results in any other functional imaging experiments in our lab or others.\"\n\nThe researchers used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) to track how the brains of 83 volunteers reacted to viewing emotionally charged but politically neutral images. The volunteers were then asked to rate how disgusting, threatening, or pleasant they thought each image was, and then answer a standard questionnaire about political ideology.\n\nThe study did not determine exactly how or why liberal brains differ from conservative ones, only that the two types of brains lit up in two different patterns when viewing the same images.\n\nBut the researchers theorize that conservatives, compared to liberals, have greater \"negativity bias,\" a psychological sensitivity to unpleasant or disturbing things. This supports the findings of an eye-tracking study published earlier this year in Behavioral and Brain Sciences , which found that conservatives reacted more intensely to disgusting images.\n\n\"Across research methods, samples and countries, conservatives have been found to be quicker to focus on the negative, to spend longer looking at the negative, and to be more distracted by the negative,\" the authors of that study wrote.\n\n\"The results do not provide a simple bromide, but ... if we can begin to see that some 'knee-jerk' reactions to political issues may be simply that -- reactions -- then we might take the temperature down a bit in the current boiler of political discourse,\" Montague said.\n\n© 2014 CBS Interactive Inc.

Fifteen percent of those respondents said they relied mostly on CNN for news; 13 percent chose NPR; 12 percent said MSNBC; and 10 percent picked the New York Times.\n\nConservatives, however, have a far more clear cut preference: nearly half of respondents, 47 percent, rely on Fox News as their main source of information about government and politics.\n\nThey also have very different views on whether news outlets are to be trusted, with liberals expressing far more trust in media overall. Pew asked respondents about whether they trust 36 different media outlets ranging from network news channels to major newspapers to shows like \"The Daily Show\" and \"The Colbert Report.\" The most liberal respondents said they trust more than they distrust 28 of the 36 outlets, while the most conservative respondents expressed more distrust of 24 of the 36.\n\nNearly all news outlets that were trusted by one end of the political spectrum were distrusted by the other end. There were two exceptions: all of the five political groupings polled by Pew (consistently liberal, mostly liberal, mixed, mostly conservative and consistently conservative) trust the Wall Street Journal more than they distrust it. All of the groups distrust the website Buzzfeed more than they trust it, though less than 40 percent of respondents had heard of the site.\n\nSocial media by its nature, makes it difficult to shut out all other political opinions. But consistent conservatives are twice as likely as the average Facebook user to see political opinions on the site, and 47 percent report that the posts they see are typically in line with their views.\n\nJust 32 percent of the most liberal respondents said the same thing, but they were far more likely to report having hidden, blocked, de-friended or stopped following someone because they disagreed with a political post. Just 31 percent of the consistently conservative respondents said they had done the same.\n\nSixty percent of liberals are more likely to \"like\" or follow groups that promote a specific issue. Just 46 percent of the most conservative respondents and 33 percent of those with mixed views are likely to follow these kinds of groups.\n\nOne behavior both sides of the political spectrum have in common is the habit of sharing political views with friends and family. Overall, just a quarter of people in the Pew survey said most of their close friends share their political views, but among liberals that number was about half (52 percent) and it rose to two thirds (66 percent) among conservatives. Conservatives are more likely to report having the same political views as most of their close friends, but liberals are more likely to say they stopped talking to or being friends with someone because of their political views.\n\nRebecca Kaplan covers Congress for CBS News.\n\n© 2014 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Who are happier, liberals or conservatives?\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nMarch 12, 2015 / 4:28 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nRepublicans may be running the show in Congress but it seems it's the Democrats who are happier.\n\nThat's the finding from a wide-ranging study published in Science Thursday examining the happiness of conservatives and liberals. As part of the study, the researchers examined 432 million words in the Congressional Record over the past 18 years as well the \"smiling behavior\" of politicians in their publicly available photographs from 2013.\n\nLiberal members of Congress used a higher ratio of positive words, such as \"interested,\" \"excited,\" \"enthusiastic\" and \"proud\" to negative words, such as \"afraid,\" \"upset,\" \"distressed\" and \"irritable.\" Those with more conservative beliefs , meanwhile, were less likely to be found beaming in their portraits.\n\n\"Conservatism predicted significantly less intense facial action in the muscles around the eyes that indicates genuine happiness,\" the study found, adding that liberal politicians \"smile more intensely and smile more genuinely.\"\n\nThe study expanded beyond politicians to look more broadly at the happiness of conservatives and liberals. Examining 47,257 Twitter status updates from conservatives and liberals as well as 457 photos from LinkedIn, they found a similar pattern.\n\n\"Together, our studies found that political liberals exhibited more frequent and intense happiness related behavior than political conservatives,\" the authors wrote. \"Although the effects in these studies were small, they consistently revealed greater happiness-related behavior among liberals, rather than conservatives.\"\n\nThe findings run contrary to earlier studies, mostly from surveys, in which conservatives reported they were happier than liberals. Scientists in those studies credited the upbeat nature of conservatives to their optimism, a sense they are in control of their lives and their \"transcendent moral values.\"\n\nIn the latest research, the authors said their findings reflected the limitations of self-reporting in the earlier work. But they also were careful to say that the expressions of happiness they found didn't mean one group of politicians or their supporters were any happier than another nor that this so-called happiness had anything to do with specific events, such as the tenure of President Obama.\n\n\"We are quite explicit that we are not arguing that liberals or Democrats are happier - or especially that becoming one will make you happier,\" the University of California, Irvine's Peter Ditto, a co-author on the study, told CBS News.\n\nRather, the authors suggest their findings \"illuminate the contradictory ways that happiness differences can manifest across behavior and self reports.\"\n\n\"In order to measure happiness correctly, we need to know what it is,\" Ditto said. \"But what is happiness?  Is it whether or not you say you are happy, or is it that happy is as happy does?  What do you do if someone says they are happy but it doesn't reveal itself in their behavior?  If someone says they are happy, are they really happy?  Or is it possible that someone can state quite genuinely that they are happy, but not really be happy?\"\n\nDavid Azerrad, the director of the Simon Center for Principles and Politics at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said it was absurd to even consider measuring happiness.\n\n\"Are we meant to believe that tweets and pictures on LinkedIn are meant to capture something as profound as happiness? I don't think so,\" Azerrad said. \"There are moments of happiness but that isn't the same thing as happiness. I don't think these things get quantified.\"\n\nAzerrad also took exception to the idea that you could judge whether someone was happy simply based on their political ideology, saying it is much more complicated and has to do with a range of other factors including income or their religion.\n\n\"Can you imagine how George Washington or Abraham Lincoln would have reacted to a study like this?\" he said.\n\nStill, other researchers said they did see value in the study.\n\nOscar Holmes IV, an assistant professor of management at Rutgers who has examined political orientation and wellbeing, said the study design \"was very clever and is among the first of my knowledge to look at systematically examining behavioral representations of happiness in relation to political orientation.\"\n\nHolmes said the latest study echoes his earlier work which found citizens in liberal countries tended to exhibit more happiness than those living in conservative nations.\n\n\"Taken together, our research and this study lends more support toward the idea that liberal political orientations and policies have a more positive impact on the wellbeing of citizens than conservative political orientation and policies,\" he said.\n\nMichael Casey covers the environment, science and technology for CBSNews.com\n\n© 2015 CBS Interactive Inc.

But you'd be wrong. According to a new study of nearly a million tweets from over 10,000 Twitter users, Republicans dominate the talk about their opponents.\n\nOn the flip side, Democrats give the most tweet-service to Dick Cheney.\n\nA study analyzing tweets sent in June 2014 from accounts of people who follow either the Republican or Democratic political figures on Twitter found that not only do people spend more time tweeting about pols they don't support than those they do, the frequency with which they use certain -- entirely nonpolitical --words is a strong indicator of their political leanings.\n\nThose words include some unsavory phrases, favored especially by liberals.\n\nAfter removing most commonly used English words, the study found that \"f--k\" and \"s--t\" rank among liberals' top ten most used words. The researchers, from Queen Mary University of London, believe this is reflective of a liberal tendency to use more emotionally expressive language.\n\nA study published in March scoured 18 years' worth of the Congressional Record and found that liberal members of Congress expressed \"more frequent and intense\" positive behavior .\n\nThe new research, published in the journal PLOS One, also uncovered that liberals use more self-referential language, employing the words \"I\" and \"me\" more often than conservatives, who opted more for group words such as \"we\" and \"us.\"\n\nRepublicans were also more likely to discuss religion, including the words \"god\" and \"psalm\" in a large number of tweets.\n\n\"The results closely matched our predictions based on existing understanding of political supporters' psychology,\" Matthew Purver, a coauthor of the study, said in a statement.\n\nThe researchers think that the clear distinctions between the way liberals and conservatives talk online could give pollsters and politicos a greater understanding of what their constituencies are really thinking.\n\nAmanda Schupak is the science and technology editor at CBSNews.com\n\n© 2015 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Liberals Vs. Conservatives\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJune 15, 2007 / 11:00 PM EDT / Political Animal\n\nLIBERALS vs. CONSERVATIVES.... Ezra and Matt (and Ezra again ) are pinging back and forth on the question of why, in general, modern political parties that represent economic liberalism also tend to represent social liberalism, and vice versa.  At first glance it's odd.  After all, the two things seem to be pretty unrelated, and there's no special reason why you can't be, for example, economically conservative and socially liberal.  But that's libertarianism, and there's no place in the world where libertarians are more than a tiny minority.  The opposite ideology, economic liberalism plus social conservatism, is a little more common (think rural populism), but generally doesn't command widespread support either.  In most places, the major parties are either all conservative or all liberal.\n\nWhy?  Fact-free speculation is what blogging excels at, so here's my take.  Most of the major parties in today's western democracies were fully formed by the middle of the 20th century, during a time before the current culture wars were a twinkling in anyone's eyes.  So regardless of how and why they were originally founded (the Republican Party, for example, was originally associated with the anti-slavery movement), by the 1950s they were primarily associated with purely economic positions.  They either represented the working class or else they represented big business and the rich.\n\nSo the question is: when the 50s and 60s dawned, why is it that it was mostly the economically liberal parties that supported the emerging social revolution?  This strikes me as a pretty easy question to answer: it's because the founding principle of most liberal parties was economic egalitarianism.  When the postwar era rolled around and the current crop of social issues became important, it was only natural that economic egalitarianism morphed into social egalitarianism, and that in turn led to support for civil rights, feminism, and gay rights.  Support for things like affirmative action, criminal justice reforms, and abortion rights were obvious corollaries.\n\nThis doesn't explain everything.  Nothing explains everything, after all.  Environmentalism, for example, is something that I suspect everyone naturally supports unless they have some reason not to, and the main reason not to is that it interferes with business interests.  So opposition to environmentalism comes mostly from conservative, pro-business parties, while everyone else supports it.  It has nothing much to do with egalitarianism.\n\nDitto for some other social issues, like gun control and school prayer, which are slightly mysterious.  They might be associated with the urban bias of liberal parties, or they might just be an artifact of tribalism.  After all, once you've drunk enough of the Kool-Aid on either side, you tend to drink the rest.\n\nBut a commitment to egalitarianism probably explains most of it.  If you're committed to breaking the stranglehold of the ruling classes, that just naturally leads you down certain roads.  Likewise, if you think the current hierarchy works pretty well, that leads you down other roads.  Economic justice and social justice are two sides of the same coin.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT: Is egalitarianism the underlying principle that guides everyone's political beliefs?  Of course not.  Libertarians, for example, just want government to leave them alone, which leads them naturally to support social liberalism and economic conservatism.  The problem is that human beings are social creatures, so \"leave me alone\" has never attracted a huge following as a guiding principle.\n\nAs for the rural populist types (socially conservative/economically liberal), I'm not really sure wat motivates them.  Whatever it is, though, it seems to have a relatively limited base these days.\n\nPolitical Animal\n\nCopyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved."

Republican officials in Texas, however, said the opposite is true, warning that the regulation will trigger an \"influx of migrants\" with unvetted asylum claims.\n\nBoth groups were describing the same Biden administration policy in separate lawsuits, but their reasons for challenging it were completely different.\n\nEnacted earlier this month, the Biden administration rule disqualifies migrants from asylum if they did not first seek refuge in a third country before reaching the U.S. southern border. Those who cross the border unlawfully and fail to prove they deserve an exemption to the rule face swift deportation and a five-year banishment from the U.S.\n\nThe rule is the centerpiece of the administration's broader effort to reduce illegal border crossings, which recently reached record levels. It penalizes those who enter the country without permission, while expanding opportunities for migrants to come to the U.S. legally.\n\nIn their lawsuit earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other advocacy groups said Mr. Biden's rule, just like two Trump administration asylum restrictions blocked in federal court, violates laws Congress passed in 1980 to protect refugees fleeing persecution.\n\nIn a separate lawsuit filed this week, Texas' Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton also argued the regulation was unlawful, but he focused his criticism on a provision that instructs migrants to wait in Mexico until they secure an appointment via a phone app to enter the U.S. at an official border crossing. Those who enter the U.S. with one of roughly 1,000 appointments distributed each day are not disqualified from asylum.\n\nThe strange bedfellows' lawsuits, both of which seek to block the asylum restriction in its entirety, could imperil Mr. Biden's strategy to manage migration to the U.S. southern border, where migrants have been coming in greater numbers and from more countries than ever before amid mass displacement in Latin American and the Caribbean. Federal judges in Oakland and Del Rio, Texas, could rule on these cases later this year, setting off a high-stakes legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court.\n\nBut beyond their legal and practical implications, the lawsuits illustrate the thorny political spot the Biden administration finds itself in on border policy.\n\nProgressive advocates say Mr. Biden has been too tough on migrants and too reliant on deterrence policies embraced by former President Donald Trump. Republicans, meanwhile, continue to argue the current migration crisis is one of Mr. Biden's own making, accusing his administration of lax border enforcement.\n\nThe lawsuits also highlight the perils of federal immigration policy-making amid decades of congressional inaction on the issue. Like his predecessors, Mr. Biden has exercised his executive authority broadly to enact major immigration policies, at the southern border and in the interior. And like his predecessors' unilateral changes, Mr. Biden's policy agenda has been challenged, and at times derailed, by lawsuits.\n\n\"Before you get to the point of another administration coming in, a court will wipe out a rule or policy with an injunction and it has to be changed immediately,\" said Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former U.S. immigration official under former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \"It's a whip-sawing effect on policy.\"\n\nA Texas lawsuit, for example, prevented the Obama administration from giving work permits and deportation protections to unauthorized immigrants whose children were American citizens or permanent U.S. residents. The Trump administration's numerous asylum restrictions, migrant family separation policy and efforts to slash legal immigration faced dozens of often successful legal challenges from Democratic-led states and advocacy groups like the ACLU.\n\nThat trend has continued, if not intensified, under Mr. Biden. During his first two years in office, Texas and other Republican-led states convinced judges to block a 100-day moratorium on most deportations, rules limiting arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the termination of a Trump-era policy known as \"Remain in Mexico\" that forced asylum-seekers to wait for their court dates outside the U.S.\n\nRepublican state officials prolonged the termination of the Title 42 public health order - which allowed border agents to expel migrants without asylum screenings - for a year. The pandemic rule only ended this month because the expiration of the COVID-19 national emergency nullified the legal challenges.\n\nMore recently, a federal judge granted Florida's request to halt a Biden administration migrant release policy that was intended to mitigate overcrowding inside Border Patrol facilities. Another federal judge in Texas is also expected to rule soon on a request by Republican-led states to force the Biden administration to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for 600,000 immigrant \"Dreamers.\"\n\nOther cases remain unresolved, including Texas' bid to shut down a popular program that allows up to 30,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans with U.S.-based financial sponsors to come to the country lawfully each month.\n\nCardinal Brown, now a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said Congress' failure or reluctance to change immigration law in any significant way since the 1990s has led states and groups that disagree with the administration in power to stage policy fights in the federal court system.\n\n\"The main reason we're seeing these particular lawsuits by the states is a political and policy difference of opinion,\" Cardinal Brown said. \"The judiciary is not supposed to be a policy-making body, and we're asking it to essentially make policy.\"\n\nIn a recent briefing, Blas Nuñez Neto, the highest-ranking immigration and border policy official at the Department of Homeland Security, said the lawsuits \"clearly demonstrate just how fundamentally broken our immigration system is.\"\n\nThe administration, Nuñez Neto argued, is employing \"innovative\" executive actions to deter illegal border entries, which dropped sharply after Title 42 lapsed on May 11. Asked by CBS News if the administration had a Plan B or C to manage border crossings if the lawsuits prevail, Nuñez Neto pivoted to Congress.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we are just clear-eyed that there is no lasting solution here that does not involve the U.S. Congress,\" he said.\n\nCamilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

      "text": "Conservatives go to red states and liberals go to blue as the country grows more polarized\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJuly 5, 2023 / 12:57 PM MDT / AP\n\nOnce he and his wife, Jennifer, moved to a Boise suburb last year, Tim Kohl could finally express himself.\n\nKohl did what the couple never dared at their previous house outside Los Angeles - the newly-retired Los Angeles police officer flew a U.S. flag and a Thin Blue Line banner representing law enforcement outside his house.\n\n\"We were scared to put it up,\" Jennifer Kohl acknowledged. But the Kohls knew they had moved to the right place when neighbors complimented him on the display.\n\nLeah Dean is on the opposite end of the political spectrum, but she knows how the Kohls feel. In Texas, Dean had been scared to fly an abortion rights banner outside her house. Around the time the Kohls were house-hunting in Idaho, she and her partner found a place in Denver, where their LGBTQ+ pride flag flies above the banner in front of their house that proclaims \"Abortion access is a community responsibility.\"\n\n\"One thing we have really found is a place to feel comfortable being ourselves,\" Dean said.\n\nAmericans are segregating by their politics at a rapid clip, helping fuel the greatest divide between the states in modern history.\n\nOne party controls the entire legislature in all but two states. In 28 states, the party in control has a supermajority in at least one legislative chamber - which means the majority party has so many lawmakers that they can override a governor's veto. Not that that would be necessary in most cases, as only 10 states have governors of different parties than the one that controls the legislature.\n\nThe split has sent states careening to the political left or right, adopting diametrically opposed laws on some of the hottest issues of the day. In Idaho, abortion is illegal once a heartbeat can be detected in a fetus - as early as five or six weeks - and a new law passed this year makes it a crime to help a minor travel out of state to obtain one. In Colorado, state law prevents any restrictions on abortion . In Idaho, a new law prevents minors from accessing gender-affirming care , while Colorado allows youths to come from other states to access the procedures.\n\nFederalism - allowing each state to chart its own course within boundaries set by Congress and the Constitution - is at the core of the U.S. system. It lets the states, in the words of former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, be \"laboratories of democracy.\"\n\nNow, some wonder whether that's driving Americans apart.\n\n\"Does that work as well in a time when we are so politically divided, or does it just become an accelerant for people who want to re-segregate?\" asked Rob Witwer, a former Republican Colorado state lawmaker.\n\nColorado and Idaho represent two poles of state-level political homogenization. Both are fast-growing Rocky Mountain states that have been transformed by an influx of like-minded residents. Life in the two states can be quite similar - conversations revolve around local ski areas, mountain bike trails, and how newcomers are making things too crowded. But, politically, they increasingly occupy two separate worlds.\n\nWitwer watched Colorado steadily swing to the left as affluent, college-educated people fled the coasts for his home state starting in the late 1990s. For two decades, it was one of the nation's fastest-growing states, and during the Trump era it swung sharply to the left. Democrats control all statewide offices and have their largest majorities in history in the legislature, including a supermajority in the lower house.\n\nIn contrast, Idaho has become one of the nation's fastest-growing states during the past decade without losing its reputation as a conservative haven. It has moved even more sharply to the right during that time and become a beacon to those, like the Kohls, fleeing blue states where they no longer feel welcome.\n\nThe states' swings aren't simply due to transplants, of course. The increasing clustering of Americans into like-minded enclaves - dubbed \"The Big Sort\" - has many causes. Harvard professor Ryan Enos estimates that, at least before the pandemic, only 15% of the homogeneity was due to people moving. Other causes include political parties polarizing on hot-button issues that split neatly on demographic lines, such as guns and abortion, and voters adopting their neighbors' partisanship.\n\n\"A lot of this is driven by other sorting that is going on,\" Enos said.\n\nWhen Americans move, politics is not typically the explicit reason. But the lifestyle choices they make place them in communities dominated by their preferred party.\n\n\"Democrats want to live in places with artistic culture and craft breweries, and Republicans want to move to places where they can have a big yard,\" said Ryan Strickler, a political scientist at Colorado State University-Pueblo.\n\nBut something may have changed as the country has become even more polarized. Businesses catering to conservatives fleeing blue states have sprouted, such as Blue Line Moving, which markets to families fleeing from blue states to Florida. In Texas, a \"rainbow underground railroad\" run by a Dallas realtor helps LGBTQ+ families flee the state's increased restrictions targeting that population.\n\nThe switch might have been flipped during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, which created a class of mobile workers no longer bound to the states where their companies were based. Those who are now mobile are predominantly white-collar workers and retirees, the two most politically engaged parts of the national population.\n\nMike McCarter, who has spearheaded a quixotic campaign to have conservative eastern Oregon become part of Idaho, said most people didn't pay much attention to state government until the pandemic.\n\n\"Then it was like 'Oh, they can shut down any church and they can shut down my kids' school?'\" McCarter said. \"If state-level government has that much power, you'd better be sure it reflects your values, and not someone else's values that are forced on you.\"\n\nThe pandemic helped push Aaron and Carrie Friesen to Idaho. When the pandemic hit, they realized they could take their marketing firm remote from its base near Hilton Head, South Carolina. They'd always planned to return to the West, but California, where Aaron, now 39, was born and raised, was disqualified because of its cost and progressive politics.\n\nThe Friesens and their three children settled on Boise. They loved the big skies, the mountains rearing up behind the town, the plethora of outdoor activities.\n\nAnd they liked Idaho's pandemic policies. When the Friesens visited, almost no one was wearing masks, which they took as a good sign - they were happy to mask up when sick, but found constant masking pointless.\n\n\"This was a place that had like-minded people,\" Carrie Friesen said.\n\nThe Friesens are happy with the direction of their new state and the abortion and transgender restrictions out of the latest legislative session. But they don't see themselves as part of what they called \"the crazy right,\" referring to the families displaying Trump yard signs in the less-politically-mixed Boise suburbs. They like living close to the center of Boise, one of the more liberal areas in the state.\n\nThey try not to make too many decisions based on politics - to a point.\n\n\"With the temperature of politics nowadays, if people choose to move somewhere, they are going to choose to move to a place with like-minded people,\" Aaron Friesen said.\n\nThat's apparently been happening in Idaho, said Mathew Hay, who oversees a regular survey of new arrivals for Boise State University. Historically, transplants mirrored the conservative population's leanings, with about 45% describing themselves as \"conservative,\" and the rest evenly split between liberal and moderate.\n\nBut something changed last year - the share of newcomers that said they lived in Idaho for the politics jumped to 9%, compared to 5% for long-timers. The percentage describing themselves as \"very conservative\" also rose.\n\nWhen Melissa Wintrow rode her motorcycle across the U.S. in 1996, she was captivated by Idaho.\n\n\"It was this grounded, commonsense, reasonable group,\" Wintrow said. \"Of course they were conservative, but they weren't going to say openly racist and homophobic things.\"\n\nNow a Democratic state senator, Wintrow is aghast at how her adopted state has become more hardline.\n\n\"The state has just moved to a more extreme view,\" she said. \"It's a certain group of people that is afraid their 'way of life' is diminishing in the world.\"\n\nIn Colorado, the reverse may be happening.\n\nBret Weinstein, owner of a realty firm in Denver, said politics has become the top issue for people buying a home.\n\n\"It's brought up in our initial conversations,\" Weinstein said. \"Three years ago, we didn't have those conversations, ever.\"\n\nNow, many entering the state tell him they're looking for a way to escape their red state - and homeowners leaving Colorado say they're fed up with it turning blue. Even within Colorado, Weinstein said, homebuyers are picking based on politics, with some avoiding conservative areas where debates on mask mandates and curriculum has dominated school board meetings.\n\nOne of those politically motivated migrants is Kathleen Rickerson, who works in human resources for Weinstein's firm. Rickerson, 35, lived in Minnesota for seven years, but during the pandemic grew weary of the blue state's vocal anti-masking, anti-vaccine minority.\n\nRickerson's parents and sister urged her to join them in Texas, but that was out of the question. Ready for a change, Rickerson instead zeroed in on Colorado. She moved to a Denver suburb in December 2021.\n\nCheered by the state's strong stance to protect abortion rights, Rickerson wants Colorado Democrats to go further.\n\n\"Colorado isn't as quick to take a stand on things, and I'd like to see that happen a bit more,\" she said.\n\nThat was a sentiment shared by Colorado progressives, who were frustrated their party didn't muscle through an assault weapons ban and other priorities of the left during the most recent legislative session.\n\n\"There is a point at which we need to stop acting like trying to get along with our enemies is going to preserve our institution,\" progressive state Rep. Stephanie Vigil said at the end of the session, after the chamber's Democratic leader said it was important that Republicans still feel like they have a voice.\n\nThe increasing political homogeneity in states makes it harder for both parties to feel invested, said Thad Kousser, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego.\n\n\"It gives one party the ability to move a state further when they're doing exactly what their constituency wants,\" he said.\n\nThe system works as a sort of escape valve, Kousser said, letting the majority in the state feel in power regardless of what's happening in Washington, D.C. But the local minority party gets shortchanged.\n\nThe Kohls felt shortchanged in California. They said they watched their native state deteriorate before their eyes, and no one was willing to fix the problems. Trash piled up with homeless encampments. Tax money seemed to go to immigrants who had entered the country illegally rather than U.S. citizens. Jennifer's mother qualified for government assistance due to her low income, but was on dozens of wait lists that were seven years long. Tim's police station, in a former hippie colony in the mountains running through West Los Angeles, was firebombed during the George Floyd protests in 2020.\n\nThe Kohls wanted to live in a red state, but Jennifer said they're not just party-line voters. A nurse, she hasn't registered with either party and has a wide range of beliefs, including that abortion is sometimes necessary.\n\n\"I believe so many different things,\" she said.\n\nOn balance, they feel more comfortable in a more conservative place.\n\n\"Here, the tax dollars naturally goes to the citizens, not the immigrants,\" said Tim Kohl, who can understand why Idaho is growing so fast. \"Most of the people we've met here are from California originally.\"\n\nIn Denver, Dean has found other people who fled red states. She and her partner, Cassidy Dean, discovered that their neighbors fled Florida after the state's hard turn to the political right.\n\nLeah Dean was a 19-year-old cosmetology college student in San Antonio in 2008 when she had an abortion. She chafed at the obstacles she faced - the state-mandated waiting period before the procedure, having to get a sonogram before the procedure - and became a committed Democratic activist. She met her partner at the Texas state party convention in 2016, and every year since then she's felt the Republican state legislature and governor make the state less and less hospitable to people like her.\n\nNow in Colorado, she and her partner both work from home, telecommuting to their old Texas jobs. They have limited social outlets, but took care of that by throwing themselves into politics again, with Leah Dean becoming vice chair of Denver Democrats.\n\n\"It's also how we meet people,\" she said. \"We don't have any other way to do that.\"\n\n___\n\nBy NICHOLAS RICCARDI Associated Press\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Ro Khanna , a leading progressive lawmaker representing the heart of Silicon Valley, said liberals shouldn't flee Elon Musk's X , instead urging his fellow Democrats to engage with those who share opposing beliefs.\n\nKhanna made the comments on an episode of Politico's Power Play podcast this week amid an exodus of liberal users from X to Bluesky.\n\nThe social networking platform, which has billed itself as a progressive alternative to Musk's site, surpassed 21 million users this month, up from 13 million in October.\n\n\"I don't think the answer is for progressives to disengage ,\" Khanna told Politico. \"The idea is that in a marketplace of ideas, over the long term, the truth emerges.\"\n\nThe California lawmaker described himself as a \"free speech person\" who uses X \"all the time\" and suggested Democrats remaining on the platform is akin to liberal lawmakers appearing on conservative news outlets like Fox News to share their message with as wide an audience as possible.\n\nKhanna, who has a longstanding relationship with Musk, cited his own interactions with the billionaire on X as evidence of the kind of common ground people can find online.\n\nOn Monday, Khanna posted a clip of himself on CNN talking about the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE , which President-elect Donald Trump has tasked Musk and fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy with leading.\n\n\"When it comes to cutting waste, fraud, and abuse and opening the 5 primes to more competition, there are Democrats on HASC who will work with @elonmusk and @DOGE,\" Khanna wrote on X.\n\nMusk subsequently retweeted the post, saying, \"Cool!\"\n\nCool! https://t.co/5WiVyOHAw6\n\nKhanna reiterated his willingness to work with Musk, who has become an advisor to Trump in recent months, on Politico's podcast this week .

      "text": "Scientists have discovered two simple psychological differences that make you liberal or conservative\n\nPolitical battles in the US are often portrayed as a clash between \"bleeding heart\" liberals and \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\" conservatives.\n\nVoters who favor opposing parties see various issues differently, but does that mean liberals and conservatives actually process the world through different emotional lenses?\n\nScientists are beginning to zero in on a few key differences in the ways that people on opposite ends of the political spectrum react to stimuli. A handful of new studies, some still under review, explore some of the subtly different ways that socially conservative and liberal voters respond to images and think about their friends and family.\n\nA study published in the journal Behavioural Brain Research in January suggests that you might be able to tell whether someone is liberal or conservative simply by the way they react to pictures of gross things like blood, feces or vomit.\n\nThe authors found that socially conservative students will physically look away from \"disgusting\" images more quickly than their liberal peers (but the same didn't hold true for people with fiscally conservative beliefs). The self-reported social conservatives also stared longer at images of faces reacting in disgust to that same potentially pathogenic stuff.\n\nThe trend didn't hold up for sad or scary scenes, though - there were no notable differences in how people reacted to those based on their political ideology.\n\nFor years, social scientists have known that conservatives tend to be more easily grossed out. President Trump, a well-known germaphobe who once advocated for banning the handshake, is perhaps a prime example. There's also evidence that the areas of the brain that process and express fear are more active in conservative voters, which might make them more likely to quickly turn away from something that could make them sick.\n\nResearch has also shown that self-identified conservative thinkers may be more hostile to what social scientists call \"outgroups\": people (or animals) that don't come from the places they do or think like them. That trait may be tied to the tendency to get disgusted more easily - if you're more likely to turn away from a foreign pathogen, you're probably also more likely to be averse to unfamiliar groups.\n\n\" Conservatives, in their tendencies toward closure, order, and stability should expend empathy toward smaller, more well-defined, and less permeable social circles,\" Psychologists Adam Waytz, Jesse Graham, and their colleagues wrote in the 2016 book \"Social Psychology of Political Polarization.\"\n\n\"Liberals, in their tendencies toward openness, tolerance for ambiguity, and desire for change, should seek larger, less well-defined, and more permeable social circles,\" they said.\n\nNew research on compassion is de-bunking the myth that liberal voters might inherently be more empathetic and kind-hearted people than conservatives. In fact, previous studies have shown that conservatives and liberals are equally generous with their money and their time, they just dole it out in different ways.\n\nSome of Waytz's forthcoming research provides even more evidence that conservatives can be just as compassionate as liberals. His findings suggest that conservatives are simply more likely to extend that empathy only to their kin.\n\nIn an unpublished study , participants first indicated whether they considered themselves \"very conservative\" or \"very liberal\"on a scale from 1 to 7. Then they were asked to report how empathetic they felt towards different groups. Conservatives tended to agree with statements like \"I often have tender, concerned feelings for my family members who are less fortunate than me.\"\n\nThe liberal study subjects more frequently reported feeling that same tenderness toward less fortunate people in general, beyond those in their own families.\n\nConservatives were also more likely to tell the researchers that they had more empathy for family members over friends, endorsed their fellow countrymen over foreigners, and took the side of humans over non-human subjects.\n\nThis research suggests anyone's heart can \"bleed\"; conservatives just might be a little more selective about who they'll bleed for. And they might not want to look at that blood.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "We read 'The Hunt' script and it isn't about liberal elites hunting 'deplorables,' but there are lines that could anger Trump and his supporters\n\nIn the wake of the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas; Dayton, Ohio; and Gilroy, California in early August, Universal announced it was pulling its September 27 release of Blumhouse Production's \"The Hunt,\" with no indication when (or if) it would ever be released.\n\nBecause of the gun violence and red-state-versus-blue-state vibe of the trailer, which shows 12 strangers suddenly waking up in a remote location and being hunted by a group of rich elites, the movie had become a flash point of controversy.\n\nA day before Universal announced it had taken the movie off its slate, President Trump called Hollywood \"really terrible\" and \"racist,\" and tweeted, \"the movie coming out is made in order ... to inflame and cause chaos.\" Many in Hollywood and the media took Trump's tweet to refer to \"The Hunt.\"\n\nBut most people debating \"The Hunt\" online and in the media hadn't seen in. In fact, other than those involved with the movie, directed by Craig Zobel (\"Compliance,\" episodes of HBO's \"The Leftovers\"), and test screening audiences, no one had.\n\nSo is the movie (budgeted at $15 million ) an ultra-violent modern take on \" The Most Dangerous Game \" with liberal elites picking off \" deplorables \" for fun, as it has sometimes been portrayed in the media?\n\nBusiness Insider was given a draft of the script written by Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof (creator of HBO series \"The Leftovers\" and \"Watchmen\"). Here's what we know.\n\n(No major spoilers, we promise.)\n\nNote : Details below could change as the movie is currently being edited.\n\nViolent ? I know, shocker! It's a Blumhouse movie about humans being hunted. But the violence in the movie needs to be addressed.\n\nThere are multiple scenes where the violence is extreme. In one instance, a man is killed by a stiletto heel being jabbed into his eyeball (you may have caught that in the trailer). Then in another sequence, a woman being chased by the elites falls into a trench with wooden spikes, is rescued and pulled off the spikes, only to later fall back in the trench and land on the spikes ... again. And in yet another scene, the movie's hero, Crystal (\"Glow\" star Betty Gilpin), gives a disturbing telling of \"The Tortoise and the Hare\" while trying to get a large hunting knife out of a dead man's face.\n\nIn many instances in the script, the violence feels very over-the-top, almost darkly comedic. But at this time, many are likely not looking to go see this kind of movie.\n\nThis is the big one (and I promise not to spoil the movie). The Universal marketing is its own worst enemy in this instance. Though the trailers and other ads make it look like \"The Hunt\" is focused on some kind of secret \"sport\" for the ultra-rich (reminiscent to those who paid to torture people in \" Hostel \"), that is not exactly what the movie is about.\n\nThis sleight of hand is needed for the movie to work. You need to go in thinking it's liberals versus conservatives. But as the movie goes on, you realize that there is nothing political about the motivations of the elites in the movie.\n\nThe shocking twist makes you think about the movie completely differently.\n\nOutside of the violence in the movie, some of Universal's motivation to pull the release likely was that it could have gotten hit hard on social media by Trump or his supporters. Why? Because there are certain lines that could spark anger from him and his base.\n\nIn the script, a group text thread among the elites includes one writing, \"Did anyone see what our ratf---er in chief just did?\" One answers, \"At least the hunt's coming up. Nothing better than going out to The Manor and slaughtering a dozen deplorables.\" In another version of the script, that line ends \"slaughtering a dozen inbred rednecks.\"\n\nAnd in another scene in the script, before an elite kills someone, the person says to their victim, \"For the record ... climate change is real.\"\n\nIn the US' charged political climate, it's safe to say lines like these would have caused a stir.\n\nJump to"

From there, they calculated which shows significantly over or under-performed with those samples.\n\nCarlson said there wasn't much of an overlap when it came to liberal and conservative television preferences. There were only three shows that liberals and conservatives both seemed to enjoy equally: \"Dancing with the Stars,\" \"Star Trek: Discovery,\" and \"The Orville.\"\n\nCarlson pointed out that these shows \"don't necessarily have a political flavor,\" and suggested that probably had a lot to do with why liberals and conservatives both enjoyed them.\n\n\"Dancing and space - these are the things that unite our country,\" Carlson said.\n\nHere are the top five shows most popular with both conservative and liberal audiences:\n\nThe military sets out on risky missions behind enemy lines.\n\n\"Will & Grace\" recently returned to television, bringing major criticisms of the Trump administration with it.\n\nLeah Remini and Kevin James star in this sitcom about the difficulties of retirement.\n\nRachel Bloom stars in the musical comedy series about a woman obsessed with her ex-boyfriend.\n\nTom Selleck stars in \"Blue Bloods\" as NY police commissioner Frank Reagan.\n\nCo-creators Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer star in this comedic series about life in NYC.\n\nDamon Wayans and Clayne Crawford star in this series reboot of the popular 1987 film \"Lethal Weapon.\"\n\nAnthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross play an upper class couple trying to stay connected to their black heritage while living in a predominately white neighborhood.\n\nThe NCIS team investigates a wide range of crimes, from homicides to terrorism in this hour-long procedural.\n\n\"The Good Place\" stars Kristen Bell and Ted Danson in a unique comedy about the afterlife.\n\nCelebrities pair up with professional dancers in this competition reality show.\n\n\"Family Guy\" creator Seth MacFarlane stars in the space comedy, \"The Orville.\"\n\nThe Discover fleet travels the universe and discovers new worlds in this newest addition to the \"Star Trek\" universe.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "How liberals and conservatives do Thanksgiving dinner differently\n\nAmerica comes together every year for a dinner, but what's served at that dinner varies considerably due to a number of factors like region, ethnic backgrounds, and traditions. But what about politics?\n\nWe conducted a nationwide survey using SurveyMonkey Audience. We got 1,217 individual respondents on November 16 and 17, 2018, and asked them to select all the dishes they expected would appear on their Thanksgiving table each year. All told, 1,211 respondents identified 11,153 expected plates of birds and sides at the table this Thanksgiving.\n\nOn the same poll, we asked about respondents' political beliefs. They responded on a seven-point scale - very conservative, moderately conservative, slightly conservative, neither conservative nor liberal, slightly liberal, moderately liberal, very liberal, or \"rather not say.\" Political alignments were shared by 1,043 respondents.\n\nThanksgiving is a holiday where people with strongly differing political views often come together and share a meal . But we did actually find some rather interesting trends in the data, dishes that really did seem to stand out among different political sets. This might be related to political geography hardening a bit, linking political outlook more directly to rural and urban divides or regional distinctions.\n\nIn the end, these are correlations and do not indicate causation. It's not like support for a robust welfare state makes Brussels sprouts any easier to swallow, and it's not like one bite of green bean casserole will make you want a tax cut. But as geography becomes political destiny, it makes sense that gastronomy follows.\n\nThe most shocking finding? The conservative-liberal divide has infected our cranberry-sauce preferences.\n\nSurveyMonkey Audience polls from a national sample balanced by census data of age and gender. Respondents are incentivized to complete surveys through charitable contributions. Generally speaking, digital polling tends to skew toward people with access to the internet. SurveyMonkey Audience doesn't try to weight its sample based on race or income. Total 1,217 respondents, margin of error plus or minus 3 percentage points with 95% confidence level.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "I saw 'The Hunt,' which had its release pulled over the summer. It's deranged and extremely violent but is not about liberals hunting 'deplorables.'\n\n\"The Hunt\" will see the light of day.\n\nThat's what I was told late last week when Universal called and invited me to see the movie before they announced on Tuesday that it will be released in theaters on March 13 (that's right, Friday the 13th).\n\nThough I had been told by sources over the span of months that sooner or later the movie would get a theatrical release, it was still shocking to sit in a nearly empty screening room and watch a movie that got so many people revved up, even President Trump. Though none of them had seen the movie yet.\n\nOriginally, the Blumhouse Productions thriller/satire about 12 strangers who wake up in a field and begin to be hunted by private-jet flying elites was to be released last year on September 27. But in the wake of the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas; Dayton, Ohio; and Gilroy, California, in early August, Universal pulled the release.\n\nHowever, before Universal made that decision, the movie became a punching bag for commentators on Fox News and other conservative outlets. Universal staff even received death threats . And Trump seemed to reference the unreleased movie when he called Hollywood \"really terrible\" and \"racist,\" then later that day, tweeted, \"the movie coming out is made in order ... to inflame and cause chaos.\"\n\nNow Universal is taking that uproar and using it for the movie's marketing. The poster released Tuesday includes the text, \"The most talked about movie of the year is one that no one's actually seen. Decide for yourself.\"\n\n\"The Hunt\" is so violent and so unapologetically twisted you can't help but laugh over how absurd the whole movie is. (Honestly, it's torture porn-level gore, so be prepared.)\n\nIt's hard to explain the movie without giving away spoilers (so I'll be light), but the story is pretty exact to the script I was given last year.\n\nAfter a powerful business executive (played by Hilary Swank) and her colleagues joke in a text thread about kidnapping \"deplorables\" and dumping them on the grounds of a remote manor out in the country for \"the hunt,\" it actually becomes a reality after the thread finds its way online and becomes an internet conspiracy called \"Manorgate.\"\n\nThe hunted run for their lives as the hunters kill them for sport. But we learn this is not liberals versus conservatives. It's more demented.\n\nThe reality is the movie uses the sensational nature of the thriller/horror genre to comment on society today. From woke culture to internet trolls to cancel culture (which wasn't even a thing yet when this movie was made), all these are given satirical jabs. Not even the classic \"Tortoise and the Hare\" story is safe in this movie.\n\nAt its core, \"The Hunt\" is a sensationalized look at what happens when things are completely blown out of proportion. And the politics angle is a complete ruse within it.\n\nBut a movie cannot (or shouldn't) be fueled by that alone. There needs to be someone in the story that the audience can get behind and root for through all of this blood-soaked madness, and that's where Betty Gilpin comes in.\n\nThe star of Netflix's \"Glow\" is absolutely perfect as Crystal, the only captured person who seems to have some kind of clue on how to survive. Gilpin gives Crystal the right mix of over-the-top outrage and deep-seated personal issues to concoct an intriguing character to watch for 90 minutes. She in no way is the traditional horror \"final girl.\"\n\nThe bottom line is \"The Hunt\" isn't about blue states or red states. Director Craig Zobel and screenwriters Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse (who have all spent their careers finding joy in messing with audiences through their work, and have recently done so in their collaborations on \"The Leftovers\" and \"Watchmen\") is using the audiences' own triggers to show the absurdity of the actions that often follow.\n\nThe result is a gory good time that asks us to poke fun at ourselves and give everyone else a break for once.\n\nWatch the new trailer below:\n\nFollow INSIDER on Facebook .\n\nJump to"

J. Scott Applewhite/AP hide caption\n\nThe justices of the U.S. Supreme Court gather for a group portrait.\n\nThe recently concluded Supreme Court term was remarkable for many reasons. But for SCOTUS geeks who love numbers, it's worth looking at how the conservatives often split among themselves, while the liberal justices, understanding that they are playing defense, stuck together far more often, refusing to dilute the outcome of their victories by disagreeing with one another.\n\nIn all, the four hard-line conservatives wrote way more separate opinions.\n\nThey wrote nearly two-thirds of the concurring opinions. These are the opinions in which individual justices do not agree with some or all of the reasoning in the majority opinion.\n\nThe conservative justices were also more likely to speak for themselves alone. Of the 45 solo opinions, the four most conservative justices wrote 31.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn addition, they wrote more pages than the liberal justices, writing 734 pages of concurring and dissenting opinions, out of 1,214 such pages total.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe most restrained conservative author was Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote just one concurring opinion and one dissent. But he was the deciding vote in a lot of cases and often wrote the majority opinion in the most important decisions.\n\nThe other four conservatives put pen to paper for themselves in especially ideologically charged cases, whereas the liberal justices stayed their hands in most of these.\n\nOn the liberal side of the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the most concurring opinions - eight of them solo and one joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. But in six of those cases, the decisions were either unanimous or 8-1.\n\nWhile members of each bloc of justices banded together in most cases, the liberal justices more often stuck together overall. Of the 60 votes cast this term, the liberals voted as a unified group 80% of the time.

Brown, like many progressive voters, thinks 2020 presidential candidates should \"not equivocate\" in calling Trump a white supremacist. Asma Khalid/NPR hide caption\n\nJeromy Brown, 46, poses for a photo with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Brown, like many progressive voters, thinks 2020 presidential candidates should \"not equivocate\" in calling Trump a white supremacist.\n\nJeromy Brown, a 46-year-old teacher in Iowa, considers President Trump a white supremacist.\n\n\"If the shoe fits, then say it, and the shoe fits him,\" Brown said, while waiting in a photo line at an Elizabeth Warren rally in August. \"Why should he be excused from that label?\"\n\nBrown, like many white liberal voters, appreciates that some Democratic presidential candidates have begun explicitly referring to Trump as a white supremacist. His top choice, Warren, told The NPR Politics Podcast in August that \"when the white supremacists call Donald Trump one of their own, I tend to believe them.\"\n\nBut she's not alone in using such strong and direct language. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has repeatedly referred to Trump as a \"racist\" on the campaign trail. And former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke insists that tackling white supremacy should be the No. 1 law enforcement priority in the country.\n\nUndoubtedly, race and racism have become more salient political issues because of how the president talks about immigrants and minorities.\n\nBut the shift in how white liberals think about race actually predates both the president's victory and the response from 2020 Democratic candidates.\n\nBeginning around 2012, polls show an increasing number of white liberals began adopting more progressive positions on a range of cultural issues. These days, white Democrats (and, in particular, white liberals) are more likely than in decades past to support more liberal immigration policies, embrace racial diversity and uphold affirmative action.\n\nResearchers say this shift among white liberals indicates a seismic transformation in the last five to seven years and not just a blip on one or two survey questions.\n\n\"The white liberals of 2016 or even 2014 are very distinguishable from the white liberals of the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s,\" said Zach Goldberg, doctoral student at Georgia State University who has been studying the change.\n\nIn poll after poll, on a range of racial issues, both Goldberg and another researcher, Andrew Engelhardt at Brown University, have independently discovered repeated evidence of a more left-leaning white Democratic electorate.\n\nThese days, a large majority of white liberals - nearly 3 in 4 - say discrimination is the main reason black people can't get ahead.\n\nLoading...\n\nFor some context, in the early 2000s, white liberals were split on that question - about half said blacks who couldn't get ahead were mostly responsible for their own condition.\n\nLoading...\n\nAn increasing number of white liberals now think the criminal justice is biased against black people. An increasing number of white liberals also say the police are more likely to use deadly force against black people.\n\nAnd, more white Democrats say the Confederate flag is a symbol of racism, rather than Southern pride. The reverse was true in 2000.\n\nLoading...\n\nSome metrics even seem to be suggesting that white Democrats express more woke attitudes than their fellow brown and black Democrats.\n\nGoldberg cited the 2018 American National Election Studies pilot survey, which found that 78% of white Democrats thought having more races/ethnicity in the country make it a \"better\" place to live. Fifty-seven percent of black Democrats, and 63% of Hispanic Democrats said the same.\n\nLoading...\n\nAbout two years ago, Engelhardt said he also noticed another major shift.\n\n\"Starting about 2016 ... white liberals actually rate non-white groups more positively than they do whites,\" explained Engelhardt. \"Usually, it's the opposite.\"\n\nMost racial groups feel more warmly about their own race than they do about other races. That's true for every group, except white liberals, according to the American National Election Studies.\n\nEngelhardt says these recent flips suggests there's something about being white in America that white liberals are trying to distance themselves from - something that could be accelerated by the rhetoric and tone of Trump and some of his supporters.\n\nWhen white liberals adopt some of these progressive positions, Goldberg said, they're \"virtue signaling\" - they want to prove that they're allies of minority groups and feel they need to do that more assertively and openly in the Trump era.\n\nAlthough Trump did not create the current conditions, both Goldberg and Engelhardt agree the president has accelerated the change in white voter attitudes.\n\nBrown, from the Warren rally, derided some of his fellow white people for being \"white supremacists\" who think they are the only people \"with the real birthright claim on this land, even though that makes no sense whatsoever.\"\n\nEngelhardt also suggests white guilt could be a motivating factor.\n\nAt an O'Rourke rally in Iowa a few weeks ago, 64-year-old Polly Antonelli teared up as the former congressman recounted a story from the El Paso, Texas, shooting. The suspected shooter in that incident had told police he was targeting Mexicans.\n\nAntonelli said it's \"highly appropriate\" to refer to Trump as a white supremacist.\n\n\"He is the one dividing people, by saying the things that he says about Muslims, about Mexicans, about s******* countries,\" she said. \"Calling him out on his crap might sound divisive, but it's a reaction to his divisiveness.\"\n\nAntonelli admits that her own opinions on race have evolved as she learned more about different cultures.\n\n\"I realize how little I know and how I need to be more careful about what I say and how I pigeonhole people because of how they look,\" she said, indicating a sense of cultural awareness you hear more often voiced by white liberals in recent years.\n\nThe \"moral buttons\" are being pushed\n\nOne possible explanation for the dramatic shift in racial attitudes in the last decade is that white Democrats who disagreed with the party's embrace of diversity have just abandoned the party altogether. But even though the makeup of the parties has fluctuated, that's not the only explanation; Researchers point to a genuine shift among the white liberals who have remained in the party.\n\n\"Whites' identification as Democrats and Republicans is motivating them to hold different attitudes about people of color in the United States,\" said Engelhardt.\n\nGoldberg says he noticed an abrupt change around the time mainstream news outlets started picking up on social media accounts of fatal police shootings of black men.\n\n\"[White liberals'] exposure to injustice inequality has been heightened because of the internet,\" said Goldberg. \"The moral buttons of white liberals are being more frequently pressed.\"\n\nEngelhardt agrees, and pointed to one specific incident as a potential catalyst - when a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black man, in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014.\n\n\"This kind of renewed attention to discrimination is new and novel for white liberals,\" he said, explaining why there has not been as large of a shift among people of color on these survey questions, in part because they didn't need social media videos to know what was already happening in their communities.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

A new study from the Pew Research Center breaks down ideology within political parties, including by views on the role of government.

A new study from the Pew Research Center breaks down ideology within political parties, including by views on the role of government.\n\nThe idea that Americans are polarized makes it seem as if there are only two sides in politics - liberal and conservative, Democratic and Republican.\n\nBut Americans are far more complicated politically, a new Pew Research Center typology shows in a study that gives a clearer picture of the full spectrum of American political views.\n\nAmericans are divided not just by party but also within them, enough so for Pew to sort Americans ideologically into nine distinct categories (one more than in its last typology four years ago , with some decidedly different contours).\n\nClear lines emerge when it comes to race, inequality and what the government should do about it. There are also decidedly different views on the role of government overall, economic policy, immigration, religion, the United States' standing in the world and - for Republican-leaning groups - former President Donald Trump.\n\nWhat's more, despite surveys having found broad support for a third party outside the two major ones, the study shows that there's no magic middle. In fact, the study finds that the three groups with the most self-identified independents \"have very little in common politically.\"\n\nThere are also clear implications for control of Congress. While there has been much focus on Democratic divisions between progressive and moderate wings in Congress, the study finds there are more divisions among Republican groups on the issues. But where Republicans have an advantage is having more of a sense of urgency about who is in charge in Washington. The strongest Republican groups more so than the strongest Democratic ones think next year's midterms \"really matter.\"\n\nThe typology was created using more than 10,000 survey interviews over an 11-day period this past July. A typical national survey has about 1,000 respondents. This is the eighth typology Pew has created since 1987.\n\nHere's an overview of Pew's nine categories (to see where you fit, you can take Pew's quiz here ):\n\nFaith and Flag Conservatives (10% of the public)\n\nCommitted Conservatives (7%)\n\nPopulist Right (11%)\n\nAmbivalent Right (12%)\n\nStressed Sideliners (15%)\n\nOutsider Left (10%)\n\nDemocratic Mainstays (16%)\n\nEstablishment Liberals (13%)\n\nProgressive Left (6%)\n\nRepublican-leaning groups largely believe government is doing too much, that everyone has the ability to succeed, obstacles that once made it harder for women and nonwhites to get ahead are now gone, white people largely don't benefit from societal advantages over Black people, that political correctness is a major problem and military might is key to keeping the U.S. a superpower.\n\nTwo-thirds also think the Republican Party should not accept elected officials who have been openly critical of Trump.\n\nThey divide, however, on economic, social and foreign policy. On economics, there are splits on whether corporations make a fair amount of profit and if taxes should be raised on the wealthy. They also don't fully agree on which is more important - oil, coal and natural gas expansion or developing alternative energy supplies.\n\nOn social issues, they diverge on whether same-sex marriage or abortion should be legal, if government policies should reflect religious beliefs and even whether they feel uncomfortable hearing people speak a language other than English in public places. There are also differences on whether election changes that make it easier to vote would make elections less secure.\n\nOn foreign affairs, some think the U.S. should take allies' interests into account; others do not.\n\nFaith and Flag Conservatives\n\nCommitted Conservatives\n\nPopulist Right\n\nAmbivalent Right\n\nStressed Sideliners\n\nWhile Democratic-leaning groups generally agree on many issues and say that problems exist when it comes to race and economic inequality, there is an intensity gap about how much should be done about those problems and how radical the solutions should be.\n\nPew notes that in past typologies, it has found cracks among Democratic groups on social issues like abortion, same-sex marriage and legalizing marijuana, but those no longer exist. Instead, now the divides are about how liberal the party should be.\n\nThese Democratic-leaning groups believe in a strong federal government, one that should do more to solve problems. They also agree that the economic system unfairly favors the powerful and that taxes on big businesses and corporations should be raised, as should the minimum wage (to $15 an hour).\n\nThey feel more needs to be done to achieve racial equality, that nonwhites face at least some discrimination, that significant obstacles remain for women to get ahead and that voting is a fundamental right and should not be restricted. When it comes to major foreign policy decisions, they agree that allies should be taken into consideration.\n\nFissures exist with regard to U.S. military power and, to a lesser extent, social and criminal justice, as well as immigration.\n\nProgressive Left\n\nEstablishment Liberals\n\nDemocratic Mainstays\n\nOutsider Left\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

On Thursday, we heard from conservative David Frum, who argues Republicans lost touch with reality.  In the same issue, liberal writer Jonathan Chait also uses the word \"fantasy\" in describing liberals. He tells Steve Inskeep liberals have become unreasonable.\n\nLINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Linda Wertheimer. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Some of the most compelling political debates come within the parties. This week inÂ New York Magazine, two writers each critiqued their own side. We heard one yesterday - conservative David Frum, who argues that Republicans lost touch with reality. In the same issue, liberal writer Jonathan Chait also uses the word fantasy in describing liberals disappointed with President Obama. Chait says they're unreasonable. What makes you think they're unreasonable? JONATHAN CHAIT: I think liberals have a problem with Democratic presidents. And I base this on the fact that liberals have been deeply upset with every president since Roosevelt. And even when Roosevelt was in office, liberals were fairly upset most of the time. INSKEEP: You make a specific comparison to now. There are a lot of liberals who miss Bill Clinton. CHAIT: Right. There's a huge wave of Clinton nostalgia, which is amazing, because I was alive, you were alive. I mean, I'm kind of surprised no one remembers this. Liberals were unhappy constantly and defensive and disillusioned. I don't think liberals have completely turned against Obama. They're planning to vote for him for the most part. But the liberal sense of Obama is so disillusioned so that even the people who defend him are completely apologetic. INSKEEP: What's an example of the apologetic attitude you're thinking of here? Something that's happened in your life, a conversation you've had? CHAIT: Oh, I don't want to... INSKEEP: Oh, go ahead. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) CHAIT: ...discuss conversations with individual friends, relatives or whatever. To the extent that you have conversations among liberals, and I think liberals are talking with their friends and family, the people who are defending Obama will say something like, well, he had it hard. The Republicans really made it difficult on him. Maybe he can do more in his second term. And the people who are disappointed will just be really going hammer and tongs, saying he's blown it all completely. INSKEEP: What is the practical effect of this Democratic dismay? If liberals in the end are just going to vote for Obama, does it matter if they're cranky about it? CHAIT: I think it does matter. I think the practical effect has two dimensions. One dimension is mobilization intensity. You're not going to have the same kind of mobilization you had for Obama in '08. The second dimension, I think, is the whole tenor of the conversation around Obama. You could really see this during the health care debate. The debate was between conservatives who said this was socialism, this was the destruction of America, and liberals who said either it's half a loaf, it's better than nothing, or it's a complete sellout to the insurance industry. And I think that was communicated to the public. And the idea was that this wasn't very good. This was a sellout. No one's really defending it. I think that really helped shape perceptions of the health care bill. And I think the same dynamic has really affected the whole Obama presidency. There's really no one out there strongly defending the guy anymore. INSKEEP: And I wonder if there's been another effect. President Obama has been campaigning for what he describes as a jobs bill this fall. And the Republican critique of Obama is essentially this: He's not proposing something that we're willing to pass. He's just playing politics. He's just trying to improve his base support. Is the president, in fact, tacking left in order to try to recapture these disenchanted Democrats? CHAIT: I don't think that's a fair description. I think he is trying to recapture disenchanted Democrats, but I think he's also trying to speak to the center. And I think he probably has captured the high ground of public opinion, because public opinion is strongly in favor of both the individual measures in his jobs bill and the ways he wants to pay for it with raising taxes on the rich. But it does show the degree to which he's really lost his base. INSKEEP: Lost his base. CHAIT: I don't think he's lost his base in the sense that he has to worry about liberal Democrats voting for him. But I think the enthusiasm is a problem. And politics works at an individual level. It works where people listen to other people talk. And when no one's defending a president, that does affect the overall climate of opinion. INSKEEP: You yourself, in your article, acknowledge that some people will listen to you or read you and conclude that you're just an apologist for Obama. CHAIT: Right. Well, look, I think a couple points need to be made. Number one, not all the complaints about Obama are wrong. And I've made many of those complaints myself. Number two, there is a role in constructive complaints, even unreasonable constructive complaints. What I'm trying to critique is going from making these complaints to making these complaints the entirety of your perspective. So my perspective is it's been the most effective domestic presidency in more than 40 years, and Obama has made a series of mistakes on top of that, as all presidents do. But I think the overall shape of the liberal view is distorted. INSKEEP: Were you excited to vote for President Obama in 2008? CHAIT: Yeah. I'm not an excitable guy, but I was optimistic about that. And my expectations have been fulfilled. INSKEEP: Are you excited for the opportunity to vote for him in 2012? CHAIT: Um... You know, like I said, I'm not excitable, so excited might be a bad verb to use for me. I feel like I've got a chance to vote for what's going to be one of the best presidents of my lifetime. Obama's probably about as good as it gets in American politics. I've tempered expectations for what you can do in politics. Obama's pretty much at the top of what I can expect to get out of a politician. INSKEEP: Jonathan Chait's article in New York Magazine is called \"When Did Liberals Become So Unreasonable?\" Thanks very much. CHAIT: Thank you.

Some of the most compelling political debates come within the parties. This week inÂ New York Magazine, two writers each critiqued their own side. We heard one yesterday - conservative David Frum, who argues that Republicans lost touch with reality. In the same issue, liberal writer Jonathan Chait also uses the word fantasy in describing liberals disappointed with President Obama. Chait says they're unreasonable. What makes you think they're unreasonable? JONATHAN CHAIT: I think liberals have a problem with Democratic presidents. And I base this on the fact that liberals have been deeply upset with every president since Roosevelt. And even when Roosevelt was in office, liberals were fairly upset most of the time. INSKEEP: You make a specific comparison to now. There are a lot of liberals who miss Bill Clinton. CHAIT: Right. There's a huge wave of Clinton nostalgia, which is amazing, because I was alive, you were alive. I mean, I'm kind of surprised no one remembers this. Liberals were unhappy constantly and defensive and disillusioned. I don't think liberals have completely turned against Obama. They're planning to vote for him for the most part. But the liberal sense of Obama is so disillusioned so that even the people who defend him are completely apologetic. INSKEEP: What's an example of the apologetic attitude you're thinking of here? Something that's happened in your life, a conversation you've had? CHAIT: Oh, I don't want to... INSKEEP: Oh, go ahead. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) CHAIT: ...discuss conversations with individual friends, relatives or whatever. To the extent that you have conversations among liberals, and I think liberals are talking with their friends and family, the people who are defending Obama will say something like, well, he had it hard. The Republicans really made it difficult on him. Maybe he can do more in his second term. And the people who are disappointed will just be really going hammer and tongs, saying he's blown it all completely. INSKEEP: What is the practical effect of this Democratic dismay? If liberals in the end are just going to vote for Obama, does it matter if they're cranky about it? CHAIT: I think it does matter. I think the practical effect has two dimensions. One dimension is mobilization intensity. You're not going to have the same kind of mobilization you had for Obama in '08. The second dimension, I think, is the whole tenor of the conversation around Obama. You could really see this during the health care debate. The debate was between conservatives who said this was socialism, this was the destruction of America, and liberals who said either it's half a loaf, it's better than nothing, or it's a complete sellout to the insurance industry. And I think that was communicated to the public. And the idea was that this wasn't very good. This was a sellout. No one's really defending it. I think that really helped shape perceptions of the health care bill. And I think the same dynamic has really affected the whole Obama presidency. There's really no one out there strongly defending the guy anymore. INSKEEP: And I wonder if there's been another effect. President Obama has been campaigning for what he describes as a jobs bill this fall. And the Republican critique of Obama is essentially this: He's not proposing something that we're willing to pass. He's just playing politics. He's just trying to improve his base support. Is the president, in fact, tacking left in order to try to recapture these disenchanted Democrats? CHAIT: I don't think that's a fair description. I think he is trying to recapture disenchanted Democrats, but I think he's also trying to speak to the center. And I think he probably has captured the high ground of public opinion, because public opinion is strongly in favor of both the individual measures in his jobs bill and the ways he wants to pay for it with raising taxes on the rich. But it does show the degree to which he's really lost his base. INSKEEP: Lost his base. CHAIT: I don't think he's lost his base in the sense that he has to worry about liberal Democrats voting for him. But I think the enthusiasm is a problem. And politics works at an individual level. It works where people listen to other people talk. And when no one's defending a president, that does affect the overall climate of opinion. INSKEEP: You yourself, in your article, acknowledge that some people will listen to you or read you and conclude that you're just an apologist for Obama. CHAIT: Right. Well, look, I think a couple points need to be made. Number one, not all the complaints about Obama are wrong. And I've made many of those complaints myself.

This week inÂ New York Magazine, two writers each critiqued their own side. We heard one yesterday - conservative David Frum, who argues that Republicans lost touch with reality. In the same issue, liberal writer Jonathan Chait also uses the word fantasy in describing liberals disappointed with President Obama. Chait says they're unreasonable. What makes you think they're unreasonable? JONATHAN CHAIT: I think liberals have a problem with Democratic presidents. And I base this on the fact that liberals have been deeply upset with every president since Roosevelt. And even when Roosevelt was in office, liberals were fairly upset most of the time. INSKEEP: You make a specific comparison to now. There are a lot of liberals who miss Bill Clinton. CHAIT: Right. There's a huge wave of Clinton nostalgia, which is amazing, because I was alive, you were alive. I mean, I'm kind of surprised no one remembers this. Liberals were unhappy constantly and defensive and disillusioned. I don't think liberals have completely turned against Obama. They're planning to vote for him for the most part. But the liberal sense of Obama is so disillusioned so that even the people who defend him are completely apologetic. INSKEEP: What's an example of the apologetic attitude you're thinking of here? Something that's happened in your life, a conversation you've had? CHAIT: Oh, I don't want to... INSKEEP: Oh, go ahead. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) CHAIT: ...discuss conversations with individual friends, relatives or whatever. To the extent that you have conversations among liberals, and I think liberals are talking with their friends and family, the people who are defending Obama will say something like, well, he had it hard. The Republicans really made it difficult on him. Maybe he can do more in his second term. And the people who are disappointed will just be really going hammer and tongs, saying he's blown it all completely. INSKEEP: What is the practical effect of this Democratic dismay? If liberals in the end are just going to vote for Obama, does it matter if they're cranky about it? CHAIT: I think it does matter. I think the practical effect has two dimensions. One dimension is mobilization intensity. You're not going to have the same kind of mobilization you had for Obama in '08. The second dimension, I think, is the whole tenor of the conversation around Obama. You could really see this during the health care debate. The debate was between conservatives who said this was socialism, this was the destruction of America, and liberals who said either it's half a loaf, it's better than nothing, or it's a complete sellout to the insurance industry. And I think that was communicated to the public. And the idea was that this wasn't very good. This was a sellout. No one's really defending it. I think that really helped shape perceptions of the health care bill. And I think the same dynamic has really affected the whole Obama presidency. There's really no one out there strongly defending the guy anymore. INSKEEP: And I wonder if there's been another effect. President Obama has been campaigning for what he describes as a jobs bill this fall. And the Republican critique of Obama is essentially this: He's not proposing something that we're willing to pass. He's just playing politics. He's just trying to improve his base support. Is the president, in fact, tacking left in order to try to recapture these disenchanted Democrats? CHAIT: I don't think that's a fair description. I think he is trying to recapture disenchanted Democrats, but I think he's also trying to speak to the center. And I think he probably has captured the high ground of public opinion, because public opinion is strongly in favor of both the individual measures in his jobs bill and the ways he wants to pay for it with raising taxes on the rich. But it does show the degree to which he's really lost his base. INSKEEP: Lost his base. CHAIT: I don't think he's lost his base in the sense that he has to worry about liberal Democrats voting for him. But I think the enthusiasm is a problem. And politics works at an individual level. It works where people listen to other people talk. And when no one's defending a president, that does affect the overall climate of opinion. INSKEEP: You yourself, in your article, acknowledge that some people will listen to you or read you and conclude that you're just an apologist for Obama. CHAIT: Right. Well, look, I think a couple points need to be made. Number one, not all the complaints about Obama are wrong. And I've made many of those complaints myself. Number two, there is a role in constructive complaints, even unreasonable constructive complaints. What I'm trying to critique is going from making these complaints to making these complaints the entirety of your perspective. So my perspective is it's been the most effective domestic presidency in more than 40 years, and Obama has made a series of mistakes on top of that, as all presidents do. But I think the overall shape of the liberal view is distorted. INSKEEP: Were you excited to vote for President Obama in 2008? CHAIT: Yeah. I'm not an excitable guy, but I was optimistic about that. And my expectations have been fulfilled. INSKEEP: Are you excited for the opportunity to vote for him in 2012? CHAIT: Um... You know, like I said, I'm not excitable, so excited might be a bad verb to use for me. I feel like I've got a chance to vote for what's going to be one of the best presidents of my lifetime. Obama's probably about as good as it gets in American politics. I've tempered expectations for what you can do in politics. Obama's pretty much at the top of what I can expect to get out of a politician. INSKEEP: Jonathan Chait's article in New York Magazine is called \"When Did Liberals Become So Unreasonable?\" Thanks very much. CHAIT: Thank you.

President Obama has been campaigning for what he describes as a jobs bill this fall. And the Republican critique of Obama is essentially this: He's not proposing something that we're willing to pass. He's just playing politics. He's just trying to improve his base support. Is the president, in fact, tacking left in order to try to recapture these disenchanted Democrats? CHAIT: I don't think that's a fair description. I think he is trying to recapture disenchanted Democrats, but I think he's also trying to speak to the center. And I think he probably has captured the high ground of public opinion, because public opinion is strongly in favor of both the individual measures in his jobs bill and the ways he wants to pay for it with raising taxes on the rich. But it does show the degree to which he's really lost his base. INSKEEP: Lost his base. CHAIT: I don't think he's lost his base in the sense that he has to worry about liberal Democrats voting for him. But I think the enthusiasm is a problem. And politics works at an individual level. It works where people listen to other people talk. And when no one's defending a president, that does affect the overall climate of opinion. INSKEEP: You yourself, in your article, acknowledge that some people will listen to you or read you and conclude that you're just an apologist for Obama. CHAIT: Right. Well, look, I think a couple points need to be made. Number one, not all the complaints about Obama are wrong. And I've made many of those complaints myself. Number two, there is a role in constructive complaints, even unreasonable constructive complaints. What I'm trying to critique is going from making these complaints to making these complaints the entirety of your perspective. So my perspective is it's been the most effective domestic presidency in more than 40 years, and Obama has made a series of mistakes on top of that, as all presidents do. But I think the overall shape of the liberal view is distorted. INSKEEP: Were you excited to vote for President Obama in 2008? CHAIT: Yeah. I'm not an excitable guy, but I was optimistic about that. And my expectations have been fulfilled. INSKEEP: Are you excited for the opportunity to vote for him in 2012? CHAIT: Um... You know, like I said, I'm not excitable, so excited might be a bad verb to use for me. I feel like I've got a chance to vote for what's going to be one of the best presidents of my lifetime. Obama's probably about as good as it gets in American politics. I've tempered expectations for what you can do in politics. Obama's pretty much at the top of what I can expect to get out of a politician. INSKEEP: Jonathan Chait's article in New York Magazine is called \"When Did Liberals Become So Unreasonable?\" Thanks very much. CHAIT: Thank you. INSKEEP: Chait and David Frum in New York Magazine provided two of many perspectives on debates within the political parties. Copyright © 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nJONATHAN CHAIT: I think liberals have a problem with Democratic presidents. And I base this on the fact that liberals have been deeply upset with every president since Roosevelt. And even when Roosevelt was in office, liberals were fairly upset most of the time. INSKEEP: You make a specific comparison to now. There are a lot of liberals who miss Bill Clinton. CHAIT: Right. There's a huge wave of Clinton nostalgia, which is amazing, because I was alive, you were alive. I mean, I'm kind of surprised no one remembers this. Liberals were unhappy constantly and defensive and disillusioned. I don't think liberals have completely turned against Obama. They're planning to vote for him for the most part. But the liberal sense of Obama is so disillusioned so that even the people who defend him are completely apologetic. INSKEEP: What's an example of the apologetic attitude you're thinking of here? Something that's happened in your life, a conversation you've had? CHAIT: Oh, I don't want to... INSKEEP: Oh, go ahead. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) CHAIT: ...discuss conversations with individual friends, relatives or whatever. To the extent that you have conversations among liberals, and I think liberals are talking with their friends and family, the people who are defending Obama will say something like, well, he had it hard. The Republicans really made it difficult on him. Maybe he can do more in his second term. And the people who are disappointed will just be really going hammer and tongs, saying he's blown it all completely. INSKEEP: What is the practical effect of this Democratic dismay? If liberals in the end are just going to vote for Obama, does it matter if they're cranky about it? CHAIT: I think it does matter. I think the practical effect has two dimensions. One dimension is mobilization intensity. You're not going to have the same kind of mobilization you had for Obama in '08. The second dimension, I think, is the whole tenor of the conversation around Obama. You could really see this during the health care debate. The debate was between conservatives who said this was socialism, this was the destruction of America, and liberals who said either it's half a loaf, it's better than nothing, or it's a complete sellout to the insurance industry. And I think that was communicated to the public. And the idea was that this wasn't very good. This was a sellout. No one's really defending it. I think that really helped shape perceptions of the health care bill. And I think the same dynamic has really affected the whole Obama presidency. There's really no one out there strongly defending the guy anymore. INSKEEP: And I wonder if there's been another effect.

And I think that was communicated to the public. And the idea was that this wasn't very good. This was a sellout. No one's really defending it. I think that really helped shape perceptions of the health care bill. And I think the same dynamic has really affected the whole Obama presidency. There's really no one out there strongly defending the guy anymore. INSKEEP: And I wonder if there's been another effect. President Obama has been campaigning for what he describes as a jobs bill this fall. And the Republican critique of Obama is essentially this: He's not proposing something that we're willing to pass. He's just playing politics. He's just trying to improve his base support. Is the president, in fact, tacking left in order to try to recapture these disenchanted Democrats? CHAIT: I don't think that's a fair description. I think he is trying to recapture disenchanted Democrats, but I think he's also trying to speak to the center. And I think he probably has captured the high ground of public opinion, because public opinion is strongly in favor of both the individual measures in his jobs bill and the ways he wants to pay for it with raising taxes on the rich. But it does show the degree to which he's really lost his base. INSKEEP: Lost his base. CHAIT: I don't think he's lost his base in the sense that he has to worry about liberal Democrats voting for him. But I think the enthusiasm is a problem. And politics works at an individual level. It works where people listen to other people talk. And when no one's defending a president, that does affect the overall climate of opinion. INSKEEP: You yourself, in your article, acknowledge that some people will listen to you or read you and conclude that you're just an apologist for Obama. CHAIT: Right. Well, look, I think a couple points need to be made. Number one, not all the complaints about Obama are wrong. And I've made many of those complaints myself. Number two, there is a role in constructive complaints, even unreasonable constructive complaints. What I'm trying to critique is going from making these complaints to making these complaints the entirety of your perspective. So my perspective is it's been the most effective domestic presidency in more than 40 years, and Obama has made a series of mistakes on top of that, as all presidents do. But I think the overall shape of the liberal view is distorted. INSKEEP: Were you excited to vote for President Obama in 2008? CHAIT: Yeah. I'm not an excitable guy, but I was optimistic about that. And my expectations have been fulfilled. INSKEEP: Are you excited for the opportunity to vote for him in 2012? CHAIT: Um... You know, like I said, I'm not excitable, so excited might be a bad verb to use for me. I feel like I've got a chance to vote for what's going to be one of the best presidents of my lifetime. Obama's probably about as good as it gets in American politics. I've tempered expectations for what you can do in politics. Obama's pretty much at the top of what I can expect to get out of a politician. INSKEEP: Jonathan Chait's article in New York Magazine is called \"When Did Liberals Become So Unreasonable?\" Thanks very much. CHAIT: Thank you. INSKEEP: Chait and David Frum in New York Magazine provided two of many perspectives on debates within the political parties. Copyright © 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Something that's happened in your life, a conversation you've had? CHAIT: Oh, I don't want to... INSKEEP: Oh, go ahead. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) CHAIT: ...discuss conversations with individual friends, relatives or whatever. To the extent that you have conversations among liberals, and I think liberals are talking with their friends and family, the people who are defending Obama will say something like, well, he had it hard. The Republicans really made it difficult on him. Maybe he can do more in his second term. And the people who are disappointed will just be really going hammer and tongs, saying he's blown it all completely. INSKEEP: What is the practical effect of this Democratic dismay? If liberals in the end are just going to vote for Obama, does it matter if they're cranky about it? CHAIT: I think it does matter. I think the practical effect has two dimensions. One dimension is mobilization intensity. You're not going to have the same kind of mobilization you had for Obama in '08. The second dimension, I think, is the whole tenor of the conversation around Obama. You could really see this during the health care debate.

To the extent that you have conversations among liberals, and I think liberals are talking with their friends and family, the people who are defending Obama will say something like, well, he had it hard. The Republicans really made it difficult on him. Maybe he can do more in his second term. And the people who are disappointed will just be really going hammer and tongs, saying he's blown it all completely. INSKEEP: What is the practical effect of this Democratic dismay? If liberals in the end are just going to vote for Obama, does it matter if they're cranky about it? CHAIT: I think it does matter. I think the practical effect has two dimensions. One dimension is mobilization intensity. You're not going to have the same kind of mobilization you had for Obama in '08. The second dimension, I think, is the whole tenor of the conversation around Obama. You could really see this during the health care debate. The debate was between conservatives who said this was socialism, this was the destruction of America, and liberals who said either it's half a loaf, it's better than nothing, or it's a complete sellout to the insurance industry. And I think that was communicated to the public. And the idea was that this wasn't very good. This was a sellout. No one's really defending it. I think that really helped shape perceptions of the health care bill. And I think the same dynamic has really affected the whole Obama presidency. There's really no one out there strongly defending the guy anymore. INSKEEP: And I wonder if there's been another effect. President Obama has been campaigning for what he describes as a jobs bill this fall. And the Republican critique of Obama is essentially this: He's not proposing something that we're willing to pass. He's just playing politics. He's just trying to improve his base support. Is the president, in fact, tacking left in order to try to recapture these disenchanted Democrats? CHAIT: I don't think that's a fair description. I think he is trying to recapture disenchanted Democrats, but I think he's also trying to speak to the center. And I think he probably has captured the high ground of public opinion, because public opinion is strongly in favor of both the individual measures in his jobs bill and the ways he wants to pay for it with raising taxes on the rich. But it does show the degree to which he's really lost his base. INSKEEP: Lost his base. CHAIT: I don't think he's lost his base in the sense that he has to worry about liberal Democrats voting for him. But I think the enthusiasm is a problem. And politics works at an individual level. It works where people listen to other people talk. And when no one's defending a president, that does affect the overall climate of opinion. INSKEEP: You yourself, in your article, acknowledge that some people will listen to you or read you and conclude that you're just an apologist for Obama. CHAIT: Right. Well, look, I think a couple points need to be made. Number one, not all the complaints about Obama are wrong. And I've made many of those complaints myself. Number two, there is a role in constructive complaints, even unreasonable constructive complaints. What I'm trying to critique is going from making these complaints to making these complaints the entirety of your perspective. So my perspective is it's been the most effective domestic presidency in more than 40 years, and Obama has made a series of mistakes on top of that, as all presidents do. But I think the overall shape of the liberal view is distorted. INSKEEP: Were you excited to vote for President Obama in 2008? CHAIT: Yeah. I'm not an excitable guy, but I was optimistic about that. And my expectations have been fulfilled. INSKEEP: Are you excited for the opportunity to vote for him in 2012? CHAIT: Um... You know, like I said, I'm not excitable, so excited might be a bad verb to use for me. I feel like I've got a chance to vote for what's going to be one of the best presidents of my lifetime. Obama's probably about as good as it gets in American politics. I've tempered expectations for what you can do in politics. Obama's pretty much at the top of what I can expect to get out of a politician. INSKEEP: Jonathan Chait's article in New York Magazine is called \"When Did Liberals Become So Unreasonable?\" Thanks very much. CHAIT: Thank you. INSKEEP: Chait and David Frum in New York Magazine provided two of many perspectives on debates within the political parties. Copyright © 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

CHAIT: I don't think that's a fair description. I think he is trying to recapture disenchanted Democrats, but I think he's also trying to speak to the center. And I think he probably has captured the high ground of public opinion, because public opinion is strongly in favor of both the individual measures in his jobs bill and the ways he wants to pay for it with raising taxes on the rich. But it does show the degree to which he's really lost his base. INSKEEP: Lost his base. CHAIT: I don't think he's lost his base in the sense that he has to worry about liberal Democrats voting for him. But I think the enthusiasm is a problem. And politics works at an individual level. It works where people listen to other people talk. And when no one's defending a president, that does affect the overall climate of opinion. INSKEEP: You yourself, in your article, acknowledge that some people will listen to you or read you and conclude that you're just an apologist for Obama. CHAIT: Right. Well, look, I think a couple points need to be made. Number one, not all the complaints about Obama are wrong. And I've made many of those complaints myself. Number two, there is a role in constructive complaints, even unreasonable constructive complaints. What I'm trying to critique is going from making these complaints to making these complaints the entirety of your perspective. So my perspective is it's been the most effective domestic presidency in more than 40 years, and Obama has made a series of mistakes on top of that, as all presidents do. But I think the overall shape of the liberal view is distorted. INSKEEP: Were you excited to vote for President Obama in 2008? CHAIT: Yeah. I'm not an excitable guy, but I was optimistic about that. And my expectations have been fulfilled. INSKEEP: Are you excited for the opportunity to vote for him in 2012? CHAIT: Um... You know, like I said, I'm not excitable, so excited might be a bad verb to use for me. I feel like I've got a chance to vote for what's going to be one of the best presidents of my lifetime. Obama's probably about as good as it gets in American politics. I've tempered expectations for what you can do in politics. Obama's pretty much at the top of what I can expect to get out of a politician. INSKEEP: Jonathan Chait's article in New York Magazine is called \"When Did Liberals Become So Unreasonable?\" Thanks very much. CHAIT: Thank you. INSKEEP: Chait and David Frum in New York Magazine provided two of many perspectives on debates within the political parties. Copyright © 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And I think that was communicated to the public. And the idea was that this wasn't very good. This was a sellout. No one's really defending it.

And my expectations have been fulfilled. INSKEEP: Are you excited for the opportunity to vote for him in 2012? CHAIT: Um... You know, like I said, I'm not excitable, so excited might be a bad verb to use for me. I feel like I've got a chance to vote for what's going to be one of the best presidents of my lifetime. Obama's probably about as good as it gets in American politics. I've tempered expectations for what you can do in politics. Obama's pretty much at the top of what I can expect to get out of a politician. INSKEEP: Jonathan Chait's article in New York Magazine is called \"When Did Liberals Become So Unreasonable?\" Thanks very much. CHAIT: Thank you. INSKEEP: Chait and David Frum in New York Magazine provided two of many perspectives on debates within the political parties. Copyright © 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I think he is trying to recapture disenchanted Democrats, but I think he's also trying to speak to the center. And I think he probably has captured the high ground of public opinion, because public opinion is strongly in favor of both the individual measures in his jobs bill and the ways he wants to pay for it with raising taxes on the rich. But it does show the degree to which he's really lost his base. INSKEEP: Lost his base. CHAIT: I don't think he's lost his base in the sense that he has to worry about liberal Democrats voting for him. But I think the enthusiasm is a problem. And politics works at an individual level. It works where people listen to other people talk. And when no one's defending a president, that does affect the overall climate of opinion. INSKEEP: You yourself, in your article, acknowledge that some people will listen to you or read you and conclude that you're just an apologist for Obama. CHAIT: Right. Well, look, I think a couple points need to be made. Number one, not all the complaints about Obama are wrong. And I've made many of those complaints myself. Number two, there is a role in constructive complaints, even unreasonable constructive complaints. What I'm trying to critique is going from making these complaints to making these complaints the entirety of your perspective.

      "text": "'The Atlantic': If Liberals Won't Enforce Borders, Fascists Will\n\nRachel Martin talks to David Frum, staff writer at The Atlantic and former speech writer for George W. Bush, about his essay proposing new limits on immigration.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST: If President Trump came into office with the phrase Make America Great Again, he intends to win re-election with the tagline Build The Wall, or as he more often says now, Finish The Wall. He and many of his supporters continue to point to immigration as a security threat, although illegal immigration has dropped dramatically from its height in the early 2000s, and legal immigration has been relatively consistent since then. David Frum is no fan of President Trump, but he agrees with him that immigration should be restricted. In the current cover essay for The Atlantic magazine, Frum argues that antipathy towards Trump is preventing tough choices about who gets to be an American. The piece is called \"If Liberals Won't Enforce Borders, Fascists Will.\" DAVID FRUM: What I observe in this article is that the effect of the Trump presidency has been, upon many liberal-minded people, to drive them to a point where any enforcement of immigration laws, beyond removing convicted felons, is emotionally, psychologically unacceptable. And this is happening at a time when we are living through a democratic recession that has brought authoritarian populists to power in this country, in Europe, in other countries. Immigration is not the only driver of the authoritarian populism that is besetting democratic institutions, but it is maybe the most proximate, most urgent. And so I'm imploring people to understand the power of this issue and the need to bring immigration into some kind of order if you're going to sustain, not only democratic institutions, but open trade, the European Union, other institutions of the liberal world order. MARTIN: Let's get to your prescriptions to curb immigration. You make two primary recommendations - to limit immigration quotas to pre-1990 levels and to focus on technical skills, rather than preference for family relationships. Why? FRUM: I don't think most Americans understand how big the numbers of legal immigrants coming to the United States are and how recently this has changed. In 1990, the United States doubled its intake of legal immigrants from about 540,000 a year to 1.2 million. There wasn't really a compelling reason to do that back in 1990. And as it is today, all these years later, it remains kind of an arbitrary decision. MARTIN: But what's the problem with that? Like, what's the problem with having that many legal immigrants? FRUM: I don't think most Americans understand how small the benefits of immigration are - the economic benefits - to the legal residents of the United States. In 2007, the Bush administration tried to quantify the immigration surplus - the benefit of immigration to American residents - and came up with a figure that was about $30 billion in a $14 trillion economy. It's negligible. It's not - it's real, but it's negligible compared to other things. And the social and political costs, we see all around us. Brexit, Trump, the crack of the European Union, the drive to authoritarian populism worldwide - those are political and social costs that have to be assessed. MARTIN: You point out that the poor are expensive to support. And low-skilled immigrants in particular are likely to remain poor. But that is also true for poor Americans, right? I mean, it takes five generations for a low-income family to reach an average income in the U.S. So how much of this is primarily a social mobility problem, an economic problem, not an immigration problem? FRUM: People correctly note that we have difficulties enough creating opportunity for poor Americans, and they use that as an argument about immigration. That's not an argument about immigration. That's an argument about how we are failing at home. Immigration proponents hope that if we care as much about poor people outside the United States as we do about poor people inside the United States, we'll raise the level of care for both. We've seen, instead, as we have become more cosmopolitan in our sympathies, we've ended up caring as little for fellow Americans as for people everywhere. It is precisely because we are not honoring our commitments and our promises and our obligations to our fellow Americans that I'm urging people to have a stronger sense of social solidarity. And the way you get that stronger sense of social solidarity is by making the meaning of Americanism stronger, and that means making it more of a national community. And communities have boundaries between themselves and the rest of the world. MARTIN: You ground a lot of your argument, though, in white Americans' fears, really, about a country that's getting less white. So is limiting immigration the answer? I mean, doesn't that just play into those fears and then legitimize them? FRUM: I don't ground very much of my argument on that at all. What I ground my argument upon is a tendency of the human mind, perceived by psychologists in people of all backgrounds, to be stressed by rapid change. If you are disturbed by what has been happening since 2005, by things like the rise of the National Front, by things like the rise of extremist parties in Italy and Poland, by the impending crackup of the European Union and by what's happening here at home, you need to focus on how can we build a stronger sense of Americanism for people of all backgrounds, including, by the way, the most recently arrived immigrants. Just to give you a sense of what's at stake in this argument - the United States is on track to become majority minority by the early 2040s. If the United States were to adopt my recommendation and cut legal immigration in half, it would become majority minority by the later 2040s. It would bump that change by three, four, maybe five years, not more... MARTIN: What's the problem with becoming majority minority? FRUM: So I'm saying - it's not - that's not the - relevant. I'm saying that - people say this, that your argument is driven by concerns about being majority minority. I'm saying that decision's already made. The question for us is how do we make a success of this? And on present policy, we are in real danger of not making a success of it. Let me give you a very, very concrete point of where we're going. So the peak decade for illegal immigration was the 1990s. Of the 45 million or so foreign-born people in the United States, about 11 million are here illegally. And most of them are probably, right now, under 45, but very soon, they're going to be reaching 65. The majority of the illegal immigrant population has been here for more than a decade. They're not going home. So when they turn 65, what happens to them? Do they get a pension? Do they get health care? Or do we write them off? Making Americans of them is going to be a huge challenge. Otherwise, we're going to have a lot of old, sick poor people living amongst us with no agreement as to what their status is.

I mean, doesn't that just play into those fears and then legitimize them? FRUM: I don't ground very much of my argument on that at all. What I ground my argument upon is a tendency of the human mind, perceived by psychologists in people of all backgrounds, to be stressed by rapid change. If you are disturbed by what has been happening since 2005, by things like the rise of the National Front, by things like the rise of extremist parties in Italy and Poland, by the impending crackup of the European Union and by what's happening here at home, you need to focus on how can we build a stronger sense of Americanism for people of all backgrounds, including, by the way, the most recently arrived immigrants. Just to give you a sense of what's at stake in this argument - the United States is on track to become majority minority by the early 2040s. If the United States were to adopt my recommendation and cut legal immigration in half, it would become majority minority by the later 2040s. It would bump that change by three, four, maybe five years, not more... MARTIN: What's the problem with becoming majority minority? FRUM: So I'm saying - it's not - that's not the - relevant. I'm saying that - people say this, that your argument is driven by concerns about being majority minority. I'm saying that decision's already made. The question for us is how do we make a success of this? And on present policy, we are in real danger of not making a success of it. Let me give you a very, very concrete point of where we're going. So the peak decade for illegal immigration was the 1990s. Of the 45 million or so foreign-born people in the United States, about 11 million are here illegally. And most of them are probably, right now, under 45, but very soon, they're going to be reaching 65. The majority of the illegal immigrant population has been here for more than a decade. They're not going home. So when they turn 65, what happens to them? Do they get a pension? Do they get health care? Or do we write them off? Making Americans of them is going to be a huge challenge. Otherwise, we're going to have a lot of old, sick poor people living amongst us with no agreement as to what their status is.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nDavid Frum is no fan of President Trump, but he agrees with him that immigration should be restricted. In the current cover essay for The Atlantic magazine, Frum argues that antipathy towards Trump is preventing tough choices about who gets to be an American. The piece is called \"If Liberals Won't Enforce Borders, Fascists Will.\" DAVID FRUM: What I observe in this article is that the effect of the Trump presidency has been, upon many liberal-minded people, to drive them to a point where any enforcement of immigration laws, beyond removing convicted felons, is emotionally, psychologically unacceptable. And this is happening at a time when we are living through a democratic recession that has brought authoritarian populists to power in this country, in Europe, in other countries. Immigration is not the only driver of the authoritarian populism that is besetting democratic institutions, but it is maybe the most proximate, most urgent. And so I'm imploring people to understand the power of this issue and the need to bring immigration into some kind of order if you're going to sustain, not only democratic institutions, but open trade, the European Union, other institutions of the liberal world order. MARTIN: Let's get to your prescriptions to curb immigration. You make two primary recommendations - to limit immigration quotas to pre-1990 levels and to focus on technical skills, rather than preference for family relationships. Why? FRUM: I don't think most Americans understand how big the numbers of legal immigrants coming to the United States are and how recently this has changed. In 1990, the United States doubled its intake of legal immigrants from about 540,000 a year to 1.2 million. There wasn't really a compelling reason to do that back in 1990. And as it is today, all these years later, it remains kind of an arbitrary decision. MARTIN: But what's the problem with that? Like, what's the problem with having that many legal immigrants? FRUM: I don't think most Americans understand how small the benefits of immigration are - the economic benefits - to the legal residents of the United States. In 2007, the Bush administration tried to quantify the immigration surplus - the benefit of immigration to American residents - and came up with a figure that was about $30 billion in a $14 trillion economy. It's negligible. It's not - it's real, but it's negligible compared to other things. And the social and political costs, we see all around us. Brexit, Trump, the crack of the European Union, the drive to authoritarian populism worldwide - those are political and social costs that have to be assessed. MARTIN: You point out that the poor are expensive to support. And low-skilled immigrants in particular are likely to remain poor. But that is also true for poor Americans, right? I mean, it takes five generations for a low-income family to reach an average income in the U.S. So how much of this is primarily a social mobility problem, an economic problem, not an immigration problem? FRUM: People correctly note that we have difficulties enough creating opportunity for poor Americans, and they use that as an argument about immigration. That's not an argument about immigration. That's an argument about how we are failing at home. Immigration proponents hope that if we care as much about poor people outside the United States as we do about poor people inside the United States, we'll raise the level of care for both. We've seen, instead, as we have become more cosmopolitan in our sympathies, we've ended up caring as little for fellow Americans as for people everywhere. It is precisely because we are not honoring our commitments and our promises and our obligations to our fellow Americans that I'm urging people to have a stronger sense of social solidarity. And the way you get that stronger sense of social solidarity is by making the meaning of Americanism stronger, and that means making it more of a national community. And communities have boundaries between themselves and the rest of the world. MARTIN: You ground a lot of your argument, though, in white Americans' fears, really, about a country that's getting less white. So is limiting immigration the answer?

So the peak decade for illegal immigration was the 1990s. Of the 45 million or so foreign-born people in the United States, about 11 million are here illegally. And most of them are probably, right now, under 45, but very soon, they're going to be reaching 65. The majority of the illegal immigrant population has been here for more than a decade. They're not going home. So when they turn 65, what happens to them? Do they get a pension? Do they get health care? Or do we write them off? Making Americans of them is going to be a huge challenge. Otherwise, we're going to have a lot of old, sick poor people living amongst us with no agreement as to what their status is.

And so I'm imploring people to understand the power of this issue and the need to bring immigration into some kind of order if you're going to sustain, not only democratic institutions, but open trade, the European Union, other institutions of the liberal world order. MARTIN: Let's get to your prescriptions to curb immigration. You make two primary recommendations - to limit immigration quotas to pre-1990 levels and to focus on technical skills, rather than preference for family relationships. Why? FRUM: I don't think most Americans understand how big the numbers of legal immigrants coming to the United States are and how recently this has changed. In 1990, the United States doubled its intake of legal immigrants from about 540,000 a year to 1.2 million. There wasn't really a compelling reason to do that back in 1990. And as it is today, all these years later, it remains kind of an arbitrary decision. MARTIN: But what's the problem with that? Like, what's the problem with having that many legal immigrants? FRUM: I don't think most Americans understand how small the benefits of immigration are - the economic benefits - to the legal residents of the United States. In 2007, the Bush administration tried to quantify the immigration surplus - the benefit of immigration to American residents - and came up with a figure that was about $30 billion in a $14 trillion economy. It's negligible. It's not - it's real, but it's negligible compared to other things. And the social and political costs, we see all around us. Brexit, Trump, the crack of the European Union, the drive to authoritarian populism worldwide - those are political and social costs that have to be assessed. MARTIN: You point out that the poor are expensive to support. And low-skilled immigrants in particular are likely to remain poor. But that is also true for poor Americans, right? I mean, it takes five generations for a low-income family to reach an average income in the U.S. So how much of this is primarily a social mobility problem, an economic problem, not an immigration problem? FRUM: People correctly note that we have difficulties enough creating opportunity for poor Americans, and they use that as an argument about immigration. That's not an argument about immigration. That's an argument about how we are failing at home. Immigration proponents hope that if we care as much about poor people outside the United States as we do about poor people inside the United States, we'll raise the level of care for both. We've seen, instead, as we have become more cosmopolitan in our sympathies, we've ended up caring as little for fellow Americans as for people everywhere. It is precisely because we are not honoring our commitments and our promises and our obligations to our fellow Americans that I'm urging people to have a stronger sense of social solidarity. And the way you get that stronger sense of social solidarity is by making the meaning of Americanism stronger, and that means making it more of a national community. And communities have boundaries between themselves and the rest of the world. MARTIN: You ground a lot of your argument, though, in white Americans' fears, really, about a country that's getting less white. So is limiting immigration the answer? I mean, doesn't that just play into those fears and then legitimize them? FRUM: I don't ground very much of my argument on that at all. What I ground my argument upon is a tendency of the human mind, perceived by psychologists in people of all backgrounds, to be stressed by rapid change. If you are disturbed by what has been happening since 2005, by things like the rise of the National Front, by things like the rise of extremist parties in Italy and Poland, by the impending crackup of the European Union and by what's happening here at home, you need to focus on how can we build a stronger sense of Americanism for people of all backgrounds, including, by the way, the most recently arrived immigrants. Just to give you a sense of what's at stake in this argument - the United States is on track to become majority minority by the early 2040s. If the United States were to adopt my recommendation and cut legal immigration in half, it would become majority minority by the later 2040s. It would bump that change by three, four, maybe five years, not more... MARTIN: What's the problem with becoming majority minority? FRUM: So I'm saying - it's not - that's not the - relevant. I'm saying that - people say this, that your argument is driven by concerns about being majority minority. I'm saying that decision's already made.

They're not going home. So when they turn 65, what happens to them? Do they get a pension? Do they get health care? Or do we write them off? Making Americans of them is going to be a huge challenge. Otherwise, we're going to have a lot of old, sick poor people living amongst us with no agreement as to what their status is.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nMARTIN: But what's the problem with that? Like, what's the problem with having that many legal immigrants? FRUM: I don't think most Americans understand how small the benefits of immigration are - the economic benefits - to the legal residents of the United States. In 2007, the Bush administration tried to quantify the immigration surplus - the benefit of immigration to American residents - and came up with a figure that was about $30 billion in a $14 trillion economy. It's negligible. It's not - it's real, but it's negligible compared to other things. And the social and political costs, we see all around us. Brexit, Trump, the crack of the European Union, the drive to authoritarian populism worldwide - those are political and social costs that have to be assessed. MARTIN: You point out that the poor are expensive to support. And low-skilled immigrants in particular are likely to remain poor. But that is also true for poor Americans, right? I mean, it takes five generations for a low-income family to reach an average income in the U.S. So how much of this is primarily a social mobility problem, an economic problem, not an immigration problem? FRUM: People correctly note that we have difficulties enough creating opportunity for poor Americans, and they use that as an argument about immigration. That's not an argument about immigration. That's an argument about how we are failing at home. Immigration proponents hope that if we care as much about poor people outside the United States as we do about poor people inside the United States, we'll raise the level of care for both. We've seen, instead, as we have become more cosmopolitan in our sympathies, we've ended up caring as little for fellow Americans as for people everywhere. It is precisely because we are not honoring our commitments and our promises and our obligations to our fellow Americans that I'm urging people to have a stronger sense of social solidarity. And the way you get that stronger sense of social solidarity is by making the meaning of Americanism stronger, and that means making it more of a national community. And communities have boundaries between themselves and the rest of the world. MARTIN: You ground a lot of your argument, though, in white Americans' fears, really, about a country that's getting less white. So is limiting immigration the answer? I mean, doesn't that just play into those fears and then legitimize them? FRUM: I don't ground very much of my argument on that at all. What I ground my argument upon is a tendency of the human mind, perceived by psychologists in people of all backgrounds, to be stressed by rapid change. If you are disturbed by what has been happening since 2005, by things like the rise of the National Front, by things like the rise of extremist parties in Italy and Poland, by the impending crackup of the European Union and by what's happening here at home, you need to focus on how can we build a stronger sense of Americanism for people of all backgrounds, including, by the way, the most recently arrived immigrants. Just to give you a sense of what's at stake in this argument - the United States is on track to become majority minority by the early 2040s. If the United States were to adopt my recommendation and cut legal immigration in half, it would become majority minority by the later 2040s. It would bump that change by three, four, maybe five years, not more... MARTIN: What's the problem with becoming majority minority? FRUM: So I'm saying - it's not - that's not the - relevant. I'm saying that - people say this, that your argument is driven by concerns about being majority minority. I'm saying that decision's already made. The question for us is how do we make a success of this? And on present policy, we are in real danger of not making a success of it. Let me give you a very, very concrete point of where we're going.

It is precisely because we are not honoring our commitments and our promises and our obligations to our fellow Americans that I'm urging people to have a stronger sense of social solidarity. And the way you get that stronger sense of social solidarity is by making the meaning of Americanism stronger, and that means making it more of a national community. And communities have boundaries between themselves and the rest of the world. MARTIN: You ground a lot of your argument, though, in white Americans' fears, really, about a country that's getting less white. So is limiting immigration the answer? I mean, doesn't that just play into those fears and then legitimize them? FRUM: I don't ground very much of my argument on that at all. What I ground my argument upon is a tendency of the human mind, perceived by psychologists in people of all backgrounds, to be stressed by rapid change. If you are disturbed by what has been happening since 2005, by things like the rise of the National Front, by things like the rise of extremist parties in Italy and Poland, by the impending crackup of the European Union and by what's happening here at home, you need to focus on how can we build a stronger sense of Americanism for people of all backgrounds, including, by the way, the most recently arrived immigrants. Just to give you a sense of what's at stake in this argument - the United States is on track to become majority minority by the early 2040s. If the United States were to adopt my recommendation and cut legal immigration in half, it would become majority minority by the later 2040s. It would bump that change by three, four, maybe five years, not more... MARTIN: What's the problem with becoming majority minority? FRUM: So I'm saying - it's not - that's not the - relevant. I'm saying that - people say this, that your argument is driven by concerns about being majority minority. I'm saying that decision's already made. The question for us is how do we make a success of this? And on present policy, we are in real danger of not making a success of it. Let me give you a very, very concrete point of where we're going. So the peak decade for illegal immigration was the 1990s. Of the 45 million or so foreign-born people in the United States, about 11 million are here illegally. And most of them are probably, right now, under 45, but very soon, they're going to be reaching 65. The majority of the illegal immigrant population has been here for more than a decade. They're not going home. So when they turn 65, what happens to them? Do they get a pension? Do they get health care? Or do we write them off? Making Americans of them is going to be a huge challenge. Otherwise, we're going to have a lot of old, sick poor people living amongst us with no agreement as to what their status is.

I'm saying that - people say this, that your argument is driven by concerns about being majority minority. I'm saying that decision's already made. The question for us is how do we make a success of this? And on present policy, we are in real danger of not making a success of it. Let me give you a very, very concrete point of where we're going. So the peak decade for illegal immigration was the 1990s. Of the 45 million or so foreign-born people in the United States, about 11 million are here illegally. And most of them are probably, right now, under 45, but very soon, they're going to be reaching 65. The majority of the illegal immigrant population has been here for more than a decade. They're not going home. So when they turn 65, what happens to them? Do they get a pension? Do they get health care? Or do we write them off? Making Americans of them is going to be a huge challenge. Otherwise, we're going to have a lot of old, sick poor people living amongst us with no agreement as to what their status is.

      "text": "Do Liberals Live Under A 'Tyranny Of Cliches'?\n\nBy\n\nNPR Staff\n\nYour purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nConservative critic Jonah Goldberg says he's inspired to write when he gets annoyed. \"Aggravation is a muse,\" he says. And after speaking on a number of college campuses, he grew aggravated enough to write a book. It's called The Tyranny of Cliches: How Liberals Cheat in the War of Ideas .\n\n\"One of the things that really drove me crazy was the way in which college kids in particular are educated to think that ideology is dangerous and bad. They'll say, you know, 'Mr. Goldberg, that sounds like an ideological statement,' when I'm talking about tax cuts or something. ... Of course it's an ideological statement. You know I'm a conservative; I was asked to come here and be a conservative,\" Goldberg says.\n\nGoldberg, a columnist and editor-at-large for National Review Online, argues that ideology is not something to be shunned - in fact, it's an inevitable part of political debate. \"We are a species that must try to impose and find systems - systems of thought, ways of organizing and categorizing reality,\" he says.\n\nBut in The Tyranny of Cliches , Goldberg argues that people he categorizes as \"liberal\" talk in ways that shut down any ideological debate.\n\nGoldberg joins Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep to talk about the book.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn the way cliches are used in place of arguments\n\n\"What you have often in American political discourse are appeals to cliches that steal territory, steal terrain unearned by argument. And all I want is an argument. I don't care that liberals have an ideology. I want them to have an ideology. I want to have a contest of ideas. What bothers me is when they come in and they say, 'Oh, you guys are the crazy ideologues with your labels and all of the rest, and we're just pragmatists who care about sound science and the numbers and the facts' and all that.' \"\n\nOn his experience speaking on college campuses\n\n\"You'll get these kids who will stand up in an audience and say, 'Mr. Goldberg, I may disagree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.' You know, and the professors nod, they're so proud of this kid, and the administrators say, 'Oh, he's gonna be a statesman someday.' And, first of all, it's just a lie - this kid's not going to take a bullet for me. And second of all, it's completely not responsive. All it is, is sort of getting bravery on the cheap, claiming to be valiantly defending my right to free speech.\"\n\nOn the saying, \"Better 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man go to jail\"\n\nJonah Goldberg is the founding editor of National Review Online and the author of Liberal Fascism . Courtesy of the author hide caption\n\nJonah Goldberg is the founding editor of National Review Online and the author of Liberal Fascism .\n\n\"As a principle, I have no problem with it. The principle behind it is society should err on the side of rights of the accused. Right? We should be careful not to convict innocent men. As a matter of utilitarianism, which I don't support ... you could make a very good argument that society would be much worse off if you let 10 rapists and murderers free rather than put one poor, wrongly accused accountant in prison. And so, my only point on that is that it should open up an argument - it should not sort of settle one because nobody disagrees with it.\"\n\nOn the charge of \"social Darwinism\"\n\n\"President Obama recently talked about 'social Darwinism.' ... He's against it. But here's the funny thing: Nobody is for it. There was no intellectual movement in American history called 'social Darwinism.' The people who were supposedly the leaders of the social Darwinist movement never embraced something called social Darwinism. It didn't exist. But it is one of these sort of mythologies about America and its intellectual history that the right embraced this thing called social Darwinism when it never did.\"\n\nOn the response that conservatives also have their own cliches\n\n\"Yeah, and some of these things I absolutely agree. I think that there is something endemic - one of the reasons why some of these cliches appeal, why they have power, why they move men, is because they appeal to the hard-wiring in our human nature. We're all built from the crooked timber of humanity; we all want to live in groups; we all want to live in tribes; we all want to, you know, band together and do good things.\"\n\nOn political calls for unity\n\n\"This is one of the cliches that Obama invokes all the time, this idea of unity. That somehow ... if we could all act like a military unit, like the one that took out bin Laden, or if we were all just unified - if we all tried our hardest and made this the best yearbook ever! - that somehow this would be a much better country. Well, that's not what this country is about. Our country, if you read the Federalist Papers, is about disagreement. It's about pitting faction against faction, divided government, checks and balances. The hero in the American political tradition is the man who stands up to the mob - not the mob itself.\"\n\nOn the saying, \"Government is the problem\"\n\n\"No, I'm not against having a government. I don't know if that qualifies as the kind of cliche that I am talking about ... The mainstream media never talks as if government is the problem - you never hear that repeated over and over again. Even on Fox, to a certain extent, you won't hear that sort of thing. It's a catchphrase, to be sure, and it's a glib catchphrase that oversimplifies things, but the context in which I was talking about it was that Ronald Reagan had said, 'In the current situation, government is the problem, not the solution.' And that is the beginning of a serious argument.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Canadian Cabinet voices support for Trudeau as some Liberals prepare to confront him\n\nBy\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nCanada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rises during Question Period in Ottawa, Tuesday, Oct. 22, 2024. Adrian Wyld/AP/The Canadian Press hide caption\n\nTORONTO - Canada's deputy prime minister said she believes Justin Trudeau has the support of a majority of Liberals in Parliament as some prepare to confront him Wednesday in the hopes of convincing him to step down.\n\nChrystia Freeland and other Cabinet members voiced support for the prime minister on Tuesday ahead of a broader meeting with colleagues.\n\nA number of Liberals have signed a letter hoping to persuade Trudeau to step down before the next election. It was unclear how many signed.\n\n\"The vast majority of Liberal Members of Parliament support the prime minister, support him as leader of our government, support him as leader of our party and support him as the guy who is going to lead us into the next election,\" Freeland said.\n\nFreeland said she is more confident of that after meetings in the last 36 hours.\n\nThe Liberal recently suffered upsets in special elections in districts the party has held for years, raising doubts about Trudeau's leadership. Losing a district in Canada's largest city of Toronto, a traditional Liberal stronghold, does not bode well.\n\nA number of Liberal lawmakers have said they will not run again.\n\nTrudeau has said he will lead the party into the election, which come any time between this fall and October, 2025. His Liberal party must rely on the support of at least one major party in Parliament as the Liberals do not have the majority in the House of Commons.\n\nThe opposition leader of the Bloc Québécois said his party will work with the Conservatives and NDP parties to bring the Liberals down and force an election if the government doesn't boost old age security payments for seniors.\n\n\"The whole story is now: what will Justin Trudeau, superstar, do in the coming days,\" Bloc Leader Yves-François Blanchet said.\n\nTrudeau's Liberals have been in power since 2015 but Canadians have been frustrated by the cost of living coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTrudeau reasserted the country's liberal identity in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative rule. His legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change.\n\n\"Anybody who has ever bet against Justin Trudeau is sorry they made that bet the next day,\" said Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault.\n\nSome Cabinet ministers acknowledged some colleagues don't agree.\n\n\"Any time there are voices of dissent we have to deal with them, we have to listen to them carefully,\" Labor Minister Stephen MacKinnon said.\n\n\"We have to deal with them and present a unified face to Canadians.\"\n\nOpposition Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre goaded the prime minister about the potential revolt.\n\n\"The reality is he can't administer the government because he's too busy fighting for his job after nine years,\" Poilievre said.\n\nNelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, said the shelf life of Canadian prime ministers has been about a decade for the past 75 years.\n\n\"Trudeau's time is up. Scandals over the years have tarnished his image. He deflects or evades rather than answering straight-forward questions. There is a popular appetite for change. Most Canadians have tuned him out,\" he said.\n\n\"He is the reason why the Liberals went from the wilderness to power in 2015, but it is no longer 2015.\"\n\nTrudeau's father, Pierre Trudeau, swept to power in 1968 on a wave of \"Trudeaumania\" and led Canada for almost 16 years.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Liberals Admire Justice Breyer. Now They Want Him To Retire\n\nDanielle Kurtzleben\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer in March 2015. Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images hide caption\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer in March 2015.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton had his eye on the future when he nominated Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Court in 1994.\n\n\"Judge Breyer will bring to the court a well-recognized and impressive ability to build bridges in pursuit of fairness and justice,\" Clinton said in announcing his nomination. \"In the generations ahead, the Supreme Court will face questions of overriding national importance, many of which we cannot today even imagine.\"\n\nIt's not just the things the court has ruled on that have changed; the atmosphere around Supreme Court confirmations has shifted dramatically.\n\nA few decades ago, nominees often came out of Senate confirmation with large, bipartisan majorities. Breyer was confirmed 87 to 9.\n\nBut as Congress has grown more ideologically polarized - and after bitter Obama- and Trump-era battles over Supreme Court seats - those confirmations have become much narrower.\n\nThat is why many on the left are hoping that, after nearly three decades on the high court, Breyer has his eye on the exit.\n\nWith Democrats holding the White House and the barest of Senate majorities, there is immense urgency among progressives for Breyer to announce his retirement when the Supreme Court term ends around the end of June. That push is amplified by interest and organizing among Democrats that's centered on the courts and has increased as Republicans built a 6-3 conservative majority in the Supreme Court over the last four years.\n\n\"If Justice Breyer is to be committed to his judicial ideology, he is going to want to be replaced on the bench by someone who is going to vote to uphold the fundamental right to vote in this country and to protect the rights of the most marginalized members of our society,\" said Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y.\n\nBreyer has helped deliver landmark rulings that have broadly pleased Democrats - rulings in favor of LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights, for example. And now, a groundswell of progressives like Jones is urging the 82-year-old Breyer to retire in order to safeguard his seat with a new liberal justice.\n\nThe stakes for Democrats were made stark by former President Donald Trump's three Supreme Court nominations - one came after Republicans refused to hold hearings for Obama nominee Merrick Garland in 2016. The other two replaced swing-vote Anthony Kennedy after he retired and liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg after she died shortly before the 2020 election, swaying the balance of the court toward conservatives. To Jones, that was entirely avoidable.\n\n\"President Obama could have had the opportunity to appoint more justices to the Supreme Court than he ultimately did,\" Jones said. \"And that was the result of a decision by senior-in-age justices not to retire and give him that opportunity.\"\n\nThe pressure from Democrats for Breyer to step down is often carefully crafted, with respect for the liberal justice. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal told The Washington Post in April, \"Justice Breyer has been a great justice, and he recognizes, I am sure, the political reality of our having control of the Senate now. But elections always have risks, so hopefully he's aware of that risk and he sees it accordingly.\"\n\nThe push is about making the court a backstop on an array of issues.\n\n\"We have our eyes on the Supreme Court around issues around abortion, birth control, health insurance, LGBT issues, immigration, kind of the gamut,\" said Rachel Carmona, executive director of Women's March.\n\nBut any pressure, whether from interest groups, lawmakers or even the White House, may have precisely zero effect on Breyer's decision-making, according to Neil Eggleston, White House counsel for President Barack Obama from 2014 until 2017.\n\n\"I don't think a call from the White House or even pressure from interest groups is going to matter much to Justice Breyer,\" he said. \"The way I think about it is, a call from the White House or a call from interest groups are not adding more information that he doesn't already have in connection with what he's going to decide to do.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court justices pose for a group photo on April 23. Erin Schaff/Pool/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nThe Supreme Court justices pose for a group photo on April 23.\n\nEggleston explained how he considered whether the White House should talk retirement with the elderly Justice Ginsburg during his tenure at the White House. But then Eggleston decided against it.\n\n\"It's a little unseemly for a White House to suggest to a justice that they should retire and that the White House didn't have any information that Justice Ginsburg didn't already have, and so I just decided she would decide what she thought was appropriate,\" he said.\n\nAnd that may be how President Biden is thinking. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last month that Biden believes retirement is Breyer's choice .\n\nOne group pushing Breyer to step down is Demand Justice, which sent a black and neon-green billboard truck driving around the Supreme Court building last month. The billboard's message: \"Breyer, retire. It's time for a Black woman Supreme Court justice,\" referencing Biden's campaign vow to nominate a Black woman to the court.\n\n\"What we're trying to do with tactics like the billboard truck that we had [in April] is to show that this is the time in which Supreme Court justices have in the past announced their retirements,\" said Christopher Kang, chief counsel for Demand Justice.\n\nHe's referring to the end of the term, typically in late June, a time when past justices, including Kennedy, announced their retirements. For his part, Jones thinks next month is when calls from Capitol Hill might get louder.\n\n\"I think it is logical to assume that if Justice Breyer decides for some reason not to retire at the end of this term, there will be a chorus of Democrats calling on him to do the right thing and be a good steward of our democracy,\" he said.\n\nThe slim Democratic Senate majority right now also has Kang fearing worst-case scenarios.\n\n\"While hopefully we have this majority for until the end of 2022, really this majority could go at any moment, given sort of the potential health or something else that might happen,\" he said.\n\nPart of Demand Justice's goal is also to further energize Democratic voters around the cause ahead of 2022.\n\n\"We're trying to raise awareness among voters and lawmakers right now in particular,\" he said. \"We've seen over the last several years, Democrats in particular have become much more engaged around the Supreme Court.\"\n\nWhile exit polls in 2016 showed Trump winning voters most concerned about the court, exit polls from 2020 suggested Democrats gained ground with those voters.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nSeries: Buying Your Vote\n\nLiberal spending via dark money groups and super PACs was relatively modest in 2012. But their spending has taken off this year in at least one state.\n\nby Theodoric Meyer and Kim Barker\n\nDark Money and Big Data\n\nMost people have come to associate outside money - the hundreds of millions of dollars from politically active nonprofits and super PACs pouring into American elections - with conservatives.\n\nAnd why not? Since the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, conservative groups have far outspent their liberal counterparts. In the 2012 federal election cycle alone, conservatives shelled out almost two and a half times the amount of outside money as liberal groups, including labor unions.\n\nBut an early look at spending on television ads in North Carolina, home to a hotly contested Senate race and a number of competitive state races, shows that liberals are asserting themselves as never before. They are spending almost as much as conservatives in the Senate race and pouring funds into state contests that conservatives haven't yet spent a cent on.\n\nA ProPublica analysis of North Carolina's top three markets shows liberal groups have booked $2.8 million in ads as of Monday praising Sen. Kay Hagan, a freshman Democrat facing a tough re-election fight, or criticizing her likely opponent. That's about the same amount as conservatives have reserved in ads attacking Hagan. A coalition of liberal nonprofits has also poured more than $1.1 million into ads criticizing four Republican state senators.\n\nThe surge in advertising by liberal outside groups is obvious when you turn on a TV in the state, said Gary Pearce, a longtime Democratic consultant in Raleigh, N.C.\n\n\"It has struck me, I'd say, in the last month,\" he said. \"It's just been a dramatic shift.\"\n\nAbout 42 percent of the outside ads in the North Carolina markets - $3.1 million worth - were booked by so-called dark money groups, nonprofits that do not disclose their donors. The rest were booked by super PACs, which do name their contributors, and a liberal charity, which discloses its donors in its annual reports.\n\nIn the past, analysts have speculated that liberals' relative lack of outside spending reflected their discomfort with dark money groups and super PACs, both of which can raise unlimited amounts of money. Even the most prominent liberal dark money groups, such as Patriot Majority USA, spent a small portion of what conservative ones like Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity did in 2012.\n\nThe leading liberal super PAC in the 2012 cycle, Priorities USA Action, spent $65 million on election activity. In contrast, Restore Our Future, the leading conservative super PAC, spent more than $142 million.\n\nBut there's been a growing push on the left to play by the same rules as conservatives. Randy Voller, the chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, said that while he thought the Citizens United ruling was \"a colossal mistake,\" he didn't think that liberal outside groups had an alternative to playing by the same rules as conservatives ones.\n\n\"At this point, these are the rules we have,\" he said.\n\nSo far, in the 2014 cycle, groups focused on the environment have led the way for liberal dark money groups.\n\nLiberal billionaire Tom Steyer has formed NextGen Climate , which plans to support legislators who push for action on climate change and attack those who don't. The organization includes a dark money nonprofit, and has said one of its aims is to counter libertarian billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, who help fund a network of dark money groups. (Steyer's wife, Kat Taylor, is a member of ProPublica's board of directors, and the couple have been significant contributors to ProPublica.) This month, two other environmental nonprofits announced they were starting a collaboration called LeadingGreen to steer donations to federal candidates and help major donors lobby elected officials.\n\nFor this story, we analyzed ads booked this year in Charlotte, Raleigh and Greensboro. Most of these ads don't tell people directly to vote for or against a candidate, so they don't have to be reported to the Federal Election Commission unless they run right before an election. But since 2012, the Federal Communications Commission has required TV stations in the country's 50 largest markets to post the ad contracts online. Our analysis only includes ads that were booked since the beginning of the year - although conservatives spent heavily in North Carolina last fall - and there's no guarantee that stations have uploaded every contract.\n\nA conservative super PAC, American Crossroads, part of GOP consultant Karl Rove's outside money empire, has booked the most money in ads for those markets so far in 2014: $1.46 million. But a liberal super PAC run by former aides to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Majority PAC, is only a touch behind. It has booked $1.45 million in ads praising Hagan so far this year.\n\nOn the dark money side, three conservative groups, led by Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers' flagship dark money group, have spent almost $1.4 million on ads criticizing Hagan. One ad portrays her as being best pals with President Obama. \"Tell Sen. Hagan to stop thinking about politics and start thinking about people,\" says another .\n\nBut two liberal nonprofits have more than countered in recent months, booking more than $1.3 million for ads of their own. One of them, Patriot Majority USA, has spent more than $500,000 on ads attacking a likely Hagan opponent. The other nonprofit, a charity called the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, has bought several spots praising Hagan.\n\n\"Who's behind the attacks on Kay Hagan? Oil industry billionaires, that's who,\" says one ad , making a veiled attack at the Koch brothers. \"They want to undermine the air safety standards that protect us, and Sen. Kay Hagan is working to stop them.\"\n\nThe group's annual reports disclose its donors, but the 2014 report may not be available for a few years. Its most recent annual report is from 2011.\n\nThe liberal Southern Alliance has only run ads in North Carolina but the buy is part of a national effort by environmental organizations, said David Di Martino, a consultant for the groups. Other nonprofits have bought ads supporting Sen. Susan Collins, the moderate Maine Republican, and Democrats running for Senate seats in Iowa and Michigan. The groups are coordinating \"to ensure that we're getting the most bang out of the buck,\" Di Martino said.\n\nThe North Carolina Environmental Partnership, a coalition of nine environmental groups formed last month, has reserved more than $1.1 million of ads attacking four Republican state senators - three of whom are facing close races this fall - for their support for fracking. The coalition's two largest members, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Southern Environmental Law Center, footed the bill for the ads. They do not disclose their donors.\n\nWhile conservative dark-money groups, such as Real Jobs NC, have shoveled money into attack ads targeting North Carolina state senators in recent years, liberal groups haven't done so until now.\n\n\"I've never seen the liberal side of the equation do anything like this,\" said Brad Crone, a Democratic political and public relations consultant in Raleigh, N.C.\n\nBob Keefe, spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, wouldn't confirm how much the coalition has spent.\n\n\"We basically all agreed to not disclose how much we're spending,\" he said. \"But it's a lot.\"\n\nAlthough conservative groups have not booked ads in state legislature races so far, two groups - the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce and a super PAC called Justice for All NC - have also reserved ads mentioning candidates in the state Supreme Court races, almost $650,000 worth so far.\n\nTheodoric Meyer\n\nTheodoric Meyer is a former ProPublica reporting fellow.

      "text": "Inside the \"Private and Confidential\" Conservative Group That Promises to \"Crush Liberal Dominance\"\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nA few months ago, Leonard Leo laid out his next audacious project.\n\nEver since the longtime Federalist Society leader helped create a conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court, and then received more than a billion dollars from a wealthy Chicago business owner to disburse to conservative causes, Leo's next moves had been the subject of speculation.\n\nNow, Leo declared in a slick but private video to potential donors, he planned to \"crush liberal dominance\" across American life. The country was plagued by \"woke-ism\" in corporations and education, \"one-sided journalism\" and \"entertainment that's really corrupting our youth,\" said Leo amid snippets of cheery music and shots of sunsets and American flags.\n\nSitting tucked into a couch, with wire-rimmed glasses and hair gone to gray, Leo conveyed his inspiration and intentions: \"I just said to myself, 'Well, if this can work for law, why can't it work for lots of other areas of American culture and American life where things are really messed up right now?'\"\n\nLeo revealed his latest battle plan in the previously unreported video for the Teneo Network, a little-known group he called \"a tremendously important resource for the future of our country.\"\n\nTeneo is building what Leo called in the video \"networks of conservatives that can roll back\" liberal influence in Wall Street and Silicon Valley, among authors and academics, with pro athletes and Hollywood producers. A Federalist Society for everything.\n\nDespite its linchpin role in Leo's plans, Teneo (which is not the similarly named consulting firm associated with former officials in the Bill Clinton administration) has kept a low public profile. Its one-page website includes bland slogans - \"Timeless ideas. Fresh approach\" - and scant details. Its co-founder described Teneo as \"private and confidential\" in one presentation, and the group doesn't disclose the vast majority of its members or its funders.\n\nBut ProPublica and Documented have obtained more than 50 hours of internal Teneo videos and hundreds of pages of documents that reveal the organization's ambitious agenda, influential membership and burgeoning clout. We have also interviewed Teneo members and people familiar with the group's activities. The videos, documents and interviews provide an unfiltered look at the lens through which the group views the power of the left - and how it plans to combat it.\n\nIn response to questions for this story, Leo said in a statement: \"Teneo's young membership proves that the conservative movement is poised to be even more talented, driven, and successful in the future. This is a group that knows how to build winning teams.\"\n\nThe records show Teneo's members have included a host of prominent names from the conservative vanguard, including such elected officials as U.S. Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Missouri's Josh Hawley , a co-founder of the group. Other members have included Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, now the fourth-ranking House Republican, as well as Nebraska's attorney general and Virginia's solicitor general. Three senior aides to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, are members. Another is the federal judge who struck down a Biden administration mask mandate. The heads of the Republican Attorneys General Association, Republican State Leadership Committee and Turning Point USA - all key cogs in the world of national conservative politics - have been listed as Teneo members.\n\nConservative media figures like Ben Shapiro of the Daily Wire, several pro athletes and dozens of executives and senior figures in the worlds of finance, energy and beyond have also been members.\n\nLeo joined Teneo's board of directors as chairman in 2021 and has since become a driving force.\n\nWatch Leonard Leo Talk About Teneo\n\nTeneo co-founder Evan Baehr, a tech entrepreneur and veteran of conservative activism, said in a 2019 video for new members that Teneo had \"many, many, many dozens\" of members working in the Trump administration, including in the White House, State Department, Justice Department and Pentagon. \"They're everywhere.\"\n\nThe goal, Baehr said in another video, was \"a world in which Teneans serve in the House and the Senate, as governors - one might be elected president.\"\n\nTeneo Has Ambitious Plans\n\nHere's how \"the Left\" works in America, according to Baehr.\n\n\"Imagine a group of four people sitting at the Harvard Club for lunch in midtown Manhattan,\" he said in a 2020 Teneo video: \"a billionaire hedge funder,\" \"a film producer,\" \"a Harvard professor\" and \"a New York Times writer.\"\n\n\"The billionaire says: 'Wouldn't it be cool if middle school kids had free access to sex-change therapy paid for by the federal government?'\" Baehr continued. \"Well, the filmmaker says, 'I'd love to do a documentary on that; it will be a major motion film.' The Harvard professor says, 'We can do studies on that to say that's absolutely biologically sound and safe.' And the New York Times person says, 'I'll profile people who feel trapped in the wrong gender.' \"\n\nAfter a single lunch, Baehr concluded, elite liberals can \"put different kinds of capital together\" and \"go out into the world\" and \"basically wreck shop.\"\n\nIn a recorded video \"town hall\" held for incoming members, Baehr, a graduate of three Ivy League universities and a serial entrepreneur fluent in tech startup lingo, recalled the moment when he had the epiphany to create a conservative counter-effort.\n\nIt happened a decade earlier when he was eating lunch at a \"fairly uninviting\" Baja Fresh in Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C., with his then-boss Peter Thiel, the iconoclastic venture capitalist.\n\nBaehr explained in the video that he had become frustrated as he kicked around right-of-center politics and activism for a few years, working on Capitol Hill, in the George W. Bush White House and for right-of-center groups including the American Enterprise Institute and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.\n\nEvan Baehr Explains Teneo's Origin\n\nBaehr and Thiel lamented what they saw as the fragmented state of conservative networks, with their hidebound think tanks and intellectual centers that hold sway over right-of-center politics. A rare bright spot on their side, Baehr and Thiel agreed, was the Federalist Society. Thiel had, in fact, served as president of the Stanford Federalist Society. What if there were a group similar to the Federalist Society for venture capitalists or corporate CEOs or members of the media? (Thiel did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nIn 2008, Baehr, Hawley and others launched Teneo - Latin for \"I grasp\" or \"I endure.\" Hawley, then an associate lawyer in private practice, authored Teneo's founding principles, according to the new member talk hosted by Baehr, and served on the group's board. Its core beliefs align with the broader conservative establishment's: limited government, individual liberty, free enterprise, strong national defense and civil society and belief in a \"transcendent order\" that is \"founded in tradition, philosophy, or theology.\"\n\nFor a long time, the group didn't live up to expectations. In its first year, Teneo raised a paltry $77,000, according to its tax filing . From 2009 to 2017, the group, based first in Washington, D.C., and later in Austin, Texas, never raised more than $750,000 in a single year, tax records show. One member described in an interview Teneo's early days as little more than a run-of-the-mill dinner club with partisan overtones: \"Instead of being an organization about ideas, it was all about being a Republican.\"\n\nEnter Leo. In the early years of the Trump administration, he and the Federalist Society had remarkable influence within the new government. The Federalist Society had brought the legal doctrines of originalism and textualism - close readings of laws and the Constitution to adhere to the intent and words of the authors - into the mainstream. Leo had taken a leave of absence from the group to advise President Trump on judicial appointments, helping shepherd the appointments of Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court and helping to fill more than 200 other positions in federal district and appellate courts. By the time Trump left office, he had put on the bench 28% of all federal judges in America.\n\nIn the town hall video, Baehr explained how he modeled Teneo on the Federalist Society. Leo's \"secret sauce,\" he said, was to identify an \"inner core\" group of people within the Federalist Society's 60,000 members. Leo was \"identifying them and recruiting them for either specific roles to serve as judges or to spin up and launch critical projects often which you would have no idea about.\"\n\nSoon after Leo took an interest in Teneo, the group's finances soared. Annual revenue reached $2.3 million in 2020 and nearly $5 million in 2021, according to tax records. In 2021, the bulk of Teneo's income - more than $3 million - came from one source: DonorsTrust, a clearinghouse for conservative, libertarian and other charitable gifts that masks the original source of the money. In 2020, the Leo-run group that received the Chicago business owner's $1.6 billion donation gave $41 million to DonorsTrust, which had $1.5 billion in assets as of 2021.\n\nTeneo's other funders have included marquee conservative donors: hedge fund investor Paul Singer, Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, the Charles Koch Foundation, the Bradley Foundation, and the DeVos family, according to Baehr.\n\nAs the group's finances improved, its videos became much more professionally produced, and its website underwent a dramatic upgrade from previous iterations. All of this was part of what Baehr called \"Teneo 2.0,\" a major leap forward for the group, driven in part by Leo's guidance and involvement.\n\nBaehr declined an interview request. He said in a statement: \"Since Teneo began, I've been building hundreds of friendships among diverse leaders who have a deep love for this country and are working on innovative solutions to drive human flourishing for all. Teneo has made me a better husband, father, and leader.\"\n\nTeneo aims to help members find jobs, write books, meet spouses, secure start-up financing or nonprofit donors and learn about public service. As described in a \"Community Vision\" report from 2019, Teneo seeks to distinguish itself by acting as \"the Silicon Valley of Conservatism - a powerful network of communities where the most influential young leaders, the biggest ideas, and the most leveraged resources come together to launch key projects that advance our shared belief that the conservative worldview drives human flourishing.\"\n\nMany of the connections happen at Teneo's annual retreat, which brings together hundreds of members and their spouses, plus allies including politicians like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and DeSantis as well as business leaders and prominent academics. Speakers at past Teneo retreats have included luminaries spanning politics, culture, business and the law: New York Times columnist David Brooks, federal judge Trevor McFadden, Blackwater founder Erik Prince, \"Woke, Inc.\" author and 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, former Trump cabinet official and 2024 presidential hopeful Nikki Haley, ultrawealthy donors and activists Dick and Betsy DeVos, and Chick-fil-A board chair Dan Cathy.\n\nBut the group's internal documents and videos also show the widening sprawl of its other activities. Teneo currently has 20 regional chapters nationwide, plus industry working groups focused, most recently, on media, corporate America, finance and law. In April, the group is hosting a \"finance summit\" in South Beach that its invitation says will \"convene rising conservative talent from major financial institutions, funds, and family offices to connect and discuss key industry issues fundamental to the future of our country.\"\n\nTeneo members represent different facets of the conservative movement writ large. Some Teneo members were \"very strong Trump defenders,\" Baehr said in the 2019 town hall video, while others have opposed Trump vehemently. Baehr said there were clear divisions within the group's members about immigration and trade policy. \"Hopefully other ones, maybe Green New Deal, I hope that's more like 99 to 1\" in opposition, he said.\n\nIt's in the town hall video that Baehr assured new members that Teneo \"is private and confidential.\" He said the group will never reveal the names of its members without their permission, though they are free to disclose their membership if they want to. Members must be in their 40s or younger to join.\n\nBaehr said Teneo's website is crafted so as not to pique the interest of Senate staffers who might look up the group if one of its members mentions Teneo during a confirmation process for a judgeship or a cabinet position. \"We think a lot about that to protect your current and future leadership opportunities,\" Baehr explained.\n\nThis strategy appears to have worked. A spokesperson for Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., a critic of Leo's who has spoken extensively about dark money and the courts, said the senator's staff was \"not familiar with Teneo.\" During the confirmation process of Ryan Holte, a Trump appointee to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, Holte was asked several written questions by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Cal., about his membership in Teneo, but Feinstein spelled the group's name wrong each time. (Asked what the mission of the group was, Holte responded that Teneo was a \"nonpartisan, and nonprofit, organization that gathers members from a variety of professional backgrounds for dinners and social activities to discuss current events.\")\n\nA recent Teneo fundraising email laid out how the group can bring its members' influence together in service of a cause.\n\nTo \"confront\" what he dubbed \"woke capitalism,\" Jonathan Bunch, a longtime Leo deputy and now Teneo board member, wrote that the group had brought together a coalition of Teneans \"working with (or serving as) state attorneys general, state financial officers, state legislators, journalists, media executives and best-in-class public affairs professionals\" to launch investigations, hold hearings, pull state investment funds and publish op-eds and news stories in response to so-called environmental, social and governance, or ESG, policies at the corporate level.\n\n\"Our members were in the rooms where it happened,\" Bunch wrote.\n\nAnother project underway, Baehr explained in a 2020 presentation, was a \"surreptitious and exciting\" effort to map key institutions in major cities - private schools, country clubs, newspapers, Rotary and so on - and find ways to get Teneo members inside those institutions and help members connect with each other.

As the battle lines are drawn in State of New York v. Mnuchin , a lawsuit filed last month by the states of Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey and New York, it will be Republicans defending the power of Congress and Democrats rallying to the cause of the states.\n\nWhile well off most people's radar, the case has the potential to disrupt President Donald Trump's signature legislative achievement: last year's massive tax cut. What remains to be seen - and will largely determine the outcome - is whether judicial conservatives align with Republicans (as they usually do) or defend the states' rights doctrine at the heart of their legal thinking.\n\nThe lawsuit attacks the tax cut passed at the end of last year by the Republican-controlled Congress, specifically its limits on the deductibility of state and local taxes. The law resulted in much higher federal taxes for many residents of high-tax states, most of which are governed by Democrats. Last month, the states brought suit in federal court in Manhattan challenging the constitutionality of this provision of the new law. The legal consensus is that the lawsuit is unlikely to prevail. But the strange bedfellows of this issue may be causing legal analysts to underestimate its chances.\n\nThe new tax law breaks sharply with the past. Every federal income tax law since 1861 (and, more relevant, every one since the enactment of the 16th Amendment in 1913 giving Congress the specific power to levy income taxes after the Supreme Court limited that power in 1895 ) has permitted unlimited deductions of state and local tax payments when calculating federal income tax. Nearly 30 percent of all taxpayers took advantage of this provision in recent years; it was available only to those who itemize deductions. The 2017 law limited deductions for state and local taxes to $10,000.\n\nGet the latest news from ProPublica every afternoon.\n\nThe central argument of the lawsuit is that the new law amounts to the federal government illegally usurping a core power of the states - deciding how to raise and spend money. Specifically, the states contend, the law makes it harder for them to maintain high tax rates to fund government programs, from the New York subway system to public schooling. One way to think about the law, which could yet prove important to the courts, is that it strong-arms liberal states into adopting conservative fiscal policies against their will. In fact, the lawsuit contends, that's exactly what Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration had in mind.\n\nAnother way to think about the new law is that it effectively legalizes taxation of more than 100 percent of income for high earners in high-tax states. If the law were upheld, and, say, California or New York (both states where progressives dominate politics) decided to enact very high income-tax rates for the highest earners - for example, those receiving over $10 million annually - these people could be on the hook for a combined federal and state marginal rate of more than 100 percent. Such a policy would be literally \"confiscatory,\" conservatives' favorite epithet in opposing higher taxes.\n\nAnd this illustrates the rub of the matter: It is - or has been - a basic conservative principle for decades in the United States that confiscatory taxation is anathema. At the same time, conservatives have also traditionally sought to maximize the freedom states have to chart their own course in many realms, very much including taxation.\n\nLiberals, conversely, traditionally express solicitude for progressive taxation, especially for the highest earners. ( Bernie Sanders , for instance, in his 2016 campaign proposed a 52 percent marginal federal income tax rate for those earning $10 million or more.) But liberals have also often sought to constrain the ability of states to place effective limits on federal policy.\n\nThe Republican proposal will not only allow them to pass millions (or billions) to their heirs without inheritance taxes, it will also add another benefit on top of that.\n\nPut another way, if the Constitution forbids a combination of state and local federal tax levies in excess of 100 percent of income - which many conservatives and some liberals would agree it does - it would be the classic conservative position that the burden of this limit must be borne by the federal government, while many liberals might be inclined to limit state power.\n\nShould the case ultimately reach the Supreme Court, the question will be whether conservative jurists take the side of conservative politicians, which would accord with their policy preference for the tax bill, or whether they will hew more closely to their usual judicial principles, at the risk of dealing Republicans a significant policy defeat. (Ruling the limitation on state-tax deductibility unconstitutional would likely not invalidate the tax bill as a whole, but it would blow a much larger hole in the federal budget, which is already running record trillion-dollar deficits.) Those taking a longer view might also worry whether upholding the expansion of effective federal power over state taxation embodied in the new law might, in some future liberal congress, be used to compel states to raise taxes instead of lower them.\n\nLiberals, too, face a difficult moment. Liberal legal scholars, many of them normally sympathetic to high-tax arguments (and many themselves residents of high-tax states), are deeply uncomfortable with both limitations on Congress' 16th Amendment taxing power and with arguments favoring states' rights under the Constitution's 10th Amendment, as are central to the new case. (The 10th Amendment declares that \"the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" It is a favorite subject of academic legal conservatives, and something of a bugaboo for liberals.) This may help explain why the lawsuit has received so little attention in the press, which often relies on these same scholars for constitutional analysis.\n\nOf course, it is possible that politics will trump law, even in the courts. That is essentially what happened in perhaps the most consequential Supreme Court case of recent times, Bush v. Gore , which decided the disputed presidential election of 2000. In that case, in legal terms, the central issue was also one of states' rights, or at least deference to a state's conduct of its own affairs, in particular Florida's approach to counting ballots cast there. One way to read the result in Bush v. Gore is to observe that every single justice on the court voted their politics over their usual judicial principles, with \"conservatives\" adopting the pro-federal government legal position usually favored by liberals while judges named to the bench by Democratic presidents took the opposite view.\n\nFor those who feel certain the states' case on the tax law will be quickly brushed aside, it's worth recalling the legal maneuvering that followed the enactment of Obamacare. For the first 10 months after President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010, the consensus in much of the legal community was that constitutional challenges to the landmark law bordered on frivolous and were going nowhere. Two federal district courts upheld the law, and the legal theory in a third case, where a judge had said the law was unconstitutional, was suspect - and was ultimately rejected by appellate courts.\n\nThen yet another district court opinion came in against the statute, and it was taken much more seriously. For the next 17 months, Obamacare hung by a legal thread, before finally being largely upheld by the Supreme Court by the narrowest of margins, 5-4.\n\nThe result in the challenge to last year's tax law is impossible to predict. But it seems easy to credit the notion that lots of people will find themselves squirming before State of New York v. Mnuchin is concluded.\n\nIan MacDougall contributed to this story.\n\nFiled under:\n\nRichard Tofel\n\nRichard Tofel was the founding general manager of ProPublica from 2007-2012, and served as president from January 2013-September 2021.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "The Man Behind Project 2025's Most Radical Plans\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIn January 2023, a group of about 15 people gathered for three days at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative Washington think tank a few blocks from the Capitol. Their aim was ambitious and farsighted: to start building the next Republican administration, two years before a Republican president might again take office.\n\nThe group's leaders originally cast the initiative as candidate-agnostic, intended to assist the 2024 Republican nominee, whoever that might be. But there was no real doubt who the envisioned beneficiary was. The team included several former members of the Trump administration, and the whole effort was geared to address a perceived shortcoming of that White House: its failure to fill enough key government positions with Trump loyalists. So few had expected Trump to win in 2016 that hiring had been left mostly to GOP veterans, who brought in establishment figures and never managed to fill some slots at all, leaving the president exposed to the bureaucratic resistance that his acolytes believe undermined him at every step: the dreaded \"deep state.\"\n\nThey were determined not to let this happen again. This time, Trump would take office with a fully staffed, carefully selected administration ready to roll. Thus the name of this new effort at Heritage, Project 2025. It would consist of four \"pillars\": an 887-page policy plan , a database of conservatives willing to serve in the administration, training seminars for potential new appointees on the functions of government and a battle plan for each agency.\n\nIn recent months, Project 2025 has gotten attention for some of the more radical proposals in its policy plan - such as reinstating more stringent rules for the use of the abortion pill mifepristone and abolishing some federal agencies. On the campaign trail, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris made the project the centerpiece of their case against a Trump restoration. Their attacks were so effective that Trump has publicly disavowed the effort (while selecting a running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who is closely allied with Heritage).\n\nThis week, as Project 2025 faced denunciations from the Trump campaign, the project's director, Paul Dans, stepped down from his role. Trump's campaign co-managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, said in a statement that \"reports of Project 2025's demise would be greatly welcomed, and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign - it will not end well for you.\" For Dans, it was a sudden end - or at least a pause - in a remarkable ascent from obscurity.\n\nBut then again, his resignation was at least partly symbolic: The work of Project 2025 is largely done. Under Dans, the project has assembled a database of more than 10,000 names - job candidates vetted for loyalty to Trump's cause - who will be ready to deploy into federal agencies should he win the 2024 election. Project 2025 has delivered a toolkit, ready for use, to create a second Trump administration that would be decidedly more MAGA than the first.\n\nThe most important pillar of Project 2025 has always been about personnel, not policy. Or rather, the whole effort is animated by the Reagan-era maxim that personnel is policy, that power flows from having the right people in the right jobs. To that end, the plan's most pertinent proposal is reinstating Schedule F - a provision unveiled near the very end of Trump's term, then repealed by the Biden administration - which would shift as many as 50,000 career employees in policy-shaping positions into a new job category that would make them much easier to fire.\n\nThis was the mission that brought people together at Heritage for those three days, with the task of designing the personnel database that would populate the next administration, all under the supervision of Dans, a tall, broad-shouldered guy with a slow, jut-chinned way of speaking and traces of a Baltimore accent.\n\nNot long ago, Dans, 55, would have seemed an unlikely person for the role. The son of a liberal Johns Hopkins University professor, Dans was a New York lawyer who before Trump's election had never served in government. For years following that election, he had tried and failed to find a place in the administration, seemingly in spite of a celebrity connection: His wife was a fitness coach for Karlie Kloss, the supermodel sister-in-law of Jared Kushner. Finally, in 2019, Dans got in the door, at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nSome four years later, here he was, hoping to build the next administration. Dans envisioned the personnel database that he wanted to create as a \"conservative LinkedIn.\" To help explain it, he displayed sketches he had made. They depicted the online file for a sample applicant - \"Betsy Ross.\" One page would show her occupation, which of the conservative organizations supporting Project 2025 had suggested her and which agencies she was being considered for. Another would show the findings of an internal review of her application, her progress on the training sessions (one of which Dans called \"Deep State 101\") and any \"red flags.\" Yet another would show additional vetting: a \"webcrawl\" report; her performance on the Project 2025 questionnaire, which would ask detailed questions about ideological and policy beliefs; and more. The database would allow administration officials to search for candidates of a certain profile to fit a certain role.\n\nThis was what Dans wanted the Heritage staffers gathered in the room and the tech engineers they'd contracted from Oracle to build: the engine of Trump 2.0. It would be a personnel machine not only far beyond what the first Trump administration had at its disposal, but beyond what any other administration had enjoyed, either. According to one person in attendance, the database would take several months to build and would cost upward of $2 million. It would reach outside the usual channels to draw in MAGA believers from across the country. And Dans was at the helm. \"There was no one who had a better idea of it than he did,\" the person in attendance told me. \"He was driving the whole thing.\"\n\nAs the database development progressed in the months that followed, Dans stressed a detail that made it even more far-reaching. He did not want the positions being filled to be limited to the 4,000 or so slots that are reserved for political appointments. He also wanted it to suggest people for roles that are currently assigned to career employees, in keeping with the plans for Schedule F.\n\nPropelling the project has been a worldview that can be easily overlooked amid Trump's talk about restoring the halcyon days of his first term. The people preparing for his return to the White House emphatically do not view his first term as a success. Rather, they view it as a missed opportunity to implement the MAGA vision. For Dans, Trump's first term was an object lesson in how difficult it could be to reach Trump's goals without a captive bureaucracy.\n\nThe former president's supporters are determined that a second Trump administration would be much more organized than the first, stocked with foot soldiers who are both loyal and capable of moving policy forward. Dans declined to be interviewed for this article or to respond on the record to a detailed list of questions, but he has been laying out his thinking in interviews with conservative media outlets. \"We're going to get this done right on the next go-round,\" he told Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, on her podcast last winter. And in essence, that will mean cleaning house, he said. \"If a person can't get in and fire people right away, what good is political management?\"\n\nPaul Dans was raised, in the 1970s and '80s, in a family that embodied liberal idealism. Peter Dans was a professor of medicine who had enlisted in the Public Health Service; started an STD clinic and a migrant health clinic while on faculty at the University of Colorado; and served in the office of Sen. Gaylord Nelson, the Wisconsin Democrat who founded Earth Day. Paul's mom, Colette Lizotte, was a French teacher who had previously worked as a chemist at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe family lived in a hilly, verdant stretch north of Baltimore. Paul and his twin brother, Tom, hung out with the other smart kids at Dulaney High School; they played sports and were on the debate team. \"Both were very bright kids, very well behaved,\" recalled Phil Sporer, who attended school with them from early on. \"The Dans boys were everybody's perfect child.\"\n\nThe first hints of Dans' political orientation emerged in college. He went to MIT, where he majored in economics, joined a frat, played on the lacrosse team and, as classmate Juan Latasa told me, stood apart from the \"political correctness\" that was rising at elite campuses around 1990. \"It wasn't always easy for such students. It was a very liberal place,\" Latasa said. \"It was tough.\"\n\nDans stayed on at MIT to get his master's in city planning. His thesis on the redevelopment of industrial parks, like the Brooklyn Navy Yard, showed him still wrestling with competing impulses. There was Reagan-style optimism: \"The myriad crises which America must grapple with in coming years pale in magnitude to the nation's gifted legacy.\" But there was also a hint of resigned declinism, with Dans addressing an \"age of diminished expectations.\"\n\nAt the University of Virginia School of Law, which Dans attended next, his transformation became explicit: He joined the campus branch of the Federalist Society, the conservative network founded by law students at Yale and the University of Chicago in the 1980s, and he rose to become chapter president. \"I was always attracted with the Federalist Society message about how some daring students stood up at Yale Law School and challenged the hegemony there and really was trying to speak truth to power,\" he told hosts Saurabh Sharma and Nick Solheim last year on \"Moment of Truth,\" a podcast produced by American Moment, a conservative organization now aligned with Project 2025.\n\nStill, Dans left little mark on his law school classmates, perhaps partly because he took a year off to study in Paris. I reached out to a couple dozen of his peers, and an email from a lawyer in Dallas was representative: \"I wish I could help but I do not remember any details about Paul Dans.\"\n\nDans' fixation on the federal bureaucracy began at home. The idealism of the 1960s brought his parents to Washington, where they met while working at the National Institutes of Health. \"They had basically come up through the JFK, Kennedy-esque, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country'\" era, he told Sharma and Solheim.\n\nDans didn't seriously consider following his parents into public service - law school debt precluded that option, he said - but he would ultimately become wrapped up in a debate that had first inspired them. They went to Washington during the federal government's great post-World War II expansion, when the ranks of career employees began swelling and when more job protections started accruing to them, sparking a decadeslong argument that has carried on to this day. To federal employee unions and other defenders of the bureaucracy, such protections were in the spirit of the Pendleton Act, the 1883 law that created the modern federal workforce, along with mechanisms for employment based on merit. But to many conservative critics, and some good-government liberals, the job protections that federal workers gained in the 1960s undermined the \"merit based\" nature of the civil service by making it difficult to remove ineffectual workers.\n\nAfter law school, Dans chose a different meritocracy, joining a wave of young attorneys in the New York corporate legal world in the late '90s. But Dans stood out. He was much more conservative than most of his colleagues. He prided himself on being one of very few in his Upper West Side building to get the New York Post. He admired Donald Trump for bringing a \"can-do spirit back ... building on the skyline again.\"\n\nSome colleagues kept their distance, but not Julio Ramos, a fellow junior associate at the law firm LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae. Dans kidded Ramos about his lefty politics and regaled him with talk of supply-side economics and Reagan. It was all very civil. \"Even though he was from the right,\" Ramos told me, \"he didn't have any hatred toward the left.\"\n\nDans left after three years to become an associate at another large firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, and after two years there eventually landed at a less prestigious firm, where his cases included a lawsuit between Yves Saint Laurent's beauty line and Costco over perfume labeling. By 2009, having not made partner anywhere, and two years into his marriage to Mary Helen Bowers, a former New York City Ballet dancer, Dans went into solo practice.\n\nDans has criticized the legal field for what he perceives to be anti-conservative discrimination. \"We are, as a profession, really getting snowed under right now,\" he said on the \"Moment of Truth\" podcast. \"Republicans and conservatives have not stood up in the face of, kind of, cancel culture, and [these] Marxist, Saul Alinsky attacks.\"\n\nEven the moment he has often framed as his biggest triumph affirmed Dans' alienation from liberal lawyers. In 2009, he was one of hundreds of attorneys hired to defend Chevron and its employees against a multibillion-dollar lawsuit for oil pollution in Ecuador. According to the journalist Michael Goldhaber, Dans was hired at $100 an hour - less than 5% of the top rate at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which was leading Chevron's defense.\n\nAs Dans later told Goldhaber, he had an epiphany: While watching the documentary film \"Crude,\" an exposé of Chevron in Ecuador that was done in collaboration with the plaintiffs' lead lawyer on the case, Steven Donziger, Dans realized that the outtakes from the film should be subpoenaed, to see if the filmmaker captured any legal malfeasance by Donziger. Dans put the suggestion in a memo.\n\nAs it turned out, the subpoenaed outtakes did prove to be damning. Chevron sued Donziger in U.S. federal court, ultimately resulting in a ruling that the company did not have to pay the $9.5 billion judgment. Dans took full credit: \"I came up with a theory that we could get documentary film outtakes, basically caught them doing their nefarious acts on video,\" he told Martin on her podcast.\n\nAccording to other lawyers on the case, the story is more complicated: Although Dans wrote a memo suggesting the outtakes be targeted, others started the push for subpoenas - and came up with the necessary legal basis for seeking the crucial outtakes - independently of Dans raising the idea.\n\nWhen the Chevron case was over, Dans was back on his own, handling motley litigation, including a patent fight between two manufacturers of sheet-pile wall systems and a class action against Frito-Lay regarding its claims that some of its products were made with all-natural ingredients. The address for Dans' solo practice was a mail drop at the New York City Bar Association.\n\nToward the end of the aughts, as President Barack Obama's first term wore on, Dans' conservatism began to take on a new shape. He spent a lot of time online. \"I'm one of the people sitting at his kitchen counter, you know, on the bench there, on the stool kind of going, How can that be? That's crazy,\" he told Martin. \"You're clicking ... you know, refreshing the Drudge Report like 100 times a day.\"\n\nOne thing he clicked on was Trump's conspiracist claims about Obama's origins: \"I had some serious academic questioning about the birthplace of a former president, if you will,\" he told Sharma and Solheim. Dans got excited when rumors spread in 2011 that Trump would be going to New Hampshire to announce a run for president. Alas, it didn't happen.\n\nEarly in the 2016 primary season, Dans attended a dinner of the steering committee for the New York City Lawyers Chapter of the Federalist Society. As he later recalled to Sharma and Solheim, someone asked whom people were supporting for president, and around the table it went: \"I like Jeb.\" \"I like Marco.\" \"I like Jeb.\"\n\nDans watched in bewilderment. Here were all these New York Republicans, and no one had yet mentioned the man who lived a few blocks away, who had decided to run for president this time. Finally, it was Dans' turn. \"Well, I like Trump, and I think he's going to win,\" he later told Sharma and Solheim. \"I like him because I'm sick of losing.\"\n\nThat fall, Dans headed to the Pittsburgh area to volunteer for Trump. He had worked on other campaigns, but none had ever felt like this. \"There was no passion,\" he told Sharma and Solheim. \"We were hungry for a candidate who could really speak to Americans. ... Donald Trump delivered.\"\n\nTrump's appeal to Dans verged on the tribal: He came to see himself as \"a pure-blooded deplorable mix,\" as he told Sharma and Solheim, citing the working-class, ethnic Catholic roots of his ancestors - his paternal grandfather was born to Spanish immigrant parents and had been a merchant mariner, and his mother hailed from French Canadian mill workers in Rhode Island. Never mind that his father was a medical professor who had raised Dans in an affluent suburb.\n\nWhen Trump won, Dans eagerly sent off his resume. \"Next stop, you know, Department of Justice, right?\" he said to Martin years later, recalling his confidence. But no. As he also told Sharma and Solheim, the response was \"crickets.\"\n\nHis explanation? He was too MAGA. \"There were so many people getting sandbagged because somebody thought that they were too 'America First'-y or too Trumpist,\" he told Martin. He was advised to instead slip in \"under the radar\" as \"just your milquetoast Republican appointee.\" Watching his accounts of this disappointment, it's hard not to feel some sympathy for Dans, whose affect in interviews can come off as both genial and awkward, like the chatty, perhaps too chatty, guy at the airport bar.\n\nFinally, late in 2018, Dans came to Washington for a Federalist Society meeting and connected with James Bacon, a college student who was working as confidential assistant to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. With Bacon's help, and with the benefit of his master's in city planning, Dans finally broke in, in July 2019, as a senior adviser in HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development.\n\nCareer staff at HUD didn't know what to make of Dans. \"We tried to figure out what his role was,\" one of them told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \"He kind of wandered in,\" the career employee said. \"He was fairly disdainful of the career staff and did not have a lot of respect for why things were the way they were.\" For Dans, his arrival was a \"real baptism\" in how the government actually works. \"You don't realize that the federal government is just an avalanche of money shooting out of various agencies,\" he told Sharma and Solheim. \"It's trying to tame this spew of money and direct in the right way, is what you're doing when you get to an agency.\"\n\nAs Dans saw it, the career employees were the problem. They were biased against conservatives, and they disregarded changes sought by the duly elected administration. Dans also blamed fellow appointees, too many of whom were clueless about the actual work and thus willing to cede decision-making to career employees. \"You came and you went to cocktail parties, and you had your birthday cakes around the office and, you know, maybe a couple of ribbon cuttings, and you got to go on a little international junket,\" he told Sharma and Solheim. \"And meanwhile, everything else is kind of going at the same level.\"\n\nBy late 2019, the White House was coming to share Dans' diagnosis. James Sherk, then a special assistant on the Domestic Policy Council, began compiling purported examples of what they viewed as deep-state obstinacy that Trump should have been able to discipline with dismissals, including anonymous reports about Environmental Protection Agency employees withholding information about legal cases from political appointees and about Department of Justice lawyers refusing to investigate discrimination against Asian Americans at Yale.\n\nThe ultimate example of perceived perfidy came in December 2019, when the House used the testimony of federal employees to approve two articles of impeachment against Trump: for using the levers of powers to pressure Ukraine into discrediting Biden and for obstructing Congress. This gave Trump and his remaining White House coterie new resolve to take more control of hiring.\n\nTrump turned the Presidential Personnel Office over to John McEntee, his 29-year-old former personal assistant who had left the White House in 2018 after a background check found that he posed a security risk due to his frequent gambling. (McEntee, now an adviser for Project 2025, has declined to comment about the background check in the past.) McEntee recruited Bacon, the college student, to assist him in overhauling personnel, and, looking for someone to join in the effort, they settled on Paul Dans. The person who had barely made it into the administration had impressed them with his critiques of the status quo.\n\nIn February 2020, the White House installed Dans at Office of Personnel Management as \"White House liaison and senior adviser to the director\" - its eyes and ears there.\n\nDans, encouraged by McEntee, wasted no time. He quickly ordered the removal of the agency's chief of staff, Jonathan Blyth, and asserted so much authority across the agency that its director, Dale Cabaniss, who had spent years as a Republican staff member in the Senate, decided to leave as well. Cabaniss was replaced by an interim director, Michael Rigas, but people at the agency told me that Dans was the de facto director for the remainder of the year; late in 2020, he was named chief of staff. (Rigas and Blyth did not respond to requests for comment; Cabaniss declined to comment on the record.) So total was the takeover of the personnel process that Dans' colleagues took to referring to him, McEntee and their allies as \"the coup group.\"\n\nOne of Dans' first assertions of authority came at a senior staff meeting after Cabaniss' departure, amid the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. According to another Trump appointee, some 20 people were present in the conference room at OPM's headquarters near the National Mall when the agency's then-chief information officer, Clare Martorana, said that, like most other agencies, it would use Zoom for online meetings.\n\nDans erupted, declaring that Zoom, which was founded by a Chinese immigrant to the U.S., posed the risk of spying by China. Martorana took in his outburst with \"a combination of anger, amusement and just dumbstruck awe,\" the Trump appointee recalled. She then tried to explain that Zoom was on the government's approved list of vendors and that many other agencies were using it. This did not mollify Dans.\n\nAs 2020 went on, Dans' colleagues became accustomed to his insistent demands, which, coupled with his large frame, could make him an intimidating presence. Dans wanted to hire as many appointees as possible in the final year of Trump's term in office, and he wanted the agency's processes to move faster. \"He would just throw bombs into senior staff meetings,\" said the appointee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, \"and they would say: 'What are we supposed to do with this? He can't be serious with this.'\"\n\nIn October 2020, less than two weeks before the election, Trump signed an executive order creating Schedule F, the new category of career employees in key positions who would now be easier to remove.\n\nOver at OPM, Dans was busy with a related effort, seeking to recategorize positions in the Senior Executive Service - higher-ranking managerial slots across the government that are mostly filled with career employees - into a general category that would allow the president to appoint more of them. He was also engaged in another aspect of the administration's new emphasis on personnel: making sure that OPM appointees answered long ideological questionnaires and met for interviews with staffers to assess their fitness for staying on in a second Trump term.\n\nThose who dealt with Dans at OPM told me that they tried to respond to his demands as best they could, but that he often grew agitated when told that OPM did not have the ability to do what he wanted. He seemed to take such explanations as a personal affront. \"He questioned everything from the point of view that there was a conspiracy against him and the president,\" the appointee said.\n\nColleagues chalked up his outbursts to insecurity born of his not understanding how the government worked and being broadly out of his depth. \"He reminded me of some of the people who show up at Republican conventions,\" said a second Republican appointee at the agency, who, like the first, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \"Those people usually show up and then go home. They show up and are vocal, but they're not like, 'Now I'm going to go do the boring work of the sausage-making of government.'\"\n\nDonald Devine, who led OPM during the Reagan administration and whom the Trump administration had brought on as an adviser during this period, scoffs at such critiques. \"If you do anything, people aren't going to like it, and that's why he's so different,\" Devine told me. \"Most of the other people in the executive office of OPM weren't doing much, so people didn't care about them. He's a serious person trying to do a serious job. You don't see a lot of that, and that's why I like him so much.\"\n\nDans' only problem, Devine said, was that he ran out of time. \"The major things were going to be done the next term,\" he said. \"It was too late to do anything before they figured out how to run personnel.\"\n\nAfter the election, Dans stayed hard at work at OPM, even as other appointees started to vanish in the final weeks of the Trump administration. Since then, Dans has criticized prosecutions of those involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. \"The unfortunate thing is it does send a message to people that you shouldn't criticize the government,\" he said in a C-SPAN interview last year.\n\nA year and a half after arriving in Washington, Dans left for his new home in South Carolina, near his wife's hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina, while she was expecting their fourth child. \"I went home kind of in this Cincinnatus sort of spirit: return to the farm. Our farm being in Fort Mill, South Carolina, in a subdivision,\" he quipped to Sharma and Solheim.\n\nBut then he turned serious: \"We're 'God, country and family.' And now is the time to go put a little more emphasis on the God and family part of that. But we'll be back for the country thing.\"\n\nWith the 2024 election approaching, with Trump leading Biden and then Harris in most national polls and with Dans' vision of reshaping the bureaucracy heavily influencing the Trump campaign, it finally seemed like Dans' moment might actually be arriving. On Tuesday's episode of the \"War Room\" podcast - founded by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who is now in prison - Dans sometimes sounded triumphant. \"In order to take this back, the swamp isn't going to drain itself,\" he said. \"We need outsiders coming in committed to doing this. ... With Project 2025, we built a pathway to encourage folks to do this.\"\n\nBut in that same \"War Room\" episode on Tuesday, Dans decried the \"great disinformation campaign\" underway against Project 2025, \"almost a hoax.\" He listed some of the mistruths that Democrats had voiced about the project's proposals, including a claim by Harris that it would eliminate Social Security. \"Just completely fallacious stuff,\" he said. \"It's just one big bald-faced lie.\"\n\nIt was plain that he was taking the attacks very personally, and with good reason. The Democrats' campaign to turn Project 2025 into an albatross around Trump's neck was succeeding, to the point where some sort of dramatic break was needed. Just hours after that episode aired came word that Dans would be stepping down. \"We are extremely grateful for [Dans'] and everyone's work on Project 2025 and dedication to saving America,\" Heritage President Kevin Roberts said.\n\nIn a note to Heritage staff, obtained by The Wall Street Journal , Dans himself suggested that his mission was, essentially, complete. \"The work of this project was due to wrap up with the nominating conventions of the political parties,\" he wrote. \"Our work is presently winding down, and I plan later in August to leave Heritage.\"\n\nIt was face-saving, but it was also largely true. The database was built; the training seminars had been taught. This time, the foot soldiers were ready to go, just waiting to be called on. \"From the president's lips to God's ears that change is going to happen? It really happens below\" the president, Dans said on \"War Room.\" \"That's the importance of recognizing: Personnel is really the cornerstone of the change.\"\n\nDisavowals or not, the logic of Project 2025 is embedded in the DNA of Trump's plan to overhaul the government. Reinstating Schedule F is still a top-level agenda item. Jacqueline Simon, the public policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, told me that the agencies could end up defining the new employment category so broadly that it could encompass far more than 50,000 positions. \"It will be a purge,\" she said.\n\nDonald Moynihan, a public policy professor at Georgetown University, does not expect Trump to fire tens of thousands. Jettisoning just a couple of thousand, to make an example of them, may be enough. \"They can fire 1,000 and put their heads on pikes, and then everyone else quickly falls into line,\" he told me. \"That way you have a terrified bureaucracy that still has institutional knowledge. That's the more strategic way to use Schedule F, to scare the bejesus out of 49,000 people and force them into line.\" Sherk, the author of Schedule F , suggested as much to me. \"The notion we're going to can 50,000 people is just insane,\" he said. \"Why would you do that? That would kneecap the ability to implement your agenda. You use it to go after bad actors and rank incompetents.\"\n\nThat would still leave the challenge of finding people to fill the 4,000 slots for appointees and however many hundreds or thousands of openings are created by firings. Many Republicans who served in the first Trump administration are leery of serving in a second. \"The last administration was a joke, and they had a real problem recruiting,\" a Washington attorney who served in the George W. Bush administration, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution against his firm, told me. \"Who the hell would jump into this clown car driving toward a cliff? Are people going to come forward, quality people? Not a fucking chance.\"\n\nThis was precisely Dans' mission with Project 2025: to find a whole new corps of people willing to come to the capital and do the work of implementing the Trump agenda that the usual D.C. fixtures refuse to do. How many will be suited to the task? \"We have to recruit the talent to get to Washington,\" Dans told Martin. \"Ultimately, what Project 2025 is is a call to action for patriots to come serve in Washington.\"\n\nWill Dans himself be among that number? As Devine sees it, Dans' current defenestration is political, and temporary. \"Paul is too bright and intelligent not to,\" he said. \"They'll pick him up somewhere.\" Devine said that he's spoken with Dans since his decision to resign. \"He's doing well,\" Devine said. \"He's ready to go on to fight. The memorandum he sent [to Heritage colleagues] ends with that: 'Fight! Fight! Fight!'\" Dans still sees himself as a field general for a new class of Trump bureaucrats, one that will come to power if Trump wins, whether the effort is called Project 2025 or not.\n\nRead More\n\nThere is a paradox at the core of this. Dans was never looking for the proverbial farmers with pitchforks, because he is aware of how complex the work of the federal government is. Dans was looking for people who are both angry enough about the state of the country to want to commit four years to serving Donald Trump in Washington to fix it, and yet sufficiently versed in the mechanisms of government to be able to restrain it. \"We need many more eyes and ears, many more technicians on the ground,\" he told Sharma and Solheim.\n\nIt is idealistic, in its way, the conception of an aggrieved, underappreciated elite that is ready to be summoned to Washington. It sounds a lot like, well, Paul Dans. The question is, how many others like him have been out there all along, just waiting for this?\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?

It seems likely that they will eke out at most a narrow majority in the Senate, but will fail to pick up the 30 seats they need to reclaim the House. If they do manage to win a Senate majority, it will be exceedingly difficult to hold it past 2018, when 25 of the party's seats must be defended, compared with eight Republican ones.\n\nThe Republican Party may seem in historic disarray, but it will most likely be able to continue to stymie the Democrats' legislative agenda, perpetuating Washington's gridlock for years to come.\n\nLiberals have a simple explanation for this state of affairs: Republican-led gerrymandering, which has put Democrats at a disadvantage in the House and in many state legislatures. But this overlooks an even bigger problem for their party. More than ever, Democrats are sorting themselves into geographic clusters where many of their votes have been rendered all but superfluous, especially in elections for the Senate, House and state government.\n\nThis has long been a problem for the party, but it has grown worse in recent years. The clustering has economic and demographic roots, but also a basic cultural element: Democrats just don't want to live where they'd need to live to turn more of the map blue.\n\nAmericans' tendency toward political self-segregation has been underway for a while now - it's been eight years since Bill Bishop identified the dynamic in \" The Big Sort .\" This helps explain why red-blue maps of so many states consist of dark-blue islands in the cities surrounded by red exurbs and rural areas, a distribution that is also driven by urban concentrations of racial minorities and by the decades-long shift in allegiance from Democratic to Republican among working-class white voters.\n\nThat hyper-concentration of Democratic votes has long hurt the party in the House and state legislatures. In Ohio, for instance, Republicans won 75 percent of the United States House seats in 2012 despite winning only 51 percent of the total votes for the House. That imbalance can be explained partly by Republican gerrymandering. But even if district lines were drawn in rational, nonpartisan ways, a disproportionate share of Democratic votes would still be clustered in urban districts , giving Republicans a larger share of seats than their share of the overall vote. Winning back control of state legislatures in Pennsylvania and Michigan could help Democrats in redistricting in 2020. But it would help more if their voters were not so concentrated in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Detroit and Ann Arbor.\n\n\"It would be awfully difficult to construct a map that wasn't leaning Republican,\" said the University of Michigan political scientist Jowei Chen. \"Geography is just very unfortunate from the perspective of the Democrats.\"\n\nMore recently, a confluence of several trends has conspired to make the sorting disadvantageous for Democrats on an even broader scale - increasing the party's difficulties in House races while also affecting Senate elections and, potentially, future races for the presidency.\n\nFirst, geographic mobility in the United States has become very class-dependent. Once upon a time, lower-income people were willing to pull up stakes and move to places with greater opportunity - think of the people who fled the Dust Bowl for California in the 1930s, or those who took the \"Hillbilly Highway\" out of Appalachia to work in Midwestern factories, or Southern blacks on the Great Migration. In recent decades, though, internal migration has slowed sharply , and the people who are most likely to move for better opportunities are the highly educated .\n\nSecond, higher levels of education are increasingly correlated with voting Democratic. This has been most starkly on display in the 2016 election, as polls suggest that Donald J. Trump may be the first Republican in 60 years to not win a majority of white voters with college degrees, even as he holds his own among white voters without degrees. But the trend of increasing Democratic identification among college graduates, and increasing Republican identification among non-graduates, was underway before Trump arrived on the scene. Today, Democrats hold a 12-point edge in party identification among those with a college degree or more. In 2004, the parties were even on that score.\n\nFinally, in the United States the economic gap between the wealthiest cities and the rest of the country has grown considerably . The internet was supposed to allow wealth to spread out, since we could be connected anywhere - but the opposite has happened. Per capita income in the District of Columbia has gone from 29 percent above the United States average in 1980 to 68 percent in 2013; in the Bay Area, from 50 percent above to 88 percent; in New York City, from 80 percent above to 172 percent. Cities like New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Boston, exert a strong pull on mobile, highly educated, Democratic-leaning voters, while at the same time stirring resentment in the less prosperous areas those voters leave behind. And these economically dominant cities tend to be in deep-blue states.\n\nHow extreme is Democratic clustering? If you compare President Obama's 2012 performance with Al Gore's in 2000, you can see a huge increase in the Democratic percentage of the vote in the 68 largest metro areas. But it barely budged everywhere else . Some of that increase was caused by voters already in those cities flipping from Republican to Democratic. But it was also the gravitational effect.\n\nThis clustering of Democrats helps explain why Trump has been keeping it close in Ohio and Iowa, both states where some 72 percent of white residents over 24 lack college degrees, the highest share among the 13 most competitive states.\n\nIt works the other way in presidential elections, too. Democrats have gained in some other swing states with high levels of college-educated voters, like Virginia and Colorado, and they do at least reap a benefit in the Electoral College for having a lock on big states such as New York and California.\n\nBut it's another story in the Senate, where this dynamic helps explain why the Democrats are perpetually struggling to hold a majority. The Democrats have long been at a disadvantage in the Senate , where the populous, urbanized states where Democrats prevail get the same two seats as the rural states where Republicans are stronger. The 20 states where Republicans hold both Senate seats have, on average, 5.2 million people each; the 16 states where the Democrats hold both seats average 7.9 million people. Put another way, winning Senate elections in states with a total of 126 million people has netted the Democrats eight fewer seats than the Republicans get from winning states with 104 million people.\n\nClustering is part of the problem. All those Democrats gravitating to blue strongholds like New York and California get the party no more Senate seats than Republicans get from Idaho and from Wyoming, a state with a population of about 580,000, slightly more than Fresno, Calif. If the Democrats are going to gain a lasting hold on the Senate, they have to win seats in swing states. But that gets harder the more that Democratic-leaning voters flock to big, blue states, abandoning swing states like Ohio, where the Republican Rob Portman is gliding to re-election, or smaller red states where Democrats might still have a shot at holding Senate seats, like Montana, Indiana or North Dakota.\n\nJenn Topper has thought about this dynamic a lot, because she's a clear example of it. Topper, 31, grew up in Beavercreek, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton, a city that has lost nearly half its population since 1960. She left for college at Florida State, then for a public relations job in New York, then for a political communications job in Washington.\n\n\"When you grow up in Ohio, there's a bigger world out there, and if you know about it, you just want to go to it,\" she said.\n\nA couple years ago, Topper and some colleagues who were also from Ohio were excited to meet \"their\" Democratic senator, Sherrod Brown, at an event. He asked them where they lived in Ohio. But they don't live in Ohio - and won't be able to vote for him in what is sure to be a tough race in 2018.\n\nTopper's high school classmate Brett Stelter, 31, left Dayton after attending Ohio University. His father was a district parts manager for Honda, which has a plant near Dayton, and Stelter himself did part-time work at the plant. But his dream was to be an actor, and so he ended up in Los Angeles.\n\n\"There's just nothing to do in Ohio,\" he said. \"The jobs are limited, but it's not just the jobs and the industries that are in Ohio, it's the mind-set that I didn't gravitate to.\"\n\nStelter, who voted twice for Obama, is disappointed that his vote is superfluous in California, and tries to make up for it by engaging on social media with people back home - people like his father, who is leaning toward Trump. \"Part of me wishes I could be there to personally talk to people instead of trolling them on the internet,\" he said. But his political irrelevance is not enough to make him consider moving back. \"Going back to Ohio to be able to vote every four years is not enough for me.\"\n\nThis clustering is happening even as many smaller cities and outlying regions are experiencing mini-cultural renaissances. For one thing, a foodie or beer snob now has much less to complain about when contemplating dining outside a big coastal city. And most of these places are much more affordable than Brooklyn or Los Angeles. But they can't seem to compare with the profusion of cool elsewhere.\n\nEven cities making comebacks, with restored downtown buildings and plenty of locally brewed I.P.A., have the memory problem. If a city was on the ropes when young people left it, it's frozen in that form in their image of it. \"You're competing with memory,\" Topper said. \"People look back and remember what it was like when they were there. You don't often hear about how things are moving or growing or new things are happening. That picture of when you have left is all you have.\"\n\nOf course, some people do go back. Brittney Vosters, 30, who went to high school and college in Dayton, left for several years, living in Chicago and enrolling in graduate school in public administration at Rutgers in New Jersey. She recently moved back to Cincinnati so her husband could go to graduate school in northern Kentucky. It has struck her how much her former Dayton classmates have sorted out politically. \"It's noticeable that the people who left are more liberal-minded and the people who stayed are more Republican,\" she said.\n\nAnd this sorting out is self-perpetuating, too. The fewer people you encounter of the opposite political persuasion, the more they become an unfathomable other, easily caricatured and impossible to find even occasional common ground with. By segregating themselves in narrow slices of the country, Democrats have also made it harder to make their own case. They are forever preaching to the converted, while their social distance also leaves them unprepared for what's coming from the other end of the spectrum. Changing that would mean adopting a broader notion of what it means to live in a happening place, and also exposing themselves to discomforts that most people naturally avoid, given the human tendency to seek out our own kind.\n\nVosters, for one, appreciates that her vote counts a lot more now in Ohio than it did when she was in New Jersey and Illinois. But she has no doubt where she'd like to end up for good. For her next move, she said, \"I'd look at the political map and go toward the blue, because it's more comfortable to be around people who are like you.\"\n\nAlec MacGillis\n\nI have been reporting for ProPublica since 2015, most recently covering the post-pandemic schools crisis.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

What's more, Cowles said, there's been little discussion of major issues. The candidates debated only once.\n\n\"I definitely think that that piece of legislation made things worse,\" Cowles said in an interview. \"Our public discourse is basically who can inflame things in the most clever way with some terrible TV ad that's probably not even true.\"\n\nMore than $80 million has been funneled into the race as of March 25, according to two groups that have been tracking spending in the contest - the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy group that follows judicial races, and the news outlet WisPolitics. That surpasses the previous costliest judicial race in the country's history, approximately $56 million spent two years ago on the Supreme Court race in Wisconsin.\n\nMoney is pouring into this swing state election so fast and so many ads have been reserved that political observers now believe the current race is likely to reach $100 million by Tuesday, which is election day.\n\n\"People are thoroughly disgusted, I think, across the political spectrum with just the sheer amount of money being spent on a spring Supreme Court election in Wisconsin,\" said Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin, which has long advocated for campaign finance reform.\n\nBut the elected officials who could revamp the campaign finance system on both sides of the aisle or create pressure for change have been largely silent. No bills introduced this session. No press conferences from legislators. The Senate no longer even has a designated elections committee.\n\nThe current election pits former Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel, now a circuit court judge in conservative-leaning Waukesha County, against Susan Crawford, a judge in Dane County, the state's liberal bastion.\n\nThough the race technically is nonpartisan, the Democratic Party, including former President Barack Obama, has endorsed Crawford; the party has received financial support from liberal billionaire George Soros. On the other side, President Donald Trump posted a message on his social media platform on March 21 urging his supporters to vote for Schimel, and much of Schimel's money comes from political organizations tied to Elon Musk.\n\nThe stakes are high. Whoever wins will determine the ideological bent of the seven-member court just two years after Janet Protasiewicz won a seat on the court and swung it to the liberals. With Protasiewicz on the court, the majority struck down state legislative maps, which had been drawn to favor Republicans, and reinstated the use of drop boxes to collect absentee ballots.\n\nA Schimel victory could resurrect those and other voting issues, as well as determine whether women in the state will continue to be able to access abortion.\n\nTwo pro-Schimel groups linked to Musk - America PAC and Building America's Future - had disclosed spending about $17 million, as of March 25. Musk himself donated $3 million this year to the Republican Party of Wisconsin. In the final stretch of the campaign, news reports revealed that Musk's America PAC plans to give Wisconsin voters $100 to sign petitions rejecting the actions of \"activist judges.\"\n\nThat has raised concerns among some election watchdog groups, which have been exploring whether the offer from Musk amounts to an illegal inducement to get people to vote.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Musk went further, announcing on X a $1 million award to a Green Bay voter he identified only as \"Scott A\" for \"supporting our petition against activist judges in Wisconsin!\" Musk promised to hand out other million-dollar prizes before the election.\n\nMusk has a personal interest in the direction of the Wisconsin courts. His electric car company, Tesla Inc., is suing the state over a law requiring manufacturers to sell automobiles through independent dealerships. Musk and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment about his involvement in the race.\n\nAlso on Schimel's side: billionaires Diane Hendricks and Richard Uihlein and Americans for Prosperity, a dark-money group founded by billionaire Charles Koch and his late brother David. Americans for Prosperity has reported spending about $3 million, primarily for digital ads, canvassing, mailers and door hangers.\n\nA Better Wisconsin Together Political Fund, a union-supported electioneering group , has ponied up over $6 million to advance Crawford. In other big outlays, Soros has given $2 million to the state Democratic Party, while Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, another billionaire, gave $1.5 million. And California venture capitalist Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, donated $250,000.\n\nIn Wisconsin, political parties can steer unlimited amounts to candidates.\n\nState Sen. Jeff Smith, a Democrat and a minority leader, called the spending frenzy \"obscene.\"\n\n\"There's no reason why campaigns should cost as much as they do,\" he said.\n\nAsked for comment about the vast amount of money in the race, Crawford told ProPublica: \"I'm grateful for the historic outpouring of grassroots support across Wisconsin from folks who don't want Elon Musk controlling our Supreme Court.\"\n\nSchimel's campaign called Crawford a \"hypocrite,\" saying she \"is playing the victim while receiving more money than any judicial candidate in American history thanks to George Soros, Reid Hoffman, and JB Pritzker funneling money to her campaign.\"\n\nQuizzed Monday by a TV reporter on whether he would recuse himself if the Tesla case got to the state's high court, Schimel did not commit, saying: \"I'll do the same thing I do in every case. I will examine whether I can truly hear that case objectively.\"\n\nA decade after Wisconsin opened the floodgates to unlimited money in campaigns in 2015, some good government activists are wondering if the state has reached a tipping point. Is there any amount, they ask, at which the state's political leaders can be persuaded to impose controls?\n\n\"I honestly believe that folks have their eyes open around the money in a way that they have not previously,\" Nick Ramos, executive director of the nonpartisan Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks campaign spending, told reporters during a briefing on spending in the race.\n\nA loosely organized group of campaign reformers is beginning to lay the groundwork for change. The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign recently called a Zoom meeting that included representatives of public interest groups inside and outside of Wisconsin, dark-money researchers and an election security expert.\n\nThey were looking for ways to champion reform during the current legislative session. In particular, they are studying and considering what models make sense and may be achievable, including greater disclosure requirements, public financing and restricting candidates from coordinating with dark-money groups on issue ads.\n\nBut Republicans say that the spending is a natural byproduct of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which equated campaign spending with free speech and opened the spigots for big-money races.\n\n\"For the most part, we don't really, as Republicans, want to see the brakes on free speech,\" said Ken Brown, past chair of the GOP Party of Racine, a city south of Milwaukee. Noting he was not speaking for the party, Brown said he does not favor spending limits. \"I believe in the First Amendment. It is what it is. I believe the Citizens United decision was correct.\"\n\nAsked to comment on the current system of unlimited money, Anika Rickard, a spokesperson for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, did not answer the question but instead criticized Crawford and her funders.\n\nAt one point, Wisconsin was seen as providing a roadmap for reform. In 2009, the state passed the Impartial Justice Act. The legislation, enacted with bipartisan support, provided for public financing of state Supreme Court races, so candidates could run without turning to special interests for money.\n\nThe push for the measure came after increased spending by outside special interests and the candidates in two state Supreme Court races: the 2007 election that cost an e stimated $5.8 million and the 2008 contest that neared $6 million , according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign.\n\nCandidates who agreed in 2009 to public financing and spending limits received grants of up to $400,000 for the race. The money came from the Democracy Trust Fund, which was supported by a $2 income tax check-off.\n\n\"Reformers win a fight to clean up court races,\" the headline on an editorial in The Capital Times read at the time.\n\nBut the law was in place for only one election, in April 2011. Both candidates in the court's general election that year agreed to take public funding, and incumbent Justice David Prosser, a conservative, narrowly won reelection. Then Republicans eliminated funding for the measure that summer. Instead, the money was earmarked to implement a stringent voter ID law.\n\nBy 2015, GOP leaders had completely overhauled the state's campaign finance law, with Democrats in the Assembly refusing to even vote on the measure in protest.\n\n\"This Republican bill opens the floodgates to unlimited spending by billionaires, by big corporations and by monied, special interests to influence our elections,\" Rep. Lisa Subeck, a Democrat, said in the floor debate.\n\nWisconsin is no longer cited as a model. Activists point to other states, including Arizona, Oregon and Rhode Island. Arizona and Oregon established disclosure measures to trace the flow of dark money, requiring campaign spenders to reveal the original source of donations. Rhode Island required ads to name not only the sponsor but the organization's top donors so voters can better assess the message and its credibility.\n\nAmid skepticism that Wisconsin will rein in campaign spending, there may be some reason for optimism.\n\nA year ago, a proposed joint resolution in Wisconsin's Legislature bemoaned Citizens United and the spending it had unleashed. The resolution noted that \"this spending has the potential to drown out speech rights for all citizens, narrow debate, weaken federalism and self-governance in the states, and increase the risk of systemic corruption.\"\n\nRead More\n\nThe resolution called for a constitutional amendment clarifying that \"states may regulate the spending of money to influence federal elections.\"\n\nAnd though it never came to a vote, 17 members of the Legislature signed on to it, a dozen of them Republicans. Eight of them are still in the Legislature, including Sen. Van Wanggaard, who voted for the 2015 bill weakening Wisconsin's campaign finance rules.\n\nWanggaard did not respond to a request for comment. But an aide expressed surprise - and disbelief - seeing the lawmaker's name on the resolution.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI'm a ProPublica reporter covering issues in Wisconsin and throughout the Midwest.\n\nI'm interested in tips about public corruption, corporate mismanagement or institutional failures that have harmed people in Wisconsin.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "The Small Midwestern Cities That Could Play a Pivotal Role in This Year's Elections\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nTwelve years ago, Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat, took the stage at his election night party in Columbus to celebrate winning a second term. Barack Obama had just carried Ohio for the second time, after emphasizing his administration's rescue of the auto industry.  Brown wanted to proclaim that success onstage, but he was losing his voice, so his wife, the writer Connie Schultz, took over for him.\n\nAs she got to Jeep expanding its Toledo operations and General Motors building the Chevy Cruze at its rejuvenated plant near Youngstown, Brown started interjecting croaks to make sure she got the details right. \"The aluminum is made in Cleveland ... the transmission is made in Toledo ... the engine is made in Defiance ... the airbag is made in Brunswick.\"\n\nI thought about that moment often while on the campaign trail in Ohio this month. Brown is running for re-election again. But the political landscape is much changed. Ohio is no longer a presidential battleground. GM no longer makes the Cruze - the Lordstown plant where it was assembled closed in 2019. And Brown, who won his last two races by 5 and 7 points, is in a tight race against a car dealership magnate named Bernie Moreno.\n\nBrown and a dwindling band of Democrats in Ohio are still making the case for a certain kind of Democratic Party - one that cares about the working class, that invests in their towns and factories and values the manufacturing jobs that power the nation. That case should have become easier to make of late. Over the past four years, the Biden administration has championed huge investments in renewable energy and computer chip production; two new Intel plants are under construction near Columbus. Yet the political landscape is tougher than ever for Brown and the last remaining Ohio Democrats.\n\nThere are several possible explanations. Sixty percent of Ohio residents have only a high school diploma, an associate degree or a few years of college - a relatively high percentage. Union membership has dwindled from its peak in 1989. And the Biden investments have taken a while to ramp up.\n\nAt a Brown rally outside an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers hall in Dayton, the head of the local building trades council, David Cox, told me that his members were getting more work than they'd seen in 35 years. Then why, I asked, wasn't this restoring support for Democrats among workers? \"It takes a little while for these guys to wake up,\" Cox said.\n\nBut Democrats often overlook another dynamic at play here, and that's the role of place: Even if your own finances are secure, if you look out your window and see your city or town struggling, you believe you are, too. Some academics have referred to this as a sense of \" shared fate ,\" and it could be a powerful force in this election, especially in small cities in the industrial Midwest - such as Reading and Erie in Pennsylvania, Saginaw and Battle Creek in Michigan, Oshkosh and Racine in Wisconsin - where Brown and other Democrats are fighting to hang on to their seats and where Kamala Harris needs to do well (or at least hold her own).\n\nIn 2007, the academic Lorlene Hoyt and the city planning consultant André Leroux assembled a nationwide list of \"forgotten cities\" that were old and small, with a population of 15,000 to 150,000 and a median household income of less than $35,000. Recently, the urban researcher Michael Bloomberg updated it. Of the 179 cities now on the list , 37 are in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. And leading the way, with 23 cities, is Ohio.\n\nPundits often overlook these sorts of places (they tend to focus on big blue cities, deep-red rural areas and the suburbs in between), but given how clustered these smaller cities are in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, they will matter greatly in the battle for both the White House and for control of Congress. Lately, two of Ohio's have gained special prominence: Middletown (population 50,000) as the hometown of JD Vance, and Springfield (roughly 60,000) as home to a large community of Haitian immigrants that both Vance and Donald Trump have made a target of their rhetoric.\n\nI have visited dozens of these cities. They often have handsome downtowns with stately central squares and ornate, century-old bank buildings that rise 10 or 12 stories, but it can be difficult to find a cup of coffee after 2 p.m. or a place to watch a ballgame on TV at night. The local news is full of the sort of items I found a few weeks ago in a newspaper in Lima, Ohio (population 35,000): a report that the area was getting its 12th Dollar General store and a letter to the editor lamenting the closure of a Dana Incorporated auto-parts plant with 280 jobs. Just as troubling, young people are becoming harder to find; they're more drawn to thriving larger cities, such as Columbus, which has been vacuuming up strivers from across the state.\n\nFor decades, these smaller cities leaned Democratic, but in the past decade, they have turned redder. In 2012, Obama won Green Bay, Wisconsin, by nearly twice as large a margin as Joe Biden did in 2020; Obama won Saginaw by an extra 15 percentage points. Even in Biden's hometown, Scranton, Pennsylvania, Obama's margin was more than 4,000 votes larger.\n\nWhat's so perplexing to liberals about this shift is that many of the people who left the Democratic Party are doing well for themselves; these cities are full of small-business owners, factory workers and retirees with pensions getting by under a Democratic president. But seeing your small city become a shadow of its former self can open you to a hard-edge populist message even if you yourself are managing. That's what scholars mean by \" shared fate ,\" and it's what's missed when we analyze voting behavior only by income or education level or race.\n\nRep. Marcy Kaptur - an Ohio Democrat who is a city planner by training and, after more than 40 years in office, the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress - understands this visceral reality. Her mother was a union organizer at a spark plug factory, and she has watched these wrenching changes play out from Toledo to the smaller cities she has represented, such as Sandusky and Lorain.\n\nIt's rare to hear her talk up the social issues that often dominate debate on the left. Instead, she is most insistent about whether the nation's industrial base can support its military, whether small cities have economic development expertise, whether workers at Toledo's closed power plant can find new jobs. \"I believe economics isn't destiny, but it's 85% of it,\" she told me this month during a visit to a new Cleveland-Cliffs steel plant in Toledo.\n\nFor years, she has been struggling to get Democratic leaders to care about left-behind districts such as hers. In 2018, Hillary Clinton boasted that the areas she had carried in her 2016 loss produced two-thirds of the nation's gross domestic product, as if votes from the economically thriving areas counted more. Two years earlier, Chuck Schumer, now Senate majority leader, declared, \"For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia. And you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.\"\n\nThis logic confounds Kaptur, who is now in a closely fought race with a state legislator, Derek Merrin. \"A country can't survive when vast segments of your population cannot get ahead,\" she told me. Last year, to impress on party leaders how much ground Democrats are losing in districts like hers, her office produced a chart ranking the 435 House districts by median income. The moral: Democrats now represented most higher-income districts - in places like the Bay Area, the Northeast and metro Washington - while Republicans dominated in many lower-income ones. Her own district was 341st on the ranking, surrounded by red ones. \"Washington has trouble seeing us,\" she said. \"They need binoculars.\"\n\nFor Brown, the plight of these small cities is personal, because he's from an archetypal one: Mansfield (population 48,000), which has lost a string of manufacturers. This month, the first person whom I met upon arriving at its central square was a woman asking for money. Brown's father was a doctor, but as Brown often reminds voters, he went to school with the children of factory workers, a perspective that set him, like Kaptur, against trade deals such as NAFTA that many other Democrats supported.\n\n\"Politicians of both parties have done the bidding of wealthy corporations and sold the country out over and over and over again,\" he said at a United Auto Workers hall in Toledo this month.\n\nAfter the event, I asked him about the difficulties facing small cities. \"Those cities were even more damaged than metropolitan areas because young people often tended to leave because there wasn't the economic opportunity,\" he said. \"So I pay special attention to them.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, this means making more visits to the smaller cities than most other Democrats might. These cities also figure prominently in Brown's stump rhetoric. \"I grew up in Mansfield, Ohio, a town that looks a lot like Springfield, looks a lot like Zanesville, looks a lot like Hamilton or Middletown\" is how Brown opened his remarks outside the union hall in Dayton, a city also on the updated \"forgotten\" list. After that event, he fell into an extended conversation with a new sort of small-city leader: one of the pioneers of the Haitian community in Springfield, who now owns five houses there and had come to Dayton to see Brown speak.\n\nWithout a doubt, Brown's and Kaptur's understanding of such places has helped them survive as long as they have as the state turned redder. It's not as if their opponents have been offering these small cities many concrete solutions of their own. Far from it: Moreno's ads center on his backing by Trump, and virtually all of the tens of millions of dollars in attack ads being run against Brown by outside groups focus on transgender youth.\n\nRead More\n\nThere's a painful irony in this for Democrats such as Brown and Kaptur. For years, they have been urging their party to pay more heed to these scattered outposts of their base: to Mansfield and Middletown, Springfield and Sandusky, all across their state and region. They were largely vindicated in their warnings about trade policy and political fallout, and a national Democratic response finally arrived in the past few years.\n\nBut in many places, demoralization had already spread so far, and local institutions had withered so much, that it became much easier for an opposition message based on nationwide culture-war appeals to register. Brown is as vulnerable now as he has ever been - running only 4 points ahead of Harris in the latest poll - and Kaptur's race is just as competitive. This is doubly painful for them because they have largely skirted the culture-war front over the years, concentrating instead on economic issues.\n\nBrown and Kaptur may well survive their latest challenges. But it's hard to see how Democrats will revive their standing in Ohio - or enhance their prospects in the nearby swing states that remain more within their reach, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania - without helping these small cities revive, too. As Kaptur told me simply, sitting in her Toledo office overlooking the Maumee River: \"They need to be seen.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nI have been reporting for ProPublica since 2015, most recently covering the post-pandemic schools crisis.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

I was looking for a professional sign-maker who had turned his West Carrollton ranch house into a distribution point for Trump yard signs, in high demand just days prior to the Ohio Republican primary. Instead of piling the signs in the driveway, he had arrayed them in his yard along the road. There they were, dozens and dozens of them, lined up in rows like the uniform gravestones in a military cemetery.\n\nThe sign man wasn't home, but he had left a married couple in charge of the distribution. I got talking to the woman, Contessa Hammel. She was 43 and worked at the convenience store at a local Speedway gas station after four years in the military. And this was the first time she was voting in 25 years of eligibility.\n\nI was startled to hear this - it's rare to find voters entering the political process after decades of disconnection; in fact, I'd met a handyman in his 70s at a Trump rally on the other side of Dayton that same day who said he was voting for the first time, but I had dismissed it as a fluke.\n\nI asked Hammel why she'd held back all those years. \"I didn't want to make an unintelligent decision,\" she said, in a tone that suggested she was well aware of what an admission that was. But this year's Republican nominee was different, she said. \"He makes it simple for people like me,\" she said. \"He puts it clearly.\"\n\nDonald Trump's stunning win Tuesday, defying all the prognosticators, suggested there were many more people like Hammel out there - people who were so disconnected from the political system that they were literally unaccounted for in the pollsters' modeling, which relies on past voting behavior.\n\nBut Hammel was far from the only person I met in my reporting this year who made me think that Trump had spurred something very unusual. Some of them had never voted before; some had voted for Barack Obama. None were traditional Republican voters. Some were in dire economic straits; others were just a notch up from that and looking down with resentment at the growing dependency around them. What they shared were three things. They lived in places that were in decline, and had been for some time. They lacked strong attachment to either party at a time when, even within a single metro area like Dayton , the parties had sorted themselves into ideological, geographically disparate camps that left many voters unmoored. And they had profound contempt for a dysfunctional, hyper-prosperous Washington that they saw as utterly removed from their lives.\n\nThese newly energized voters helped Trump flip not only battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa but long-blue Northern industrial states - Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin - without which he would have lost to Hillary Clinton. Nationwide, his margin with the white working class soared to 40 points , up 15 points from Romney's in 2012.\n\nTwo days after meeting Hammel, I tagged along with some Trump supporters, women who'd come all the way from Buffalo to go canvassing door-to-door in the adjacent Dayton suburb of Miamisburg. It was a rainy day, and few were answering their doors in this neighborhood of frayed frame houses and bungalows, but they persisted in their yellow ponchos; I couldn't help but be reminded of the doggedness I'd observed among Obama volunteers in 2008.\n\nAt one small house, someone finally answered the door. Tracie St. Martin stepped out onto the porch, a 54-year-old woman with a sturdy, thick-muscled build and sun-weathered face, both of them products of her 26 years as a heavy-construction worker. St. Martin greeted the women warmly, and when they told her what they were there for she said, sure, she was considering Trump - even though she usually voted Democratic. And when they got talking, in the disjointed way of canvassers making a quick pitch, about how Trump was going to bring back the good jobs, St. Martin was visibly affected. She interrupted them, wanting to tell them about how she had, not long ago, worked a job that consisted of demolishing a big local GM plant. Her eyes welled up as she told the story and she had trouble continuing.\n\nThe canvassers gave her some materials and bade her farewell. But I doubled back a little later and visited with St. Martin in her kitchen, which she was in the midst of tidying up, with daytime TV playing in the background. Space in the kitchen was tight due to the treadmill she recently bought to help her get into better shape, which she hoped might make her less dependent on the painkillers for the severe aches she got from her physically demanding job, pills that had gotten a lot harder to obtain from her doctor amid the clampdown on prescription opioids.\n\nSt. Martin apologized, unnecessarily, for her emotions on the porch and expanded on what she had told the women from Buffalo: She was a proud member of Local 18 of the operating engineers' union, which had been urging its members to support Hillary Clinton. The union provided her health insurance and decent pay levels, and trained her for demanding work, which, just months earlier, had required her to hang off of a Pennsylvania cliff face in her dozer as part of a gas pipeline project.\n\nShe came from a staunch Democratic family and had voted for Barack Obama in 2008, before not voting in 2012 because, she said, she was away on one of her long-term jobs. She was a single mother with three grown daughters. She had experienced all manner of sexual discrimination and harassment on very male-heavy worksites over the years.\n\nShe was, in other words, as tailor-made a supporter as one could find for Clinton, a self-professed fighter for the average Jane who was running to become the first woman president.\n\nAnd yet St. Martin was leaning toward Trump.\n\nHer explanation for this was halting but vehement, spoken with pauses and in bursts. She was disappointed in Obama after having voted for him. \"I don't like the Obama persona, his public appearance and demeanor,\" she said. \"I wanted people like me to be cared about. People don't realize there's nothing without a blue-collar worker.\" She regretted that she did not have a deeper grasp of public affairs. \"No one that's voting knows all the facts,\" she said. \"It's a shame. They keep us so fucking busy and poor that we don't have the time.\"\n\nWhen she addressed Clinton herself, it was in a stream that seemed to refer to, but not explicitly name, several of the charges thrown against Clinton by that point in time, including her handling of the deadly 2012 attack by Islamic militants on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya; the potential conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation; and her use of a private email server while serving as Secretary of State, mixing national security business with emails to her daughter, Chelsea.\n\n\"To have lives be sacrificed because of corporate greed and warmongering, it's too much for me - and I realize I don't have all the facts - that there's just too much sidestepping on her. I don't trust her. I don't think that - I know there's casualties of war in conflict, I'm a big girl, I know that. But I lived my life with no secrets. There's no shame in the truth. There's mistakes made. We all grow. She's a mature woman and she should know that. You don't email your fucking daughter when you're a leader. Leaders need to make decisions, they need to be focused. You don't hide stuff.\n\n\"That's why I like Trump,\" she continued. \"He's not perfect. He's a human being. We all make mistakes. We can all change our mind. We get educated, but once you have the knowledge, you still have to go with your gut.\"\n\nHand-wringing among Democrats about the party's declining support among white working-class voters goes back a long time, to Lyndon Johnson's declaration that signing the Civil Rights Act would sacrifice the allegiance of white Southerners. Then came the rest of the historical litany: the crime wave, riots and anti-Vietnam War protests of the late 1960s, the consolidation of suburban white flight, Nixon's Silent Majority, Reagan Democrats, NAFTA, gun control, the War on Coal, and on and on. By this year, many liberals had gotten so fed up with hearing about these woebegone voters and all their political needs that they were openly declaring them a lost cause, motivated more by racial issues than economic anxiety , and declaring that the expanding Democratic coalition of racial and ethnic minorities and college-educated white voters obviated the need to cater to the white working class.\n\nBut this assessment suffered from a fatal overgeneralization. The \"white working class\" was a hugely broad category - as pollsters defined it, any white voter without a four-year college degree, roughly one-third of the electorate. Within that category were crucial distinctions, especially regional ones. Democrats in national elections had lost most white working-class voters in the Deep South - indeed, virtually all white voters there - a long time ago. They had in the past decade and a half seen much of Greater Appalachia, stretching from the Alleghenies to Arkansas, follow suit, to the point where West Virginia, one of just five states that Jimmy Carter won in 1980, went for Mitt Romney by 26 percentage points in 2012. It was hard to see how the Democrats were going to win back coal country like Logan County, W.V., which Bill Clinton won with 72 percent in 1996 but where Obama got only 29 percent in 2012.\n\nDayton was once a bastion of the GOP establishment. The story of how the city changed helps explain the rise of Donald Trump. Read the story .\n\nOur series seeks to show how politics and government really work, and why they don't. See The Breakdown .\n\nBut there was a whole subset of the white working class Obama was still winning : voters in northern states where unions, however diminished, still served to remind members of their Democratic roots (and build inter-racial solidarity). In these states, voters could still find national figures who represented them and their sort, people like Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Vice President Joe Biden. Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, centered on Biden's hometown of Scranton, went for Obama with 63 percent of the vote in 2012. Rural Marquette County, in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, went for him with 56 percent of the vote. In Ohio, there were a couple counties in the state's Appalachian southeast that went stronger for Obama in 2012 than they had in 2008. In the opposite corner of the state, gratitude for Obama's bailout of the auto industry helped win him 64 percent of the vote in Lucas County, around Toledo. Across the North, Obama ran even or ahead with John Kerry and Al Gore among white working class voters; their raw vote total for him nationwide exceeded his tallies of college-educated white voters and minority supporters.\n\nOn Election Day 2012, one voter I spoke with in Columbus, Ohio, encapsulated how well Obama had managed to frame the election as a \"who's on your side\" choice between himself and the private equity titan Mitt Romney, and thereby hold onto enough white working-class voters in crucial swing states. Matt Bimberg, 50, was waiting by himself at a remote bus stop in a black neighborhood on the edge of town. He had in the past decade lost jobs as a telecom technician for Global Crossing (he still carried a Global Crossing tote bag) and at a factory making escape hatches for buses. But he had just landed a job at a nearby warehouse as a forklift operator, a success for which he credited a three-week training course paid for by the U.S. Department of Labor. And as gratitude for that, he was voting for Obama after voting for John McCain in 2008. \"My line of thinking was that under Romney and [Paul] Ryan, it would be more of a trickle-down administration,\" he said. \"Their thinking is to give that money to corporations and the rich in tax breaks, and some will trickle down. But it didn't work then and it won't work now. Romney reminds me so much of Reagan's theory of supply-side economics. It scares me.\"\n\nNot so long ago, Hillary Clinton would have seemed ideally suited to keep such northern white working-class voters in the fold. After all, she had trounced Obama among many of these very voters in the 2008 primaries, as she beat him in states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania and at one point went so far as to declare herself, in a slip of the tongue, the champion of \"working, hard-working Americans, white Americans.\"\n\nBut things had changed in the intervening years. For one thing, she was further removed from her stint representing downtrodden upstate New York as a senator - she had spent the years since 2008 in the rarefied realm of the State Department and then giving more than 80 paid speeches to banks, corporations and trade associations, for a total haul of $18 million. For another thing, cause for resentment and letdown had grown in many of those Rust Belt communities where Obama had held his own - they might be inching their way back from the Great Recession, but the progress was awfully slow, and they were lagging ever further behind booming coastal cities like New York, San Francisco and Washington, where the income gap compared with the rest of the country had grown far larger.\n\nMost crucially, she was running not against Mitt Romney, the man from Bain Capital, but against Donald Trump. Yes, Trump was (or claimed to be) a billionaire himself, but he was not of Romney's upper crust - they scorned him and his casinos and gold-plated jet, and were giving him virtually none of their campaign contributions. Trump attacked the trade deals that had helped hollow out these voters' communities, he attacked the Mexicans who had heavily populated some of their towns and had driven much of the heroin trade in others, and, yes, he tapped into broader racial resentments as well. Faced with this populist opposition, Clinton fatefully opted against taking the \"I'm on your side; he's not\" tack that Obama had used so well against Romney, and had instead gone about attacking Trump's fitness for the presidency.\n\nBack in Dayton, where Clinton never visited during the entire campaign, I had run into two more former Obama voters after Trump's March rally there. Both Heath Bowling and Alex Jones admitted to having been swept up in the Obama wave, but had since grown somewhat disenchanted. Bowling, 36, a burly man with a big smile, managed a small siding and insulation business, and as he'd grown older he'd had gotten more bothered about the dependency on food stamps he saw around him, especially among members of his own generation, and demoralized by the many overdose deaths in his circle.\n\nJones, 30, who worked part-time at a pizza shop and delivering medicines to nursing homes, joked at first that his vote for Obama might have had to do with his having been doing a lot of drugs at the time. He grew serious when he talked about how much the Black Lives Matter protests against shootings by police officers grated on him. Chicago was experiencing soaring homicide rates, he said - why weren't more people talking about that? He was upset that when he went out on the town in Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine bar district, he had to worry about getting jumped if he was on the street past a certain hour - and that he felt constrained against complaining against it. \"If I say anything about that, I'm a racist,\" he said. \"I can't stand that politically correct bullshit.\" He had, he said, taken great solace in confiding recently in an older black man at a bar who had agreed with his musing on race and crime. \"It was like a big burden lifted from me - here was this black man agreeing with me!\"\n\nPolls had consistently showed that Trump's support was stronger with white working-class men than women, and in October came a revelation that seemed sure to weaken his standing among women of all classes, release of an 11-year-old tape in which Trump boasted of trying to commit adultery with a married woman and grabbing women \"by the pussy.\"\n\nA few days after the release of the tape, which was followed by a string of accusations from women saying they had been sexually harassed and assaulted by Trump, I checked back in with Tracie St. Martin to see if she still supported him. She was working on a new gas plant in Middletown, a working-class town near Dayton that was the setting of the recent best-selling memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" Here's what she wrote back in a text message: \"I still appreciate the honesty in some of his comments. Most of his comments. I still favor what he says he may be able to do. I am voting against Hillary, come what may with Trump. It's important to me that 'we the people' actually have political power. And electing Trump will prove that. I am AMAZED at the number of people voting for him. The corruption is disgusting in the press. Yes, as of right now I am voting FOR Trump.\" She was sure he would win, she said: \"His support is crazy! The polls have to be wrong. Have to be fixed.\"\n\nAnd she shared an anecdote that reflected how differently Trump's comments had been received in some places than others. \"I'm setting steel for this new gas plant...I'm operating a rough terrain forklift,\" she wrote. \"So today, I kept thinking about the debate and the audio was released ... And I got underneath a load of steel and was moving it...I was laughing and laughing and one of the iron workers asked 'what are u laughing at.' I said 'I grabbed that load right by the pussy' and laughed some more...And said 'when you're an operator you can do that ya know', laughed all fucking day.\"\n\nJust last week, I was back in Ohio, in the southeastern Appalachian corner. I was at a graduation ceremony for opiate addicts who had gone through a recovery program, and sitting with four women, all around 30, who were still in the program. Someone mentioned the election, and all four of them piped up that they were voting for the first time ever. For whom? I asked. They looked at me as if I had asked the dumbest question in the world. All four were for Trump.\n\nThe most of the loquacious of the group, Tiffany Chesser, said she was voting for him because her boyfriend worked at a General Electric light-bulb plant nearby that was seeing more of its production lines being moved to Mexico. She saw voting for Trump as a straightforward transaction to save his job. \"If he loses that job we're screwed - I'll lose my house,\" she said. \"There used to be a full parking lot there - now you go by, there are just three trucks in the lot.\"\n\nBut Chesser also was viscerally opposed to Clinton who, the week prior, had endured a surprise announcement from FBI Director James Comey that a newly discovered cache of emails of hers was under scrutiny. \"If she's being investigated by the FBI, there's a reason for it,\" she said. I asked the women if they weren't equally bothered by the many women's accusations against Trump. They shrugged. \"It's locker-room talk,\" Chesser said. \"I know girls talk like that, and I know guys do.\" But what about the accusations of assault? \"Why are they just coming forward now?\" she said. \"If he did it to me before, I'd have come forward then. I wouldn't wait until now.\"\n\nThe next day, I met with Taylor Sappington, a native of Southeast Ohio who, after graduating from Ohio University, had decided to run for town council last year in Nelsonville, pop. 5,400, and won a seat. Sappington, who had been raised in a manufactured home by a single mother and whose brother works as a corrections officer, was a proud Democrat. He had volunteered for Obama's 2012 campaign and took comfort in knowing that parts of Southeast Ohio had remained solid for the Democrats, unlike so much of the rest of Appalachia. But he knew that Clinton would not perform as well in the area as Obama had. \"It's a Democratic area. But Trump has blown a hole through it,\" he said. \"They feel like this is a forgotten area that's suffering, that has been forgotten by Columbus and Washington and then they hear someone say, we can turn this place around, they feel it viscerally.\"\n\nAnd he feared that the national Democratic Party did not realize how little it could afford such a loss, or even realize how well it had those voters in the fold as recently as 2012. \"I'm a believer in the Democratic coalition, but they're writing off folks and it's going to hurt them,\" he said. \"To write them off is reckless.\"\n\nA week later, on Election Day, I drove to a polling station in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, a small town south of York, just across the Maryland line. The polling station was inside an evangelical church housed inside a vast, mostly abandoned shopping plaza. It's Republican country, where Romney outpolled Obama 2-1, but I was still startled by how long it was taking me to find a single Hillary Clinton voter.\n\nBut there was yet another woman voting for the first time in her life, at age 55, for Trump. \"I didn't have much interest in politics. But the older you get you realize more and more how important it is,\" said Kelly Waldemire, who works in a local plastic-molding plant. \"When it got to the point where the country is going in the wrong direction, I thought it was time.\"\n\nAnd there was yet another voter who had been for Obama in 2008 - Brian Osbourne, a 33-year-old Navy veteran who now drove all the way to Washington, D.C., every day to do commercial HVAC work because it paid double there what it would in Shrewsbury. The local economy had come back a little, he said, but \"there's a lot of people working jobs that they're overqualified for.\" That wasn't all, he said. He hesitated, warning that what he was about to say wasn't \"politically correct,\" and then said, \"We're really getting pussified as a country.\"\n\nI asked what he made of reports that Trump wrote off as much of a billion dollars on his taxes to avoid paying any at all. He shrugged it off just as every Trump voter I spoke with there did. \"That doesn't worry me all that much,\" he said. \"That's what he does - that's the loophole the government created. He takes advantage of what the system created. I'd do the same thing.\"\n\nAs for Obama, his promise of racial reconciliation had been a \"big letdown,\" he said. \"I thought it would help with race relations, but it's getting way worse,\" he said. \"I wouldn't be surprised if we have another civil war in this country.\"\n\nAnd there were yet more women willing to wave off Trump's comment on the tape and the women's accusations against him. \"I don't take that crap seriously,\" said Tammy Nuth, 49, who cares for Alzheimer's patients. \"Men are men.\" As for the women accusers: \"I think they're getting paid off.\"\n\nAs I was preparing to leave, I glimpsed a young woman who I guessed might've voted for Clinton, and approached her to help balance my reporting. I was wrong. Stephanie Armetta, an 18-year-old working as a grocery store cashier before heading to community college, had cast her first-ever ballot, for Donald Trump. Her family had many members in the military, she said, and she thought Trump would \"have more respect\" for them. She thought it was wrong that if her brother got deployed, he got only two meals per day, while people in prison get three. And then of course there was Benghazi, \"that she left [the four Americans] there, that they weren't her priority.\" She was bothered by Trump's comments on the tape, for sure. But, she said, \"I'm glad how he didn't lie about it. They caught him and he said, yeah, I said an asshole thing.\" Not to mention, she said, \"Bill Clinton isn't good either on that subject.\" Her vote, she concluded, was \"more against Hillary than for Trump.\"\n\nTrump won that one small precinct by 144 more votes than Romney had won it in 2012 - a 20 percent increase. And all across rural and small-town Pennsylvania, that pattern repeated itself. In Scranton's Lackawanna County, where Obama had won 63 percent, Clinton won only 50 percent.\n\nIn Michigan's rural Marquette County, where Obama had won 56 percent, Clinton got only 49 percent. Trump became the first Republican since 1988 to win Pennsylvania or Michigan.\n\nIn Ohio's Mahoning County, home of Youngstown, where Obama got 63 percent, Clinton got only 50 percent. In Hocking County, just adjacent to Nelsonville, Clinton fell even further, getting 30 percent, down from the 48 percent Obama had gotten, and realizing Taylor Sappington's fears.\n\nAnd at Tracie St. Martin's working-class precinct in Miamisburg, where Obama had managed to get 43 percent in 2012, Clinton's support plunged to 26 percent, giving Trump a margin of 293 votes just in that one precinct, triple Romney's margin four years earlier. That helped provide Trump a historic claim: the first Republican majority in Dayton's Montgomery County in 28 years. Statewide, Trump won by a whopping eight percentage points, a swing of 10 points from four years earlier. He had brought new voters out of the woodwork; he had converted some white working-class Obama voters while others had just stayed home.\n\nSt. Martin, who was still hard at work on the Middletown gas plant with a \"great bunch of ironworkers,\" was elated. \"I just really needed to know that I was part of a majority that recognized we need these things that Trump spoke of,\" she told me. \"More importantly for me, to NOT have Hillary as Commander in Chief.\"\n\nAlec MacGillis\n\nI have been reporting for ProPublica since 2015, most recently covering the post-pandemic schools crisis.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

Two new books that reckon with the long, bleak history of the country's white poor suggest their plight shouldn't have caught the rest of the country off guard.\n\nby Alec MacGillis\n\nHow politics and government really work, and why they don't.\n\nSometime during the past few years, the country started talking differently about white Americans of modest means.\n\nEarly in the Obama era, the ennobling language of campaign pundits prevailed. There was much discussion of \"white working-class voters,\" with whom the Democrats, and especially Barack Obama, were having such trouble connecting. Never mind that this overbroad category of Americans - the exit pollsters' definition was anyone without a four-year college degree, or more than a third of the electorate - obliterated major differences in geography, ethnicity, and culture. The label served to conjure a vast swath of salt-of-the-earth citizens living and working in the wide-open spaces between the coasts - Sarah Palin's \"real America\" - who were dubious of the effete, hifalutin types increasingly dominating the party that had once purported to represent the common man. The \"white working class\" connoted virtue and integrity. A party losing touch with it was a party unmoored.\n\nThat flattering glow has faded away. Today, less privileged white Americans are considered to be in crisis, and the language of sociologists and pathologists predominates. Charles Murray's \"Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010\" was published in 2012, and Robert D. Putnam's \"Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis\" came out last year. From opposite ends of the ideological spectrum, they made the case that social breakdown among low-income whites was starting to mimic trends that had begun decades earlier among African Americans: Rates of out-of-wedlock births and male joblessness were rising sharply. Then came the stories about a surge in opiate addiction among white Americans, alongside shocking reports of rising mortality rates (including by suicide) among middle-aged whites. And then, of course, came the 2016 presidential campaign. The question was suddenly no longer why Democrats struggled to appeal to regular Americans. It was why so many regular Americans were drawn to a man like Donald Trump.\nEqually jarring has been the shift in tone. A barely suppressed contempt has characterized much of the commentary about white woe, on both the left and the right. Writing for National Review in March, the conservative provocateur Kevin Williamson shoveled scorn on the low-income white Republican voters who, as he saw it, were most responsible for the rise of Trump:\n\nNothing happened to them. There wasn't some awful disaster. There wasn't a war or a famine or a plague or a foreign occupation. Even the economic changes of the past few decades do very little to explain the dysfunction and negligence - and the incomprehensible malice - of poor white America. So the gypsum business in Garbutt ain't what it used to be. There is more to life in the 21st century than wallboard and cheap sentimentality about how the Man closed the factories down.\n\nThe truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die. Economically, they are negative assets. Morally, they are indefensible. Forget all your cheap theatrical Bruce Springsteen crap. Forget your sanctimony about struggling Rust Belt factory towns and your conspiracy theories about the wily Orientals stealing our jobs ... The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles. Donald Trump's speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin.\n\nAnalysis on the left has been less gratuitously nasty but similarly harsh in its insinuation. Several prominent liberals have theorized that what's driving rising mortality and drug and alcohol abuse among white Americans is, quite simply, despair over the loss of their perch in the country's pecking order. \"So what is happening?\" asked Josh Marshall on his \"Talking Points Memo\" blog in December. \"Let's put this clearly,\" he said in wrapping up his analysis of the dismal health data. \"The stressor at work here is the perceived and real loss of the social and economic advantages of being white.\"\n\nThe barely veiled implication, whichever version you consider, is that the people undergoing these travails deserve relatively little sympathy - that they maybe, kinda had this reckoning coming. Either they are layabouts drenched in self-pity or they are sad cases consumed with racial status anxiety and animus toward the nonwhites passing them on the ladder. Both interpretations are, in their own ways, strikingly ungenerous toward a huge number of fellow Americans.\n\nThey are also unsatisfying as explanations for what is happening out there. Williamson, for one, mischaracterizes the typical Trump voter. As exit polls show, the candidate's base is not the truly bereft white underclass Williamson derides. Those Americans are, by and large, not voting at all, as I'm often reminded when reporting in places like Appalachia, where turnout rates are the lowest in the country. People voting for Trump are mostly a notch higher on the economic ladder - in a position to feel exactly the resentment that Williamson himself feels toward the shiftless needy. As for liberals' diagnosis that a major public-health crisis is rooted in racial envy, it fails to square with, among other things, the fact that blacks and Hispanics have hardly been flourishing themselves. Yes, there's an African American president, but by many metrics the Great Recession was even worse for minorities than for whites.\n\nTwo new books - one a provocative, deeply researched history and the other an affecting memoir - are well timed to help make better sense of the plight of struggling whites in the United States. Both accounts converge on an important insight: The gloomy state of affairs in the lower reaches of white America should not have caught the rest of the country as off guard as it has - and mobilizing solutions for the crisis will depend partly on closing the gaps that allowed for such obliviousness.\n\n\"Welcome to America as it was,\" Nancy Isenberg, a historian at Louisiana State University, writes near the outset of \"White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America.\" Her title might seem sensational were it not so well earned. As she makes plain, a white lower class not only figured more prominently in the development of the colonies and the young country than national lore suggests, but was spoken of from the start explicitly in terms of waste and refuse.\n\nFor England, the New World beckoned as more than a vast store of natural resources, Isenberg argues. It was also a place to dispose of the dregs of its own society. In the late 16th century, the geographer Richard Hakluyt argued that America could serve as a giant workhouse where the \"fry [young children] of wandering beggars that grow up idly and hurtfully and burdenous to the Realm, might be unladen and better bred up.\" The exportable poor, he wrote, were the \"offals of our people.\" In 1619, King James I was so fed up with vagrant boys milling around his New-market palace that he asked the Virginia Company to ship them overseas. Three years later, John Donne - yes, that John Donne - wrote about the colony of Virginia as if it were England's spleen and liver, Isenberg writes, draining the \"ill humours of the body ... to breed good bloud.\" Thus it was, she goes on, that the early settlers included so many \"roguish highwaymen, mean vagrants, Irish rebels, known whores, and an assortment of convicts,\" including one Elizabeth \"Little Bess\" Armstrong, sent to Virginia for stealing two spoons.\n\nOne of America's founding myths, of course, is that the simple act of leaving England and boldly starting new lives in the colonies had an equalizing effect on the colonists, swiftly narrowing the distance between indentured servant and merchant, landowner and clerk - all except the African slave. Nonsense, Isenberg says: \"Independence did not magically erase the British class system.\" A \"ruthless class order\" was enforced at Jamestown, where one woman returned from 10 months of Indian captivity to be told that she owed 150 pounds of tobacco to her dead husband's former master and would have to work off the debt. The Puritans were likewise \"obsessed with class rank\" - membership in the Church and its core elect were elite privileges - not least because the early Massachusetts settlers included far more nonreligious riffraff than is generally realized. A version of the North Carolina constitution probably co-authored by John Locke was designed to \"avoid erecting a numerous democracy.\" It envisioned a nobility of landgraves and caciques (German for \"princes\" and Spanish for \"chieftains\"), along with a \"court of heraldry\" to oversee marriages and make sure they preserved pedigree.\n\nClass distinctions were maintained above all in the apportionment of land. In Virginia in 1700, indentured servants had virtually no chance to own any, and by 1770, less than 10 percent of white Virginians had claim to more than half the land. In 1729 in North Carolina, a colony with 36,000 people, there were only 3,281 listed grants, and 309 grantees owned nearly half the land. \"Land was the principal source of wealth, and those without any had little chance to escape servitude,\" Isenberg writes. \"It was the stigma of landlessness that would leave its mark on white trash from this day forward.\" This was not just a Southern dynamic. The American usage of squatter traces to New England, where many of the nonelect  -  later called \"swamp Yankees\" - carved out homes on others' land only to be chased off and have their houses burned.\n\nThe Founding Fathers were, as Isenberg sees it, complicit in perpetuating these stark class divides. George Washington believed that only the \"lower class of people\" should serve as foot soldiers in the Continental Army. Thomas Jefferson envisioned his public schools educating talented students \"raked from the rubbish\" of the lower class, and argued that ranking humans like animal breeds was perfectly natural. \"The circumstance of superior beauty is thought worthy of attention in the propagation of our horses, dogs and other domestic animals,\" he wrote. \"Why not that of man?\" John Adams believed the \"passion for distinction\" was a powerful human force: \"There must be one, indeed, who is the last and lowest of the human species.\"\n\nBy the time the nation gained independence, the white underclass - its future dependents - was fully entrenched. This underclass could be found just about every-where in the new country, but it was perhaps most conspicuous in North Carolina, where many whites who had been denied land in Virginia trickled into the area south of the Great Dismal Swamp, establishing what Isenberg calls \"the first white trash colony.\" William Byrd II, the Virginia planter, described these swamp denizens as suffering from \"dis-tempers of laziness\" and \"slothful in everything but getting children.\" North Carolina's governor described his people as \"the meanest, most rustic and squalid part of the species.\"\n\nAccounts of this underclass as \"an anomalous new breed of human,\" as Isenberg puts it, proliferated as poor whites without property spread west and south across the country. These \"crackers\" and \"squatters\" were \"no better than savages,\" with \"children brought up in the Woods like brutes,\" wrote a Swiss-born colonel in the colonial army in 1759. In 1810, the ornithologist Alexander Wilson described the \"grotesque log cabins\" where the lowly patriarch typically stood wearing a shirt \"defiled and torn,\" his \"face inlaid with dirt and soot.\" Thomas Jefferson's granddaughter came back from an 1817 excursion with her grandfather telling of that \"half civiliz'd race who lived beyond the ridge.\" In 1830, the country even got its first \"Cracker Dictionary\" to document the slang of poor whites.\n\nAt various junctures, politicians (think Davy Crockett and Andrew Jackson) turned humble roots into a mark of \"backwoodsman\" authenticity, but the pendulum always swung back. The term white trash made its first appearance in print as early as 1821. It gained currency three decades later, by which point observers were expressing horror over these people's \"tallow\" skin and their habit of eating clay. As George Weston warned in his widely circulated 1856 pamphlet \"The Poor Whites of the South,\" they were \"sinking deeper and more hopelessly into barbarism with every succeeding generation.\" Speaking of this class as a separate breed - a species unto itself - was a way to skirt the challenge it presented to the nation's vision of equality and inclusivity.\n\nIsenberg points up the tension: \"If whiteness was not an automatic badge of superiority, a guarantee of the homogeneous population of independent, educable freemen ... then the ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were unobtainable.\"\n\nWith so much talk of breeds, it is no surprise that, in the early 20th century, the U.S. was gripped by a eugenics craze, which Isenberg sees as motivated by revulsion over the supposed degeneracy of poor whites, especially those in the South. State fairs held \"fitter family\" contests, Teddy Roosevelt fretted about Americans' \"germ protoplasm,\" and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. issued a ruling upholding the forced sterilization of a poor Virginian named Carrie Buck, deemed a \"moron.\"\n\nIsenberg, for all her efforts to clarify the role of class in the national culture, succumbs to a different kind of distortion herself. She is frustratingly hazy about regional distinctions within the white lower class, a blurriness that also skews some of the contemporary liberal theorizing about white despondency. As her account progresses, she focuses increasingly on the South, without squarely addressing that choice and its implications.\n\nTo zero in on the white underclass in or near slaveholding areas is, understandably, to dwell on the fraught dynamic between poor whites and enslaved African Americans and its role in the national debate leading up to the Civil War. On the one hand, opponents of slavery argued that the association of labor with servitude dulled the work ethic of poor whites. On the other, defenders of slavery claimed that being spared the lowliest toil kept poor Southern whites a step above their Northern counterparts.\n\nBut there were whole other swaths of the country where many poor whites lived without any blacks nearby to speak of - not least the broad expanse of Appalachia. Isenberg makes plain in a brief aside that she does not buy the idea, enshrined in so many books in recent years, of a separate cohort of \"Scots-Irish\" - hard-drinking, hard-scrapping brawlers from the \"borderlands\" of Scotland, northern Ireland, and northern England who, cherishing their freedom and wanting nothing to do with the coastal elites, settled up in the Appalachian hills in the mid-18th century. One such account, Grady McWhiney's \"Cracker Culture\" (1988), earns Isenberg's brisk dismissal as a \"flawed historical study that turned poor whites into Celtic ethnics (Scots-Irish).\"\n\nRegardless of the merits in that dispute, Isenberg ought to have reckoned more fully with the distinctions between poor whites in the Deep South and those elsewhere. At points, she mentions \"hillbilly\" whites (AKA \"mountaineers\" and \"briar hoppers\") as a subset of her white underclass. But at other points, she makes it sound as if all poor whites lived with blacks in their midst and, when the Civil War came, went off with varying degrees of enthusiasm to fight to maintain their superiority over those blacks. In reality, many poor whites in Appalachia avoided what they saw as the war of the slave-holding planters of the Deep South and the cavaliers of the Tide-water region of Virginia - and even created a new state, West Virginia, in their resistance. Whether or not one buys into the Scots-Irish version of events, the history of greater Appalachia is one of provincial upstarts asserting themselves against elites, not merely one of dispossessed victims.\n\nThe distinction's relevance persists today. Large areas of \"real America\" are almost entirely white. In Appalachia, that homogeneity, along with the region's populist tradition, helps explain why white voters there took so much longer to flip from Democrat to Republican than in the Deep South. This does not mean that racism is absent in these areas - far from it. But it suggests that the racism is fueled as much by suspicion of the \"other\" as it is by firsthand experience of blacks and competition with them - and that political sentiment on issues such as welfare and crime isn't as racially motivated as many liberal analysts assume. A focus on the South also eclipses places where low-income whites consist mainly of descendants of later European immigrants. (Think of the South Boston Irish, or Baltimore's Polish American dockworkers depicted in the second season of \"The Wire.\")\n\nAs Isenberg's chronicle moves into the middle of the 20th century, she offers a fascinating account of how the trailer parks built to provide housing for war-industry workers gave rise to a whole new demeaning stereotype: trailer trash. She captures the reflexively pejorative depictions of poor southern whites during the civil-rights years. And she shows how, starting in the 1970s, the new preoccupation with ethnic heritage instilled a semi-ironic pride in \"redneck\" identity. The upgraded self-image prefigured the elevation of the \"white working class\" in the years to follow.\n\nBy the time her account reaches the late 20th century, though, the social and economic texture thins. Instead, Isenberg resorts to cataloguing representations of poor whites in pop culture (Deliverance, Hee Haw, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo) and celebrity politics (Tammy Faye Bakker, Bill Clinton, Sarah Palin), and offers some fairly trite commentary on the current political scene. Isenberg's history is a bracing reminder of the persistent contempt for the white under-class, but you will have to look elsewhere for insights into why the condition of this class has taken a turn for the worse - and what its members think of themselves, and of the elites who have trashed them for so long.\n\nTo have become a memoirist when he's barely cracked 30, J. D. Vance suggests at the outset of \"Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,\" is \"somewhat absurd\" - except that the result couldn't be better-timed. Vance's story amounts to a one-family composite of nearly all the worrisome trends affecting poor white Americans.\n\nThe cover image of a mountain cabin is slightly misleading. Vance's family straddles \"hillbillies\" who have remained in Appalachia and those whose ancestors left for work in the Midwest and are now struggling across the postindustrial flatlands. He still has relatives in Breathitt County, Kentucky, and feels a strong bond with that place. But most of the book is set where his grandparents moved decades ago and he grew up, the small manufacturing city of Middletown, in distinctly un-hilly southwestern Ohio.\n\nUnlike Isenberg, Vance subscribes fully to the notion of the Appalachian Scots-Irish as a distinct breed of low-income Americans who have brought their pugilistic ways with them wherever they have gone. His family fits the bill to the point of straining credulity. His beloved maternal grandmother, Mamaw, once nearly killed a man who stole the family's cow. His great-uncle forced a man who made a leering comment about the young Mamaw to eat her panties at knifepoint. Later, when Mamaw got angry that her husband, Papaw, had come home drunk again, she set him on fire. (One of their daughters put out the flames.) Papaw was no slouch himself, having once apparently killed a neighbor's dog by feeding it steak marinated in antifreeze after it nearly bit Vance's mom.\n\nBut Vance, a self-described conservative who has contributed to National Review, is not offering another lurid saga of hillbilly exploits. He is trying to figure out how things went wrong for his people. \"I am a hill person. So is much of America's white working class,\" he writes. \"And we hill people aren't doing very well.\"\n\nIn Vance's story, the troubles are embodied above all in one person: his mother. After graduating high school as the salutatorian, Bev became a teenage mother, as Mamaw had also been, and embarked on a string of marriages - five, at last count. She was bright - \"the smartest person I knew\" - and drilled the importance of reading and education into her son. She checked out library books on football strategy to get him to think more deeply about the game he loved, and revamped his third-grade science project the night before it was due, just like any suburban helicopter mom.\n\nBut her marriages were riven by fighting. She drank heavily, and became addicted to the painkillers she could pilfer in her job as a nurse, and later to heroin. Vance and his older sister were raised amid an extreme form of the instability and dysfunction that Charles Murray and Robert Putnam lament: He grew up with three stepfathers, and during one two-year stretch he lived in four houses. At one low point, when he was 12, his mother was taken away in handcuffs after he fled to a stranger's house to escape a beating from her. At another point, she asked him to pee into a cup so she could use his urine to pass a drug test. \"Chaos begets chaos,\" he writes. \"Welcome to family life for the American hillbilly.\"\n\nVance survives this endless turbulence, thanks in large part to the tough love he receives from Mamaw, living nearby, who sees in him a chance to redeem her parenting failures with Bev. His grades are good enough to get him into the best state colleges in Ohio. But fearing that he isn't ready for unstructured campus life, he enlists in the Marine Corps, and gets a stint in Iraq and a large helping of maturity and perspective. After finishing his tour, he excels at Ohio State and, to his joyful amazement, is admitted to Yale Law School.\n\nWith the same appealing guilelessness that he brings to the story of his youthful ordeals, Vance describes the culture shock he experiences in New Haven. He doesn't know what to make of the endless \"cocktail receptions and banquets\" that combine networking and matchmaking. At the fancy restaurant where he's attending a law firm's recruitment dinner, he spits out sparkling water, having never drunk such a thing. He calls his girlfriend from the restroom to ask her, 'What do I do with all these damned forks?' \"\n\nHis estrangement often reflects poorly on the echelon he's joined, whose members, he says with understatement, could do a better job of \"opening their hearts and minds to\" newcomers. He is taken aback when law-school friends leave a mess at a chicken joint, and stays behind with another student from a low-income background, Jamil, to clean it up. \"People,\" he writes, \"would say with a straight face that a surgeon mother and engineer father were middle-class.\" To his astonishment, he is regarded as an exotic figure by his professors and classmates, simply by virtue of having come from a small town in the middle of the country, gone to a mediocre public high school, and been born to parents who didn't attend college.\n\nHe adapts to his new world well enough to land at a Washington, D.C., law firm and later in a court clerkship, and is today prospering as a principal at an investment firm in San Francisco. But the outsider feeling lingers - hearing someone use a big word like confabulate in conversation makes his blood rise. \"Sometimes I view members of the elite with an almost primal scorn,\" he admits. And questions nag at him: \"Why has no else from my high school made it to the Ivy League? Why are people like me so poorly represented in America's elite institutions?\" He is acutely aware of how easily he could have been trapped, had it not been for the caring intervention he received at key moments from people like Mamaw and his sister. \"Thinking about ... how close I was to the abyss, gives me chills. I am one lucky son of a bitch.\" He asks: How much of our lives, good and bad, should we credit to our personal decisions, and how much is just the inheritance of our culture, our families, and our parents who have failed their children? How much is Mom's life her own fault? Where does blame stop and sympathy begin?\n\nVance's answers read like works in progress: His passages of general social commentary could have benefited from longer gestation, and are strongest when grounded in his biography. He is well aware of the larger forces driving the cultural decline he deplores. He knows how much of the deterioration in Middletown can be traced to the shrinkage of the big Armco steel-rolling mill that, during World War II, drew so many Appalachians - including Papaw - to the town. His tales of the increasingly\nrarefied world of elite education offer good evidence for why \"many people in my community began to believe that the modern American meritocracy was not built for them.\"\n\nBut he also sees the social decline in personal terms, as a weakening of moral fiber and work ethic. He describes, for instance, working at a local grocery store, where he \"learned how people gamed the welfare system\":\n\nThey'd buy two dozen-packs of soda with food stamps and then sell them at a discount for cash. They'd ring up their orders separately, buying food with food stamps, and beer, wine, and cigarettes with cash ... Most of us were struggling to get by, but we made do, worked hard, and hoped for a better life. But a large minority was content to live off the dole. Every two weeks, I'd get a small paycheck and notice the line where federal and state income taxes were deducted from my wages. At least as often, our drug-addict neighbor would buy T-bone steaks, which I was too poor to buy for myself but was forced by Uncle Sam to buy for someone else.\n\nAs Vance notes, resentment of this sort - which surfaces again and again in his book - helps explain why voters in the world he came from have largely abandoned the Democrats, the party of the social safety net.\n\nNor is the animus new: Isenberg traces it back to the days when poor Southerners were scorned for availing themselves of the aid extended to freed slaves - and joined in the scorn as soon as they escaped the dole. \"The same self-made man who looked down on white trash others had conveniently chosen to forget that his own parents escaped the tar-paper shack only with the help of the federal government,\" she writes. \" 'Upscale rednecks' had no trouble spotting those below them in their rearview mirrors.\" In Vance's book, those \"below\" are mostly fellow whites and the resentment is not primarily racially motivated, as many liberals would have one believe of all anti-welfare sentiment.\n\nVance does not pivot from such observations to a full-blown indictment of social-welfare programs. He isn't ready to join the Republican chorus that blames the government (and specifically the black president who now heads it) for all ills. But he zealously subscribes to its corollary: The government, in his view, can't possibly cure those ills. In a summary that borders on the polemical, he exhorts the \"broad community of hillbillies\" to \"wake the hell up\" and seize control of its fate.\n\nPublic policy can help, but there is no government that can fix these problems for us ... Mamaw refused to purchase bicycles for her grandchildren because they kept disappearing - even when locked up - from her front porch. She feared answering her door toward the end of her life because an able-bodied woman who lived next door would not stop bothering her for cash - money, we later learned, for drugs. These problems were not created by governments or corporations or anyone else. We created them, and only we can fix them.\n\nVance's intentions here are sincere and understandable. He's tired of folks back home talking big about hard work when they are collecting checks just like the people they denigrate - tired of \"the lies we tell ourselves.\" He's fed up with the quick resort to political blame, like the acquaintance in Middletown who told him that he had quit work because he was sick of waking up early but then declared on Facebook that it was the \"Obama economy\" that had set him back. \"Whenever people ask me what I'd most like to change about the white working class,\" writes Vance, \"I say, 'The feeling that our choices don't matter.' \"\n\nHe is wrong, though, that the burden of fixing things falls entirely on his people. The problems he describes - the reasons life in Middletown got tougher for his mom's generation than it was for Mamaw and Papaw when they came north for work - have plenty to do with decisions by \"governments or corporations.\" The government and corporations have presided over the rise of new monopolies, the effect of which has been to concentrate wealth in a handful of companies and regions. The government and corporations welcomed China into the World Trade Organization; more and more economists now believe that move hastened the erosion of American manufacturing, by encouraging U.S. companies to shift operations offshore. The government and corporations each did their part to weaken organized labor, which once boosted wages and strengthened the social fabric in places like Middletown. More recently, the government has accelerated the decline of the coal industry, on environmentally defensible grounds but with awfully little in the way of remedies for those affected.\n\nEven at the edges, solutions lie within the purview of the powers that be - such as allowing Medicaid expansion to proceed in the South and expanding access to medication-assisted treatment to help people like Vance's mother get off heroin. Yes, aid should be tailored to avoid the sort of resentment that Vance felt at the grocery store. At moments, he seems to acknowledge a role for taxpayer-funded compassion. \"The best way to look at this might be to recognize that you probably can't fix these things,\" a friend who worked at the White House once told him. \"They'll always be around. But maybe you can put your thumb on the scale a little for the people at the margins.\"\n\nPerhaps you can even put your whole hand on the scale. One of the most compelling parts of Isenberg's history is her account of the help delivered to struggling rural whites as part of the New Deal. Projects like the Resettlement Administration, led by Rexford Tugwell, which moved tenants to better land and provided loans for farm improvements, brought real progress. So did the Tennessee Valley Authority, which not only spurred development of much of the South but created training centers and entire planned towns - towns where hill children went to school with engineers' kids. The New Deal had its flops. But men like Tugwell recognized that citizens in some places were slipping badly behind, and that their plight represented a powerful threat to the country's founding ideals of individual self-determination and advancement.\n\nA case can be made that the time has arrived for a major undertaking in, say, the devastated coal country of central Appalachia. How much to invest in struggling regions themselves, as opposed to making it easier for those who live in them to seek a livelihood elsewhere, is a debate that needs to happen. But the obligation is there, as it was 80 years ago. \"We think of the left-behind groups as extinct,\" Isenberg writes, \"and the present as a time of advanced thought and sensibility. But today's trailer trash are merely yesterday's vagrants on wheels, an updated version of Okies in jalopies and Florida crackers in their carts. They are renamed often, but they do not disappear.\"\n\nExcept they are now further out of sight than ever. As Isenberg documents, the lower classes have been disregarded and shunted off for as long as the United States has existed. But the separation has grown considerably in recent years. The elite economy is more concentrated than ever in a handful of winner-take-all cities - as Phillip Longman recently noted in the Washington Monthly, the per capita income of Washington, D.C., in 1980 was 29 percent above the average for Americans as a whole; in 2013, that figure was 68 percent. In the Bay Area, per capita income jumped from 50 percent to 88 percent above average over that period; in New York, from 80 percent to 172 percent. As these gaps have grown, the highly educated have become far more likely than those lower down the ladder to move in search of better-paying jobs.\n\nThe clustering is intensifying within regions, too. Since 1980, the share of upper-income households living in census tracts that are majority upper-income, rather than scattered throughout more mixed-income neighborhoods, has doubled. The upper echelon has increasingly sought comfort in prosperous insularity, withdrawing its abundant social capital from communities that relied on that capital's overflow, and consolidating it in oversaturated enclaves.\n\nSo why are white Americans in downwardly mobile areas feeling a despair that appears to be driving stark increases in substance abuse and suicide? In my own reporting in Vance's home ground of southwestern Ohio and ancestral territory of eastern Kentucky, I have encountered racial anxiety and antagonism, for sure. But far more striking is the general aura of decline that hangs over towns in which medical-supply stores and pawn shops dominate decrepit main streets, and Victorians stand crumbling, unoccupied. Talk with those still sticking it out, the body-shop worker and the dollar-store clerk and the unemployed miner, and the fatalism is clear: Things were much better in an earlier time, and no future awaits in places that have been left behind by polished people in gleaming cities. The most painful comparison is not with supposedly ascendant minorities - it's with the fortunes of one's own parents or, by now, grandparents. The demoralizing effect of decay enveloping the place you live cannot be underestimated. And the bitterness - the \"primal scorn\" - that Donald Trump has tapped into among white Americans in struggling areas is aimed not just at those of foreign extraction. It is directed toward fellow countrymen who have become foreigners of a different sort, looking down on the natives, if they bother to look at all.\n\nAlec MacGillis\n\nI have been reporting for ProPublica since 2015, most recently covering the post-pandemic schools crisis.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "PUBLIC OPINION: Liberals\n\nFollow @TIME\n\n(3 of 3)\n\nGloom. A captiously critical man reading the New Republic's Promise of \nAmerican Life might define a liberal as one in a gloomy state of mind. \nPromise of the U. S. looked dim to some of its 16 contributors, was \nwell-nigh invisible to others, was in imminent danger of destruction \n(Liberal Lewis Mumford), depended on the will to believe (Poet \nArchibald MacLeish), was no joyous, blithe, cheery, inextinguishable \nprospect to any one of them. Reading from sombre Right to dismayed \nLeft, it depended on progressive education to Progressive Educator \nWilliam H. Kilpatrick, on Labor's political role to Labor Leader \nSidney Hillman.\n\nUneasily Editor Bliven admitted that \"For the first time in our history, \nAmerican optimism. . . has been seriously challenged\" -seldom so \neffectively as by the New Republic. Deepest gloom was expressed by \nVincent Sheean, who wrote of social progress as Soviet Russia (often \nviewed tolerantly in the New Republic] has achieved it: \"The human and \neconomic waste has been colossal, more, probably, than any nation has \never known in twenty years of its history; and the enslavement of the \nproletariat and the peasantry, which no longer have even the right of \nmovement from one part of the same district to another, is without \nparallel in the records of mankind.\"\n\nVictory? Last week's 25th anniversary cast much light on liberals' \ndilemma, made the New Republic's 25th anniversary indicative of U. S. \nliberalism as a whole. Plain was it that after Herbert Croly's death in \n1930 editors had tried to keep his tradition alive. Equally plain was \nit that the New Republic, like most liberals, had plumped more & more \nfor specific liberal reforms, had hammered less & less at the old Croly \nvision of liberalism as a basic, unifying, cultural belief.\n\nAs a practical political program, modern liberalism is crammed to \noverflowing with the souvenirs of old minority causes-distrust of big \nbusiness, inherited from the trustbusters and western populists, and \nnewly polished by Marxists; fear of political corruption, handed down \nby the muckrakers. And liberals, now as 25 years ago, generally hold \nto the right of labor to organize, watch for violations of civil \nliberties. But more & more liberals have found Communists initiating \nmovements, unearthing scandals, doing more & more of the drudgery of \nreform, while liberals merely passively approved, passively \ndisapproved.\n\nLast week Liberal Charles Beard gloomily pointed the paradox: in \npractical reforms, liberals had won what they were fighting for in \n1914, were now gloomier than ever. The U. S. had, said Dr. Beard: woman \nsuffrage, old age pensions, public development of waterpower sites, a \nnational highway system, an anti-injunction act, the Wagner Labor \nRelations Act. That liberals are now dismayed, confused, unhopeful, \nstoic at their strongest, despairing at their weakest, looked like the \nsurest proof of Founder Croly's basic belief: that liberalism had to be \na great spiritual force or the practical reforms it won would not be \nworth the victory."

      "text": "Why the Polls May Be Feeding Liberals Another Blue Mirage\n\nThis article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nThe easiest explanation for a natural mirage is that light moves faster through hot air than cold air, and rays will bend to find the path of least resistance. Phantom sightings of watering holes in deserts, for instance, are as encouraged by the psyche as the physics of light on the horizon chasing hotter air. Desert mirages are something of a lazy trope in cartoons, but the phenomenon happens plenty in politics, too, and some Democrats are worrying that they're seeing oases where none may exist. The source of those illusions? All those polls suggesting President Joe Biden's party may not be as screwed as they had thought.\n\nBy historical benchmarks , Democrats should definitely be in trouble. Since World War II-with one exception, after 9/11-the party in power at the White House gets flayed in their first at bat with voters picking their members of the House. It doesn't matter if it's Ronald Reagan in 1982 or Bill Clinton in 1994; the first term of a President leaves the electorate ready to reject the latest experiment.\n\nAt the moment, though, there are at least some cold pockets of air that suggest the recent optimism coming from the Democratic side may not be just figments of liberal imaginations. While the money race is competitive and the feeling in the field is that the ground games on both sides are evenly matched, Republicans are stumbling toward the general election with some lousy nominees , particularly for Senate.\n\nNowhere is the faith in the mirage more pronounced than in polling, a political junky's favorite cheap buzz. Spend any time looking at the numbers these days and you're likely seeing positive trends for Democratic candidates. Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Michael Bennet of Colorado, and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire have consistently led their Republican challengers. Pennsylvania seems increasingly tough for GOP nominee Dr. Mehmet Oz , while Wisconsin is, by all signs, a true jump-ball race between incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson and the Democrat, Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes. Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock and Catharine Cortez Masto are inches ahead of their rivals in Georgia and Nevada. And in Ohio, Florida , and North Carolina , states where Donald Trump won by 8 points, 3 points, and 1 point, respectively, the Democratic candidates for Senate remain within striking distance.\n\nSo why aren't Democrats giddy? Put simply: responsible Democrats know they have been here before-seeing the palm trees in the desert, ordering cocktails with matching umbrellas-and walked away big losers.\n\nThe perceived flaws in polling have been manifest in conversations about recent elections. In recent cycles, pollsters supposedly missed the silent Trump supporters who either refused to participate in surveys or lied about their true allegiances. Pew's deep dive into the problem is a must-read for why nuance matters a ton in this space. Even though the polls were collectively off by about four points, according to an industry autopsy , they weren't entirely afield; they just missed some of the shading. Still, the hue matters when billions of dollars, control of Washington, and maybe the future of democracy itself is in the balance.\n\n(Also, don't discount the political impact of COVID-19 during the 2020 cycle. That was a huge pocket of icy air that bent a lot of perceptions, created plenty of mirages, and, according to a government report , changed votes.)\n\nThese concerns about an over-reliance on polling isn't new. Some have suggested it's time for all of us to quit being polling junkies hooked on the heroin of crosstabs. Others have said the polls themselves are in need of a complete overhaul, or should be abandoned entirely.\n\nTempting, sure. But maybe the answer is a more-informed use of the numbers.\n\nArmchair pundits have invested far too much confidence in surveys that-by their very definition -have a baked-in margin of error, and expectations that occasionally a garbage reading gets taken. In that, it's on the consumer to understand the product; no one would blame Elon Musk for someone who drove their Tesla into the sea to find it didn't float. Similarly, blaming pollsters for their output when it is misapplied isn't fair.\n\nThat said, the polls could be off once again, and maybe even worse than in 2020, which was the biggest polling misfire since 1980. Even the most seasoned pollsters concede their work in recent years has missed parts of the electorate.

Half of the people are drowned and the other half are swimming in the wrong direction.\" For a lot of D.C. this election season, there's a whole lot of overlap in those two groups.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

If the Liberals do get back on their feet after more\nthan 40 years in eclipse, it will be almost entirely through Grimond's\nleadership. A ruggedly handsome man with a wayward lock of grey hair,\nGrimond, 49, is not so much a policymaker as a popularizer with a flair\nfor making the party's traditional championship of free enterprise and\nindividual liberties seem timely to young citizens of Britain's welfare\nstate. Grimond (pronounced Grimm-ond) is a tireless organizer who\nshuttles up to 80,000 miles a year between London, Liberal outposts and\nhis far-flung constituency of Orkney and Shetland, a storm-battered\n20-island chain in the North Atlantic, where he campaigns by motor\nlaunch and shanks' mare.\n\nLike Harold Macmillan, Grimond is a Scot who attended Eton and won a\nscholarship to Oxford's austere Balliol College -and, like the Prime\nMinister, he is wedded to his work. Grimond's wife Laura is the\ndaughter of Lady Violet Bonham Carter, perennial high priestess of the\nLiberal Party, and herself the daughter of Lord Asquith, who in 1908\nbecame Prime Minister in the party's last elected government.

The confident, well-disciplined party at\nLlandudno last week suggested that it could at least hold the balance\nof power in an electorate that is increasingly bored with the Tories\nand mistrustful of the Socialists.

      "text": "How Liberal Blunders Handed the Right the Supreme Court\n\nA s the Supreme Court launches a new term, it remains dominated by a 6-3 super-majority that has ushered in one of the most conservative eras in the institution's history. In recent years, the justices have overturned key precedents on abortion , gun rights , and the power of federal regulators while forging a groundbreaking path in areas spanning religious liberty , presidential immunity , and other fields that have damaged the Court's reputation and instigated calls for reforms .\n\nThe lurch to the right is the culmination of a more than 50-year transformation. Most Americans are familiar with the latest chapters of that story. Senate Republicans, for example, used unprecedented tactics to prevent Democratic President Barack Obama from filling the Supreme Court seat of the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. They justified the move by claiming that a seat should not be filled in the final months of a presidential term. Four years later, however, they flipped positions and rushed the conservative Amy Coney Barrett through the confirmation process after liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died months before the end of Republican Donald Trump's presidential term.\n\nYet, most Americans do not know that the seeds of this warfare over the Court were not planted by conservatives in recent years, but by liberals in the late 1960s. Through a combination of hubris, miscalculation, and poor timing, they squandered a majority that could have remained intact for decades to come, giving way to the conservative counter-revolution that continues to dramatically reshape American law.\n\nThat hubris was on full display when Lyndon Johnson eyed the high court months after his landslide victory in 1964. Eager to extend the Warren Court's liberal jurisprudence and fearful that his Great Society might suffer the fate of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal initiatives at the hands of conservative jurists, Johnson resolved to maintain the institution's ideological bent.\n\nTo accomplish this task, he sought to do the impossible-remove a sitting justice to make room for his close friend and counselor, Abe Fortas. Fortas was a brilliant attorney renowned for winning the landmark case Gideon v. Wainright , which expanded the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel to state prosecutions.\n\nIn 1965, the news of Justice Arthur Goldberg's frustration with the Court's tepid pace, which couldn't match the rush Goldberg had felt as a former union negotiator and Labor Secretary, gave Johnson an opening. Exploiting the justice's patriotism and ego, he offered Goldberg the ambassadorship to the U.N., along with a promise that the justice would be his point man on Vietnam. To sweeten the offer, Johnson vowed to make Goldberg a \"second secretary of state.\" Though never intending to keep these promises, Johnson even dangled the prospect of adding the justice to his ticket in 1968 as a final inducement. Goldberg succumbed within days.\n\nJohnson then coaxed Fortas, who preferred to maintain his lucrative private legal practice, into accepting the appointment. Having endured Johnson's full-court press, Goldberg presciently told his clerks: \"He's going to wear him down.\" To overcome Fortas' repeated refusals, Johnson asked his friend to visit the White House and then sprung the news that they were headed to a press conference to announce Fortas' appointment. \"To the best of my knowledge... I never said yes\" Fortas later proclaimed-but he found himself on the Court all the same.\n\nJohnson's next move was just as cunning. To dislodge Tom Clark, a center-right justice , Johnson appointed the justice's son, Ramsey, to lead the Justice Department in 1967, knowing that the senior Clark would resign rather than risk a conflict of interest that could impede his son's advancement.\n\nAt that point, Johnson's reengineering of the Court looked like a masterclass in Machiavellian scheming. Though Goldberg and Fortas were ideologically comparable, replacing Clark with Thurgood Marshall created a 6-3 liberal bloc capable of perpetuating the Warren Court for years to come.\n\nYet, what might have been the next chapter in cementing the liberal dominance of the Court instead proved to be the beginning of its undoing. In June 1968, Chief Justice Earl Warren decided to retire because he was convinced that Richard Nixon would win the presidency. Warren \"detested\" his fellow Californian with an \"abiding passion\" and feared Nixon would dismantle the Warren Court's revolutionary legacy .\n\nJohnson ignored the plethora of names suggested to him, which included Texas Governor John Connally, Attorney General Clark, Goldberg, and others. Instead, he selected Fortas to be chief justice and Homer Thornberry, an old friend serving as a federal appeals court judge, for Fortas' seat. In doing so, Johnson rejected Defense Secretary Clark Clifford's suggestion of pairing Fortas with a moderate Republican to secure GOP support. \"I don't intend to put some damned Republican on the Court,\" Johnson fired back at Clifford.\n\nThe choice of the Texan Thornberry was intended to appease conservative Southern Democrats-the Warren Court's biggest critics. When an aide warned that Thornberry and Fortas would be ripe for charges of cronyism, the president mocked his calculations: \"What political office did you ever get elected to?\"\n\nTo secure the nominations, Johnson attained personal guarantees from the Senate's two most powerful members, Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, and Richard Russell, the long-time leader of the Southern Democrats. Backed by Johnson-the one time \"Master of the Senate\"-and having been easily confirmed in 1965, Fortas' ascension seemed like a foregone conclusion .\n\nTo the surprise of the Washington establishment, however, a coalition led by a Republican odd couple-ardent segregationist Strom Thurmond, and Robert Griffin, a centrist from Michigan- shattered the well-established norms governing judicial appointments to upend the nominations.\n\nThe rebels savvily allied themselves with the Southern Democrats to organize the first filibuster against a Court nominee. Initially, they galvanized the opposition with the then-novel argument that since it was an election year, the next president, not the \"lame duck\" Johnson, ought to name the new chief justice.\n\nGaining momentum, their attacks grew more strident. Fortas' foes labeled him a crony for serving as the president's advisor, questioned his ethics by pointing to oversized payments for a teaching position, and welcomed social conservatives to tar him as a patron of criminals and pornographers.\n\nThurmond's histrionics reached their apogee when, screaming from the dais during Fortas' confirmation hearings, he accused the nominee of inciting criminals to \"commit rapes.\" His most unorthodox exploit involved the airing of adult movies the Court had shielded from censors. The unprecedented spectacle mockingly named the \" Fortas Film Festival \" was the last straw that doomed the justice's candidacy.\n\nThe failure exposed Johnson's miscalculations . Contrary to what he had envisioned, Thornberry's selection failed to pacify the Southern Democrats. And by picking Fortas rather than a centrist or someone not already sitting on the Court, Johnson unwittingly gave the Warren Court's enemies a prime target.\n\nEven more surprisingly, for a president revered for bending the Senate to his will, he failed to rally the chamber's liberals angered over his handling of the Vietnam War. The final blow came when his two long-time friends, Dirksen and Russell, abandoned Johnson, the latter in a pique over Ramsey Clark's handling of a district court judgeship.\n\nAfter a May 1969 LIFE article exposed a short lived dubious financial arrangement between Fortas and a white-collar criminal, Warren pressured him into resigning to preserve the Court's integrity. Upon Warren's retirement a few weeks afterwards, the liberal hold over the institution was over after 30 years.\n\nIt would take more than two decades for conservatives to seize firm control of the Court and another three to reach today's commanding super-majority. Along the way, Republicans suffered numerous setbacks, highlighted by Robert Bork's botched nomination in 1987 and the liberal turn taken by Justices Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, and David Souter. The abrupt shift in the Court's ideological make-up in 1969, however, allowed the right to lay the foundation for the long-term transformation of the judicial body into a conservative stronghold.\n\nThe demise of the Court's liberal majority is littered with what-ifs. Justices Hugo Black and William Douglas had been on the Court for more than a quarter century by the mid-1960s (and Black was 80 years old). What if they had retired during Johnson's presidency rather than serve until infirmity forced their resignations at moments when Republicans occupied the White House?\n\nWhat if Clark had acquiesced to Russell's judicial pick, thereby keeping the head of the Southern Democrats in Fortas' camp? What if Warren had retired earlier, when Johnson's power was at its apex, or hadn't driven Fortas from the Court for his ethical lapse? What if Johnson hadn't duped Goldberg into resigning in 1965 or if he had tried to reinstall the former justice on the Court in 1968?\n\nAt the center of all of this was Johnson's blundering. In his memoir, the former president admitted he \"feared... a conservative Court.\" Yet, in trying to prevent it, he instead helped foster the creation of the very thing he feared.\n\nMichael Bobelian is a journalist who has written about the Supreme Court, legal affairs, and history for the Washington Post , Los Angeles Times , Forbes.com , and other publications.

President George Meany bluntly scored some U.S. liberals \nand international neutralists for avoiding the facts of 20th century \npolitical life. Excerpts:\n\n\"Too many in the free world fail to see the real nature of Communism as \nthe mortal foe of everything that we hold dear, of every moral and \nspiritual value. Too many are still prisoners of the illusion that \nCommunism is, historically speaking, a progressive system . . . extreme \nliberalism temporarily making bad mistakes. Actually, Communism \nrepresents darkest reaction. It is an anti-social system in which there \nare embedded some of the worst features of savagery, slavery, feudalism \nand life-sapping exploitation manifested in the industrial revolution \nof early-day capitalism.\n\n\"Too many in the free world seem to have lost their capacity for moral \nindignation against the most brutal inhumanities when they are \nperpetrated by Communists. It is painful, but we must face the cruel \nfacts of life. It is disturbing to me that many people in our country \nwho call themselves liberals are stone silent about the Soviet \nconcentration camps. They never find the time to utter a word of \ncondemnation against the Communist imperialist destruction of the \nnational independence and democratic rights of hundreds of millions of \npeople in Europe and Asia.\n\n\"One would expect the true liberal to cry out in protest. Communism is \nthe deadliest enemy of liberalism. Liberals should be the most \nconsistent and energetic fighters against Communism. Liberals must also \nbe on guard against developing a certain type of McCarthyism of their \nown. They must shun like a plague the role of being anti \nantiCommunist. Only by refusing to be thus entrapped can liberals shed \nevery vestige of subconscious and conscious regard for Communism as a \nmovement with which they have something in common.\n\n\"No country, no people, no movement can stand aloof and be neutral. \nNehru and Tito are not neutral. They are aides and allies [of the \nCommunists] in fact and in effect, if not in diplomatic verbiage.\n\n\"The conflict between Communism and freedom is the problem of our time. \nIt overshadows all other problems. This conflict mirrors our age, its \ntoils, its tensions, its troubles and its tasks. On the outcome of this \nconflict depends the future of all mankind. I pray that, on the \nthreshold of the atomic age, we of the free world can muster the moral \ncourage and total strength to preserve peace and promote the freedom of \nthe men and women of every continent, color and creed.\""

      "text": "What Liberals Don't Understand About Income Inequality\n\nB laming the success of America's 1% for the slow growth of middle- and working-class incomes leads to policies that slow an already slow-growing economy. A shortage of properly trained talent and risk-taking limit the growth of America's innovation-driven economy. In those circumstances, growth can manifest itself as an increase in employment or an increase in wages.\n\nWhen America spreads talent and entrepreneurial risk-taking over a greater number of workers, it slows middle- and working-class productivity and wage growth. U.S. employment has grown twice as fast as Germany and France, and three-times faster than Japan since 1980. America is now home to 40 million foreign-born adults, their 20 million native-born adult children and their 20 million children-a large share of America's 325 million people. Despite this influx of workers, median disposable incomes are 15% to 30% higher than Germany, France and Japan, and have grown faster than these countries since the mid-1990s. Without the disproportionate contribution of American-made innovation, European and Japanese growth would have been even slower.\n\nAmerica has produced a disproportionate share of innovation with a smaller share of high-scoring workers. Twenty-five percent of Americans earn high academic scores , compared to more than 35% of Germans, 40% of Scandinavians, and nearly 50% of Japanese. High-earning Americans work longer hours, take more entrepreneurial risks and produce more innovation than their counterparts elsewhere. Despite the supposed success of Scandinavia, Scandinavian-Americans earn 50% more than their counterparts in Scandinavia.\n\nAmerica's entrepreneurial success gradually creates assets that accelerate its growth. Companies, like Facebook, provide Americans with valuable on-the-job training. Those workers coalesce into synergistic communities of experts, like Silicon Valley. Success puts money into the pockets of successful risk-takers. They use their equity and expertise to underwrite risks that accelerate growth. These assets raise the productivity of American innovators and increase the certainty of their success. Given the faster growth of these American assets, it's hard to believe higher and more certain payoffs for risk-taking don't gradually motive talented workers to get the training and take the risks that produce innovation, growth, employment, and higher wages.\n\nInstead, advocates of redistribution cavalierly diminish the importance of incentives. They claim the success of America's 1% stems from rising cronyism despite overwhelming evidence that the status quo has grown less entrenched. Seventy percent of the wealth of the top 0.1% is owned by self-employed business owners who bested competitors to satisfy customers, not cronies, to earn their success. Today, the Forbes 400 richest Americans are \"less likely to have inherited their wealth or to have grown up wealthy\" and \"more likely to have started their businesses.\" Similarly, average CEO tenures have shortened . Public company CEO pay has not risen faster than private company pay where owners, not cronies, control boards. Nor has CEO pay risen faster than the value of the companies they manage. Instead, the rise in CEO pay comes almost entirely from the formation of new companies with high employee pay rather than from increased CEO pay relative to their employees.\n\nFailing these arguments, some insist rising company profits stem from a lack of competition that puts money in the pockets of investors at the expense of customers. They point to evidence showing \"two-thirds of all publicly traded companies operated in more highly concentrated markets in 2013 than they did in 1996.\" But the turnover of the S&P 500 has accelerated. And a 2015 McKinsey study finds that the share of profits generated by idea-intensive companies has grown from 17% of profits in 1999 to 31% today while \"companies in capital-intensive industries are feeling a growing squeeze.\"\n\nThe IT sector is in turmoil, the opposite of an entrenched status quo. The 15 largest technology companies in 2000 have lost 60% of their market value, while 15 companies with combined market capitalization less than $10 billion in 2000 are now worth over $2 trillion. Despite these one-in-a-million successes, the Kauffman Foundation finds : \"[venture capital] returns haven't significantly outperformed the public market since the late 1990s.\"\n\nCrony capitalism exists. But growing inequality is caused, not by rising cronyism, but by America deploying its properly trained talent and risk-taking more effectively than other economies.\n\nThe challenge facing America today is not how to defeat the success that brought it here, but how to accelerate growth, employment, and wages in an economy with a near-unlimited supply of low-skilled labor. To raise low-skilled wages, without slowing GDP growth, America must increase the ratio of high to low-skilled workers. Throttling back low-skilled immigration might increase wages, but the cost of retiring baby boomers and the growing military threat of China loom large. Japan, for example, is expected to lose a third of its population by 2060. A better strategy trains America's talent to be more effective, recruits ultra-high-skilled talent from abroad, lowers taxes on American-based international competitors, and restrains perennial trade deficits without restraining trade.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "How Liberal White America Turned Its Back on James Baldwin in the 1960s\n\nIn discussions about race relations today, the works of James Baldwin continue to speak to the present, even decades after they were written. So it is worth remembering that, at the very height of his influence, Baldwin experienced the same frustration that some Black activists, particularly on campus, feel about white liberals today: their refusal to acknowledge their complicity in the regime of white supremacy. In Baldwin's case, the liberal backlash was widespread, and effectively marginalized him for a time.\n\nThe very first piece on the front page of the very first issue of The New York Review of Books , Feb. 1, 1963, was a review of Baldwin's The Fire Next Time by F. W. Dupee of the Columbia English department. Dupee (a former Communist Party organizer) took exception to Baldwin's apocalyptic tone. \"Do I really want to be integrated into a burning house?\" Baldwin had written. The answer, Dupee wrote, is that \"[s]ince you have no other, yes; and the better-disposed firemen will welcome your assistance.\"\n\nBaldwin had abandoned criticism for prophecy and prescription for provocation, Dupee said. He was goading white racists, who were in a better position to cause trouble than Black people were, \"and it is unclear to me how The Fire Next Time , in its madder moments, can do nothing except inflame the former and confuse the latter.\" The point was repeated by Kenneth Rexroth in the San Francisco Examiner. The Fire Next Time , he wrote, \"is designed to make white liberals feel terribly guilty and to scare white reactionaries into running and barking fits.\"\n\nAt the end of the year, Baldwin participated in a Commentary symposium, \"Liberalism and the Negro.\" Baldwin's fellow symposiasts were Gunnar Myrdal, Nathan Glazer and Sidney Hook, the epitome of liberal integrationist opinion. It became a war almost from the start, and Baldwin's most persistent antagonist was Glazer. This was not surprising. Unlike the others, Glazer had worked in the American government. He served in the Housing and Home Finance Agency, precursor to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), when Kennedy was president, and he had just published, with Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Beyond the Melting Pot . Glazer had written most of the book, which was based on research into the conditions of ethnic groups in New York City. He must have felt entitled to believe that he had a better grasp of government programs and of the facts on the ground than Baldwin did.\n\nThe argument of Beyond the Melting Pot is that many Americans retain their ethnic identities regardless of the degree of their assimilation in other respects, and from this it followed that Black Americans should do the same-that is, they should become like other ethnic groups. The trouble, Glazer said, is that the Negro \"insists that the white world deal with his problems because, since he is so much the product of America, they are not his problems, but everyone's.\" But once he becomes willing to accept that he is a member of a group, he will be able to take responsibility for himself and other members of his community.\n\nBaldwin knew what he was in for, and he set the stakes early on. \"[T]o my mind, you see,\" he said, \"before one can really talk about the Negro problem in this country, one has got to talk about the white people's problem . . . There is a sense,\" he went on, \"in which one can say that the history of this country was built on my back.\" To the suggestion that he become a member of one of the ethnic groups competing for their share of the pie, his answer was: \"What pie are you talking about? From my own point of view, my personal point of view, there is much in that American pie that isn't worth eating.\"\n\nGlazer responded that it's not prejudice that slows racial progress as much as ignorance, incompetence, and bureaucratic inefficiency. \"[T]he problems are a product of the kind of unwieldy institutions we have,\" he told Baldwin, \"the kind of feudal country we have, the kind of recalcitrant special interests that have developed-among them Negro interests. And so we all fight it out.\"\n\nTo this kind of argument Baldwin's response was \"if you don't know what Ray Charles is singing about, then it is entirely possible that you can't help me.\" It is a good bet that none of the white men sitting around the table had ever willingly listened to Ray Charles. But they all wanted to help Black people, and they were being told that this was the reason they probably couldn't.\n\nWhite liberals who identified with the Kennedy Administration resented being told they were not \"getting it.\" But even white liberals who may have considered themselves politically purer of heart expressed impatience. With Baldwin, Susan Sontag wrote in The New York Review of Books, \"passion seemed to transmute itself too readily into stately language, into an inexhaustible self-perpetuating oratory.\"\n\nThe Commentary symposium was published in March, 1964. In August, Esquire ran a profile of Baldwin that had been commissioned by the magazine's editor, Harold Hayes, who thought that Baldwin's war on white liberals was absurd. The writer, Marvin Elkoff, dutifully portrayed Baldwin as mercurial and high-strung, and quoted him calling the white liberal \"blinder, more innocent and ignorant than the segregationist,\" and saying things like: \"If you don't realize that the same people who killed Kennedy also killed Medgar Evers, then you don't understand what is going on in the world.\" In the end, Elkoff concluded, \"everybody was playing his [Baldwin's] game, and of course not nearly as well . . . At bottom he is disaffiliated, a medium of emotion.\"\n\nAt Christmastime, Baldwin published a deluxe boxed coffee table book of photographs with his high school friend Richard Avedon, now a successful fashion photographer. Baldwin's essay is a cri de coeur on the banality of American life. It begins with despairing reflections on the artificiality of actors in television commercials and descends into musings like: \"When a civilization treats its poets with the disdain with which we treat ours, it cannot be far from disaster; it cannot be far from the slaughter of the innocents.\"\n\nThere is a way in which this boutique item, which does not present itself as a book about race, brings the precariousness of Baldwin's position into focus. When he said things like \"the history of this country was built on my back\" or, in a widely publicized debate with William F. Buckley at the Cambridge Union, \"I picked cotton, I carried it to the market, I built the railroads under someone else's whip,\" he was using an established conceit of group autobiography (as Malcolm X did in his autobiography, published in 1965.) The understanding is that if these things did not happen to the author, they happened to somebody like the author. The \"I\" stands for the group.\n\nWhite people don't write group autobiographies, however. It was not that people did not believe that when Baldwin lived in the United States, he had encountered racism and discrimination. It was that professionally, he had suffered no more, and arguably less, from efforts to censor him than, for instance, Norman Mailer or Henry Miller had. From the very beginning, he had been supported and promoted by powerful writers and editors, Black and white. He had written bestsellers: the only book that sold more copies than Another Country in 1963 was William Golding's Lord of the Flies . He wrote for Partisan Review and The New Yorker . He had been on the cover of TIME . He hung around with celebrities; he was rich; he had an entourage. And on top of all that, he had been living in Paris for eight years, and when the Montgomery bus boycott turned out to be a success, he turned up on the scene, in 1957, and started telling everyone what it was like to be Black in America.\n\nThe New York Review of Books was ready for Nothing Personal . The headline was \"Everybody Knows My Name,\" and the reviewer was Robert Brustein, who was soon to become dean of the Yale School of Drama: \"Now comes Richard Avedon, high-fashion photographer for Harper's Bazaar , to join these other outrage exploiters, giving the suburban clubwoman a titillating peek into the obscene and ugly faces of the mad, the dispossessed, and the great and neargreat [ sic ]-with James Baldwin interrupting from time to time, like a punchy and pugnacious drunk awakening from a boozy doze during a stag movie, to introduce his garrulous, irrelevant, and by now predictable comments on how to live, how to love, and how to build Jerusalem.\"\n\n\"[L]ending himself to such an enterprise,\" Brustein concluded, \"Baldwin reveals that he is now part and parcel of the very things he is criticizing.\" Baldwin was one of a handful of Black writers who had a white audience in 1963, and he lost it. He had set the bar higher than many white liberals were willing to jump.\n\nThis essay is adapted from Menand's new book, The Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold Wa r, published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Liberals Want to Overturn Citizens United. A New Study Shows Conservatives Do Too\n\nL iberals and conservatives overwhelmingly support a constitutional amendment that would effectively overturn the Supreme Court's seminal campaign finance decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , according to a new study from the University of Maryland and nonpartisan research group Voice of the People.\n\nThree-fourths of survey respondents - including 66 percent of Republicans and 85 percent of Democrats - back a constitutional amendment outlawing Citizens United .\n\nThe study also indicates that most Americans - 88 percent overall - want to reduce the influence large campaign donors wield over lawmakers at a time when a single congressional election may cost tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThat most Republican and Democratic voters want to amend the U.S. Constitution to limit big money's role in politics is notable because it's the \"most drastic step that can be taken,\" said Steven Kull , director of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy's Program for Public Consultation, which conducted the study.\n\nThe 2010 Citizens United decision specifically allowed corporations, unions and certain nonprofits to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for and against political candidates. It also gave rise to super PACs - lightly regulated political committees that have become major weapons in both state and federal politics.\n\nCandidates and political parties, meanwhile, may by law only accept limited contributions.\n\nOverturning Citizens United has been many liberals' dream for years, although it's highly unlikely to happen . The traditional route for amending the Constitution requires a vote of two-thirds of both the House and Senate, followed by ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures. The Constitution was last amended in 1992.\n\nMost survey respondents also support congressional action on money in politics that fell short of a constitutional amendment, such as a bill that required corporations and unions to report campaign spending to shareholders, members and the public in addition to disclosures they file with the Federal Election Commission .\n\nSome major corporations with household names indeed keep their political practices and spending quiet, such as Expedia, Garmin and Netflix, among others, according to a study by the nonpartisan Center for Political Accountability and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nA recent Center for Public Integrity analysis found that Congress has little appetite for passing laws addressing campaign cash: Of more than two dozen money in politics bills introduced early in the current congressional session, lawmakers have not conducted a single formal hearing or vote on any of them.\n\nLess than half of those surveyed consider an anti- Citizens United amendment to be an attack on free speech. More than four out of five agree with the statement that \"the rich should not have more influence just because they have more money.\"\n\nDavid Keating, president of the Institute for Free Speech, a conservative nonprofit, questioned the survey's findings.\n\n\"If Americans knew that repealing Citizens United would allow Congress to censor critics and make it more difficult to defeat corrupt incumbents then they'd be less likely to support it going away,\" Keating said. \"It's typical for academics to tout biased polls with questions that try to undermine support for free speech.\"\n\nAlthough Democrats typically tout reducing big money and eliminating secret money in politics, they don't always follow their own counsel.\n\nFor example, a Center for Public Integrity investigation revealed how a big-spending Democratic super PAC used a loophole in federal law to hide the identities of its donors until after Alabama's special U.S. Senate election in December. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also benefited from millions of dollars worth of so-called \" dark money .\"\n\nOne campaign finance reform that most survey respondents dismissed? Funding presidential campaigns with public money using a federal system that's largely fallen out of favor since the Citizens United decision. Two-thirds of respondents would prefer the federal government nix the checkbox on their tax forms that provides $3 to campaigns and instead direct the funds to other areas, such as pediatric research or deficit reduction.\n\nCampaign finance reform isn't the only thing voters on both sides of the aisle agree on: the University of Maryland found in a study late last year that Americans on the whole thought lawmakers should wait longer periods of time before cashing in on K Street as lobbyists.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "It's True: Liberals Like Cats More Than Conservatives Do\n\nI n January, TIME ran a 12-question quiz that guessed your politics based on things like your preference for cats versus dogs and the neatness of your desk. The survey's questions were all taken from previous research projects that found differences between liberals and conservatives on matters not directly related to politics. (You can still take the original quiz here .)\n\nMany readers were skeptical, to say the least. The comments section simmered with protests like \"Since WHEN does being a cat-lover make one a liberal?\" and \"Having a neat desk isn't political.\"\n\nLoving cats may not make a person a liberal, but it does increase the odds that a person already is one. To see how accurate our survey was, we analyzed the data from 220,192 TIME readers who took the quiz and then volunteered their actual political preferences, and found that all 12 items did in fact predict partisanship correctly.\n\nEven seemingly innocuous questions like ones about the state of one's desk or preference for fusion cuisine had at least modest predictive power. A majority of TIME readers, like a majority of Americans, prefer dogs to cats, but conservatives had a significantly stronger preference, on average.\n\nOverall, the quiz's predictions were quite accurate when compared to a respondent's self-reported ideology. (The correlation coefficient was 0.682, for those of you keeping score at home.) The individual questions varied in their predictive accuracy, from low (but non-negligible) correlation of 0.124 for the \"cats versus dogs\" question to 0.471 for the statement \"I'm proud of my country's history.\"\n\nWhen you add together a bunch of these modest predictors, you end up with a pretty good guess as to how a person votes. Not as good as asking people about their views on taxes, abortion and gun control, but enough to show that partisanship nowadays correlates with many non-political attitudes and behaviors.\n\nInterestingly, Libertarians-often considered as being on the political right-fell between the liberal and conservative extremes on most questions. Even when it came to an affinity for nature's truest libertarians: felines.\n\nWrite to Chris Wilson at chris.wilson@time.com"

      "text": "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics\n\nIf you had asked Canadians a few months ago who would win the country's next general election, most would have predicted a decisive victory for the Conservative Party.\n\nThat outcome does not look so certain now.\n\nIn the wake of US President Donald Trump's threats against Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party has surged in the polls, shrinking the double-digit lead their Conservative rivals had held steadily since mid-2023.\n\nThe dramatic change in the country's political landscape reflects how Trump's tariffs and his repeated calls to make Canada \"the 51st state\" have fundamentally altered Canadian voters' priorities.\n\nTrump's rhetoric has \"pushed away all of the other issues\" that were top of mind for Canadians before his inauguration on 20 January, notes Luc Turgeon, a political science professor at the University of Ottawa.\n\nIt has even managed to revive the once deeply unpopular Trudeau, whose approval rating has climbed by 12 points since December. The prime minister, of course, will not be in power for much longer, having announced his resignation at the start of the year.\n\nOn Sunday, his Liberals will declare the results of the leadership contest to determine who takes over a party running a precarious minority government. The new leader will have two immediate decisions to make: how to respond to Trump's threats, and when to call a general election. The answer to the first dilemma will surely influence the second.\n\nA federal election must be held on or before 20 October, but could be called as early as this week.\n\nPolls indicate that many Canadians still want a change at the top. But what that change would look like - a Liberal government under new leadership, or a complete shift to the Conservatives - is now anyone's guess, says Greg Lyle, president of the Toronto-based Innovative Research Group, which has been polling Canadians on their shifting attitudes.\n\n\"Up until now, it was a blowout for the Conservatives,\" he tells the BBC.\n\nThat is because the centre-right party led by Pierre Poilievre, has been effective in its messaging on issues that have occupied the Canadian psyche for the last few years: the rising cost of living, housing unaffordability, crime and a strained healthcare system.\n\nPoilievre successfully tied these societal problems to what he labelled Trudeau's \"disastrous\" policies, and promised a return to \"common sense politics\".\n\nBut with Trudeau's resignation, and Trump's threats to Canada's economic security and even its sovereignty, that messaging has become stale, Mr Lyle says. His polling suggests the majority of the country is now most afraid of Trump's presidency and the impact it will have on Canada.\n\nTrump's 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports to the US, some of which have been paused until 2 April, could be devastating for Canada's economy, which sends three-quarters of all its products to the US. Officials have predicted up to a million job losses as a result, and Canada could head into a recession if the tax on goods persists.\n\nTrudeau left no doubt how seriously he is taking the threat, when he told reporters this week that Trump's stated reason for the US tariffs - the flow of fentanyl across the border - was bogus and unjustified.\n\n\"What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,\" the prime minister warned.\n\n\"In many ways, it's an all encompassing, fundamental issue about the survival of the country,\" Prof Turgeon tells the BBC. Who is best placed to stand up for Canada against Trump has therefore become the key question in the forthcoming election.\n\nThe Conservatives are still ahead in the polls, with the latest averages suggesting 40% of voters back them. The Liberals' fortunes, meanwhile, have been revived, with their support climbing to slightly over 30% - up 10 points from January.\n\nLiberals have attempted to highlight similarities between the Conservative leader and Republican president. At last week's leadership debate, candidates referred to Poilievre as \"our little version of Trump here at home\" and said he was looking to \"imitate\" the US president. A Liberal Party attack ad juxtaposed clips of the two using similar phrases such as \"fake news\" and \"radical left\".\n\nThere are clear differences, however, between the two politicians, in terms of style and substance. And Trump himself has downplayed any parallels, telling British magazine The Spectator in a recent interview that Poilievre is \"not Maga enough\".\n\nStill, polls suggest a slipping of Conservative support. A recent poll by national pollster Angus Reid indicates Canadians believe Liberal leadership front-runner Mark Carney is better equipped to deal with Trump on issues of tariffs and trade than Poilievre.\n\nThe former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England is touting his experience dealing with economic crises, including the 2008 financial crash and Brexit.\n\nAnd the shift in the political mood has forced Conservatives to recalculate their messaging.\n\nIf the election is called soon, the campaign will take place at a moment when Trump's threats have inspired a fierce patriotism among Canadians. Many are boycotting American goods at their local grocery stores or even cancelling trips to the US.\n\nProf Turgeon says this \"rallying around the flag\" has become a key theme of Canadian politics.\n\nThe Conservatives have shifted away from their \"Canada is Broken\" slogan, which Mr Lyle says risked coming across as \"anti-patriotic\", to \"Canada First\".\n\nConservatives have also redirected their attacks towards Carney. Before Trump's tariffs, they ran ads saying he is \"just like Justin\" in an attempt to tie him to Trudeau. But in recent weeks, the Conservatives have started digging into Carney's loyalty to Canada.\n\nSpecifically, they have questioned whether he had a role in moving the headquarters of Brookfield Asset Management - a Canadian investment company - from Toronto to New York when he served as its chair.\n\nCarney has responded that he had left the firm by the time that decision was made, but company documents reported on by public broadcaster CBC show the board approved the move in October 2024, when Carney was still at Brookfield.\n\nThe move, and Carney's equivocation of his involvement with it, was criticised by the editorial board of Canada's national newspaper the Globe and Mail, which wrote on Thursday that Carney must be transparent with Canadians.\n\nMore broadly, the paper wrote: \"Every party leader must understand that Canada is entering a years-long period of uncertainty. The next prime minister will have to call on the trust of Canadians to lead the country where it needs to head but may not want to go.\"\n\nGiven the anxiety reverberating among Canadians, Mr Lyle says that any ambiguity about Carney's loyalty to the country could yet be damaging for him and the Liberals.\n\nWhenever the election comes, and whoever wins, one thing is certain: Trump will continue to influence and reshape Canadian politics just as he has in the United States.\n\nPolice say the suspect drove into pedestrians at Lapu Lapu celebrations in the western Canadian city.\n\nBlanchet has led Quebec's sovereigntist party since 2019, after spending time in provincial politics.\n\nAfter a campaign upended by Trump's threats, the Liberals hope they can hold onto power.\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Liberal? Are we talking about the same thing?\n\nBoth sides of the political spectrum lay claim to the word liberal, leaving us all in a muddle\n\nIs there a more elastic word in the English language than the word liberal?\n\nIs there a more abused, innocent, in-need-of-protection-from-bullies-word than the word liberal?\n\nOn either side of the Atlantic - for that matter, wherever English is spoken - liberal means whatever the speaker says it means, although that is often not what the hearer thinks it means. Confusion reigns.\n\nIn America, neo-conservatives call themselves neo-liberals when it comes to economic theory. They advocate liberal interventionism in foreign policy.\n\nLiberals in Britain find the phrase liberal intervention to be an oxymoron and cringe at the very idea of intervening in another country's affairs, no matter how vicious the regime.\n\nA couple of years ago, if you told an American that the Liberal Party was in power in Australia, the last thing he would have thought was that Liberal leader John Howard was a conservative slightly to the right of Ronald Reagan.\n\nIt must befuddle the bejesus out of fans of Rush Limbaugh - dean of America's influential right-wing talk radio - to think that Britain's Conservative Party, the party of Margaret Thatcher, is in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.\n\nFirst of all, for Rush that would be a redundant name. For them Liberal = Democrat.\n\nBut beyond that, Liberal = Socialist, and it is not possible to contemplate a coalition between Thatcher's party and socialists.\n\nAnd if you remind them that their other true British hero, Winston Churchill, started out a Conservative MP and then became a Liberal MP before returning to the Conservative fold, it absolutely makes their head spin.\n\nRonald Reagan was a true liberal. Discuss.\n\nThe reason for Churchill's change of allegiance was trade policy.  He was a free trader, but his Conservative colleagues believed in protective tariffs, so he crossed over to the Liberal benches in the House of Commons.\n\nThat happened around a century ago, and if you go back another century you get to the origins of the liberal confusion.\n\nAccording to most scholars, the word liberalism was first used in 1815 in English.\n\nIt comes from the Latin word liber , meaning free. That part is easy to understand.\n\nOf course, what it means to be free is hard to pin down, and the methods for ensuring that governments allow their citizens to be free is equally muddy.\n\nIn its early days, liberal was a word used by that new phenomenon, the capitalist, businessman, or entrepreneur.\n\nThese businessmen wanted to be free to conduct trade across borders without paying tariffs - taxes that often went to supporting the feudal aristocrats who still ruled in much of the continent.\n\nDemocracy, rather than inherited privilege, was a liberal cause.\n\nUS divisions over slavery was the start of the confusion\n\nEurope in the mid-19th Century was divided up into kingdoms and duchies. Uniting the people of a nation against this ancient order - nationalism - became a liberal cause.\n\nMany people were second-class citizens based on ancient religious antagonisms. Equality for all citizens became a liberal cause.\n\nHow to achieve liberal goals? In 1848, revolutions swept across Europe.\n\nTheir goals were by and large liberal. People wanted clear national borders and they wanted to be able to trade freely across them.\n\nThese revolutions were bloody at first, and so for some, liberal became closely linked with radical.\n\nThe revolutions ended in failure, but within two decades most of the liberal principles that had been fought for had become common.\n\nModern Germany and Italy had been created.\n\nStrong national movements in smaller countries were thriving.\n\nBut most of all, by the middle of the 19th Century, liberalism meant free trade.\n\nCertainly, that is what it meant for Britain's Liberal Party which tore itself out of the Conservative (Tory) Party shortly after the events of 1848.\n\nOver on the other side of the Atlantic, the word was not in use quite yet, but a massive wave of immigrants from Europe, fleeing the economic conditions that liberalism was not strong enough to fix, arrived in America.\n\nThey supported liberal ideas on personal freedom and infused them into America.\n\nA new party, the Republican Party, was founded in 1854 and drew immediate support from these immigrants.\n\nThe Republicans were against the slavery that underpinned the economy of the American South.\n\nHere is the source of modern confusion.\n\nThe South was against tariffs - a liberal position - but it was willing to fight to the death over the right to maintain slavery, as illiberal a position as it is possible to imagine.\n\nAnyway, from that moment to the present, the word has been bathed in controversy.\n\nNationalism is considered illiberal now. Liberals in America question free trade because it costs American workers their jobs.\n\nMaybe the word liberal can no longer stand on its own. Perhaps it is a weakness of the English language. Our language is wonderful for all manner of expression but on this it lacks subtlety.\n\nGerman might be more useful here. We could run several nouns together to form a single word that conveys our specific meaning: socialliberal or freetradeliberal might add clarity.\n\nEven better might be socialliberalsolongasitadvancesthe-interestsofmyethnicgroup or freetradeliberalsolongasitmakesme-richandifnotthenI'mprotectionist.\n\nI love the German language.\n\nWould Winston Churchill still be smiling if you called him a liberal?\n\nAnyway, the transatlantic confusion is not going away any time soon.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron is, by the current American usage of the word, a liberal.\n\nHe accepts the basic science surrounding climate change theories and is an advocate of gay rights. He even calls himself a progressive.\n\nThe word liberal has been so debased in America by right-wing demagogues that liberals have for at least two decades preferred to call themselves progressives.\n\nIt really is confusing - although perhaps the real transatlantic confusion is not over the meaning of the word liberal but over the meaning of the word conservative.\n\nMichael Goldfarb , external is a journalist and broadcaster who has lived in London since 1985.

      "text": "Who is in the running to replace Trudeau as Liberal Party leader?\n\nCanada's governing Liberal Party will announce on Sunday who will take over from Justin Trudeau as leader, after a crucial vote that will change the face of Canadian politics.\n\nAbout 140,000 of the party's members have been voting for their preferred candidate, with results expected to be announced around 18:00 EDT (22:00 GMT).\n\nThe new leader will become the country's prime minister. But because the Liberals are a minority government, holding onto the top job will require winning a general election, which could be called in the coming weeks.\n\nWhoever replaces Trudeau will have to grapple with US President Donald Trump's threats against Canada, which include an escalating trade war and repeated calls to make the country the US's \"51st state\".\n\nThe issue has dominated the campaigns of all four candidates vying for the top job. Here's what to know about them.\n\nFormer Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney has pitched himself as a strong fiscal manager who can help countries navigate challenging times, including his own.\n\n\"I've helped manage multiple crises, and I've helped save two economies,\" he said in his campaign launch speech.\n\nWidely seen as the frontrunner for the job, he's sought to position himself as the man who can steer the country through the fallout caused by Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills,\" he said during a leadership debate last month.\n\nThe 59-year-old was born in Canada's Northwest Territories and grew up in Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nHe has sought to highlight his Canadian roots and paint himself as a political outsider.\n\nHe has served in recent months as a special economics adviser to Trudeau, and has long been considered a contender for the top job, though the Harvard graduate has never held public office.\n\nTrudeau himself admitted that he had long been trying to recruit Carney to his team.\n\nCarney tried to distance himself from the unpopular PM, saying he is \"not the only Liberal in Canada who believes that the prime minister and his team let their attention wander from the economy too often\". Trudeau's approval ratings have however improved since Trump's return to office.\n\nCarney brings with him expertise on environmental matters through his role as the United Nations special envoy on climate action, recently calling the goal of net zero \"the greatest commercial opportunity of our time\".\n\nHe is a champion of some Liberal policies that have been unpopular, like the federal carbon tax, the party's signature climate policy that critics argue is a financial burden for Canadians.\n\nHe has recently backed away from the policy, saying in May that it had \"served a purpose up until now\".\n\nHe has received a number of cabinet endorsements, including Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault and Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly.\n\nThe Toronto member of parliament became one of the most well-known members of Trudeau's team.\n\nWhile she had long been seen as a trusted senior official in his inner circle, a rift with the prime minister's office led to her recent abrupt resignation in December.\n\nThat was a blow to Trudeau's already-shaky hold on power, helping to usher in his own resignation.\n\nThe two disagreed on how to address President Trump's threat of tariffs, among other financial policies as Canada faced a C$60bn deficit ($42bn; £33bn).\n\nBorn to a Ukrainian mother in the western province of Alberta, the 56-year-old was a journalist before entering politics.\n\nShe entered the House of Commons in 2013 and two years later joined Trudeau's cabinet with a trade brief after he swept the party to power.\n\nAs Minister of Foreign Affairs she helped Canada renegotiate a free trade deal with the US and Mexico.\n\nShe was later named deputy prime minister and minister of finance and oversaw Canada's financial response to the Covid pandemic.\n\nA 2019 Globe and Mail profile said depending who you asked, Freeland is either a last, best hope for the liberal world order or an out-of-touch idealist.\n\nHer steadfast support of Ukraine earned praise in some quarters but the Harvard-educated MP has had her share of critics, including Trump who recently called her \"toxic\".\n\nIn her launch - walking onto the stage to the 1982 song, Maneater - she leaned into her time renegotiating a trade deal under the first Trump administration, and said she would take on the president again.\n\n\"I will lead a true Canadian response to the threat we now face. We will be united, we will be strong, we will be smart and that's why we will win,\" she told the crowd of supporters.\n\nShe has received the backing of Health Minister Mark Holland and Justice Minister Arif Virani, among other MPs.\n\nKarina Gould, a former trade and investment specialist, has thrown her hat in the ring, declaring she would represent a \"new generation\" if elected.\n\nShe was first elected in 2015 and has served a number of roles in Trudeau's cabinet - the youngest woman to serve as a minister in Canada.\n\nThe 37-year-old was families minister, international development minister and later Minister of Democratic Institutions, before taking on her current role as House Leader, where she oversees the government's legislative agenda.\n\nGould launched her bid by saying \"Canadians have lost trust in our party\".\n\nShe has taken aim at the US when trying to convince voters to choose her as leader, telling CNBC \"trust has been broken\" between Canada and its southern neighbour.\n\nShe said fentanyl, one of Trump's justifications for imposing tariffs, comes from Canada in \"miniscule amounts.\"\n\n\"But if that's what he cares about,\" she said, referring to the US president, \"well then let's put together an inspection team at the border to inspect every truck that goes south for fentanyl and every truck that comes north for illegal guns\".\n\nFrank Baylis, a former Liberal member of parliament, was the first out of the gate to announce he is seeking the leadership of the party.\n\nHe has said he will bring his experience from the world of business to address the affordability and cost-of-living challenges facing Canadians.\n\nBaylis is the executive chairman of a medical device company that was founded by his mother and where he later served as president. It was sold to a US firm in 2021. He is an engineer by training.\n\nBaylis served in parliament from 2015-2019 and was a founding member of the Parliamentary Black Caucus.\n\nHe has been heavily critical of Trudeau's approach to Trump's tariff threats and has claimed he would deal with Trump better than his opponents, casting his outsider experience as a businessman as a strength.\n\n\"Whether we like it or not, the Americans have put as a president a highly aggressive bully of a man, who's a businessman,\" he told The Canadian Press. \"And people coming from a genteel world of bureaucrats or banking, they're not going to know how to deal with this character,\" he said, taking aim at his opponents.\n\nMany prominent cabinet ministers chose not to run in this race, including Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, Foreign Minister Melanie Joly and Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne, who all said they need to focus on their current duties.\n\nJaime Battiste, a member of parliament (MP) from the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, dropped out earlier in the race.\n\nAnother hopeful, former Toronto area MP Ruby Dhalla, was kicked out of the race over \"extremely serious\" violations, the party said. Those include allegations of inaccuracies in her campaign's financial reporting. Ms Dhalla has appealed the decision.\n\nPolice say the suspect drove into pedestrians at Lapu Lapu celebrations in the western Canadian city.\n\nBlanchet has led Quebec's sovereigntist party since 2019, after spending time in provincial politics.\n\nAfter a campaign upended by Trump's threats, the Liberals hope they can hold onto power.\n\nGhayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election.\n\nCanadians will vote on April 28.

      "text": "Canada's NDP pulls support for Trudeau's Liberals\n\nCanada's left-wing New Democratic Party (NDP) has pulled the plug on a two-and-a-half-year-old agreement with Justin Trudeau's Liberals that had helped keep his minority government in power.\n\nIn a video posted to social media on Wednesday, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said he had informed the prime minister of his decision, saying the Liberals were \"too weak, too selfish\" to fight for Canadians.\n\nThe deal - called a \"supply and confidence\" agreement - had the NDP supporting the Liberals in confidence votes.\n\nThe announcement does not automatically mean a federal election is imminent but  that Canadians may go to the polls before the election scheduled for October 2025.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, Mr Singh said a non-confidence vote would be \"on the table\" with every confidence measure.\n\nLosing a confidence vote in parliament can trigger a general election.\n\n\"The NDP is ready for an election,\" Mr Singh said.\n\nMr Trudeau and Mr Singh reached the agreement in March 2022, with the Liberals pledging to support the NDP on several of the party's key priorities in parliament.\n\nThe deal differed to a coalition, where parties share power.\n\nInstead, the Liberals - who failed to win a majority in the past two elections - governed as a minority, but with assurances the NDP would support them in confidence votes.\n\nIn exchange, Mr Singh's party secured progress on key priorities, including dental benefits for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme covering birth control and insulin.\n\nIt was the first such formal agreement between two parties at the federal level.\n\nUntil this spring, Mr Singh and senior members of his party remained publicly committed to the deal.\n\nBut NDP's leadership reportedly began to re-evaluate the agreement last month, after Mr Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration after Canada's two largest railways began a work stoppage.\n\nAnnouncing he was tearing up the deal, Mr Singh said the Liberals had \"let people down\" and didn't \"deserve another chance from Canadians\".\n\nMr Trudeau, speaking at an event in Newfoundland, told reporters he was confident he could make parliament work and will focus on \"delivering for Canadians\".\n\n\"I'll let others focus on politics,\" he said, adding he hoped the next election will not happen \"until next fall\" so that his government has time to move forward on its agenda.\n\nIn recent years, Canadian voters have shown increasing frustration with issues like  rising inflation and a housing affordability crisis.\n\nThat has been reflected in the polls, where the Liberals have been down for months, with national opinion surveys suggesting the party is lagging about 18 points behind the opposition Conservatives.\n\nOn Wednesday, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre criticised Mr Singh for not committing to a non-confidence vote, dismissing the announcement as a \"stunt\".\n\nLast week, he penned an open letter urging Mr Singh to abandon his agreement with the Liberals.\n\n\"No one voted for you to keep Trudeau in power. You do not have a mandate to drag out his government another year,\" Mr Poilievre wrote.\n\nMr Trudeau has been in power since 2015, with the Liberals winning re-election - albeit with a minority - in 2019 and 2021.\n\nPolice say the suspect drove into pedestrians at Lapu Lapu celebrations in the western Canadian city.\n\nBlanchet has led Quebec's sovereigntist party since 2019, after spending time in provincial politics.\n\nAfter a campaign upended by Trump's threats, the Liberals hope they can hold onto power.\n\nGhayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election.\n\nCanadians will vote on April 28.

      "text": "Five takeaways from Canada's Liberal leadership debates\n\nAfter back-to-back debates in both English and French, the candidates to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in Canada have made their case to voters.\n\nCard-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.\n\nWhoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year.\n\nA big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"\n\nHere are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.\n\nHow Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.\n\nTrump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.\n\nHe has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.\n\nFreeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.\n\nBut Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"\n\nGould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.\n\nBaylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.\n\nTrump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.\n\nCanadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.\n\nCarney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.\n\nBut he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.\n\nAs the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.\n\nBaylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.\n\nGould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.\n\n\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.\n\nThe four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.\n\nLiberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.\n\nCarney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.\n\nPoilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.\n\nHis message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.\n\nPoilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.\n\nResponding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.\n\nAll of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.\n\nFreeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.\n\nBoth Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.\n\nFreeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.\n\nA tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.\n\nBut that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.\n\nCarney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.\n\nFreeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.\n\n\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.\n\nGould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price.\n\nPolice say the suspect drove into pedestrians at Lapu Lapu celebrations in the western Canadian city.\n\nBlanchet has led Quebec's sovereigntist party since 2019, after spending time in provincial politics.\n\nAfter a campaign upended by Trump's threats, the Liberals hope they can hold onto power.\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trudeau's key ally says he will vote to topple him\n\nJagmeet Singh, leader of Canada's New Democratic Party (NDP), says he will introduce a motion to topple Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government in the new year.\n\nIt marks a turn for the NDP leader, whose centre-left party helped prop up Trudeau's minority government in exchange for support on their shared political priorities.\n\nHe is the last of Canada's three main opposition parties to turn on Trudeau, meaning the prime minister is now unlikely to survive a non-confidence vote.\n\nSingh's announcement comes at the end of a difficult week for Trudeau, who is facing growing calls to resign from his own Liberal Party following the exit of his most senior cabinet minister on Monday.\n\nIn a letter posted on X, Singh said, \"the Liberals don't deserve another chance,\" and vowed to \"put forward a clear motion of non-confidence in the next sitting of the House of Commons.\"\n\nCanada's next election must be held on or before October. With the Liberals holding power with a minority government, a non-confidence motion could trigger an earlier election if most members of Canada's parliament vote in favour of it.\n\nThe House of Commons is currently on its holiday break but is scheduled to resume in late January.\n\nAll three main opposition parties have now said they want Trudeau's government to fall.\n\nConservative leader Pierre Poilievre has repeatedly called for an election as soon as possible, while Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet said a confidence vote must happen as soon as possible to trigger an early 2025 election.\n\nSingh's announcement is the latest in a series of political setbacks suffered by Trudeau this week after the resignation of Chrystia Freeland, his deputy prime minister and finance minister.\n\nFreeland quit in a public letter hours before she was set to deliver an economic statement on Monday, citing political disagreements between her and Trudeau on the \"best path forward for Canada\" in light of tariff threats posed by US President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has promised to impose a levy of 25% on imported Canadian goods unless progress was made on securing the countries' shared border. Economists have warned the tariffs would significantly hurt Canada's economy.\n\nFreeland said the tariffs are a \"grave challenge\" for Canada, and accused Prime Minister Trudeau of championing \"costly political gimmicks\" that the country cannot afford instead of working to keep its \"fiscal powder dry\".\n\nTrudeau has since faced growing calls to resign, including from members of his own Liberal Party.\n\nTo date, at least 19 out of 153 have publicly called on him to quit, according to a tally by the Globe and Mail.\n\nThe latest of them is Robert Oliphant, a Liberal member of parliament for Toronto riding Don Valley West.\n\nOliphant wrote in a public letter on Friday that his constituents \"feel the meaningful difference\" the Liberal government has made in its nine-year tenure, but that Trudeau's leadership has become \"a key obstacle\" to the party's success in the next election.\n\nTrudeau has not responded publicly to these calls, and has reportedly told members of the party that he will take the holidays to reflect and decide what to do.\n\nAfter appointing a replacement immediately for Freeland, Trudeau scheduled a cabinet shuffle on Friday to address other vacancies in his government, as several ministers announced that they would not run for re-election next year.\n\nPolice say the suspect drove into pedestrians at Lapu Lapu celebrations in the western Canadian city.\n\nBlanchet has led Quebec's sovereigntist party since 2019, after spending time in provincial politics.\n\nAfter a campaign upended by Trump's threats, the Liberals hope they can hold onto power.\n\nGhayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election.\n\nCanadians will vote on April 28. Here is a breakdown of who could be the country's  next prime minister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

      "text": "Canada election: Trudeau stays in power but Liberals fall short of majority\n\nJustin Trudeau's Liberal Party has narrowly won Canada's election, but it failed to secure a majority of seats.\n\nThis is Mr Trudeau's third federal election win, but his critics say the poll was a waste of time.\n\nThe Liberals are projected to win 158 seats, short of the 170 seats needed for the majority Mr Trudeau was seeking with his early election call.\n\nThe Conservatives have held onto their main opposition status and are expected to win about 122 seats.\n\n\"There are still votes to be counted but what we've seen tonight is millions of Canadians have chosen a progressive plan,\" Mr Trudeau told supporters in Montreal in the early hours of Tuesday morning.\n\n\"You elected a government that will fight for you and deliver for you,\" he said.\n\nThe election, which took place during a fourth pandemic wave in Canada, was the most expensive in the country's history, costing some C$600m ($470m; £344m).\n\nThe projected results suggest a parliament strikingly similar to the one elected just two years ago in 2019.\n\nThe snap election call, sending Canadians to the polls for the second time in two years, was widely seen as a bid by Mr Trudeau to secure a majority government and he struggled to explain why a campaign was necessary. Conservative leader Erin O'Toole suggested it was a waste of time and money.\n\n\"Canadians sent him back with another minority at a cost of $600m and deeper divisions in our great country\", he told reporters.\n\nMr Trudeau maintained that the election gave the incoming government a clear mandate in moving forward.\n\nBut over the course of the campaign, he struggled to convince voters of the need for an election, which also coincided with rising Covid-19 case loads due to the Delta variant.\n\nSeparately he was also heckled by anti-vaccine protesters on the campaign trail, with some shouting they would refuse the Covid jab.\n\nWhile questions will inevitably be raised about Mr Trudeau's political future, Liberal MP Pablo Rodriguez told journalists early in the evening that no matter the outcome, he had  \"100% confidence\" in him as Liberal Party leader.\n\n\"And all the members of the party do as well,\" he said.\n\nThe country's left-wing New Democrats (NDP), which ran on a \"tax the ultra-rich\" message with leader Jagmeet Singh trying to tap into progressive voters frustrated with the Liberals, looks to have picked up a small number of seats.\n\nVote counts will continue to trickle in over the coming days as elections officials tally the roughly one million mail-in ballots cast this election, and current seat tallies are still to be finalised.\n\nFor the Conservatives, the result is a disappointment for new party leader Erin O'Toole, who ran on a centrist message in a bid to expand the party's base of support.\n\nLike in 2019, the party is projected to have won the popular vote. But the first-past-the-post system - awarding victory to the candidate with most votes in any given constituency - means that has not translated to seats won.\n\nSpeaking to party faithful in Oshawa, Ontario, a defiant Mr O'Toole pitched his vision for a bigger Conservative tent, saying: \"Our party needed the courage to change because Canada has changed.\"\n\nHe urged supporters not to waiver from the commitment to grow the party's base, acknowledging that \"clearly there is more work for us to do\" in setting the stage for a better showing in the next campaign.\n\nConservative strategist Jason Lietaer told journalists at party headquarters that there's reason to keep  Mr O'Toole on as leader despite his failure to secure them a victory.\n\n\"He's gone from unknown to contender in just a few weeks,\" Mr Lietaer said. \"O'Toole was a huge underdog. To be within a few points is something we're all proud of.\"\n\nWhile minority governments are common in Canada, coalitions are extremely rare and Mr Trudeau will need to compromise with opposition parties to pass legislation.\n\nThe NDP are likely to be kingmakers in this new parliament, and could help the Liberals to survive key confidence votes and get their policies through.\n\nMr Singh, the NDP leader, speaking in Burnaby, British Columbia, noted he had secured concessions from Mr Trudeau in the last parliament.\n\nHe said he had a laundry list of priorities this time around, and vowed to push for action on climate change, affordable housing, and healthcare.\n\n\"You can be sure if we work together we can build a better society,\" he said.\n\nThe night saw setbacks for both the Green Party and the People's Party of Canada (PPC).\n\nNew Green leader Annamie Paul was badly defeated in her efforts to secure a seat in Toronto, after she struggled with internal party divisions that threatened her leadership.\n\n\"I am disappointed - it is hard to lose, no one likes to lose,\" Ms Paul said as she thanked supporters.\n\nStill, the party is still projected to send at least two members of parliament to Ottawa.\n\nThe PPC failed to secure any seats despite a late surge as its populist leader tapped into a vein of anger among some Canadians over vaccine mandates and lockdown measures, but did increase its overall vote share.\n\nPolice say the suspect drove into pedestrians at Lapu Lapu celebrations in the western Canadian city.\n\nBlanchet has led Quebec's sovereigntist party since 2019, after spending time in provincial politics.\n\nAfter a campaign upended by Trump's threats, the Liberals hope they can hold onto power.\n\nIn Alberta, many voters feel alienated by the country's elite - some are even tempted by Trump's call to join the US.\n\nGhayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Liberals gain control of the Wisconsin state Supreme Court for the first time in 15 years\n\nJanet Protasiewicz, a judge on the Milwaukee County Circuit Court, has won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, NBC News projects , giving liberals their first majority on the state's highest court in 15 years.\n\nProtasiewicz defeated conservative Dan Kelly, a former state Supreme Court justice, on Tuesday in what became the most expensive state Supreme Court race in U.S. history and one of the most closely watched elections of 2023.\n\nProtasiewicz's victory will allow the court's new liberal majority to determine the future of several pivotal issues the bench is likely to decide in the coming years, including abortion rights, the state's gerrymandered legislative maps and election administration - including, possibly, the outcome of the 2024 presidential race in the battleground state.\n\nWith 85% of the expected vote counted, Protasiewicz had the support of 55% percent of voters, while Kelly had 45% percent.\n\nConservative-leaning justices hold a 4-3 majority on the court. Protasiewicz will fill the seat being vacated by retiring conservative Justice Patience Roggensack, giving liberals the majority for the first time since 2008. Protasiewicz was elected to a 10-year term.\n\nThroughout her campaign, Protasiewicz made it clear that her positions on many issues - most prominently abortions rights - aligned with those of the Democratic Party. She was endorsed by the Democratic abortion rights group Emily's List , Hillary Clinton, former Attorney General Eric Holder and several other prominent Democrats.\n\nDemocrats in the state, and nationally, described the race as the most important one in the country this year, and they focused their messaging on emphasizing abortion rights and fair elections - extending a strategy the national party used last year to fend off a red wave in the House and keep the Senate. The win by Protasiewicz suggests that the strategy continues to pay off for the party - a data point national Democrats will be all but certain to rely on heading into next year's presidential election.\n\nState Democrats and abortion rights groups lauded her win in the moments after NBC News called the race for her. Ben Wikler, the chair of the state Democratic Party, tweeted that the race was \"a release valve for twelve years of Democratic rage in Wisconsin about Republicans rigging our state and smashing our democracy.\" Laphonza Butler, the president of Emily's List, a group that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights, said in a statement to NBC News that Protasiewicz's win \"will change the lives of Wisconsinites for years to come and give the state the opportunity to become a beacon of reproductive health care access.\"\n\nAnother significant factor was that the Protasiewicz campaign, as well as groups supporting it, widely outspent Kelly's campaign and groups supporting it.\n\nIn her victory speech from Milwaukee, Protasiewicz praised voters for having \"chosen to reject partisan extremism in this state\" and said, \"Our democracy will always prevail.\"\n\n\"Too many have tried to overturn the will of the people,\" she added in a veiled reference to attacks she made against Kelly during the campaign for his ties to a plot to overturn the 2020 election results in the state.\n\n\"Today's results show that Wisconsinites believe in democracy and the democratic process,\" she said.\n\nKelly, who lost his seat on the state Supreme Court in 2020 to liberal Jill Karofsky, faced relentless attacks from Protasiewicz and allied groups for having advised Republicans on legal efforts to overturn the 2020 race through the use of \"fake electors.\"\n\nKelly, in a blistering speech to supporters in the small town of Green Lake, acknowledged his loss but slammed Protasiewicz for having run what he called \"the mostly deeply deceitful, dishonorable, despicable campaign I've ever seen run for the courts.\"\n\n\"The people of Wisconsin have chosen the rule of Janet. I respect that decision because it is theirs to make,\" Kelly said.\n\nMore from NBC News: Intel officials watching for signs Russia, China are trying to exploit Trump indictment to widen U.S. political divide Tennessee Republicans trying to expel Democratic lawmakers who supported gun control protest What to watch for in the hotly contested Wisconsin and Chicago elections Tuesday\n\n\"I wish I would be able to concede to a worthy opponent,\" he added, \"but I do not have a worthy opponent to which I can concede.\"\n\nHe ended his remarks with another jab, saying he wished Wisconsin luck, \"because I think it's going to need it.\"\n\nIn a deposition to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, former Wisconsin GOP chairman Andrew Hitt said he and Kelly had \" pretty extensive conversations \" about the plan, and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported last month that the Republican Party at the state and national levels had paid Kelly $120,000 to advise them on \"election integrity\" issues.\n\nKelly repeatedly hit back against the accusations and denied any involvement in the matter.\n\nAt the center of the race, however, was abortion rights.\n\nThe state Supreme Court is widely expected to decide the fate of the state's restrictive 1849 abortion law in the near term.\n\nSeveral of Protasiewicz's television advertisements emphasized her support for abortion rights and slammed \" extremists \" on the other side. Kelly, who refrained from saying how he would rule in such a case, was endorsed by three groups that oppose abortion rights, and he provided counsel to another Wisconsin group that opposes abortion rights.\n\nThe state Supreme Court is also likely to hear various challenges to existing election laws, as well as cases that might relate to recounts, absentee ballots and other facets of election administration that could have material impacts on the outcomes of close elections in the perpetual battleground state - including the 2024 presidential election.\n\nFor example, in a 4-3 decision last year, the state Supreme Court deemed all ballot drop boxes outside of election clerks' offices illegal - a setback for Democrats, who had advocated to preserve one of the more lenient rules about the boxes that arose during the coronavirus pandemic. Two years earlier, the court, in another 4-3 vote, narrowly upheld the 2020 election results in the state . Court watchers predict similar cases in the future.\n\nOther issues that could make it before the court in the coming years are challenges to Act 10, a law enacted by then-Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, that eliminated collective bargaining for most public workers. It could also hear cases about redrawn legislative maps (the current map, which experts have said is one of the most gerrymandered in the country, was approved by the current state Supreme Court last year). As is the case in many states, in Wisconsin, if the governor and the Legislature cannot agree on legislative maps, the issue falls to the state Supreme Court.\n\nProtasiewicz made her stance clear, saying at a debate: \"I think the map issue is really kind of easy, actually. I don't think anybody thinks both maps are fair.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Wisconsin voters Tuesday also approved a constitutional amendment that could make it more difficult for suspects in violent crimes to be released from jail on bail. Protasiewicz and Kelly had supported the proposed amendment.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Progressives gear up for their first big fight if Harris wins: Protecting Lina Khan\n\nWASHINGTON - Anxious liberals have held their fire as Vice President Kamala Harris tacks to the center , but recent calls from some allies that she part ways with a popular, progressive financial regulator if she wins the White House, has sparked warnings from her party's left flank of a potential \"out and out brawl.\"\n\nFor many in the progressive movement, the question of whether to keep Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan represents a pivotal question about the party's future: whether it will double down or walk away from the cause of taking on big corporations and breaking up monopolies and concentrations of power.\n\n\"If Vice President Harris wins, her decision whether to replace Lina Khan and other enforcement officials will be the first big test of whether she wants to preserve the broad coalition built by the Biden-Harris administration, or whether she'll choose ongoing conflict with progressives instead,\" said Dan Geldon, a consultant and former chief of staff to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\n\nWith Republicans favored to win the Senate , Harris may have few opportunities to pursue an ambitious legislative agenda, shifting the Democratic ideological fight to key personnel decisions.\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\n\"Her decision on Biden-era enforcement officials will also set the tone in her administration around whether officials will be penalized for standing up to powerful people and corporations,\" Geldon told NBC News.\n\nLikely flashpoints have already emerged in the closing weeks of the campaign, as Harris embraces figures like businessman Mark Cuban who have called for the ouster of progressive financial regulators like Khan and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. Billionaire Democratic mega-donors Barry Diller and Reid Hoffman have also pushed for Khan's removal , with Hoffman claiming she is \"waging war on American business.\"\n\n\"After the election, there will be a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party when it comes to economics,\" said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \"So it'll be a big fork in the road for Kamala Harris.\"\n\nWhile outgoing President Joe Biden did not come out of the progressive movement, he made major entreaties to the left to consolidate their support after the factious 2020 Democratic primary. That resulted in a strong working relationship for activists with key Biden officials, like his first chief of staff, Ron Klain, and the installation of progressive favorites in key policy posts.\n\nThat includes Khan, who has led sweeping efforts to crack down on alleged monopolies, such as Amazon and Facebook ; gone after drug companies for allegedly inflating insulin prices; and headed the administration's ban on noncompete agreements .\n\nDanielle Deiseroth, executive director of the progressive Data for Progress, said her polling firm has tested FTC actions under Khan and found them to be \"really popular,\" even if \"most Americans probably have not heard of Lina Khan by name.\"\n\nThat aggressive stance, though, has also made Khan a target for some business-minded Democrats, who see her as overly hostile to free enterprise, including Hoffman.\n\nWhile the prospect of a Trump comeback has motivated progressives to rally around Harris in the near term, many still worry about the direction of the party, particularly as it welcomes more affluent and center-right voters who are turned off by the MAGA-infused GOP. Will Democrats continue to be a populist, worker-oriented party? Or will the electoral realignment cause them to start catering more to business?\n\nIf Harris loses, Democrats will have bigger problems, of course. But if she wins, activists and party stakeholders will be looking at what she does with Khan as one clue about how she sees the future of the party.\n\n\"It'd be a strategic blunder for Harris to pick an ugly fight over Lina Khan's future when there's already strong consensus among Democrats. Moderate senators like Bob Casey and Jackie Rosen are actively campaigning on the FTC's work to lower prices,\" said a Senate Democratic aide, who was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject. \"Progressives are ready to fight, but if Harris caves to her billionaire donors it will be her prosecutor brand and the entire Democratic Party that gets bruised in an unnecessary brawl.\"\n\nCuban's call for Khan's ouster led Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to issue a warning to the \"billionaires ... trying to play footsie\" with Harris: \"Anyone goes near Lina Khan and there will be an out and out brawl. And that is a promise,\" she said on X.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also threw in for Khan, calling her \"the best FTC chair in modern history.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign declined to comment for this story.\n\nProgressives have inertia on their side. Khan, whose term expired last month, can remain in the role until she is replaced. Removing her would not only infuriate the left but it could provoke a confirmation fight with Senate Republicans over her replacement.\n\nSome in the progressive movement believe Harris should simply leave her there without going through confirmation again in the Senate if need be. Khan has broad support among Democrats and even some Republicans, including moderates outside the progressive movement.\n\n\"Khan has a lot of allies in Congress,\" said Deiseroth. \"Keeping her is the path of least resistance that will make the most people on the left happy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the cryptocurrency industry and its allies also want to replace Gensler atop the SEC, since he has taken a skeptical view of the nascent industry.\n\nThe main pro-Crypto super PAC Fairshake has spent more than $204 million on the 2024 elections, cultivating a slew of new allies in Congress and in Harris' orbit, including Cuban.\n\nHarris herself has said relatively little about her thoughts on cryptocurrency, which makes progressives worry that in the absence of strong views of her own, and little organized opposition from crypto skeptics, they could have a hard time being heard.\n\nJeff Hauser, the founder of the progressive watchdog Revolving Door Project, said he's hoping Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, the current chair of the Senate Banking Committee, will win his tough re-election contest to serve as a countervailing voice inside the party.\n\n\"The more an issue touches on crypto, the less confident I am in her team,\" he said.\n\nProgressives are already feeling a bit more comfortable about Khan after Cuban on Monday walked back his criticism of Khan and said he's not trying to influence personnel.\n\nGeldon said keeping Khan would be consistent with the populist themes in Harris' campaign platform and messaging, which have been a major part of her pitch to voters even as she campaigns with anti-Trump Republicans to court center-right voters.\n\n\"The Harris campaign's advertisements have been overwhelmingly populist in nature, focusing on price gouging and other issues of corporate accountability,\" Geldon said. \"And that's a strong indication they're looking to continue the momentum built under the Biden-Harris administration.\"\n\nAs with Khan and Gensler, in the case of a divided government, progressives are urging Harris to keep acting cabinet secretaries and their deputies in place and using a vacancies law to make recess appointments, instead of trying to find replacements who could be confirmed by a hostile Republican-led Senate.\n\nCurrent cabinet officials may be asked to stay on to avoid a replacement fight but at least some will depart key roles, such as Attorney General Merrick Garland , who has few fans on the left for a number of reasons, including the perceived tentativeness with which he oversaw the federal prosecutions of former President Donald Trump.\n\nRegardless of which party controls Congress, Harris will be confronted with the challenge of working with Republicans almost immediately without alienating her left flank. The new Congress and president will need to raise the debt ceiling and fund the government again early next year.\n\nSome on the left are already preparing to push a potential Harris administration to essentially disregard the nation's debt limit, promoting the interpretation of legal scholars Michael Dorf and Neil Buchanan that it is unconstitutional .\n\nEzra Levin, a co-founder of the progressive advocacy network Indivisible, said his group's members who are \"very attuned\" to Washington see Khan as one of the most effective Biden administration officials when it comes to taking on concentrated economic and political power.\n\n\"If it came to that in a new Harris administration we'd be pushing strongly to make sure that she stays in,\" Levin said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Canadian PM Carney calls snap election, says Trump wants to break Canada\n\nNew Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Sunday called a snap election for April 28, saying he needed a strong mandate to deal with the threat posed by U.S. President Donald Trump , who \"wants to break us so America can own us.\"\n\nThe comments showed the extent to which relations between the U.S. and Canada, two long-time allies and major trading partners, have deteriorated since Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened to annex it as the 51st state.\n\nAlthough the next election was not due until October 20, Carney is hoping to capitalize on a remarkable recovery by his Liberal Party in the polls since January, when Trump began threatening Canada and former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation.\n\nUpon being sworn in as prime minister on March 14, Carney had said he could work with and respected Trump. On Sunday, however, he took a more combative approach.\n\n\"We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,\" Carney told reporters after the Governor General - the personal representative of King Charles, Canada's head of state - approved his request for an election.\n\n\"Our response must be to build a strong economy and a more secure Canada. President Trump claims that Canada isn't a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us. We will not let that happen.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Carney's remarks.\n\nTrump on March 6 delayed a broad 25% tariff on some Canadian goods for 30 days. He has since imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and threatened reciprocal tariffs on additional goods, including Canadian dairy and lumber, on April 2.\n\n\"The polling suggests that the number one concern that Canadians have right now is the potential negative fallout of Donald Trump and the threatened tariffs,\" said Nik Nanos, chief data scientist and founder of pollster Nanos Research.\n\nCarney is \"probably setting the groundwork for something a little more strident on April 2nd,\" Nanos said.\n\nCarney, a former two-time central banker with no previous political or election campaign experience, captured the Liberal leadership two weeks ago by persuading party members he was the best person to tackle Trump.\n\nNow he has five weeks to win over Canadians. On Sunday, Carney proposed cutting the lowest income tax bracket by one percentage point.\n\nPolls suggest the Liberals, who have been in power since 2015 and badly trailed the official opposition Conservatives at the start of the year, are now slightly ahead of their rivals.\n\n\"We moved from an election where people wanted change to an election that's really much more about leadership,\" said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs.\n\n\"The ability of the Conservatives to attack the Liberals has been greatly diminished because people are focused on the here and now and the near-term future, not on what happened over the last 10 years,\" he said by phone.\n\nThe Conservatives have sought to portray Carney as an elitist who plans to continue the Trudeau-era policy of high government spending. They also accuse him of being less than clear about how he transferred his personal financial assets into a blind trust.\n\nCarney bristled last week when asked about the trust, and accused the reporter asking of engaging in \"conflict and ill will.\" The prickly reaction could give hope to the Conservatives that Carney might stumble during what will be his first campaign.\n\nKey to any victory will be a good performance in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec. Carney had trouble at one press conference when asked to respond in French, first misunderstanding the question and then answering in English.\n\nConservative leader Pierre Poilievre, on the other hand, speaks flawless French and is a seasoned politician who has fought seven elections.\n\n\"What we need to do is put Canada first for a change,\" Poilievre said at a press conference on Sunday to launch his campaign, adding that his policies, including tax cuts and increased resource production, would bring back investment, helping Canada become more self-reliant and better equipped to stand up to Trump.\n\nLaura Stephenson, a politics professor at Western University in the Canadian city of London, said Carney's inexperience might not be that important given the Trump factor.\n\n\"I have a feeling we're going to see a little more grace extended than is usually given to politicians during this campaign,\" she said.\n\nAn online Angus Reid poll of 4,009 people released last week put the Liberals on 42% public support and the Conservatives on 37%. Angus Reid said the margin of error was around 1.5%, 19 times out of 20.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces decision to step down\n\nCanada's Justin Trudeau on Monday said he would step down from the helm of the ruling Liberal Party, but will stay on as prime minister until a new leader is selected ahead of general elections due by late October.\n\n\"I intend to resign as party leader, as prime minister after the party selects its next leader through a robust nationwide, competitive process,\" he said during a Monday news conference. \"Last night, I asked the president of the Liberal Party to begin that process. This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election.\"\n\nHe added that the Canadian Parliament will be prorogued - suspending its activity - until March 24, when a confidence vote will be carried out.\n\n\"Parliament has been entirely seized by obstruction and filibustering and a total lack of productivity over the past few months. We are right now the longest serving minority government in history, and it is time for a reset,\" Trudeau said.\n\nDomestic press had reported he was expected to announce his resignation before a key national caucus meeting on Wednesday. Canadian stocks were slightly higher following the news. The S&P TSX index was up 0.1%, and the Canadian dollar gained 0.5% to 1.4373 against its U.S. counterpart. The iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC) climbed 0.5%.\n\nCanada's latest political crisis was triggered by the abrupt departure of former Trudeau ally and Deputy and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, who resigned in December, citing differences over Ottawa's response to prospective U.S. trade nationalism over the next four years under President-elect Donald Trump 's incoming administration.\n\nDominic LeBlanc has since been appointed to succeed her and head the finance ministerial portfolio.\n\nTrudeau, 53, who assumed office in 2015 and won reelection twice, suffered a plunge in voter popularity to just 19% in the wake of Freeland's departure, pollster Abacus Data found on Dec. 17 . The Angus Reid Institute on Dec. 30 pronounced a \"bruising year for federal Liberals\" and assessed just 16% of popular support for the party - its weakest level since the institute began tracking in 2014. Trudeau's resignation leaves a successor at most mere months to prepare an electoral campaign.\n\nThe opposition Conservative Party now has a more than 20% lead in the polls ahead of general elections - and its firebrand leader, Pierre Poilievre, has gained the compliments of Trump ally Elon Musk , who recently praised his \"great interview.\"\n\nDespite growing calls for his resignation, Trudeau had demurred on taking the step since the middle of December, and the Liberal Party lacks a mechanism to evict its leader nonconsensually.\n\nIn a fresh blow to Trudeau, Jagmeet Singh, leader of allied left-wing New Democratic Party, on Dec. 20 announced in an open letter the intention to introduce a motion to topple Trudeau's government, paving the path for an election.\n\n\"Justin Trudeau has failed in the most important task beholden to a prime minister: working for the people and not for the powerful,\" Singh said, according to a CNBC translation. \"The liberals of Justin Trudeau have made many beautiful promises. Yet they have let down the people, again and again.\"\n\nTrudeau has recently presided over a Canadian economy that only just heeled inflation below its 2% target in November , but remains battered by household debt, rising unemployment , the worst productivity performance in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2023 and panoptic exposure to the U.S. - where Trump, belittling \"governor\" Trudeau, has already teased the possibility of both 25% tariffs and annexation .\n\nDifferences over Canada's response to Trump's \"aggressive economic nationalism\" finally splintered Freeland from Trudeau last month.\n\n\"We need to take that threat very seriously,\" she warned in her resignation letter , stressing \"the serious challenges presented by the United States\" and urging pushback against \"'America First' economic nationalism with a determined effort to fight for capital and investment and the jobs they bring.\"\n\n- CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "'It's a viable idea': what liberals like about the latest Republican health care proposal\n\nRepublican legislators and policy experts are kicking around a novel way to increase health coverage: automatically enrolling millions of uninsured Americans into low-cost insurance plans.\n\nThe idea has shown up on the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal and been discussed in private meetings of the Senate working group on health care.\n\nAnd unlike Republicans' other ideas, automatic enrollment is the rare health proposal that doesn't reflexively alienate liberals. They are generally enthusiastic about policies that would lead to greater coverage.\n\n\"It's a viable idea,\" says Andy Slavitt, who ran Medicare under President Obama and is an ardent Affordable Care Act advocate. \"What's appealing about it to Republicans and to Democrats is you want people to have free choice but not be free riders.\"\n\n\"It's an interesting idea that has got a lot of promise, but the operational details need to be worked through,\" says Stan Dorn, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a think tank generally supportive of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe goal of an automatic enrollment program would be to increase coverage and lower premiums by getting younger and healthier people signed up for coverage. The government would pick a plan for uninsured Americans with premiums equal to the size of their tax credits, meaning they wouldn't pay anything out of pocket.\n\nAn automatic enrollment plan would have an opt-out option, senators say. But research on other similar programs suggests most people won't use it - that they'll stay in their no-cost health plan.\n\n\"We want to get more people into the pool and that obviously makes it better for everybody,\" says Sen. John Thune (R-SD), who has advocated for a discussion of the issue in the Senate working group.\n\nThere are significant logistical obstacles to setting up an automatic enrollment program - namely, how to set up a database of all Americans who currently lack insurance. But the idea is gaining traction on Capitol Hill at this point, as senators explore how to create a bill that covers more people than the House's proposal.\n\n\"There was a nice discussion the other day about how senior Republican aides think that auto-enrollment is the direction we should go in,\" says Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), an early advocate for the policy. \"On the left, Andy Slavitt said auto-enrollment could be a way to get there. We're changing the conversation.\"\n\nRepublican legislators have been clear about two goals they have for their health care bill: it needs to lower premiums and repeal the individual mandate.\n\nPulling off both of those objectives is a huge policy hurdle. The individual mandate exists to bring healthy people into the insurance market, thereby holding down the price of premiums.\n\nDitching the mandate can also lead to fewer people getting insurance - a lesson House Republicans learned with their American Health Care Act, which the Congressional Budget Office estimated to leave 24 million without coverage.\n\n\"There are policy reasons why you want people to have coverage and political reasons why a plan that leaves 24 million uninsured can be a liability,\" says Lanhee Chen, a health policy expert at Stanford who advised Mitt Romney's and Marco Rubio's campaigns on health care. \"The discussion has really been around finding a mechanism to expand coverage that would work.\"\n\nRepublicans have begun eyeing automatic enrollment as a way to get healthy people into the market without a mandate - to \"nudge\" the uninsured into a plan they might not proactively sign up for on their own.\n\nThe uninsured would be signed up for a plan with a low premium and a high deductible. The idea would be to deliver catastrophic coverage, the type of policy that might not pay for every doctor visit but would prevent financial ruin in case of an accident or serious illness.\n\n\"You want to have a plan that provides adequate protection for catastrophic events,\" Chen says. \"I'm less convinced you have to have a spectacularly generous plan or one that would be perceived as relatively generous. I think the plan will provide the backstop catastrophic coverage.\"\n\nAutomatic enrollment has shown to hugely increase sign-ups in other settings. Companies that enroll workers into 401(k) savings program, for example, have participation rates twice as high as those requiring workers to opt in.\n\nMedicare Part B automatically enrolls seniors when they turn 65, and has nearly universal coverage among the elderly. The government began enrolling low-income seniors into Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, and got 74 percent of the population enrolled in just six months.\n\nDorn at the Urban Institute noted that there are two states that have used automatic enrollment in Medicaid, South Carolina and Louisiana . Massachusetts used a similar program when it launched its health coverage expansion in 2006, to get low-income residents signed up for coverage.\n\n\"That was an important factor behind Massachusetts unexpectedly rapid take up,\" Dorn says. \"We've done this in a lot of different places.\"\n\nRepublicans last explored the idea of automatic health insurance enrollment in 2009, when House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) introduced a plan that would let states set up such programs.\n\nTheir bill suggested that DMVs might be able to check whether people had coverage and, if not, offer the automatic enrollment option.\n\nCongressional Democrats ended up going down a different path, preferring an individual mandate to require nearly all Americans to sign up for coverage.\n\nWhile automatic enrollment may be an alluring policy idea, experts on both sides of the aisle concede that it is a difficult one to implement. The government doesn't maintain a list of all Americans who lack insurance coverage, and building one would be a Herculean effort.\n\nAll previous examples of automatic enrollment focused on a specific group of people. States could automatically enroll people in Medicaid, for example, by using lists of people on other public assistance programs. They knew those people were below the income threshold to qualify.\n\nPrograms that automatically enroll workers in 401(k) plans target employees of a specific company.\n\nBut the target of this latest idea is all uninsured Americans, a group that can be difficult to define. People constantly switch jobs, move states, and make countless other decisions that alter their coverage.\n\n\"I don't think this is a super-easy thing to do that doesn't require any thought at all,\" Chen says.\n\nStill, it's not impossible to imagine how to build the infrastructure for such a program. The Coburn-Ryan proposal suggested letting the DMV and emergency rooms enroll the uninsured into coverage, when they turn up to apply for other services.\n\nChen and others thought IRS data could be the best start, particularly since the agency already asks about insurance status as part of our tax returns.\n\nThat data lags a bit; it's possible that someone has gained or lost coverage since the prior year. Dorn at the Urban Institute suggested the most concrete workaround: a question on tax forms that asks people whether they have insurance and signs them up if the answer is no.\n\n\"You could see a form asking are you covered now and if you say no, it would say we're going to enroll you in premium-free coverage unless you check this other box,\" Dorn says.\n\nSome Affordable Care Act supporters worry that the automatic enrollment plans would be too skimpy to provide actual coverage - that they would give enrollees a false sense of security, when their plan didn't pay for much at all.\n\n\"My question is, if my income is $30,000 a year and I'm enrolled into a plan with a $25,000 deductible, how is that protection?\" asks Jonathan Gruber, an economist at MIT who helped draft the Affordable Care Act. \"In that case, you're just giving money to health insurers.\"\n\nGruber added that enrollees that default into a health insurance plan might not pay much attention and realize what type of coverage they had until they actually tried to use it. He argues that at a certain point, bare-bones coverage is worse than no coverage at all because it creates a false sense of security.\n\n\"This is similar to why we didn't want lifetime limits in health insurance - it's one of those things where you think, 'I'm set, I have insurance,' but you don't realize you have a cap,\" says Gruber. \"People could make the same mistake here, think, 'I'm auto-enrolled and this is good coverage.'\"\n\nOne Urban Institute analysis of an earlier version of the House bill showed that the plans older Americans could afford to purchase with just tax credits would be very bare-bones, with deductibles upward of $10,000 and $25,000. The Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, has warned that it won't count especially skimpy plans as coverage - but has not drawn a bright line of how generous a plan needs to be in order to count.\n\nThe tax credits in the version of the AHCA that the House voted on were more generous than those Urban analyzed, meaning they would provide slightly better coverage. But Chen says that in order to make automatic enrollment work, the Senate bill would need to increase the subsidies even more.\n\n\"The tax credits as currently formulated do need to be adjusted,\" says Chen. \"I don't think they would be sufficient for older folks. There needs to be some refreshing of those amounts.\"\n\n- Dylan Scott contributed reporting to this piece.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Mark Carney wins race to replace Trudeau as Canada's prime minister\n\nFormer central banker Mark Carney won the race to become leader of Canada's ruling Liberal Party and will succeed Justin Trudeau as prime minister, official results showed on Sunday.\n\nCarney will take over at a tumultuous time in Canada, which is in the midst of a trade war with longtime ally the United States under President Donald Trump and must hold a general election soon.\n\nCarney, 59, took 86% of votes cast to beat former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland in a contest in which just under 152,000 party members voted.\n\n\"There's someone who's trying to weaken our economy,\" Carney said of Trump, spurring loud boos at the party gathering. \"He's attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses. We can't let him succeed.\"\n\n\"This won't be business as usual,\" Carney said. \"We will have to do things that we haven't imagined before, at speeds we didn't think possible.\"\n\nTrudeau announced in January that he would step down after more than nine years in power as his approval rating plummeted, forcing the ruling Liberal Party to run a quick contest to replace him.\n\n\"Make no mistake, this is a nation-defining moment. Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given,\" Trudeau said.\n\nCarney, a political novice, argued that he was best placed to revive the party and to oversee trade negotiations with Trump, who is threatening additional tariffs that could cripple Canada's export-dependent economy.\n\nTrudeau has imposed C$30 billion of retaliatory tariffs on the United States in response to tariffs Trump levied on Canada.\n\n\"My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect,\" Carney said.\n\nCarney's win marks the first time an outsider with no real political background has become Canadian prime minister. He has said his experience as the first person to serve as the governor of two G7 central banks - Canada and England - meant he was the best candidate to deal with Trump.\n\nThe prospect of a fresh start for the Liberal Party under Carney, combined with Trump's tariffs and his repeated taunts to annex Canada as the 51st U.S. state, led to a remarkable revival of Liberal fortunes.\n\nAt the start of 2025, the party trailed by 20 or more points but is now statistically tied with the official opposition Conservatives led by career politician Pierre Poilievre in several polls.\n\nAt a protest outside Canada's Parliament building in Ottawa on Sunday, dozens of Canadians held up signs protesting Trump with no reference to domestic politics.\n\n\"There is a rallying-around-the-flag moment that we would never have predicted a year ago,\" said University of British Columbia politics professor Richard Johnston. \"I think it's probably true as we speak that the Liberals have been saved from oblivion.\"\n\nPolls, though, indicate that neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives would be able to form a majority government. An election must be held by October 20.\n\nTwo Liberal Party sources said Carney would call an election in coming weeks, meaning one could take place much sooner.\n\nCarney could legally serve as prime minister without a seat in the House of Commons but tradition dictates that he should seek to win one as soon as possible.\n\nLiberals sought to compare Conservative leader Poilievre to Trump in a recent advertisement. Poilievre in turn ramped up attacks on Carney on Sunday.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Supreme Court abortion ruling is 'catastrophic,' liberal justices write in furious dissent\n\nThe Supreme Court's monumental ruling overturning longstanding federal abortion protections is a \"catastrophic\" decision that takes away women's freedoms, threatens other rights and erodes the court's credibility, three dissenting justices wrote in a blistering rebuke.\n\nThe court overruled the constitutional right to an abortion, which was established a half-century ago by Roe v. Wade and reaffirmed in the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Friday's ruling gives individual states the power to set their own abortion laws, with many poised to immediately outlaw or severely restrict the procedure in nearly all instances.\n\nRead the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade here\n\nRead CNBC's live coverage on the nation's emotional reaction to the ruling here\n\n\"The majority has overruled Roe and Casey for one and only one reason: because it has always despised them, and now it has the votes to discard them,\" wrote Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan in a joint dissent.\n\n\"The majority thereby substitutes a rule by judges for the rule of law,\" they wrote.\n\nThe decision to uphold a restrictive abortion law in Mississippi, the dispute at the center of the case, divided the justices along ideological lines between the six conservative justices and the three liberals in the minority. Chief Justice John Roberts, however, wrote that he did not approve of tossing out Roe altogether.\n\nThe majority opinion, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, held that \"the Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.\"\n\nWhile he acknowledged that the court has interpreted the 14th Amendment to guarantee some rights that are not explicitly spelled out, Alito cited precedent stating that those rights must be deeply rooted in U.S. traditions and \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\"\n\nRoe \"was egregiously wrong from the start,\" he wrote, and therefore should not be upheld by the principle of adhering to judicial precedent, known as stare decisis.\n\nThe liberal wing of the court, which had shrunk to just one-third of the nine-seat bench after former President Donald Trump appointed three new conservative justices during his one-term presidency, tore into the majority from a variety of angles in a seething 59-page dissent.\n\n\"We believe in a Constitution that puts some issues off limits to majority rule. Even in the face of public opposition, we uphold the right of individuals - yes, including women - to make their own choices and chart their own futures. Or at least, we did once,\" the liberals wrote.\n\nThe liberal justices decried the court for curtailing women's rights and empowering states to enact draconian reproductive laws that force women to give birth: \"A State can of course impose criminal penalties on abortion providers, including lengthy prison sentences. But some States will not stop there. Perhaps, in the wake of today's decision, a state law will criminalize the woman's conduct too, incarcerating or fining her for daring to seek or obtain an abortion.\"\n\nThey accused the conservative majority of disregarding \"stare decisis\" in order to throw out the abortion rulings, thereby substituting \"a rule by judges for the rule of law.\"\n\n\"In the end, the majority says, all it must say to override stare decisis is one thing: that it believes Roe and Casey 'egregiously wrong,'\" they wrote in the dissent. \"That rule could equally spell the end of any precedent with which a bare majority of the present Court disagrees. It makes radical change too easy and too fast, based on nothing more than the new views of new judges.\"\n\nThey also warned that the majority's reasoning threatens other rights that, until recently, appeared settled, including same-sex marriage and intimacy, and the right to purchase contraception.\n\nRoe and Casey are connected to decisions protecting a slew of other constitutional rights, the dissenters wrote, rejecting assurances from the majority that Friday's ruling does not undermine other cases.\n\nThey cited Justice Clarence Thomas' concurring opinion, which railed against precedents that rely on the doctrine of so-called substantive due process, to argue that \"at least one Justice is planning to use the ticket of today's decision again and again and again.\"\n\n\"We cannot understand how anyone can be confident that today's opinion will be the last of its kind,\" the liberals wrote.\n\nAnd the three justices took a sharp swipe at the contention from Justice Brett Kavanaugh that the Constitution is \"neutral\" on the question of abortion and that the decision should therefore be left to the states.\n\n\"When it comes to rights, the Court does not act 'neutrally' when it leaves everything up to the States,\" the liberals wrote. \"When the Court decimates a right women have held for 50 years, the Court is not being 'scrupulously neutral.' It is instead taking sides: against women who wish to exercise the right, and for States (like Mississippi) that want to bar them from doing so.\"\n\nKavanaugh \"cannot obscure that point by appropriating the rhetoric of even-handedness,\" they added.\n\n\"In overruling Roe and Casey, this Court betrays its guiding principles. With sorrow - for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection - we dissent,\" they wrote.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Liberals Steer Outside Money to Grass-Roots Organizing\n\nAfter months on the sidelines, major liberal donors including the financier George Soros are preparing to inject up to $100 million into independent groups to aid Democrats' chances this fall. But instead of going head to head with the conservative \"super PACs\" and outside groups that have flooded the presidential and Congressional campaigns with negative advertising, the donors are focusing on grass-roots organizing, voter registration and Democratic turnout.\n\nThe departure from the conservatives' approach, which helped Republicans wrest control of the House in 2010, partly reflects liberal donors' objections to the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which paved the way for super PACs and unbridled campaign spending.\n\nBut in interviews, donors and strategists involved in the effort said they also did not believe they could match advertising spending by leading conservative groups like American Crossroads and Americans for Prosperity, and instead wanted to exploit what they see as the Democrats' advantage in grass-roots organizing.\n\n\"Super PACs are critically important,\" said Rob Stein, the founder of the Democracy Alliance, a group of liberal donors who will convene near Miami this week to discuss where to steer their money this year. But the liberal groups, he said, believe that local efforts and outreach through social media \"can have an enormous impact in battleground states in 2012.\"\n\nIn a move likely to draw in other major donors, Soros will contribute $1 million each to America Votes, a group that coordinates political activity for left-leaning environmental, abortion rights and civil rights groups, and American Bridge 21st Century, a super PAC that focuses on election-oriented research. The donations will be Soros's first major contributions of the 2012 election cycle.\n\n\"George Soros believes the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United opened the floodgates to special interests' paying for political ads,\" said Michael Vachon, a spokesman for Soros. \"There is no way those concerned with the public interest can compete with them. Soros has always focused his political giving on grass-roots organizing and holding conservatives accountable for the flawed policies they promote. His support of these groups is consistent with those views.\"\n\nOn Monday, in an indication that he does not expect significant advertising spending from Democratic-leaning outside groups at this stage, President Obama unveiled a $25 million ad campaign against Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nA super PAC founded by two former Obama aides, Priorities USA Action, has struggled to raise money against better-financed conservative groups like American Crossroads, which expects to spend $300 million on the presidential, House and Senate elections.\n\nThose difficulties stem in part from Obama's past opposition to spending by outside groups, which has dampened donor enthusiasm despite his about-face this year. But it also reflects how major liberal donors and independent groups have focused since 2004 on creating a permanent infrastructure of liberal research and voter-outreach groups. That year, liberal groups spent more than $200 million on advertising and grass-roots activity in a failed bid to deprive President George W. Bush of a second term.\n\nConservative independent groups, including super PACs that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on election ads, dominated the advertising wars in 2010, helping Republicans make major gains in Congress, and their money has had a similar impact so far in this cycle.\n\n\"The idea that we're going to engage in an arms race on advertising with the Republicans is not appealing to many liberal donors,\" said David Brock, the founder of American Bridge 21st Century.\n\nThe advertising-oriented Democratic super PACs, including Priorities USA and two groups founded to back Democrats in Congress, remain on the list of organizations that the Democracy Alliance recommends to its members. Robert McKay, who is the chairman of the Democracy Alliance and sits on the board of Priorities USA, said the $100 million expected to be spent this year by alliance members would include some money for election ads, but would most likely favor grass-roots organizing and research groups.\n\n\"There is a bias towards funding infrastructure as it relates to the elections,\" McKay said. \"That means get-out-the-vote efforts\" directed toward young voters, single women, black voters and Latinos, he said.\n\nOrganizations likely to be a part of the effort include Catalist, which creates voter lists for allied liberal groups; ProgressNow, a network of state-based Web sites for liberal opinion and activism; and the Latino Engagement Fund, a new group that works to register and turn out Latino voters for Democrats. Conservative independent groups are financing similar outreach to Latino voters: the American Action Network, which spent $26 million against Democratic candidates in 2010, last year unveiled the Hispanic Leadership Network, which will seek to mobilize center-right Latino voters.\n\nLiberals outside the Democracy Alliance are also likely to make significant contributions, as are labor unions, which plan to spend up to $400 million on state, local and federal races, and advocacy groups like the Sierra Club.\n\nSome groups will pay for both advertising and organizing. PAC+, a super PAC founded by the San Francisco philanthropist Steve Phillips, a member of the Democracy Alliance, expects to spend about $10 million on Latino voters in six states, with a heavy emphasis on Arizona, which the Obama campaign is seeking to turn into a battleground. Half of PAC+ spending will go to enrollment and half to advertising.\n\n\"You can dump 10 or 20 million in TV ads in Ohio and try to reach the persuadable swing voters there, or you can up voter turnout among Latinos in Colorado and Arizona and win that way,\" Phillips said. \"It's much cheaper.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Liberals' class warfare on the working class keeps Trump afloat\n\nEveryone knows that Republicans have political problems, from their failure to repeal Obamacare to President Trump 's erratic tweets to his sputtering efforts to make populism a governing philosophy. But what about Democrats? While their problems don't get as much media attention, Democrats are now both the minority party and a toxic brand to much of middle-class America.\n\nTake last Friday, when Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia announced he was becoming a Republican. \"The Democrats walked away from me,\" he told a Trump rally in Huntington. \"Today I tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you any more being a Democrat governor.\" \"I think it's a sign of the times,\" Jose Gonzalez, a 37-year-old project manager at a local steel plant, told the Washington Post at the rally. \"The Democratic Party used to look out for the downtrodden, but more and more working people are going for Republicans.\" More from National Review: What's the matter with Democrats? The Fusion Party: Democrats and the progressive media Al Franken, un-funny man of the Senate\n\nTrump certainly broke the mold in 2016. He did better among low-income whites than among upper-income whites - the first time a Republican has done that at the presidential level. He won 62 percent of the vote among white voters without a college degree who make less than $30,000 a year. In 2012, Mitt Romney had only won 52 percent of votes in that group. They made the difference in key working-class states that Trump won, carrying them for the GOP for the first time since the 1980s - Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Republicans now control the White House and both houses of Congress and have complete executive and legislative control in 26 states. Since the November election, Trump's popularity has largely held with those voters. Concerns about his lack of focus have been assuaged by the recent growth in jobs and wages. Democrats have not improved their position - in part because of their obsession with leading the \"resistance\" against Trump. A Washington Post/Abc News poll published July 19 found that 52 percent of Americans don't believe the Democratic party stands for anything beyond opposing Trump. Even 42 percent of nonwhite voters agree that Trump-bashing is all the party is focused on.\n\nThe Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic party is convinced it has a solution: have the party move left. \"People are looking for a populism, but a multi-racial populism,\" Heather McGhee, of the leftist voting-rights group Demos, said on Meet the Press this morning. \"They're looking for candidates who say, 'I'm willing to take on the wealthy and powerful, and also I'm not willing to let the wealthy and powerful divide us from each other so that they can have the spoils of our great nation.'\" But that's not what the polls taken by Democrats themselves are showing. The House Majority PAC last month released an exhaustive survey. McClatchy's Alex Roarty summarized the findings as \"white voters without a college degree still view Trump relatively favorably, their opinion of Democrats is in the dumps, and they reject some of the party's favored economic initiatives.\"\n\nAsked which party will \"improve the economy and create jobs,\" Republicans have a 35-point edge among white working-class Democrats. They have a 19-point edge when it comes to ensuring people are rewarded for their hard work, and a 15-point edge on middle-class tax cuts. Democrats have only a four-point edge on health care, a surprise given the unpopularity of the GOP's failed Senate plan. The poll and its accompanying focus group found that Democrats are hurt by the perception that they care mostly about upper-income concerns such as free or reduced college tuition, and they look down with thinly veiled contempt on working-class voters. Many of those voters don't think college is a ticket to prosperity, and many prefer blue-collar jobs. \"In short, when these voters hear people tell them that the answer to their concerns is college, their reaction is to essentially say - don't force your version of the American Dream on me,\" the House Majority PAC concluded.\n\nIndeed, the biggest challenge that liberals will face in trying to win back the voters who have drifted to the GOP is finding a way to conceal their agenda - which is now geared toward identity politics, job-killing environmentalism, and expanding the welfare state. \"We are seeing an ongoing class war by liberal elites against the middle and working classes,\" Joel Kotkin, a demographer and executive director of the Houston-based Center for Opportunity Urbanism, told me in an interview. Donald Trump won because he recognized the nature of that class war and appealed to those who were being hurt by it. Democrats aren't likely to win back the voters they've lost until they realize that many of those voters won't even listen to them if there isn't a truce in the class war they see being waged against them.

      "text": "Conrad Black: The Rise and Fall of the Liberals' Political Fortunes Over Recent Decades\n\nFor the first time since the last days of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's tenure over 40 years ago, there was widespread curiosity in Canada-until this Monday-about whether the incumbent prime minister would retire voluntarily or otherwise, or lead his party into another general election later this year.\n\nSince the merging of the Progressive Conservatives and Reform Parties in 2004, the electoral equation has been that of an effective two-party state instead of the 1 1/2 party state that had prevailed between 1896 and 1984 and 1992 and 2004. Since 1984, the Conservatives have governed federally for 18 years and the Liberals for 23 years, and all indications are that the Conservatives will be re-elected with a solid majority in October of this year at the latest.\n\nUp until this week, the Liberal prime minister who succeeded Campbell, Jean Chrétien, was the only elected prime minister deposed from that office by his own party, and his successor, Paul Martin, was also unable to avoid the defeat the voters had in mind for Chrétien: Stephen Harper took office at the head of a united Conservative Party. Justin Trudeau now joins Chrétien as an elected prime minister forced from office by his own party. Ms. Freeland deserves credit for not allowing Trudeau to lay all the blame for the government's economic policy failures on her, but she should not imagine that she is now an acceptable replacement.\n\nA stark historic contrast is Brian Mulroney, who had a solid record of achievement as prime minister, but after eight years, for various reasons, was not popular in the country, although he did not suffer the wobbling of a single caucus member, because he treated his MPs so attentively and retained their unconditional loyalty. This was in sharp distinction to Justin and Pierre Trudeau, Jean Chrétien, John Diefenbaker-and even Lester Pearson and Stephen Harper, both of whom faced some rumblings of mutiny below decks.\n\nThe departure of the most famous Canadian, Jordan Peterson, to the United States, hounded by politically correct cancellation, is sadly indicative of Canada's decline in recent years.\n\nThere is indisputable evidence from public opinion trends within Canada and elections elsewhere, that the Western world has tired of the woke, ultra-green, diversity-equity-inclusion agenda. The outright bunk about the influence of fossil fuels upon the world's temperature has imposed intolerable costs on consumers, and fundamentally fair-minded populations of civilized countries can only tolerate a limited amount of unjust moral self-flagellation. Even the most pious and self-critical person can only spend a certain amount of time heaping abuse upon himself in the confessional before reawakening a sense of self-worth.\n\nTrudeau appears to be trying to bring in former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney as his replacement, but Ms. Freeland has thrown a wrench into that plan.\n\nWith his resignation announcement, Justin Trudeau took to the lifeboats while there's still a place for him in one. Joe Clark retains his record as the only person in history ever to have defeated a Trudeau, and Canada has taken an important step in retrieving its status throughout its national history until a decade ago as a successful country."

In a survey ahead of the announcement, many Canadians identified the former finance minister as the most appropriate candidate to succeed him.\n\nThe online survey was conducted from Dec. 27 to 31, receiving responses from 2,406 members of Angus Reid's online forum.\n\nSurvey respondents were presented with six candidates: Freeland, former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Finance Dominic LeBlanc, and Transport Minister Anita Anand.\n\nThe majority identified Freeland as the one most likely to strengthen the party's prospects in the next election if she were to assume the role of Liberal party leader.\n\nIn the situation of Trudeau continuing as leader, the Liberal Party garnered just 13 percent voter intention compared to the Conservative Party's 39 percent, the poll found.\n\nWith Freeland at the helm, the Liberal vote intention rose to 21 percent. While still less than the Conservatives' 36 percent, it is greater than the backing for Trudeau or any of the other possible leadership contenders. Joly scored 16 percent while Carney scored 14 percent.\n\n\"In the event Freeland were to succeed as Liberal Party leader, the party's fortunes among the total population jumps eight points to 21 percent,\" a report on the poll results said.\n\nWhile this offers her a large advantage over the other potential candidates, the Conservative Party \"still holds a commanding advantage in all situations,\" the report said. \"In a faceoff against a Freeland-led Liberal Party, the CPC still hold a 15-point lead.\"\n\nThe estimates were also reflected in sentiments from Liberal voters and potential Liberal supporters, the poll found. It said that 28 percent would be more likely to back the party if Freeland were the leader, while 27 percent said they \"might\" consider voting Liberal. Fifty-five percent said they would never consider it, no matter who the leader is.\n\nLiberal voters were even less likely to want Trudeau to remain as leader. Sixty percent of those surveyed want to see him step down. Only 10 percent said he should call a February election and the remaining 30 percent said he should stay on as long as his minority government goes unchallenged.\n\nNo matter who is leading the Liberals into the next election, the key to avoiding \"an electoral catastrophe,\" is convincing fence sitters considering the NDP to vote Liberal instead, the poll said.\n\n\"More than half of those who would definitely consider the Liberals currently lean toward Jagmeet Singh's party,\" the report said. \"A smaller number but still a plurality (38%) of the 'might consider' group also currently support the NDP, while one-in-four of this group are initially undecided when asked how they would vote.\""

      "text": "Liberals' Rules Allowing Foreign Nationals to Vote in Leadership Contest Makes Chinese Interference Too Easy\n\nWell, the inevitable has happened. After months of speculation, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emulated his father, took a walk in the snow (it may not have been actually snowing in Ottawa on Jan. 6 but it was extremely cold!), and announced his intention to resign once a replacement is selected. The worst-kept secret in the nation's capital came to pass.\n\nWe know, through leaked intelligence and the Public Inquiry Into Foreign Interference, that Beijing has been at the forefront of efforts to sway candidate nomination meetings, in part by busing Chinese students to events and to ensure that those running for office are in China's, and not Canada's, interests. When added to the PRC's establishment of \"police stations\" on our soil to monitor dissidents, as well as the outright harassment and threats to those it sees as undermining China's self-created myth as a paradise on Earth, we are well aware of this menace to our democracy.\n\nChina is not alone. Russia, Iran, and others also do their utmost to advance their agendas among diasporas in Canada. The evidence behind these schemes has been well documented publicly-not to mention the intelligence passed on by national security agencies-and the government has no excuse for its lack of action.\n\nIn fairness, other parties also have leaky party selection processes, and we need a national solution to a national problem, but the Liberals seem to be the worst at sticking their heads in the sand (at least the Conservatives limit voting to citizens and permanent residents, those on the path to citizenship). Not only did the PM and his team ignore CSIS intelligence on these forms of interference, but he accused those merely demonstrating the extent of the problem of being racist. This approach underlines that the government, which claims to take national security \"very seriously,\" does nothing of the sort.\n\nThe bottom line is that this party will continue to allow foreign nationals, i.e., non-citizens, to have a say in the choice of candidates for the House of Commons up to and including the prime minister. What other democracy allows this to happen?\n\nThe Liberals are making a mockery of the democratic process in Canada. It is unclear why they would want to undermine our independence and allow foreign states to have such levels of influence in what must be a made-in-Canada process. This inaction and sheer disregard for sovereignty must be stopped before the next election. Beijing must be dancing in the aisles at this ignorance and shortsightedness.\n\nIf nothing is done soon, I nevertheless hope the next government gives national security the time, attention, and priority it deserves.\n\n\"The China Syndrome\" was a 1979 film starring Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas about a cover-up of safety hazards at a nuclear power plant (shades of Chernobyl?). It appears that truth is again imitating fiction in that we have a government keen to cover up hazards, these ones to the core of the voting process.\n\nThere is an old saying: \"Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.\" The Liberal Party needs to clean up its act and close the loopholes to prevent foreign meddling."

      "text": "In the past few decades, the Democratic Party has undergone a seismic shift. Kitchen-table issues like the economy and public safety have been overshadowed by more elitist topics like identity politics, gender ideology, defunding the police, climate change, and the vaguely defined yet rigidly enforced ideology of anti-racism, which sees white supremacy as the force behind every institution in America.\n\nBut while activists, lobbyists, and pundits were busy reshaping the Democratic Party, ordinary voters-including the working class, middle-class families, and ethnic minorities-were simply leaving. All of which has stranded a large group of Americans on an island, voters in the center of nowhere.\n\nTwo people who have spent years thinking about how the Democratic Party lost its vision are political analysts John Judis and Ruy Teixeira. Their new book, Where Have All the Democrats Gone? , offers up a map to help us understand how liberals lost their way.\n\nOn today's episode of Honestly , guest-hosted by Michael Moynihan, Judis and Teixeira trace the influence of big money forces behind what they call the Democrats' \"shadow party,\" and offer a path forward away from the radical cultural issues embraced by party elites and back to core economic issues that matter to the working class, a group that Democrats need to win back if they want to win in 2024.\n\nOn the trajectory of the Democratic party over the last 20 years:\n\nMichael Moynihan : Before you wrote your new book, Where Have All the Democrats Gone? , you wrote another book together called The Emerging Democratic Majority in 2002 about a new wave of Democratic voters that was emerging in America. How does it look 20 years later?\n\nJohn Judis : In the late 1990s, Ruy discovered that the white working class was disappearing from the Democratic ranks and I discovered that this new group-the professionals-was coming in. And we constructed what we thought was a plausible scenario for the Democrats having an advantage over the next decade or two, and it would consist of professionals, nurses, teachers, people with college degrees, particularly single women, minorities, and young people. And when Obama won in 2008, it was hallelujah-we were prophets and we figured it all out! But then two years later, in 2010, the Democrats lost big. They lost the House, and we started figuring out that something was the matter. After the 2016 election, it became clear that the Democrats had lost out on its central issue: the economy. And it also had all this extra baggage, which Trump summed up in the idea of \"political correctness.\"\n\nRuy Teixeira : We never downplayed the importance of the white working class. In fact, it was very clear that in a lot of key states, there would be no way for the Democrats to sustain what we called at the time \"the progressive centrist coalition,\" unless they were able to retain the loyalty of these voters. In 2016, with Trump's victory built on the backs of white working-class voters in the Midwest especially, it was very clear that the Democrats were not able to maintain the kind of share of the white working-class vote they needed to make the political arithmetic of a changing America work out in their favor. But as we saw after 2016, Democrats summarized their loss as being about the reactionary parts of America-the racist, the xenophobes, the left-behinds-and it didn't seem to have much to do, in their view, with questions of economics. It was all about how they're not \"down\" with the multicultural, multiracial America that's coming into being, and that's all there is to it. So, they thought, why even bother with these people? They're \"deplorables,\" as Hillary Clinton famously put it.\n\nJJ : I used to always hear Democrats saying, \"The election was all just Trump's racist appeals,\" but I actually went to the rallies in 2015. He would talk about bad trade deals. He promised to bring back Glass-Steagall, which is the bill regulating finance. He talked about health insurance. He was going to do a plan that actually would cover all Americans and wasn't going to be like a rat's maze. And if you compare the ads, his ads were overwhelmingly more policy-oriented than Clinton's. She was really just attacking him as a bad guy and it didn't work.\n\nMM : So, you didn't anticipate that the party that said, \"We are the party of Paul Ryan, we're the party of tax cuts, we're the party of Milton Friedman,\" would actually start to sound more liberal on economic policy?\n\nRT : Yeah, and that's another way in which Trump was misunderstood. He got the nomination because the Republican Party itself was changing and was becoming more of a working-class party driven by these kinds of voters. They didn't want to hear the Paul Ryan message over and over again. They didn't want to hear just about tax cuts. They didn't want to just hear, \"We unleash the free market, everything will be great. Trust us on this.\" They were mad, and they thought the elites of the Republican Party as well as the Democratic Party were selling them out. So Trump's message fell on receptive ears, and that shock to the Republican Party system is still with us today, because I don't think there's any turning back to the former economic approach of the Republicans. Trump is the guy who changed the landscape. This gets away from looking at him as just an avatar of white supremacy or whatever it is he is frequently portrayed as by some Democrats.\n\nOn the non-white working class:\n\nMM : In 2021, I went down to Starr County, Texas, which I believe is the most Hispanic county in America. They went about 40 points for Hillary Clinton, but they went for Joe Biden by about 3 or 4 points. These voters are Mexican Americans who have been in America for a very long time. They supported Trump on immigration. They were very concerned about culture war issues that they thought the Democrats had gone too far on. Is that ultimately the failing of this type of identity politics that lumps a very disparate group of people together and says, \"Well, they're Latino,\" and not acknowledging that there's variations in that?\n\nJJ : All that stuff is goofy. I mean, Puerto Ricans vote differently than Cubans, who vote differently than Latinos in Texas. So, yes, but it is also a fact that except for the Cubans, minority voters are pretty much Democratic on economic issues. The Democrats have started to lose them more recently and it's partly over economics, but it's also over culture issues and over immigration and abortion.\n\nRT : It should have really shocked Democrats more than it did in 2020 when Hispanic working-class voters bailed out en masse from the Democratic Party. Democrats can't any longer count on working-class voters of any color to be stable in their levels of support.\n\nThe Democrats also made a serious error in melding Hispanics into this construct of \"people of color\" in the United States who are all oppressed by the fact they are non-whites in a white supremacist society; who are all the victims of racism and discrimination; who all believe in a very liberal immigration policy. None of those things were correct. Hispanics think of themselves as Americans. They think of themselves as people who want to pursue economic uplift for themselves, their families, their communities. They want healthcare. They want safe streets. They want a normal, good, prosperous American life. And they're not so sure the Democrats really have their backs on economics.\n\nIf you look at the data from what people think about how they fared under Trump as opposed to how they fared under Biden so far, Hispanics give very solid margins to Trump, and that has something to do with the lack of inflation when he was in office. Wages were going up. Things were stable. Then there is the whole issue of the lockdown, which really did not sit well with a lot of Hispanic voters who felt we were locked down for too long. Immigration is another example. I listened to a focus group of swing Hispanic voters recently, and it was extraordinary how negative and outraged they were on the immigration situation. This just gets back to the white, educated, liberal part of the Democratic voter base that thinks what they believe about the world must be what other elements of their base constituencies think.\n\nHas the party changed, or have the constituents changed?\n\nMM : You say there's no one single factor that has driven working-class voters from the Democratic Party. You compile this long list of possible reasons: Democrats' enthusiasm for immigration of unskilled workers, the support for abortion rights, support for strict gun control, support for and identification with the quest for new identities and lifestyles, particularly among the young, Democrats' insistence on eliminating fossil fuels, and many others. Aren't these people you're describing just lost to the Republican Party at this point because they're too conservative for the Democratic Party?\n\nJJ : I think the electorate is much mushier than the political scientists make out. If you look at Gallup's polling on party identification, the number of independents has just been rising to the stratosphere in the last ten years. There's a huge number of discontented voters and a lot of those are working-class voters. So, those voters are up for grabs. The Democrats' main problem may be geographic. I don't think the Democrats are ever going to win West Virginia back, as long as climate change is an issue. But bringing industry to Ohio, for example, if the UAW starts to organize some of these non-union foreign firms like Honda that have plants there, then I think you could see a lot of movement in certain parts of the Midwest. The other factor is suburbanites, women. So I think that the Democrats, in that sense, have a chance to win a lot of these people back.\n\nRT : I don't think the cultural barriers are as big as people think for the Democrats being able to win back over some of these voters. Most people are culturally moderate. They're not super conservative.\n\nMM : So how do you marginalize the cultural extremists in the party?\n\nRT : Well, how did the Sister Souljah thing work for Bill Clinton? He drew a line. He named names. I think this is something Democrats are very reluctant to do. When Biden, in his State of the Union address , said, \"Fund the police, fund the police, fund the police,\" that was fine, except he didn't point out any of the places in the Democratic Party where people aren't doing that. He didn't say, \"I disapprove of that. That's not what Democrats are about.\" Democrats need not just to make gestures toward the center. They have to really mean it and they have to emphasize it and actually make it part of their brand, their persona, their offer to voters. That's what Biden and Democrats, by and large, have not been willing to do. So if you want to disidentify the Democrats with cultural radicalism, you have to do it aggressively. The progressive left is a paper tiger. They're threatening that if you move to the center on any of these issues, that gazillions of young people who are controlled by liberal organizations, or listen to them, won't turn out or won't vote. I think that's baloney.\n\nOn the Democrats' shadow party:\n\nMM : Is this a media issue? If so few voters believe this kind of cultural radicalism, if they don't want to defund the police, if they don't know who Ibram X. Kendi is, why is this worldview so dominant?\n\nRT : The Democrats and their associated shadow party, this penumbra of media pundits and activists and nonprofits and advocacy groups and foundations, really control the commanding heights of cultural production. So the dominant narratives that get out there in a lot of the most prominent cultural and media areas of the country are really those that are consistent with this cultural radicalism that the Democrats are now so associated with. The institutions that dominate our cultural discourse are not channeling the view of the voter. They're channeling the view of the educated liberal folks who staff these institutions, who write things, who pontificate, who give out foundation grants, who advocate in Washington. And those people are, generally speaking, white, college-educated liberals, if not radicals, who have a particular point of view on the world. So even if, for example, \"defund the police\" was never anything that had a purchase among ordinary voters, including ordinary black voters, it suddenly blew up into something that people actually seem to be taking seriously and debating, despite the fact it was a terrible idea, and it's not actually what black people wanted.\n\nJJ : The other factor you have is that if you are organizing a group, or if you become the head of the ACLU, and you want to raise money, you need to have an active base that you're able to appeal to, and the way you appeal to them is not by having political views that will gain a majority in the country, but having views that will stir them up.\n\nMM : So it's an incentive problem in some way, too.\n\nRT : Yes. Follow the money, follow the prestige, follow the status. If you can get subscribers, support, likes, and money by taking these positions, you're going to continue to do it. What it doesn't do is allow you to form a broad coalition in American politics. But that's not the priority for a lot of these people.\n\nMM : Talk a little bit about money, because I've never seen a book in which every institution that is mentioned is followed by a note about who funds that institution.\n\nJJ : There's two aspects to it. First is the politicians. That's what people ordinarily talk about, and that remains important. The other aspect is the role of foundations in funding a lot of these groups that we're talking about. Black Lives Matter started a group in 2015 called The Movement for Black Lives. And they had a very controversial platform-for instance, guaranteed healthcare and guaranteed income for blacks only. They wanted an end to public jails. Well, the Ford Foundation joined forces with the Borealis Philanthropy to launch a six-year fundraising project aimed at giving $100 million to The Movement for Black Lives. So, you get these very controversial positions being reinforced by the foundations, who are giving them enormous amounts of money.\n\nOn the Democrats' strategy in 2024:\n\nJJ : I think the main problems are going to be to what extent are the Democrats going to define themselves simply in terms of Republican craziness, and to what extent are they going to find a path to winning back a lot of these other voters. And what I would expect in 2024 is not that they're going to call for \"defund the police.\" But it's going to be focused on how crazy the Republicans are.\n\nMM : What do you think of that tactic? If you did a LexisNexis search of MSNBC transcripts, which I have done, of the word fascism in the past four years, you could be clicking through 20 pages with 50 results a page. It's endless. The argument was that if you stuck with Donald Trump, this is incipient fascism and the American republic will crumble. Do you think that that's something that most Democrats are going to still push on with as the most effective way of fighting back against Trump?\n\nRT : I don't think there's any question that they're going to stick with that. I mean, look at the 2023 results right now, and in 2022 as well. I think they feel that's a great motivator for the high turnout parts of their base. And I don't think they feel comfortable defending Bidenomics or dealing with public safety and immigration issues in any serious way. They just want to highlight Republican extremism because that's what allows them to be victorious. So that's why John and I tend to think that because they'll take this tack, we are looking at another highly contested teeter-totter kind of election where the Democrats might come out on top with a strategy. They might not. But I think that's what they're committed to. And I don't think at this point they see any compelling reason to change their approach. As far as they're concerned, they think there's an anti-MAGA majority in this country and we just have to mobilize it, get our people out to the polls, and then we'll win. We don't really have to change anything substantively.\n\nJJ : The other thing I'd say is that the Republicans in the House are doing the Democrats an enormous favor, because there's a big middle of the electorate that's very skeptical about Washington and getting things done, and for the last 20, 30 years have blamed both parties. And I think if the Democrats had a really powerful candidate for president in 2024, they would win the House big and win the White House.\n\nTo support more vital conversation, become a Free Press subscriber today:\n\nIn short, the Democratic platform will be built on a divisive lie that Republicans are fascist. Meanwhile, Trump did not lock up a single political prisoner or curtail anyone's rights.\n\nBut the progressive agenda have conspired with NGO's and social media to suppress speech, impose laws to fine people for speech they don't like; fired, censored and deplatformed countless speakers and academics; imposed by fiat loan forgiveness, eviction moratoriums, vax mandates and DEI pledges of allegiance; reinstate Title IX kangaroo courts at universities; impose equity through unequal treatment; sic the DOJ on school board protestors and Catholics; allowed agents of chaos to riot, burn and loot cities with impunity - the list goes on.\n\nI'm shocked, utterly shocked they'd resort to lies.\n\nOver the past forty years, the Democratic Party has been transformed and weakened, from the donor top down, by meritocratic, neoliberal Boomers who radically broke with the FDR traditions of the old Dem party based on solidarity with the working and lower classes of all races in order to get as rich as possible. These Dem neoliberals prided themselves on being \"socially liberal but fiscally conservative.\" That meant that in post-60s American they loved being bobos, college-educated elites, often risen from below because of college, who gloried in feeling morally superior to white working-class deplorables because the grads were totally PC on gender, race, and LGBTQ+ rights, which never cost any of them a dime in new taxes to support. The fiscal conservatism of these yuppies of all ages was a matter primarily of backing globalist Dem servants of Wall St. and corporate America, like Clinton and Obama, who were by definition de facto enemies of the working class because they backed the same globalistic political economy that gutted our industrial base by shipping it to China etc. as Reagan and the Bushes. Needless to say, the stock profits and exploding corporate salaries produced by globalization were hugely responsible for the massive wealth gains of our so-called \"meritocrats\" in both parties. So the second part of the \"fiscal conservatism\" of these nouveaux riches Dem yuppies (of whom the rise of the Clintons and the Obamas are almost parodically perfect examples) was naturally an aversion to tax increases almost identical to that of their young Republican twins, who only differed from Dem yuppies in not constantly virtue signaing about their devotion to \"rights\" for the \"oppressed\" which they could conveniently support tax-free. Long ago, during the Clinton presidency, the Rust Belt got wise to the ways in which yuppie Dem elites like the Clintons were constantly redefining \"liberalism\" as \"helping\" women, blacks, and the LGBTQ+, while these same yuppie Dems were as busy screwing over the American working class, mostly white demographically, with globalization as the Republicans any day. NAFTA said it all. Started by Bush, passed by Clinton. Republican Boomers like Trump have been more than happy to exploit the Dem yuppies' betrayal of the white working class by wooing them with incessant culture wars about (what else?) women, blacks, and the LGBTQ+. This was great for distracting white workers from the fact that Republican yuppies were waging exactly the same economic war against the workers Dem yuppies were, and conning white workers into believing only Dem PC yuppies were the \"elites\" screwing them over economically, when in fact Republican yuppies were just as much class enemies economically of the white workers as Dems any day. Let's hope that younger Dems follow Bernie's lead in trying to get the Dems back to their economic FDR roots as the friends of workers and the poor of all genders, races, ethnic groups, and sexual preferences, as well as being the enemies of the legacy of the Boomer yuppie meritocratic \"malefactors\" of globalization in both parties. We need a united front of young, progressive FDR ecomic liberals and the workers of all types they are equally fighting for economic justice for. That could unite America again, as it was under FDR, and help the country be as prosperous and powerful for all our citizens as possible. United we stand; divided against China and the rest we fall.\n\nNo posts"

The Republicans, meanwhile, have become a cult of personality.  There is a real need for more pragmatic political solutions being offered by a centrist party rather than the craziness now on display by Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nThis article and discussion seems completely out of touch with the current state of affairs. October 7 and the unconscionable praise or affirming silence of many on the left has completely upended the status quo. Many mainline Dems are horrified by what \"progressive\" identity politics has done to our universities and cities. A large contingent of left leaning voters have been set adrift without a political home - abandoned by the party they thought had their back.  This article ignores these facts, which only highlights how out of touch this analysis is.\n\nI'm sick and tired of both parties.   They are both deplorable and don't govern to take care of the needs of the  people they are elected to care for.  They instead care about filling their own pockets, their friends, big pharma's and other self interested billionaires.  Enough already!  Kennedy will get my vote as the politician who truly cares about changing the wreckage our country had become.\n\nFascist is a great word for Dems to run with. With the BLM riots, Defund the Police, and now the pro Hamas antisemitic displays the argument gets thrown right back at them.  Any normal Republican ( Haley) will absolutely destroy Biden, as the initial polls clearly confirmed.  Trump will still lose to any Democrat.\n\nWhere Have All the Democrats Gone? Some have gone to the Republican party but many, especially younger voters, have moved towards a more populist independent mindset. Many will not show up next year for either of the two 'old guys' but those that do will vote for RFK Jr or some other non-party candidate. Both parties will become less relevant as boomers die off and younger voters become the majority.\n\nI do not see any way that the stealth Kamala Harris for president bit is going to work for the progressives.  Not many middle class Democrats of any of the human colors can stomach her.  And Joe certainly does not seem to be hitting all cylinders these days.  So a vote for Joe is a vote for Kamala.  Real.\n\nNice try, but pretty much a useless article. The commenters are part of the \"professional class\" and way too much a part of the problem to be able to comment appropriately on it. Plus they know somewhere between little and nothing about what Republican voters think or what motivates them.\n\nNeither party has ever been pure. There's extremism on both sides. But the fringe left has a ball-clamp on the Democratic Party. Asian, Hispanic and Black voters are leaving the Democrats in droves. Lefties desperately need the reason for that to be white racism, and minorities voting 'against their own interests,' but the real reason is that the 8% of Americans who identity as 'progressive' (overwhelmingly white, young and rich) dominate the media narrative, and that narrative has become increasingly radical. They're completely out of step with the working classes of all races. The fringe Woke left needs to be excised from the Democratic Party if there's any hope for liberals. A new Obama-style coalition needs to happen. Personally I'd like to see moderates on both sides join hands. But that's doubtful.\n\nMichael Mohr\n\nSincere American Writing\n\nhttps://michaelmohr.substack.com/\n\nIt's not complicated. The left decided that an \"end run\" to social issues was the best way to attack (what they view) as the core injustice within western democratic capitalism - lack of equal outcomes. So they put all their efforts over a generation into portraying every possible identity group as victims of the white, heterosexual male. Because they cannot argue the economic failures of capitalism (they lost that one long ago) - they instead argue that the people running it are doing so only because of profound injustice.\n\nI cited actions, not words. You tell me to research words alone. You offer nothing to support your initial assertion.\n\nI viewed Trump as a protest vote in 2016. His election would not be the end of the world, the USA had  survived plenty of bad Presidents. When he won I naively believed there would be some form of reflection by the establishment & attempts to address issues which actually affected the ordinary people. Instead most Democrats (& some Republicans) went stark raving lunatic asylum screaming screeching nuts & appeared to have stayed that way. Terrifying.\n\nPoll after poll says a large percentage of Americans are dissatisfied with both parties and partisan BS. The Trump and Obama presidencies, for all their hoopla, didn't inspire anything like the trust that previous leaders had.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s liberals solved many American problems, changing our thinking and behavior in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly among people born after 1960.  So much so, a mainstream Republican takes for granted so many points raised by old liberals as requiring correction.  Color-blind, check; women in the workplace in roles once reserved for men - fighter pilot, CEO, lawyer, garbage truck driver, and at the same pay, check. and so on.  Liberals have run out of issue.  What they need to focus on are the few remaining problems - a truly decent education for all - teachers' Unions showed their colors and value in the Pandemic.  Education, be it academic or technical, is a civil rights issue, but poor versus rich, not by race.  And governance is terrible.  Government and the incompetency of our Federal government.  Imagine not knowing where $300 billion or more of COVID funds went.  Business is skewed to executives rewarded extravagantly for success OR failure.  Liberals, it is time to refocus on problems rather than lunatic ideologies.  As a man, I will not need an abortion, but then maybe it is because I am beyond MEN-0-pause.  Oh, and stop the hate wing-nuts.\n\nClimate change is an \"elitist\" issue? Seriously? It affects us all, but low income communities and countries suffer the most from the mounting disruptions: floods, droughts, fires..."

      "text": "You know the stereotype of the NPR listener: an EV-driving, Wordle-playing, tote bag-carrying coastal elite. It doesn't precisely describe me, but it's not far off. I'm Sarah Lawrence-educated, was raised by a lesbian peace activist mother , I drive a Subaru, and Spotify says my listening habits are most similar to people in Berkeley.\n\nI fit the NPR mold. I'll cop to that.\n\nSo when I got a job here 25 years ago, I never looked back. As a senior editor on the business desk where news is always breaking, we've covered upheavals in the workplace, supermarket prices, social media, and AI.\n\nIt's true NPR has always had a liberal bent, but during most of my tenure here, an open-minded, curious culture prevailed. We were nerdy, but not knee-jerk, activist, or scolding.\n\nIn recent years, however, that has changed. Today, those who listen to NPR or read its coverage online find something different: the distilled worldview of a very small segment of the U.S. population.\n\nIf you are conservative, you will read this and say, duh, it's always been this way.\n\nBut it hasn't.\n\nFor decades, since its founding in 1970, a wide swath of America tuned in to NPR for reliable journalism and gorgeous audio pieces with birds singing in the Amazon. Millions came to us for conversations that exposed us to voices around the country and the world radically different from our own-engaging precisely because they were unguarded and unpredictable. No image generated more pride within NPR than the farmer listening to Morning Edition from his or her tractor at sunrise.\n\nBack in 2011, although NPR's audience tilted a bit to the left, it still bore a resemblance to America at large . Twenty-six percent of listeners described themselves as conservative, 23 percent as middle of the road, and 37 percent as liberal.\n\nBy 2023, the picture was completely different: only 11 percent described themselves as very or somewhat conservative, 21 percent as middle of the road, and 67 percent of listeners said they were very or somewhat liberal. We weren't just losing conservatives; we were also losing moderates and traditional liberals.\n\nAn open-minded spirit no longer exists within NPR, and now, predictably, we don't have an audience that reflects America.\n\nThat wouldn't be a problem for an openly polemical news outlet serving a niche audience. But for NPR, which purports to consider all things, it's devastating both for its journalism and its business model.\n\nLike many unfortunate things, the rise of advocacy took off with Donald Trump. As in many newsrooms, his election in 2016 was greeted at NPR with a mixture of disbelief, anger, and despair. (Just to note, I eagerly voted against Trump twice but felt we were obliged to cover him fairly.) But what began as tough, straightforward coverage of a belligerent, truth-impaired president veered toward efforts to damage or topple Trump's presidency.\n\nPersistent rumors that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia over the election became the catnip that drove reporting. At NPR, we hitched our wagon to Trump's most visible antagonist, Representative Adam Schiff.\n\nSchiff, who was the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, became NPR's guiding hand, its ever-present muse. By my count, NPR hosts interviewed Schiff 25 times about Trump and Russia. During many of those conversations, Schiff alluded to purported evidence of collusion. The Schiff talking points became the drumbeat of NPR news reports.\n\nBut when the Mueller report found no credible evidence of collusion, NPR's coverage was notably sparse. Russiagate quietly faded from our programming.\n\nIt is one thing to swing and miss on a major story. Unfortunately, it happens. You follow the wrong leads, you get misled by sources you trusted, you're emotionally invested in a narrative, and bits of circumstantial evidence never add up. It's bad to blow a big story.\n\nWhat's worse is to pretend it never happened, to move on with no mea culpas, no self-reflection. Especially when you expect high standards of transparency from public figures and institutions, but don't practice those standards yourself. That's what shatters trust and engenders cynicism about the media.\n\nRussiagate was not NPR's only miscue.\n\nIn October 2020, the New York Post published the explosive report about the laptop Hunter Biden abandoned at a Delaware computer shop containing emails about his sordid business dealings. With the election only weeks away, NPR turned a blind eye. Here's how NPR's managing editor for news at the time explained the thinking : \"We don't want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories, and we don't want to waste the listeners' and readers' time on stories that are just pure distractions.\"\n\nBut it wasn't a pure distraction, or a product of Russian disinformation, as dozens of former and current intelligence officials suggested. The laptop did belong to Hunter Biden. Its contents revealed his connection to the corrupt world of multimillion-dollar influence peddling and its possible implications for his father.\n\nThe laptop was newsworthy. But the timeless journalistic instinct of following a hot story lead was being squelched. During a meeting with colleagues, I listened as one of NPR's best and most fair-minded journalists said it was good we weren't following the laptop story because it could help Trump.\n\nWhen the essential facts of the Post 's reporting were confirmed and the emails verified independently about a year and a half later, we could have fessed up to our misjudgment. But, like Russia collusion, we didn't make the hard choice of transparency.\n\nPolitics also intruded into NPR's Covid coverage, most notably in reporting on the origin of the pandemic. One of the most dismal aspects of Covid journalism is how quickly it defaulted to ideological story lines. For example, there was Team Natural Origin-supporting the hypothesis that the virus came from a wild animal market in Wuhan, China. And on the other side, Team Lab Leak, leaning into the idea that the virus escaped from a Wuhan lab.\n\nThe lab leak theory came in for rough treatment almost immediately, dismissed as racist or a right-wing conspiracy theory. Anthony Fauci and former NIH head Francis Collins , representing the public health establishment, were its most notable critics. And that was enough for NPR. We became fervent members of Team Natural Origin, even declaring that the lab leak had been debunked by scientists.\n\nBut that wasn't the case.\n\nWhen word first broke of a mysterious virus in Wuhan, a number of leading virologists immediately suspected it could have leaked from a lab there conducting experiments on bat coronaviruses. This was in January 2020, during calmer moments before a global pandemic had been declared, and before fear spread and politics intruded.\n\nReporting on a possible lab leak soon became radioactive. Fauci and Collins apparently encouraged the March publication of an influential scientific paper known as \"The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2.\" Its authors wrote they didn't believe \"any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.\"\n\nBut the lab leak hypothesis wouldn't die. And understandably so. In private, even some of the scientists who penned the article dismissing it sounded a different tune. One of the authors, Andrew Rambaut, an evolutionary biologist from Edinburgh University, wrote to his colleagues , \"I literally swivel day by day thinking it is a lab escape or natural.\"\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, a number of investigative journalists made compelling, if not conclusive, cases for the lab leak. But at NPR, we weren't about to swivel or even tiptoe away from the insistence with which we backed the natural origin story. We didn't budge when the Energy Department-the federal agency with the most expertise about laboratories and biological research- concluded , albeit with low confidence, that a lab leak was the most likely explanation for the emergence of the virus.\n\nInstead, we introduced our coverage of that development on February 28, 2023, by asserting confidently that \"the scientific evidence overwhelmingly points to a natural origin for the virus.\"\n\nWhen a colleague on our science desk was asked why they were so dismissive of the lab leak theory, the response was odd. The colleague compared it to the Bush administration's unfounded argument that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, apparently meaning we won't get fooled again. But these two events were not even remotely related. Again, politics were blotting out the curiosity and independence that ought to have been driving our work.\n\nI'm offering three examples of widely followed stories where I believe we faltered. Our coverage is out there in the public domain. Anyone can read or listen for themselves and make their own judgment. But to truly understand how independent journalism suffered at NPR, you need to step inside the organization.\n\nYou need to start with former CEO John Lansing. Lansing came to NPR in 2019 from the federally funded agency that oversees Voice of America . Like others who have served in the top job at NPR, he was hired primarily to raise money and to ensure good working relations with hundreds of member stations that acquire NPR's programming.\n\nAfter working mostly behind the scenes, Lansing became a more visible and forceful figure after the killing of George Floyd in May 2020. It was an anguished time in the newsroom, personally and professionally so for NPR staffers. Floyd's murder, captured on video, changed both the conversation and the daily operations at NPR.\n\nGiven the circumstances of Floyd's death, it would have been an ideal moment to tackle a difficult question: Is America, as progressive activists claim, beset by systemic racism in the 2020s-in law enforcement, education, housing, and elsewhere? We happen to have a very powerful tool for answering such questions: journalism. Journalism that lets evidence lead the way.\n\nBut the message from the top was very different. America's infestation with systemic racism was declared loud and clear: it was a given. Our mission was to change it.\n\n\"When it comes to identifying and ending systemic racism,\" Lansing wrote in a companywide article, \"we can be agents of change. Listening and deep reflection are necessary but not enough. They must be followed by constructive and meaningful steps forward. I will hold myself accountable for this.\"\n\nAnd we were told that NPR itself was part of the problem. In confessional language he said the leaders of public media, \"starting with me-must be aware of how we ourselves have benefited from white privilege in our careers. We must understand the unconscious bias we bring to our work and interactions. And we must commit ourselves-body and soul-to profound changes in ourselves and our institutions.\"\n\nHe declared that diversity-on our staff and in our audience-was the overriding mission, the \"North Star\" of the organization. Phrases like \"that's part of the North Star\" became part of meetings and more casual conversation.\n\nRace and identity became paramount in nearly every aspect of the workplace. Journalists were required to ask everyone we interviewed their race, gender, and ethnicity (among other questions), and had to enter it in a centralized tracking system. We were given unconscious bias training sessions. A growing DEI staff offered regular meetings imploring us to \"start talking about race.\" Monthly dialogues were offered for \"women of color\" and \"men of color.\" Nonbinary people of color were included, too.\n\nThese initiatives, bolstered by a $1 million grant from the NPR Foundation, came from management, from the top down. Crucially, they were in sync culturally with what was happening at the grassroots-among producers, reporters, and other staffers. Most visible was a burgeoning number of employee resource (or affinity) groups based on identity.\n\nThey included MGIPOC (Marginalized Genders and Intersex People of Color mentorship program); Mi Gente (Latinx employees at NPR); NPR Noir (black employees at NPR); Southwest Asians and North Africans at NPR; Ummah (for Muslim-identifying employees); Women, Gender-Expansive, and Transgender People in Technology Throughout Public Media; Khevre (Jewish heritage and culture at NPR); and NPR Pride (LGBTQIA employees at NPR).\n\nAll this reflected a broader movement in the culture of people clustering together based on ideology or a characteristic of birth. If, as NPR's internal website suggested, the groups were simply a \"great way to meet like-minded colleagues\" and \"help new employees feel included,\" it would have been one thing.\n\nBut the role and standing of affinity groups, including those outside NPR, were more than that. They became a priority for NPR's union, SAG-AFTRA-an item in collective bargaining. The current contract, in a section on DEI, requires NPR management to \"keep up to date with current language and style guidance from journalism affinity groups\" and to inform employees if language differs from the diktats of those groups. In such a case, the dispute could go before the DEI Accountability Committee.\n\nIn essence, this means the NPR union, of which I am a dues-paying member, has ensured that advocacy groups are given a seat at the table in determining the terms and vocabulary of our news coverage.\n\nConflicts between workers and bosses, between labor and management, are common in workplaces. NPR has had its share. But what's notable is the extent to which people at every level of NPR have comfortably coalesced around the progressive worldview.\n\nAnd this, I believe, is the most damaging development at NPR: the absence of viewpoint diversity.\n\nToday on Honestly Bari talks to Uri about this essay and his decision to publish it. Listen here:\n\nThere's an unspoken consensus about the stories we should pursue and how they should be framed. It's frictionless-one story after another about instances of supposed racism, transphobia, signs of the climate apocalypse, Israel doing something bad, and the dire threat of Republican policies. It's almost like an assembly line.\n\nThe mindset prevails in choices about language. In a document called NPR Transgender Coverage Guidance-disseminated by news management-we're asked to avoid the term biological sex . (The editorial guidance was prepared with the help of a former staffer of the National Center for Transgender Equality.) The mindset animates bizarre stories-on how The Beatles and bird names are racially problematic, and others that are alarmingly divisive; justifying looting , with claims that fears about crime are racist ; and suggesting that Asian Americans who oppose affirmative action have been manipulated by white conservatives.\n\nMore recently, we have approached the Israel-Hamas war and its spillover onto streets and campuses through the \"intersectional\" lens that has jumped from the faculty lounge to newsrooms. Oppressor versus oppressed. That's meant highlighting the suffering of Palestinians at almost every turn while downplaying the atrocities of October 7, overlooking how Hamas intentionally puts Palestinian civilians in peril, and giving little weight to the explosion of antisemitic hate around the world.\n\nFor nearly all my career, working at NPR has been a source of great pride. It's a privilege to work in the newsroom at a crown jewel of American journalism. My colleagues are congenial and hardworking.\n\nI can't count the number of times I would meet someone, describe what I do, and they'd say, \"I love NPR!\"\n\nAnd they wouldn't stop there. They would mention their favorite host or one of those \"driveway moments\" where a story was so good you'd stay in your car until it finished.\n\nIt still happens, but often now the trajectory of the conversation is different. After the initial \"I love NPR,\" there's a pause and a person will acknowledge, \"I don't listen as much as I used to.\" Or, with some chagrin: \"What's happening there? Why is NPR telling me what to think?\"\n\nIn recent years I've struggled to answer that question. Concerned by the lack of viewpoint diversity, I looked at voter registration for our newsroom. In D.C., where NPR is headquartered and many of us live, I found 87 registered Democrats working in editorial positions and zero Republicans. None.\n\nSo on May 3, 2021, I presented the findings at an all-hands editorial staff meeting. When I suggested we had a diversity problem with a score of 87 Democrats and zero Republicans, the response wasn't hostile. It was worse. It was met with profound indifference. I got a few messages from surprised, curious colleagues. But the messages were of the \"oh wow, that's weird\" variety, as if the lopsided tally was a random anomaly rather than a critical failure of our diversity North Star.\n\nIn a follow-up email exchange, a top NPR news executive told me that she had been \"skewered\" for bringing up diversity of thought when she arrived at NPR. So, she said, \"I want to be careful how we discuss this publicly.\"\n\nFor years, I have been persistent. When I believe our coverage has gone off the rails, I have written regular emails to top news leaders, sometimes even having one-on-one sessions with them. On March 10, 2022, I wrote to a top news executive about the numerous times we described the controversial education bill in Florida as the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill when it didn't even use the word gay . I pushed to set the record straight, and wrote another time to ask why we keep using that word that many Hispanics hate- Latinx . On March 31, 2022, I was invited to a managers' meeting to present my observations.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, no one has ever trashed me. That's not the NPR way. People are polite. But nothing changes. So I've become a visible wrong-thinker at a place I love. It's uncomfortable, sometimes heartbreaking.\n\nEven so, out of frustration, on November 6, 2022, I wrote to the captain of ship North Star-CEO John Lansing-about the lack of viewpoint diversity and asked if we could have a conversation about it. I got no response, so I followed up four days later. He said he would appreciate hearing my perspective and copied his assistant to set up a meeting. On December 15, the morning of the meeting, Lansing's assistant wrote back to cancel our conversation because he was under the weather. She said he was looking forward to chatting and a new meeting invitation would be sent. But it never came.\n\nI won't speculate about why our meeting never happened. Being CEO of NPR is a demanding job with lots of constituents and headaches to deal with. But what's indisputable is that no one in a C-suite or upper management position has chosen to deal with the lack of viewpoint diversity at NPR and how that affects our journalism.\n\nWhich is a shame. Because for all the emphasis on our North Star, NPR's news audience in recent years has become less diverse, not more so. Back in 2011, our audience leaned a bit to the left but roughly reflected America politically; now, the audience is cramped into a smaller, progressive silo.\n\nDespite all the resources we'd devoted to building up our news audience among blacks and Hispanics, the numbers have barely budged. In 2023, according to our demographic research, 6 percent of our news audience was black, far short of the overall U.S. adult population, which is 14.4 percent black. And Hispanics were only 7 percent, compared to the overall Hispanic adult population, around 19 percent. Our news audience doesn't come close to reflecting America. It's overwhelmingly white and progressive, and clustered around coastal cities and college towns.\n\nThese are perilous times for news organizations. Last year, NPR laid off or bought out 10 percent of its staff and canceled four podcasts following a slump in advertising revenue. Our radio audience is dwindling and our podcast downloads are down from 2020. The digital stories on our website rarely have national impact. They aren't conversation starters. Our competitive advantage in audio-where for years NPR had no peer-is vanishing. There are plenty of informative and entertaining podcasts to choose from.\n\nEven within our diminished audience, there's evidence of trouble at the most basic level: trust.\n\nIn February, our audience insights team sent an email proudly announcing that we had a higher trustworthy score than CNN or The New York Times . But the research from Harris Poll is hardly reassuring. It found that \"3-in-10 audience members familiar with NPR said they associate NPR with the characteristic 'trustworthy.' \" Only in a world where media credibility has completely imploded would a 3-in-10 trustworthy score be something to boast about.\n\nWith declining ratings, sorry levels of trust, and an audience that has become less diverse over time, the trajectory for NPR is not promising. Two paths seem clear. We can keep doing what we're doing, hoping it will all work out. Or we could start over, with the basic building blocks of journalism. We could face up to where we've gone wrong. News organizations don't go in for that kind of reckoning. But there's a good reason for NPR to be the first: we're the ones with the word public in our name.\n\nDespite our missteps at NPR, defunding isn't the answer. As the country becomes more fractured, there's still a need for a public institution where stories are told and viewpoints exchanged in good faith. Defunding, as a rebuke from Congress, wouldn't change the journalism at NPR. That needs to come from within.\n\nA few weeks ago, NPR welcomed a new CEO , Katherine Maher, who's been a leader in tech. She doesn't have a news background, which could be an asset given where things stand. I'll be rooting for her. It's a tough job. Her first rule could be simple enough: don't tell people how to think. It could even be the new North Star.\n\nUri Berliner is a senior business editor and reporter at NPR.  His work has been recognized with a Peabody Award, a Loeb Award, an Edward R. Murrow Award, and a Society of Professional Journalists New America Award, among others. Follow him on X (formerly Twitter) @uberliner .\n\nTo support our mission of independent journalism, become a Free Press subscriber today:\n\nWhen I see good writing, I realize how much I miss it.  Well done, Uri, and thank you.\n\nI'm one of those conservatives who listens to NPR.  I enjoy the well-modulated voices and clear enunciation, and the upspeak and vocal fry are not too bad.  But those would obviously not be reasons to listen.  The reason is simple:  There's no faster way to know what the progressive cause du jour is and how progressive propagandists are trying to frame the narrative.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "Liberals Hit Musk's Biggest Weakness\n\nEditorial Team November 21, 2023\n\nWhat's happening: Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) recently filed a defamation lawsuit against Media Matters, accusing the left-wing activist group of intentionally circulating misinformation in an attempt to drive advertisers away from X.\n\nThe report: Media Matters recently published a report alleging advertisements from major companies were appearing next to \"pro-Nazi content\" on X.\n\nPushing back: X argues Media Matters manipulated algorithms to make it appear as if the phenomenon was far more widespread than it actually is: the report \"knowingly and maliciously\" skewed the data to fabricate a \"typical X users experience on the platform.\"\n\nHot water: This all comes in the wake of a tweet Musk recently posted in which he seemed to agree with an X user who suggested Jewish communities \"push hatred against whites.\" Musk later clarified he was referring to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nBacklash: That didn't stop many high-profile antisemites from amplifying Musk's original statement, and even celebrating that he was one of them. Major companies such as Apple, IBM, Disney, and Comcast announced they would pause ads on X because of the controversy surrounding the Media Matters report and Musk's tweet.\n\nStill, a number of well-known conservative Jews, including Ben Shapiro, Chaya Raichik, and Bill Ackman, defended Musk against allegations of antisemitism.\n\nBetween the lines: When Elon Musk took the reins at X, he promised to end widespread censorship on the platform. That meant those who were previously banned can now actively use X. Musk's goal of absolute free speech means some unpalatable ideas like antisemitism, which seems to be on the rise on X, will be allowed.\n\nWhy it matters: Elon Musk's control of X ahead of 2024 is causing panic among liberals and Democrats who previously benefited from government-coordinated censorship on the platform. The specter of truly free speech is a vulnerability for Musk - one liberals are now trying to exploit to damage the platform.\n\nUpward News\n\nNeed-to-know reporting and analysis you won't find in the mainstream media.\n\nHome\n\nPosts\n\nAccount\n\nUpgrade\n\nAbout us\n\nAbout\n\n© 2025 Upward News.\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use"

      "text": "The future of the American right is post-liberal. Don't take that from me. Take it from the mainstream media. In recent days, prestige outlets have published a number of \"deep dives\" into the cohort of scholars and writers (including yours truly) pushing the right to govern for the common good, rather than abandon society to acidic market forces, corporate domination, and the progressive left's cultural furies.\n\nThese include an essay in the New Republic attempting, with some success, to untangle the relationship between political Catholicism and national conservatism and what's afoot in Central and Eastern Europe; an admirably fair Washington Post profile of Ohio Senate contender J.D. Vance; and a Vox interview with Sam Adler-Bell , a left-wing writer who pitches himself as something of an expert on the new right (I think he has much to learn yet). Moreover, the New York Times editorial page turned to me for a right-wing take on the anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol; take a glance .\n\nYet with the growing attention comes often-heard questions and criticisms, some lodged in good faith, others not. The most commonly heard question-cum-objection is this: What do you post-liberals want, concretely? Why do you always deal in abstractions, rather than in practical politics?\n\nThere's a lot to be said for a pragmatic spirit, of course. But unless we get the theory right, we may find ourselves engaging in furious but ultimately fruitless activity. It's the speculative that determines our ultimate horizon, the end goal. More to the point, though, it simply isn't true that the post-liberals don't deal with legal and policy specifics.\n\nAdrian Vermeule, for example, is a council member of the Administrative Council of the United States and the nation's foremost expert on administrative law. Gladden Pappin has toiled for years on family policy, and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic seek out his counsel in this area. And Christopher Rufo's campaign against critical race theory is best understood as a post-liberal project. At the core of his argument, after all, is the notion that the state must ensure that children are taught the truth in school. His claims, in other words, aren't grounded in the liberal theories of neutrality that prevail on the establishment right.\n\nThen there's restoration of the American Sabbath (\"blue laws\"), a proposal Vermeule brought up in response to the latest round of questions about why post-liberals don't dwell in policy detail. In my most recent book, The Unbroken Thread , I devoted a chapter to exploring Sabbath's meaning in the modern world-and why the loss of America's Sabbatarian tradition has made us less, not more, free. An essay based on that chapter appeared in the Wall Street Journal when the book was first published.\n\nI don't want to recapitulate the whole argument here. Rather, I want to make a case for why post-liberals should pursue it as a concrete campaign in 2022 and beyond.\n\nFor starters, Sabbath speaks profoundly to the restlessness and misery that is the lot of millions of Americans. The erasure of the boundary between toil and rest is something felt as much by white-collar professionals as by working-class Americans, albeit in different ways. America's blue laws were abolished in the name of freedom, but it turned out to be freedom for Jeff Bezos and other large employers. Not freedom for workers or families.\n\nPlus, the Sabbath is good realignment politics, at a time when workers have the job-market advantage. A campaign for the Sabbath can bring together labor unions, religious conservatives, and small-business owners (that last group historically opposed abolishing blue laws for lack of ability to compete). Can any other issue unite three core constituencies of the new right quite like Sabbath?\n\nSuch a union wouldn't be a novel thing, moreover. As historian Gillis Harp recounts in his book Protestants and American Conservatism , it was an alliance of Christians and the nascent labor movement that at the turn of the 20th century managed to put a stop to Sunday mail delivery (applying Sabbatarian laws to federal mail delivery was a flash point between Protestant activists and pro-business types throughout the 19th century).\n\nA Sabbath campaign would also serve as a reminder that America has nonliberal traditions. A certain kind of classical liberal likes to pretend that America was a Reason magazine project from its origins. But this is what Patrick Deneen calls \"an invented tradition.\" In fact, Americans carved out a day for rest and worship going back to the colonial era, not just in Puritan New England, but even in New Amsterdam and Virginia.\n\nFinally, there is no \"originalist\" case against Sabbatarianism. As I noted in the WSJ essay, \"so seriously did early Americans take the Sabbath that, legend has it, even President George Washington got an earful from a local magistrate for riding from Connecticut to New York on a Sunday in 1789.\" By insisting on Sabbatarianism, post-liberals can highlight how free-market fundamentalists have no roots in the tradition.\n\n\"Bosses, Give Us Our Weekend Back\" would make for a potent slogan.\n\nSohrab Ahmari is a founder and editor of Compact magazine, a contributing editor of The American Conservative, and a visiting fellow of the Veritas Center for Ethics in Public Life at Franciscan University.

      "text": "My friend Matt Sitman tweets:\n\nSo I finished Hillbilly Elegy. Gonna write a long review. I was right about why conservatives like it so much\n\n- Matthew Sitman (@matthew_sitman) August 5, 2016\n\nYes, but the more interesting question, at least to me, is why so many liberals like it - or at least why they are writing to me in droves saying how the interview J.D. Vance did with me deeply resonated with them, and inspired them to buy the book. (By the way, that interview was published two weeks ago today, and it's still drawing so much web traffic to this site that our servers are struggling to handle it.) I'll give you a sample below of the kind of correspondence I'm getting (with a couple of tweaks to protect privacy). There's lots of it just like these below:\n\nMr. Dreher, this article was fantastic.\n\nI grew up in rural Alabama, proudly declared myself \"politically somewhere to the right of Attila the Hun\", and enlisted when I was 17. I had a difficult time getting out at 23 years old, several states away from my family, with a grownup's bills to pay but an MOS that didn't match the career I was suited for or needed as a civilian. I spent the next several years desperately poor but \"self-sufficient\" - as far as I knew, anyway.\n\nIn reality, of course, I had zero understanding of how taxes work. I saw about a 28% bite taken out of my paycheck, and didn't understand that FICA/SS didn't ultimately go to anybody but me, myself, and I, and that I wasn't actually paying any income tax. I also had heard of but didn't really understand or care about things like \"every federal tax dollar that leaves SC has three federal tax dollars pass by it coming in.\"\n\nTruth be told, I wasn't just unaware, I actively disbelieved that I wasn't \"self sufficient\" at all, and I naively thought that I was paying for the \"welfare\" that the tiny, tiny portion of the population \"poorer than me\" was getting. I was also completely unaware that I was \"desperately poor\" at all. I was making $6/hr and I thought I was middle class! I knew people who made $10/hr, and I thought they were on the low end of upper class! Eventually I made a real career for myself, started my own business, and spent less time scratching and kicking and fighting just to stay alive. The more time and resources I had, the more I learned about how the world, and politics, worked, and the more progressive I became. I am not, today, someone who would normally read articles from a site called \"American Conservative\".\n\nBut I read yours, and I'm glad I did. What you and J.D. Vance had to say in that article are exactly what I want to hear from the conservative wing of American politics. Speaking candidly, I'm unlikely to be a \"conservative\" again - I'm a progressive, and likely to stay that way. But what you and Vance said was thoughtful, and reasonable, and - like I try to very publicly be myself, having \"been there and done that\" - understanding of the realities of the working poor. It's the real and sensible ballast that even the best of real and sensible balloons (if you'll permit the analogy between conservative and progressive, and we can both agree to handwave away the fact that the current DNC is neither as real or as sensible as it should be) needs.\n\nThat's probably way too much to slog through, but seriously: thank you.\n\nAnother one:\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this article! The conversation is not one that I have witnessed anyone else having. It is so easy to dismiss people as racist without ever considering from where their views and positions are derived. I am certainly going to read Hillbilly Elegy and look forward to reading more of your articles, By the way I am black, liberal, I most often vote Democrat and I don't like Trump (for Reasons too high in number to state). I enjoy intelligent conversation and debate and have learned to carefully listen to and understand those who I may disagree with, so I might be educated fully on the issue not just entrenched in my beliefs.\n\nThank you for a refreshing read in a sea partisan sludge.\n\nAnother one, this from a reader who mistakenly believed that J.D. Vance's experiences were mine. Still, his letter is fascinating:\n\nI wandered in on this article today... and couldn't stop reading. I'm Californian, a progressive and a Sanders supporter, a former Nader supporter, a former UAW organizer, currently a medical devices engineer in [state], and have a Ph.D. in engineering. I grew up in a town 5 miles north of the Mexican border in south San Diego, and grew up among Mexican immigrants, many of whom were undocumented... they were my neighbors, my friends, my elders. I myself am an immigrant, came here as a kid with my parents, who were liberals who wanted something better than that right-wing dictatorship in [another country].\n\nBut I did grow up around the poverty line. My parents fought hard to stay out of welfare, to stay together, and to teach us the value of work. At 43, I have always worked since I was 14, and have always associated these traits with working-class liberal values... and was quite surprised many election cycles ago to hear silver-spooned class enemies in the GOP pick that up. What did these bastards know about real work? But it also pains me to see the elites, especially the East Coast elites, take over the Democratic Party.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your experiences at Yale Law. And I'm glad that I didn't go to a private school, or a school in the East Coast. After moving to [my current state] 3 years ago I've found that liberals \"out east\" (east of the Sierra Nevadas) seem to come from privilege, are more dogmatic, disconnected from the working class, and can be super competitive and vindictive. I even remember starting out as an undergrad and scholarship kid at UC San Diego, how I felt the sting of class. I felt disconnected culturally from the liberals. It wasn't until friends from high school began shipping back from Desert Storm all crazy and screwed up that I found common cause with these liberals.\n\nAs with the folks of Appalachia (I was a member of the Southern Baptist Church... it was a big military town), the defense of our neighborhoods was also paramount to us. What south San Diegans were seeing during the 90s was an entire generation deployed to guard oil fields in Iraq while the princelings of Kuwait lived it up in night clubs, and folks in Sacramento setting up laws that attack immigrants as a cheap shot to get elected. Everything was fine at the border until these demagogues (Republicans in this case) started showing up in our town in staged photo-ops.\n\nTrump does have that appeal of at least pretending to listen to the broken and forgotten. But just as we were about to forget the vengeance we swore against those who hurt our town, Trump comes by and reopens all the wounds, reminding us that while we might hold some conservative values, Republicans will always see us as sub-human.\n\nI do think dialog and empathy are something of a short supply in American politics today. The neoliberal policies and unfair trade pacts supported by both parties have been crushing our respective beloved hometowns. And we have a lot more in common than what these entrenched political entities say that we do. I've read \"Rivethead\" and \"Deer Hunting with Jesus\" and felt this familiarity. I will look for your book.\n\nAnd here's another one:\n\nI just wanted to write and tell you that I was fascinated by your interview with the author JD Vance, and I speak as a socialist, agnostic, gay white male who's never voted Republican in all his years! As a lifelong resident of the suburbs of Houston, Texas, it's long occurred to me how insulated I am from the struggles of poor and working-class folks today; however my family started out poor, with my parents divorcing when I was six. Luckily our mother was strong enough to help us make it out of the hole by excelling in her profession as a nurse. I remember her telling me that in the days when my sister and I were very young, for Christmas she'd spend $20 on each of us at the dollar store, and she always hoped that we enjoyed our presents. That made me love my mom so much more, and I realized how lucky we'd been to have her, given how things might have turned out. In Houston as you probably know there is a staggering number of people of every imaginable type, and my school years were spent among kids from every walk of life, of every ethnicity and persuasion you can imagine. As an outsider myself, being gay and openly agnostic in an environment where neither was considered acceptable (high school was in the late 90s), I can identify with the feeling of seeming hopelessness, isolation, and fear for the future that Mr Vance describes, though certainly on a different level and for different reasons. I also feel a greater understanding now of the appeal of Trump to certain strata within our society...along with a renewed sense of how dangerous he really is to all of us (not to mention the rest of the world)! I would like to feel as hopeful for the future as Mr Vance seems to, but I'm afraid that until November (though hopefully not after!) I'll be suffering a case of non-stop indigestion. Maybe we could all use a touch of that hillbilly idealism in our lives.\n\nAnyway, that's enough rambling out of me. Cheers for an excellent interview, and congratulations for gaining a new reader of the blue persuasion!\n\nI could go on and on. I'm getting so many e-mails like these above that I can't begin to respond to them all. I'm passing every one of them on to J.D. Vance, though. Interestingly, if I've received a single e-mail from a conservative about the interview, I can't remember it.\n\nI'm genuinely surprised and grateful for all these generous e-mails, and I'm sure J.D. is too. What I find so hopeful about it is that someone has finally found a voice with which to talk substantively about an important economic and cultural issue, but without antagonizing the other side. JDV identifies as a conservative, but his story challenges right-wing free-market pieties. And I've gotten plenty of e-mails from liberals who either come from poverty or who work with poor people for a living, who praise JDV's points about the poor needing to understand that whatever structural problems they face, they retain moral agency.\n\nWhat do you think, readers? Do you think the runaway success of Hillbilly Elegy , and the powerfully positive response from liberals to a book about class written by a conservative, bodes well for the possibility of constructive engagement around issues of class and poverty? To be sure, I've received a handful of letters from angry liberal readers who reject the idea that there's anything wrong with poor and working class white people that government action can't solve. I believe, and so does J.D., that government really does have a meaningful role to play in ameliorating the problems of the poor. But there will never be a government program capable of compensating for the loss of stable family structures, the loss of community, the loss of a sense of moral agency, and the loss of a sense of meaning in the lives of the poor. The solution, insofar as there is a \"solution,\" is not an either-or (that is, either culture or government), but a both-and. From a Washington Post review of the book :\n\nThe wounds are partly self-inflicted. The working class, he argues, has lost its sense of agency and taste for hard work. In one illuminating anecdote, he writes about his summer job at the local tile factory, lugging 60-pound pallets around. It paid $13 an hour with good benefits and opportunities for advancement. A full-time employee could earn a salary well above the poverty line.\n\nThat should have made the gig an easy sell. Yet the factory's owner had trouble filling jobs. During Vance's summer stint, three people left, including a man he calls Bob, a 19-year-old with a pregnant girlfriend. Bob was chronically late to work, when he showed up at all. He frequently took 45-minute bathroom breaks. Still, when he got fired, he raged against the managers who did it, refusing to acknowledge the impact of his own bad choices.\n\n\"He thought something had been done to him,\" Vance writes. \"There is a lack of agency here - a feeling that you have little control over your life and a willingness to blame everyone but yourself.\"\n\nPerhaps Vance's key to success is a simple one: that he just powered through his difficulties instead of giving up or blaming someone else.\n\n\"I believe we hillbillies are the toughest god--ed people on this earth,\" he concludes. \"But are we tough enough to look ourselves in the mirror and admit that our conduct harms our children? Public policy can help, but there is no government that can fix these problems for us. . . . I don't know what the answer is precisely, but I know it starts when we stop blaming Obama or Bush or faceless companies and ask ourselves what we can do to make things better.\"\n\nThe loss of industrial jobs plays a big role in the catastrophe. J.D. Vance acknowledges that plainly in his book. But it's not the whole story. Anybody who comes to Hillbilly Elegy thinking that it's going to tell a story that affirms the pre-conceived beliefs of mainstream conservatives or liberals is going to be surprised and challenged - in a good way.\n\nBy the way, the viral nature of the TAC interview with J.D. Vance has pushed Hillbilly Elegy onto the bestseller list (more details of which will be available shortly). It's No. 4 on Amazon's own list as of this morning. They can barely keep enough in stock. It really is that good, folks. All this success could not have happened to a nicer man. Credit for this spark goes to reader Surly Temple, who gave me my copy of Hillbilly Elegy.\n\nUPDATE: A reader writes to point out:\n\nThe Washington Post review you quote states, Perhaps Vance's key to success is a simple one: that he just powered through his difficulties instead of giving up or blaming someone else.\" I think that misses the point of the book. J.D. fully acknowledges the importance of his Mamaw, Marine Corps drill instructors, and wife in changing his outcomes.\n\nMy takeaway from the book is that we can help these communities and people, but not from a distance. It takes unconditional, sacrificial love.\n\nHe's right about that, and I shouldn't have posted that WaPo review without commenting. JDV openly credits his Mamaw and the Marine Corps with making him the man he is today. He does not claim he got there entirely on his own, by bootstrapping it.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "For eight years, one group's response bias has been playing havoc with poll accuracy.\n\nBy the end of July, it had become clear that Joe Biden was going to lose the 2024 presidential election in a landslide. Democratic internals were not worried about Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania but New Mexico, Virginia, and New Jersey. Yet polls remained relatively tight nationally because Biden's considerable support came from one demographic group: older white voters.\n\nQuinnipiac 's last poll before Biden dropped out had him leading Trump among senior citizens by eight points; the New York Times/ Siena and NPR/Marist polls gave Biden a four-point lead with Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation, Fox News had the 46th president tied with his predecessor. In contrast, the Washington Post /ABC poll gave Trump just a point lead among this crucial demographic.\n\nSo, did Joe Biden have a unique ability to win over these voters, perhaps because of his advanced age? No; it was that older white liberals were answering the polls at a greater frequency than the general public.\n\nIt's called polling response bias, and it's the reason that voters were shocked at Trump's 2016 victory and how close 2020 was despite Clinton and Biden's monumental leads. Older white liberals' tendency to become \" Karens ,\" telling anyone within an eyeshot their opinion, is destroying the reliability of the polling industry.\n\nAccording to Pew Research 's analysis of the last two presidential elections, Trump defeated Clinton by nine and Biden by four percent among voters over 65. Still, in the run-up to the election, pollsters predicted a blue wave led by an army of gray-haired voters.\n\nIn the last few weeks before the election, Biden was crushing Trump among seniors in most national polls: Quinnipiac said Biden would win voters 65 and up by 15 points, Emerson by 12, CNN by 11, The New York Times /Siena and Fox News by 10, NPR/Marist by nine, YouGov/Economist by four points USA Today by two, ABC/ Washington Post had him up a point.\n\nThis wasn't the first time this happened. In 2016, key swing states had Clinton outperforming Trump among senior citizens.\n\nAccording to exit polls , Trump beat Clinton by 23 points among senior citizens in North Carolina, but polls leading up to the election had his victory far narrower. Monmouth and the New York Times had his lead at 11 points, CNN had him up five, and Elon University tied them.\n\nLikewise, in Pennsylvania, Trump beat Clinton by 10 points among seniors in exit polls . Still, serious pollsters undervalued his support among this key demographic group in the last few weeks of the election. CNN had Clinton leading Trump by four, as did Monmouth .\n\nWhile pollsters have worked at updating models after the embarrassment that was 2016 and 2020, the same issue is occurring in 2024.\n\nWith less than 70 days to go, Kamala Harris's marginal lead in polls is built off the back of a group she will lose, and probably somewhere in the margin Biden and Hillary lost: four to nine points. The only national public polls with crosstabs available to have Trump in this range are Pew Research , which has the largest national sample size of 10,000 people, and the New York Times /Siena poll. Pew shows him besting the vice president by six points among voters over 65, while she leads in the national poll by a single point, while the New York Times has Trump with a single-point advantage overall while winning seniors by five.\n\nNational polls like Fairleigh Dickson University have Harris beating Trump among seniors by 16 points, NPR/Marist has the Vice President leading by 11 points among Baby Boomers and two among the Silent Generation, Marquette has her up by four, Fox News has her up by two, Emerson has them tied, ABC/ Washington Post has Trump up by just two.\n\nIn the swing states, the polls are even more lopsided regarding seniors.\n\nThe New York Times /Siena poll, considered one of the most accurate in the country, has Kamala leading or outperforming Biden's 2020 numbers among seniors in virtually every swing state. According to their polls, she leads among voters over 65 years old by 20 points in Michigan , 10 points in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin , and two points in Arizona . The pollster has Trump leading by five in Georgia and North Carolina and seven in Nevada .\n\nIn 2020, Trump performed significantly better against Biden among seniors in most of those states. According to the exit polls, he won voters 65 years and older by 19 points in North Carolina, 12 points in Georgia, seven in Nevada and Pennsylvania, six in Wisconsin, and a point in Arizona. Biden won seniors in Michigan by two points.\n\nAnd the New York Times /Siena poll remains one of the more accurate among this crucial demographic. Quinnipiac has Kamala winning the gray vote by three in Pennsylvania, Marquette has her leading by five in Wisconsin, SurveyUSA has Kamala up 10 in North Carolina, and Landmark Communications has Trump up by just two in Georgia.\n\nOlder white liberals' response bias created the illusion that there was a silent Trump voter in the last two presidential elections, and they're doing it again.\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "A characteristically interesting and provocative comment from Matt in VA, left on the West, Still Declining comments thread:\n\nOne of the mistakes that American conservatives make most often and most consistently is confusing liberalism and leftism with weakness. That conservatives continue to make this mistake over and over again even when liberals are grinding them into the dust and tossing them in the ashcan of history just shows how important it is to conservatives, how it undergirds their entire worldview, to believe this, I would say, very un-Christian idea that right makes might.\n\nEven today in the year of our Lord 2022, when small minorities like gays have stomped sexually traditional American Christians in to the ground politically, we get these assertions that a nonbinary and trans army is a weak and feeble army, that pajama boy leftists are pushovers, etc. We also see claims that \"traditional\" rural and exurban communities are safe and Orderly, while liberal/Democratic areas are unsafe, with the implication being that the people of those areas are too weak or compromised to create conditions of order.\n\nBut something that I have seen borne out for my whole life is that liberalism and leftism are stronger than conservatism and traditionalism, and generally win any contest, at least sooner or later. One *must* abandon this idea that the correct or the truer Way is the stronger way, at least in this life. The conservative or traditional position on the purpose of marriage may be the best one, the most honest, the most tested, the most rational and the most beautiful, but like many beautiful things, it is quite delicate in itself as a *force* in our world. The degree to which it must be shored up, promoted, protected, ingrained in children nearly from birth, normalized, etc is quite astonishing. Yet conservatives seem to have this impression that such ideas or values can \"win in the marketplace of ideas\" simply by being baldly stated over and over, without any sort of real power or force being brought to bear, when all of the venal worldly benefits and sticks and carrots are on the other side.\n\nThe US military could devote fully 40% of its training to inculcating the deconstruction of the gender binary and the promotion of Kendian anti-racism, and it would not necessarily make the military \"weak,\" not so long as America continued to have the incredible amounts of $$$ it has. Now, I know, movement conservatives will reply that we have all this money because we have the best values (free enterprise, free trade, freedom to do business), and so our hugely dominant financial position demonstrates our moral superiority. This really is how movement conservatives think! The line in the Bible about camels passing through needles' eyes is one that American conservative Christians just absolutely have no interest in whatsoever even as they accuse liberal Christians of being selective in their readings of the Gospels. But the reality is that atomizing, commodifying, annihilating consumer capitalism, or whatever you want to call it, leads to worldly power that few can resist, and that power is *real*, and it is certainly not Christian, nor is it \"rational\" in a secular sense, to continue to insist on this idea that that sort of worldly power is really \"weakness.\"\n\nConservatives are very attached, emotionally attached, to the idea that their values are the values of strength, manliness, forthrightness, the John Wayne values. They are attached to the values of the frontier, the sphere in which every man may need to be the law unto themselves; they are attached to the values of a space in which women are not a serious or viable force. Thus we see the *incredible* weakness of conservatives: they have NO skills or abilities to resist forms of power or aggression or coercion that, absent from frontier conditions, are nevertheless very present in the city/in civilization. What might work in frontier conditions will not work in conditions of domestication or in conditions where the space in which one moves is *owned.*\n\nThe world in which one operates, if one is a wolf, is very different from the world in which one operates, if one is a domesticated dog. The wolf's life may be nasty, brutish, and short, and the domesticated dog's life may be significantly longer and significantly easier, but there is an entire transmutation and reversal of all values (so to speak) here - is what the domesticated dog has obtained worth what has been lost? The conservative looks at the wolf, and compares it to the French bulldog, and says, here is no contest at all. But if enough French bulldogs are harmed, and their owners pass a law legalizing the shooting of wolves from aircraft, traps, homing devices so that the wolf dens can be found and the wolf pups massacred, etc., perhaps in fact it is no contest at all, in the other direction. Perhaps another way of putting this is that the conservative still believes in the \"silent majority\" and thinks he has the masses on his side. There so often seems to be little or no understanding of what it means when you cannot count on that or assume that, when you have to operate in a hostile information environment or under a *regime* that is hostile. Again, this fantasy that the values and tactics of the frontier are the only applicable or important ones; but this just does not pertain most of the time for most people.\n\nI am very convinced by arguments that the West is in moral and - especially - aesthetic decline, but over and over again I see conservatives taking this intellectual shortcut or falling into this intellectual trap and asserting that that means the West is *weak* or about to collapse or at least to falter, and I do not see that at all. Moral and aesthetic decline, increasing dishonesty and vapidity, etc., do not mean worldly power is about to drop or disappear. Where on earth is it promised that right will make might? Don't people understand the self-flattery and indulgent thinking that is amply demonstrated by the idea that the United States is rich and powerful due to having the right beliefs and values and ideals? Perhaps our dominant position in the world is in fact evidence that the opposite might be true? OK -one hears it - this sounds like Leftism, and conservatives and the Right wing are by definition not Leftists, so of course they don't see things this way. It is Leftists who say the USA is powerful and therefore bad - exploitative, unjust, greedy, etc. To which I would say, it is just as great an error to automatically ascribe power to desert, as it is to ascribe power to greed or megalomaniacal dominance. To be sure, there is something annoyingly ungrateful about the leftist who sneers at his own homeland and preens over his attachment to the alien and distant; but there is something off putting about the smug bourgeois too. The fact that it's gross to see the leftist indulge in conspicuous telescopic philanthropy does not mean that it's not also gross to have to listen to the self-congratulation of the soft-handed middle class - épater les bourgeoises may be tiresome but there's a reason it's also effective.\n\nThe truth of the world, I think, is that there are always dangers on both sides; there is always a Scylla AND a Charybdis. There is the danger of Communism on one side, but there are the dangers of out-of-control financialization and commodification as well. There is the danger of narrow and bigoted provincialism, and the danger of cosmopolitan atomization and disintegration. The danger of rigidity so inflexible the whole system breaks, and the danger of flexibility that preserves and sustains nothing at all.\n\nAgain, it is possible to imagine a US military that gives over ten or twenty times the amount of time and resources to promoting the Democratic Party platform to its members, without it necessarily being the case that this \"weakens\" the military or the standing of the US in the world. The question is whether the $$$$ is there or not, and how others stand or compare in regards to that money. Evolution and survival of the fittest are *amoral.* That which is good and noble and beautiful may go extinct, while that which is horrible may survive or even thrive. Beautiful, noble, exotic species of birds and beasts may disappear in huge numbers, yet the virus persists. The horrible, poisonous \"marketplace of ideas\" god that American conservatives worship (or, at least, assume) is a false god-the \"best idea\" does not necessarily win, the most cursory look at the history of the world tells us that. \"All that is required for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\" The nearly total capture of all American institutions by the progressive worldview and mindset does not automatically or necessarily mean that these institutions will weaken, only that they will transform. This transformation can indeed come with even greater strength, as the progressive worldview is optimized for making money and is indeed fanatically devoted to the worldly and venal values of money and vulgar status. It would be strange indeed for an ideology that is structured around promoting the interests of multinational corporations and international capital over all else (including real differences of religion, tradition, sex, etc.) to lead directly to *weakness* - one might expect the internal contradictions of such an ideology or its disintegrating and atomizing qualities might eventually lead to problems, but not that it would immediately bring about weakness!\n\nThoughts? As ever, remember that my citing someone's comments does not mean I agree with them all, only that I find them interesting and worth considering.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "My friend Vincent Philip Muñoz, who teaches politics at Notre Dame, has a good National Review essay out critiquing Patrick Deneen, Adrian Vermeule, and, tangentially, Your Working Boy. Muñoz - a Catholic and a conservative - broadly agrees with Deneen et al. that we in the liberal democracies are in a serious and complex crisis, but he disagrees that this is the result of liberalism. (N.B., he means classical liberalism, not merely the philosophy of the Democratic Party).\n\nMuñoz does a very good job summarizing fairly the core of the Deneenist critique - one he attributes to \"radical Catholics.\" He concludes:\n\nThe critics conclude that our current situation reigns because of our liberal founding principles, not despite them. If you want to understand the true character of America, the \"radical\" Catholics contend, just look to the Supreme Court's plurality opinion in the abortion-rights case Planned Parenthood vs. Casey (1992): \"At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\"\n\nContra Deneen, Muñoz says the Casey \"abomination\" is not the logical result of the principles of the American Founding, but an aberration. Likewise, the moral crises we're suffering from are not the fault of classical liberalism itself, but because of something extraneous to it. Muñoz concedes that the strongest claim the Deneenists make is\n\nthat American liberalism, whatever its original character, has produced a decadent and deplorable legal and moral culture. One might contend that even if the Founders accepted natural law, moral duties, and limits on rights, their account of freedom has proved to be too thin. It provides too much freedom for bourgeois, comfortable self-preservation, what moral theologian Servais Pinckaers calls \"freedom for indifference,\" and insufficient cultivation of \"freedom for excellence.\"\n\nMore:\n\nAmerica is better characterized as an \"experiment.\" The Founders well understood that every generation would need to be taught to use its freedom well, which is why they sought to cultivate virtue through education and religion. (Thomas G. West in his excellent new book, The Political Theory of the American Founding , skillfully documents the Founders' efforts.) They did not embrace Aristotle's teachings that the purpose of politics is to make men virtuous and that law should be used to coercively habituate moral virtue, but they did understand that their constitutional republic would depend on virtue for its success. \"Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious People,\" John Adams stated. \"It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\" This is why America is an experiment: Can a free people remain sufficiently virtuous to maintain, and deserve to maintain, their freedom?\n\nIf we Americans are no longer sufficiently virtuous, the fault lies primarily with us, not our founding principles. Our political and economic institutions have never been perfect, but (aside from slavery and its legacies, perhaps) they have never been so corrupt that they have made virtuous living impossible. Original sin may make corruption probable, and political liberty may make it possible; but the causes of America's problems lie primarily in the poor choices we have made.\n\nThat means the solution to our problem lies, to a large extent, in our choices. To choose well, we must regain both political wisdom and the character that befits a constitutional people. Reacquaintance with our actual liberal principles and a return to belief in the existence of an obligatory moral law are essential.\n\nThe latter may require a reemergence of religious belief, especially among the cultural elite where it has precipitously declined. The necessity of morality for liberal democracy, and of religion for morality, cannot be understated. As Tocqueville recognized, religion is the first of America's political institutions. It teaches us to respect the equality of all individuals and provides the grounds for moderation and self-restraint, both individually and communally.\n\nIf I'm reading Muñoz correctly, then he's saying simply that the moral soundness of liberalism depends on the moral and religious soundness of the people who live under it, well, this is not terribly controversial. John Adams said as much. Deneen's claim is that liberalism was bound to get us to the Kennedy Moment (\"At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life\"). I don't see that Muñoz has refuted that in this essay. Deneen wouldn't deny that the Founders were religious men, of a sort, and that liberalism can be compatible with a moral, religious, cohesive polity. His argument is that at its core. liberalism, over time, cannot help but atomize the polity, because it is in its nature to do so.\n\nIn other words, Muñoz seems to be saying: It didn't have to turn out this way. To which Deneen replies: Yes, it did.\n\nIt's easier to see Deneen's point when you realize that liberalism is not merely a political arrangement, but a more comprehensive way of looking at and living in the world. In this excerpt from an interview with The Nation , Deneen talks about liberalism in economics:\n\nJH: Here's a good line: \"The economic system that simultaneously is both liberalism's handmaiden and also its engine, like a Frankenstein monster, takes on a life of its own, and its processes and logic can no longer be controlled by people purportedly enjoying the greatest freedom in history.\" How much does global capitalism factor into your critique of liberalism?\n\nPD: I see it very much as the right hand of the liberal political project. I see these two systems as having grown up together. Every political worldview has an accompanying economic worldview.\n\nNow, people debate whether we have capitalism or crony capitalism or statist capitalism. But essentially we have what, I think, is market ideology-the ideology that locates in the economic sphere a realm driven by private decision making-and this is the economic counterpart of the self-making self of the liberal political sphere.\n\nI think we tend to have this narrative that capitalism is the opposite of statism. But you see that, so often in American history and in recent years, the growth of a global market has been driven by political processes. Our political order creates our market order.\n\nLiberalism trains us to think of everything as a market. This has broad effects:\n\nJH: So maybe it's good that liberalism has helped people break traditional bonds, but perhaps only because those bonds are themselves weak or, otherwise, too restricting and oppressive-not bonds but shackles.\n\nPD: I think you've stated a core understanding and ambition of the liberal order: of turning religious identity or family identity or one's geographic identity into one option among many. I would go one step further, and here's where I think you see the excess of liberalism. We begin to see the actual diminution of any of these particular forms of cultural identity. I think that one hallmark is this: As you move through recent generations, you find that the younger you are, the more likely you have no identifying markers. Now 50 percent of millennials identify with no religious tradition, are unlikely to marry, unlikely to have children, and show the lowest measurements of patriotism ever in American history. Say what you will: This might be a good thing. But I would say it's potentially a bad thing to have a society of disaggregated, atomized individuals who, I'd argue, are not socialized to be sociable.\n\nMy fear is that, if things continue as they're going, a highly atomized society is one that is very susceptible to the attractions of a despot. Someone who can offer a political identity that would prove attractive as the kind of flattening of our political, economic, and cultural life continues.\n\nLet's say, for the sake of argument, that most Americans today were religiously engaged. Would that have stopped the kind of liberal economics that have eviscerated communities? Or the other cultural developments that have deracinated modern people? I don't see how. Whether the Founders realized what liberalism was capable of or not, the fact is that the deepest principles of liberalism are antithetical to the kind of virtues necessary to sustain liberalism. It's a paradox.\n\nAnd it's a paradox that none of us can escape. I can't speak for the others in Muñoz's list, but I would be hard pressed to come up with a system I would rather live under than liberalism. Vermeule is a Catholic integralist, a system that is intellectually coherent, but that is totally unfeasible here, and unacceptable to non-Catholics (as well as many modern Catholics). Deneen, of course, doesn't propose a post-liberal program, and acknowledges in his book that it is impossible to think past liberalism at the moment. The best we can do is work to shore up local connections and to ground ourselves. That's my view as well.\n\nAnd, I have to concede that liberalism, broadly understood, is what makes it possible for my family to educate our children in a countercultural way. People like me can lament the loss of social solidarity, but in the end, do we put our children in the same school as most of our neighbors? No, because we have a very different understanding of what education is and should be, as well as a meaningfully different understanding of moral order. I'm grateful for the liberties that give us the freedom to dissent, and I will fight for them.\n\nI have to admit, though, that liberalism, as it is now practiced in America, gives me the right to be illiberal, and to live illiberally. At least for now. Recognizing that we are living under a paradox does not make one a hypocrite.\n\nMuñoz concludes:\n\nThe \"radical\" Catholics' misinterpretation of America is thus no mere academic matter. Their mistakes blind us to how our liberal principles offer a moral framework by which to support life. They are unable to appreciate the greatness of Lincoln or appropriate his moral wisdom and constitutional statesmanship. They preach local community and relationship to the past, but fail to understand their own community and eschew America's own traditions and what is most noble about them.\n\nIn doing so, \"radical\" Catholicism alienates from the American experiment those who should be America's most faithful friends, dispiriting young conservatives in particular. If liberalism was never attractive to begin with - if Casey is consistent with the Constitution - why fight for America? Why run for office or give one's time or treasure to those who do? Why even vote and implicate oneself in an inevitably failing and corrupt political regime? The political alienation the \"radical\" Catholics foster cannot help but engender disdain for engaged citizenship and responsible patriotism among the young, religiously orthodox citizens that America most needs right now.\n\nI see what he's getting at, but I think this relies too much on abstraction. It's not hard to see why liberalism was once attractive, and why it remains attractive in theory. In practice, though, the Casey decision is consistent with the Constitution, because the Supreme Court, the authoritative interpreters of the Constitution, have declared it so. Liberalism - politically, economically, and culturally - have produced a people that by all appearances believe that Justice Kennedy's statement is true. I would love to see Pew poll Americans on their opinion about the Kennedy statement:\n\n\"At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\"\n\nThe liberals who founded America in the 18th century would not have agreed with that. But can anybody seriously claim that Justice Kennedy's view is not consonant with what most Americans today believe? If defending classical liberalism from the liberals (in the left-wing sense of the term) means convincing the American people that Kennedy's statement is not essentially true, then the battle for liberalism is lost. As Deneen points out in his Nation interview, liberalism has turned us all into \"self-making selves.\" The problem is, human beings can't sustain a way of life as a herd of self-making selves. Even Christianity itself has become Self-Making Selves At Prayer (this is what Moralistic Therapeutic Deism is). If the ordinary source of transcendence has become so thoroughly immanent for most of those who look to it, what hope is there for our politics?\n\nThink about it: Liberalism's latest battle is to insist that we can make our own sex, male or female or somewhere in between. Before long the Court will be asked to decide if this is true, constitutionally. Whatever the Court decides will be the law of the land. Why, exactly, should young conservatives give themselves over to defending a system that by its very nature undermines (actively and passively) and even denies things they believe to be fundamental truths?\n\nOne conservative answer might be: because we have to do the best we can in the world as it is. You don't have to affirm liberalism to serve on your town council, and to do your best to improve the world for your neighbors, using the liberties you have. Even after the Roman Empire fell in the West, people still showed up for work. I expect conservatives will keep doing the same thing here. This is why in The Benedict Option , I explicitly say that religious conservatives should stay involved in politics, to work for the common good and especially to protect religious liberty.\n\nBut we have to do this with clear eyes. I don't see sufficient evidence to convince me that liberalism can be rescued from its unwinding. Conservatives, especially religious conservatives, have to face this difficult truth, and prepare themselves and their families for it. Liberal civilization has done the thing that the conservative thinker Eric Voegelin warned us not to do: immanentized the eschaton . That is, we have assumed all transcendence into ourselves. The Founders did not believe that, but the logical outworking of their principles had this effect. And here we are.\n\nAnyway, read the whole thing. It's well worth considering. For you conservative readers who believe that classical liberalism can be saved, I'm eager to know how you think that might be done, given the cultural realities of our post-Christian age.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "The Limits of Liberalism: Tradition, Individualism, and the Crisis of Freedom, Mark T. Mitchell, University of Notre Dame Press, 340 pages\n\nWriting in 1955, Russell Kirk cited the German thinker Carl J. Friedrich to the effect that \"[T]o all intents and purposes, the United States is today a highly traditional society, in the sense that arguments from tradition carry a great deal of conviction.\" Few would agree now, or at least not in the way Kirk intended. What defines much of American popular discourse today, among elites especially, is a conviction that appeals from authority not only have little resonance but also that tradition itself is suspect. Or to be more specific, reliance on tradition for any authoritative position that would restrict or limit individual freedom is almost completely out of bounds. In other words, tradition can be discussed only where it has no authority. Thus, we see attacks on institutions and practices-the Boy Scouts, Catholic schools, gender-specific sports-that are seen to embody \"traditions\" that are not inclusive.\n\nTradition is one way, we are told, that conservatives differ from liberals. Conservatives wish to conserve something; liberals, supposedly, do not. Indeed, liberalism is the great anti-tradition. But too often conservatives are left to mount only an attenuated defense of tradition; they seek to show liberals that some practice or tradition is in accord with \"reason\" and therefore sensible to retain, or that submitting to a tradition is more useful or advantageous than not. But this ultimately is no defense of tradition at all. It values tradition only insofar as it meets the standard of some other metric, such as utility, or it assumes the liberal separation of tradition from \"reason\" as valid, when it is not.\n\nIn that same essay, Kirk distinguished between tradition and ideology. \"Individualism\" or \"democracy\" in the abstract, he thought, could not form a tradition. Although Kirk's rejection of ideology is controversial in some conservative circles, in general he meant an overarching system that purported to give answers to all earthly problems, typically imposed by a self-selected political elite. Traditions, in contrast, \"are not abstractions; they are particular beliefs and customs closely related to private life and faith. The American Republic has its traditions, and so has the Cambodian Kingdom; but traditions are not created by political authority, and ought not to be debased into party slogans.\"\n\nBecause traditions are not ideological, there could be several kinds within a political community. In America, the bulk of traditions come from the Christian religion and our British heritage, though there are pockets of French and Spanish traditions as well. \"These traditions are very numerous, and some are in conflict with others,\" Kirk said, \"yet, provisionally, we may take for examples of American traditions such received opinions as the following: belief in a spiritual order which in some fashion governs our mundane order; belief in political self government; belief in the importance to human persons of certain natural private rights; belief in the value of marriage and the family.\"\n\nNow that may all be well and good, but how do we know when a tradition should change, and how do we determine how people should think about and defend traditions? The recent debate over Confederate statues and monuments is one example. Some conservatives argued for them to be kept as a recognition of history, but others argued they did not represent the best of our traditions-better to have monuments to the Underground Railroad and its heroes, for example. This major study from Mark T. Mitchell is titled The Limits of Liberalism , but one of its main themes is how we can think about tradition, because one of the things that has become clear from the body of conservative thought is that we are tradition-making animals.\n\n♦♦♦\n\nWe are, in George Scialabba's words, \"situated beings\" living in a particular place and time with family and economic circumstances that shape us. Even when we are thrust into an unfamiliar situation, we take our traditions with us and seek to recover them, or to adapt them, in order that we may retain them. An example based on historical precedent is the TV series Deadwood . Deadwood was an actual town in South Dakota which for a brief period was \"without law,\" since the law of no state nor of the U.S. Constitution applied to it. Yet it mimicked-at some points less well than others-the traditions its inhabitants brought from elsewhere.\n\nMitchell recognizes that \"an errant account of tradition may entail an errant account of knowing, which in turn may give birth to social and political maladies.\" One kind of errant account of tradition is evident in liberalism. The liberal person is an autonomous self whose ultimate goal is liberation from every idea and restraint except for the idea that restraint is unacceptable. Mitchell writes that the first stage of liberalism still relied on the Christian, traditional society in which it lived. But the second stage of liberalism, which he defines as beginning in the late 18th century, threw off even these restraints:\n\nFirst wave liberalism, because it relied (despite its explicit claims) on resources rooted in tradition, entailed a general agreement about substantive goods, including some notion of the good life, both individually and corporately. Second wave liberalism is characterized by an increasingly explicit and energetic reaction of any claim to a universal, substantive good. What matters in second wave liberalism is merely a procedural framework that creates the maximal space for individuals to determine their own good.\n\nAnd because there are no just limits to liberal autonomy, second-wave liberalism furthers what Mitchell calls cosmopolitanism, \"the ideal of the autonomous chooser combined with a cosmopolitan impulse that seeks to eradicate differences, even as it celebrates the unconstrained choices of individuals.\" Note that this description encompasses certain forms of free-market absolutism as well as liberalism. In their underlying assumptions about tradition, the Democratic Socialists of America and Silicon Valley global capitalists are not so different. Liberalism in this second stage, though theoretically cohesive, is as a practical matter unstable. Because it disregards the validity of common traditions that should shape our conduct, it has no limiting principle.\n\nThe bulk of the book examines three of the most astute interpreters of tradition: Michael Oakeshott, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Michael Polanyi. Oakeshott developed a sophisticated defense of tradition, one made notable because it dispensed with any appeal to religious faith or natural law as a grounding of any particular tradition-or as Oakeshott later called it, \"practice.\" The lack of any sure baseline for when we can distinguish a good tradition from a bad one therefore opens Oakeshott up to criticism that he is simply a partisan of the status quo. But this would be unfair. According to Mitchell, Oakeshott was attempting to explain the conditions of how we think. Liberal critics think of the mind as a neutral instrument that is applied to a problem; for Oakeshott, \"when an innovation is needed one simply cannot find a solution outside of what is available. And what is available constitutes one's tradition.\"\n\nBut at its best, tradition reflects not just epistemology but anthropology. Customary social practices reflect what we think a human being is , and whether there are practices that hinder or further personal flourishing (within, in some contexts, a common good). For this, Mitchell turns to MacIntyre. In his writings, MacIntyre considers how we can judge among traditions-something that was not explicitly part of Oakeshott's account. MacIntyre thinks that, although we are all bound by our specific traditions, those traditions may nevertheless partially reflect and give access to truths beyond any one tradition. It is that commonality in objective truth that makes development within, and communication between, cultures possible. MacIntyre thus tries to answer the main challenges to his account of tradition: from the Enlightenment partisans who believe there is some universally applicable truth that can crush all customs and traditions to the postmoderns who deride MacIntyre's search for any universal reality. But the MacIntyrean process of judgment is not easy, because it involves having to learn another tradition from the ground up.\n\nPolanyi contributes for Mitchell a theory of knowing, or \"tacit knowledge,\" since not all valuable knowledge is articulable in logical precepts. Like MacIntyre and Oakeshott, Polanyi does not really think a \"tradition-less\" position is possible, but what is possible is knowledge of an objective reality. He develops a theory of knowing that relies on what Mitchell calls a fiduciary relationship: to know something, we must submit to the authority of someone who already knows that thing. In other words, there is an element of conscious participation in the knowledge we are obtaining because otherwise-if the truth were just presented to us without our assent to understanding-we would not be able to understand it, a process Polanyi describes as objectivism leading to nihilism.\n\n♦♦♦\n\nSo far, so good. Mitchell has written a deep and compelling account of the school of thought that defends tradition. It will long be a resource for conservatives and others who want to understand how tradition can represent an alternative to modern rationality that both recognizes objective truth and our personal rootedness, which paradoxically is what gives us the means to understand that truth. It furthers the project that Kirk and others initiated. We are tradition-minded beings, despite the Enlightenment delusion, and our rationality is tied up with our historical and cultural situations.\n\nIf that was where Mitchell ended, the book would be useful but little more. What makes it of real value is that Mitchell knows this analysis is not enough, for conservatives have heard this all before. The question is not how we can explain tradition in a world without tradition. As Mitchell explains, there was always within liberalism-in its first or second phases-an illiberalism, which is itself a tradition. This illiberal liberalism has developed even as it was throwing off older traditions in the name of liberation. The question is what to do with the liberal tradition that has already developed. This is made more complicated by the very fact that we are swimming in that liberal tradition-that is what we know, in an Oakeshottian sense. As Mitchell acknowledges, the theme of liberation-from the Puritans to the abolitionists-is deeply woven into the American character.\n\nMitchell discusses this in his chapter entitled \"The Incoherence of Liberalism and the Response of Tradition.\" Liberalism, in Rousseau's phrase, will force us to be free. We can choose whatever we want except that which questions liberalism. And that means, as we have seen, that contemporary liberalism is very comfortable with punitive measures against those actors (Christian bakers, for example) who choose goods contrary to it. Liberalism has its liturgical calendar and its eschatology, its saints and demons, and it has developed customs and traditions from this that are recognizable lineaments of a kind of tradition. Liberalism may have rejected traditional authorities of church and state, but it has put other authorities in their place. The conservative lament that liberalism is only \"procedural\" in its rejection of tradition is incorrect, largely for the reasons Mitchell adumbrates.\n\nSeveral strategies therefore present themselves. One is MacIntyrean. Conservatives must learn the liberal tradition as it exists now, not simply as many think of it-as a poor offshoot of Western Christendom. Those seeking to defend tradition must then infiltrate its institutions and shift them in a non-liberal direction when warranted and able. Law professor Adrian Vermeule has proposed something similar in light of liberalism's dominance. With Polanyi, we must also participate in our traditions and seek ways to express the universals in ways that both liberalism and tradition can understand. Only then can we start to recover a way back to tradition.\n\nAnd that brings us back to Kirk. The frustrating thing about most conservative discussions of tradition is that for a topic that is so place- and context-specific, there are too few analytical discussions of what those traditions might be. Simply to tell liberals that their cosmopolitanism does not take into account the irreducibly local and personal nature of human relationships, or that one should submit to those knowing more about a practice than you, will persuade few people. In part, this is because Mitchell is right: liberals have their own traditions, so this line of critique is not that effective. Similarly, there is surely a hierarchy of traditions that deserve more conservative reflection on their interrelationship and reliance on one another. Our tradition of public recognition of the divine, for example, is more important than my grandmother's tradition of cooking fish on Christmas Eve. The World Series is an important cultural moment in our national tradition, but not more important than, say, our tradition of an impartial jury of one's peers, and so on.\n\nFor Kirk, as the quote above demonstrates, traditions in the private sphere were just as important if not more so than political ones. He saw an organic and real connection between tending your own garden and the development of virtue, between public holidays and self-government. How we spend our time locally dictates what we care about nationally. More important, his own life was a paean to rootedness, which makes his work all the more attractive. Mitchell recognizes this need too and develops somewhat in this direction, but this is not such an instruction manual. Therefore, this book needs to be read alongside the work he and others have done with the website Front Porch Republic, where more concrete examples of lived tradition are discussed.\n\nPerhaps what is needed instead is a reverse MacIntyrean strategy. Conservatives need to \"translate\" liberalism so that they can better explain its failings-something Mitchell does well. But conservatives also need to persuade liberals to translate conservatism. To do that, conservatives need to find potentially sympathetic interlocutors (such as Scialabba) and live lives that spark interest from those inclined to disdain tradition.\n\nGerald J.

      "text": "Everybody, sorry I've been out of touch all day. I had to go out of town unexpectedly today, and have been away from the keys. One of the nice things about this blog is when I don't post when people think I should, folks start writing to ask if I'm okay. Some good news: in February, this here blog received over one million unique visitors - the twelfth month in a row we've done this. Overall, TAC had another great month as well. Thank you!\n\nHere's a fascinating story from The Atlantic: a map of American political prejudice. Guess where researchers found that the most politically prejudiced people live, and who they are? Read on:\n\nIn general, the most politically intolerant Americans, according to the analysis, tend to be whiter, more highly educated, older, more urban, and more partisan themselves. This finding aligns in some ways with previous research by the University of Pennsylvania professor Diana Mutz, who has found that white, highly educated people are relatively isolated from political diversity. They don't routinely talk with people who disagree with them; this isolation makes it easier for them to caricature their ideological opponents. (In fact, people who went to graduate school have the least amount of political disagreement in their lives, as Mutz describes in her book Hearing the Other Side .) By contrast, many nonwhite Americans routinely encounter political disagreement. They have more diverse social networks, politically speaking, and therefore tend to have more complicated views of the other side, whatever side that may be.\n\nWe see this dynamic in the heat map. In some parts of the country, including swaths of North Carolina and upstate New York, people still seem to give their fellow Americans the benefit of the doubt, even when they disagree. In other places, including much of Massachusetts and Florida, people appear to have far less tolerance for political difference. They may be quicker to assume the worst about their political counterparts, on average.\n\nWhite, highly educated people are the most politically intolerant in the entire country. These are the people who congregate in Boston, New York, and Washington. I would love to see the demographic breakdown of who the decision-makers in major-media newsrooms are, as well as in other US institutions. We know from other demographic data that the more educated you are, the more likely you are to be liberal.\n\nLook at this finding: \"the most politically intolerant county in America appears to be Suffolk County, Massachusetts, which includes the city of Boston.\" Here's a map of Suffolk County:\n\nCambridge, home of Harvard University, is in neighboring Middlesex County. According to the researchers, it is equally as prejudiced as Suffolk County. So the most elite university in America is also located in the county that is most prejudiced - in this case, against Republicans.\n\nHow about that? Mercer County, NJ (home of Princeton) and New Haven County, CT (home of Yale), are also \"considerably more prejudiced\" against Republicans than most other counties in the US.\n\nNote well: it is also the case that Republicans who live in these same counties are highly prejudiced against Democrats. But they are small minorities in those places.\n\nIf you are an educated liberal in a major US city like Boston, New York, Washington, and Philadelphia, you are unlikely to know and deal with Republicans. The cultural and political establishments in those cities are quite liberal. Interestingly, the partisan polarization in other cities is equally strong. In Dallas, Houston, and Austin, both sides are strongly prejudiced against the other; the establishments in all three cities, though, are Democratic. Most people outside Texas don't realize that. Note too that the entire state of Florida scores strongly on the polarization scale. I found it fascinating that except for the heavily populated counties around NYC, the State of New York is pretty much the least politically polarized state in the US.\n\nMore from the article:\n\nAs politics have become more about identity than policy, partisan leanings have become more about how we grew up and where we feel like we belong. Politics are acting more like religion, in other words.\n\nThis is partly because partisan identities have begun to line up with other identities, as Lilliana Mason describes in her book, Uncivil Agreement. Making assumptions about people's politics based on their race or religiosity is easier than it was in the past. Black people get typed as Democrats; people who go to church on Sunday are assumed to be Republicans. (But as always, stereotypes still mask complexity: about half of black Americans go to church at least once a week, for example, a far higher rate than that of white Americans.)\n\nIn other words, partisan prejudice now includes a bunch of other prejudices, all wrapped up into one tangled mess. \"Americans are really divided, but not in terms of policy; they're divided in terms of identity,\" Mason says. \"And the more identities come into play, the more salient they are, the harder it will be to agree, even if policy positions shift.\" Politics are becoming a proxy battle for other deep divisions that have almost nothing to do with environmental regulation or tax policies. [Emphasis mine - RD]\n\nRead the whole thing. It's worthwhile, though nothing about it is encouraging.  What stood out the most to me, though, is that the people who are in charge of the media, and our cultural institutions, and the ones who bang on the most about \"diversity,\" are pretty much extremely intolerant, monocultural white liberals. Whatever else you might say about him, Trump has these people figured out.\n\nUPDATE: Wow, wow, wow. You've got to read the companion piece about Watertown, NY , judged by the Atlantic's researchers as the most politically tolerant county in America. Trump won it by 20 percent, but that's not why it's the most tolerant. Excerpt:\n\nAs is the case anywhere else in the world, demonization eventually bends toward violence. Already, nearly 20 percent of Democrats and Republicans say that many members of the other side \"lack the traits to be considered fully human,\" according to a 2017 survey by the political scientists Nathan Kalmoe and Lilliana Mason. Even more chilling: About 15 percent of Republicans and 20 percent of Democrats agree that the country would be \"better off if large numbers of opposing partisans in the public today 'just died.'\"\n\nI cannot imagine thinking this! But a lot of people do. More:\n\nThe most politically prejudiced people in America right now don't seem to be the most vulnerable ones. The PredictWise analysis showed that the most judgmental partisans tend to be white, urban, older, highly educated, politically engaged, and politically segregated. And the inverse is also true, which explains why the Watertown area stands out. It's a very white place, but it's also fairly young, largely suburban and rural, and not particularly highly educated.\n\nThe story about Watertown is really interesting, especially for the light it sheds on how social media ramps up division. Watertown is not perfect, though. I laughed out loud at this quote from an angry conservative woman who laid into her liberal pastor.\n\nWhen I spoke with Walker, now 91, she remembered the incident well. \"I said to him, 'I am not going to church and having you preach to me what's right and wrong,'\" she told me.\n\nUm, Mrs. Walker, you're missing the point of church. Anyway, please read the whole story , especially to the end. It involves Mrs. Walker, and it's a punch in the gut.\n\nUPDATE.2: Reader Mr. \"Hate Crime\" comments:\n\nWhen I first saw this post here, I waited to comment because I wanted to make a thoughtful response. If only some of the others here would have done the same thing...\n\nAll that being said, I like to think that I have an unusual perspective: I grew up poor in West Texas and I live in a (used to be, now not as much) very red Houston suburb now and work in the energy industry, but I also have an undergraduate degree from Harvard and a graduate degree from another Boston institution, and I've spent a significant portion of my adult life living in Boston and New York. And I'm no longer poor, either.\n\nI've seen both sides of this debate and I count as friends and family people who are both red and blue in their politics. This is what I observe:\n\n1) First and foremost, it's mostly a class thing and it more or less goes back to the Civil War. The liberals (urbans) think they are entitled to make judgments, the conservatives (rurals) resent being judged. And there is a sliver of truth to both sides' positions.\n\n2) There is animosity and polarization on both sides, but my personal experience says that most of the organic disdain comes from educated liberals, as noted in the article. Motives are impugned constantly . These people just know they have the magic answers for society and the only reason anyone would disagree with them is because they are stupid bigots. And the liberal disdain is even more severe in liberal enclaves like Harris County and Travis County for the obvious reason that those liberals interact with \"rednecks\" every day and are confronted with their own obvious superiority over their neighbors. A great example of this disdain is the premise of \"What's the Matter With Kansas?\" The liberals want to evangelize and the conservatives don't want to be converted and the liberals get offended in response.\n\n3a) Much of the animosity that comes from the conservatives is reactionary. They just want to be left alone. This is where I find common cause with them and is why I have always personally identified as a libertarian (I voted for Gary Johnson in 2016), or even drifting toward what is now being referred to as \"alt-right\" as a response to the aggressiveness of the liberal agenda. Leaving aside sexual matters (including abortion), which I'll touch on next, on practically any other political issue: regulations, taxes, welfare, voting laws, Second Amendment, speed limits, urban sprawl - rural conservatives don't care how things are done in Massachusetts or Chicago, they just don't want to be told how they have to do things in their own backyard.\n\n3b) On sexual matters, I understand the complaint that \"Mike Pence hates gay people and wants to control women's bodies\" but that is something of a strawman in the sense that many conservatives see those two issues as special cases of morality or religion rather than pure politics or \"human rights\" as liberals tend to do. Conservatives see those two issues as being intrinsically corrosive to society - more than \"just politics\", hence their desire to want to regulate those issues more than others. Many liberals in turn take the special case of the sexual matters and use that as an excuse to dismiss all other political differences as bigotry or ignorance and then we're back at point (1) about the evangelizing.\n\n4) My personal opinion is that a lot of the polarization is caused by the liberals due to the very nature of their mission: to effect change and seek what they see as improvements in society. As I said, the conservatives are more reactionary and don't want the changes that are often pushed on them. With experience in both camps, I can see both sides: sometimes changes are necessary but sometimes they are just provocations, too.\n\n5) Finally, I do not deny that there is a significant element of racism and bigotry in conservative areas, but there is also a lot more integration and harmony as well. The kind of interactions between whites and blacks and hispanics of all classes that one sees in downtown Houston on a normal workday is non-existent in downtown Boston. The idea that the south is a hotbed of racism compared to the north is a comforting myth that liberals tell each other as justification for their evangelistic zeal.\n\nUPDATE.3: Amanda Ripley, the article's co-author, objects to the characterization of educated white liberals as the most intolerant Americans. Here's how I arrived at that description.\n\nShe (and her colleagues) wrote:\n\nIn general, the most politically intolerant Americans, according to the analysis, tend to be whiter, more highly educated, older, more urban, and more partisan themselves.\n\nThey also wrote:\n\nNationwide, if we disregard the smallest counties (which may be hard to pin down statistically, since they have fewer than 100,000 people), the most politically intolerant county in America appears to be Suffolk County, Massachusetts, which includes the city of Boston. In this part of the country, nine out of every 10 couples appear to share the same partisan leaning, according to the voter-file data. Eight out of every 10 neighborhoods are politically homogeneous. This means that people in Boston may have fewer \"cross-cutting relationships,\" as researchers put it. It is a very urban county with a relatively high education level. All these things tend to correlate with partisan prejudice.\n\nThe next-door county to Boston - the one with Cambridge - is equally intolerant, according to the map. In fact, the East Coast cities dominated by liberal Democrats, and where the most highly educated white people congregate, score very high on the intolerance scale. Plus, a Pew survey found that people with advanced degrees are far more liberal than those without.\n\nThis is how I drew that conclusion.\n\nIt is also true that the article says:\n\nIn general, Republicans seem to dislike Democrats more than Democrats dislike Republicans, PredictWise found. We don't know why this is, but this is not the only study to have detected an imbalance.\n\nI do not like to read that Americans dislike each other over their political party (as opposed to sensible reasons, such as supporting the Alabama Crimson Tide). But I find it meaningful and especially worrying that the least tolerant people in the country are educated white people who live in big cities.

      "text": "Anti-woke liberals weren't tricked by progressives. They were wrong about liberalism.\n\nAnti-woke liberals are becoming the de facto leaders of the American right. They have brought to it an undeniable infusion of talent, along with first-hand knowledge of liberal institutions and milieus. But they have also carried with them certain assumptions that can hobble the right in its effort to articulate a governing philosophy for the country.\n\nAnti-woke liberals are defined by their skepticism of three progressive causes: Black Lives Matter, MeToo, and transgenderism. In response to these movements, anti-woke liberals propose a return to liberal principles-an embrace of individualism, proceduralism, and neutrality.\n\nWe can see this in the anti-woke response to Black Lives Matter, a movement that arose in response to the Ferguson unrest of 2014 and gained new strength after the death of George Floyd in 2020. As the slogan indicates, Black Lives Matter focuses on the particular challenges and demands of black Americans. It thus represents what anti-woke liberals describe as a form of \"tribalism\" or \"identity politics.\" This outlook received its most sustained and influential expression in the 1619 Project, published by the New York Times .\n\nIts most eloquent opponent is Thomas Chatterton Williams, a writer who lives in Paris. In opposition to the \"tribal\" claims of Black Lives Matter and the 1619 Project, Williams insists on individual autonomy. As he puts it, \"individualism by its very nature is opposed to racism.\" His approach is liberal in its rejection of any group identity that might limit individuality. Yet it fails to take account of the fact that people will always seek some form of belonging.\n\nAnti-woke liberals have likewise resisted #MeToo on liberal grounds. They have responded to its notable disregard for due process by insisting that we uphold basic legal protections for the accused. They have pointed out the damage #MeToo has done to our legal system and to the practice of journalistic ethics. In all this, they are correct, but they are wrong to stop there. For like the proponents of #MeToo, they support a liberal ideal of sexual autonomy. In fact, as a more conventional conservatism has long recognized, the public promotion of chastity is the only plausible way to minimize sexual harms. This was the intuition that stood behind parietal rules and criminal penalties for adultery.\n\nAnti-woke liberals have righteously opposed the rise of child sex-change operations. But they have failed to reckon with its connections-institutional and logical-to a rainbow agenda that they otherwise support. It is not just the case that same lobbies that pushed for gay marriage promptly switched to supporting trans causes. Gay liberation, even in its most conservative guise, has required at some level a queering of society, a displacement of what had been the norm. Such a project is logically opposed to any attempt to define and defend what counts as normal.\n\nIn fact, anti-woke liberals sometimes speak as though the only problem with binding, padding, tucking, and packing a child is that the child can't consent. If it could, all those things-along with hormone replacement therapy and surgery-would be unobjectionable. Andrew Sullivan, one of the leading anti-woke liberals, went so far as to compare child sex-changes with circumcision, a practice intrinsic to Jewish identity that is also affirmed-while being transcended-by Christianity. When St. Paul calls Christians to a \"circumcision of the heart,\" he is not enjoining the spiritual version of an unjust perversity.\n\nThough Andrew Sullivan is a believer, it is worth recalling here that many of the leading lights of anti-woke liberalism were once New Atheists; they oppose \"wokeism\" no more and no less than they oppose organized religion. In this way, they are fundamentally opposed to what conservatives generally seek to uphold.\n\nAnti-woke liberals have also decried the politicization of the workplace and economy. CEOs like Jason Fried of Basecamp have banned \"societal and political discussions\" in the workplace, a move widely celebrated on the right. Liberals assume that individuals can and should leave their politics at the door when they enter the office or factory.\n\nIn doing so, they ignore the fact that men remain political and religious animals even when they go to work. As Emile Durkheim argued in the preface to the second edition of The Division of Labor in Society , the medieval guild system-which combined political and religious belonging with economic function-was merely one contingent response to an enduring human need. Romans had likewise organized themselves into professional groups that carried out religious and political functions, including burial of the dead. The problem is not that we have political ideas invading the workplace, but that those ideas are unnatural and need to be replaced.\n\nLiberalism has failed. The progressive movements opposed by anti-woke liberals arose because of its insufficiencies. People need communal belonging. They are rightly embittered by our sexual marketplace. They are correct to believe that work has to be directed at something higher than profit. Anti-woke liberals deny these realities. That is why different leadership is needed for the American right-or any other movement that hopes to stand against woke excesses effectively.\n\nThis article appears in the January/February 2023 issue\n\nMatthew Schmitz is a founder and editor of Compact magazine, and a contributing editor at The American Conservative .\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

New data has the answer\n\nSecularity - the idea that people, beliefs, and activities can be void of all spirituality and religiosity - is a myth, says Steve Deace.\n\n\"Someone will always rule; something must always be worshipped. There's no secular realm,\" he says. \"Anyone who claims so is either willfully ignorant to naive, or they're lying to you in the hopes that you will take your faith and set it aside so that they can then replace yours with their own.\"\n\nAs further proof, Steve points to some data shared by American political scientist Ryan Burge:\n\nThe graph depicts a strong correlation between Protestant Christian church attendance and political affiliation. Simply put, those who identify as politically liberal, regardless of racial demographic, are far less likely to be frequent church attenders.\n\nWhy? Because what being a liberal has evolved to mean puts one in diametric opposition with biblical standards.\n\nCo-host Aaron McIntire explains it like this: \"What does liberal actually mean? Well, it used to mean being open-minded to new ideas ... individual rights, things of that nature,\" but today, it means \"capital-P progressive.\"\n\n\"Liberalism was 'we want government to allow people to do things that God says are wrong.' Progressivism is basically ... 'we want the government to force people to do what God says is wrong,\"' he explains.\n\nThe \"biggest idiots of them all,\" McIntire says, are the small percentages of individuals who are both liberal and regular church attenders.\n\n\"Why are you going there? What's the point?\" he asks.\n\nSteve speculates that those small percentages are likely made up of people who attend \"very left-wing churches\" that operate outside biblical doctrine anyway.\n\nThe data, however, only depicts Protestant Christian church attendance. How do the numbers shift when it's Catholicism, Mormonism, Judaism, Islamism, Hinduism, or Buddhism?\n\nTo find out, watch the episode above.\n\nTo enjoy more of Steve's take on national politics, Christian worldview, and principled conservatism with a snarky twist, subscribe to BlazeTV - the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.\n\nBlazeTV Staff"

The choice of Bongino might push them right over.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Sunday evening that FBI Director Kash Patel has tapped former U.S. Secret Service agent and popular conservative commentator Dan Bongino to be his right-hand man.\n\nThe news that Bongino will serve as FBI deputy director was well received on the right and by members of the Trump administration. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, for instance, noted , \"No better patriot or professional. Patel-Bongino atop the FBI is pure [fire].\"\n\nWhite House adviser Stephen Miller wrote , \"Dan Bongino is the warrior America needs in this vital role.\"\n\nOn the left, however, there was weeping and gnashing of teeth - par for the course given that Democrats and liberal pundits were still in the process of melting down over Patel's Thursday confirmation.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.) tweeted , \"Trump has chosen grifters to lead the FBI. Kash Patel sells 'K$SH' branded merch, vaccine reversal pills. Dan Bongino's entire show is telling listeners the world is ending so they buy the dozens of survivalist products he sells.\"\n\nMurphy, who recently humiliated himself by attacking Vice President JD Vance and the Trump family over a post from a Lara Trump fan account, added, \"I know this feels like a bad dream. It isn't.\"\n\n'The choice of Mr. Bongino is a radical and abrupt departure.'\n\nThe news feed on the liberal X knockoff Bluesky was crowded with similar complaints, which in many cases recycled the attacks previously used by establishmentarians against Hegseth, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nOne self-identified member of the 2024 Kamala Harris team wrote , \"Two of Trump's most devout sycophants have now been installed at the highest, most powerful echelons of the FBI - a law enforcement agency heretofore known for its tradition of independence,\" adding that the duo are \"the least experienced leadership pair in the entire 117-year history of the FBI.\"\n\nAdam Cohen, the vice chair of the anti-Trump group Lawyers for Good Government, similarly characterized Bongino as \"unqualified,\" suggesting that the FBI deputy director's ideas \"are generally ludicrous conspiracy theories, totally devoid of fact.\"\n\nThe New York Times was among the liberal publications that rushed to frame the choice, which requires no Senate confirmation, as unorthodox and \"radical.\"\n\n\"In the past, F.B.I. directors have selected senior agents with extensive experience to essentially run the bureau's operations, a complex and grueling job that requires working closely with foreign partners and navigating sensitive investigations,\" said a Times piece on the announcement. \"The choice of Mr. Bongino is a radical and abrupt departure from that practice and raises startling questions about how two people who have never served as F.B.I. agents will oversee the vast surveillance and investigative powers of an agency of 38,000 people and a budget of about $11 billion.\"\n\nThe Times further claimed that Bongino \"often peddles rampant misinformation.\" Two of the examples that the Times provided of \"conspiracy theories\" advanced by Bongino were, however, fact-based - namely that masks were ineffective at preventing the spread of the coronavirus, which the Cochrane Collaboration's 2023 systematic review confirmed , and that Democrats spied on Trump's 2016 campaign .\n\nMSNBC analyst Tim Miller was among the pundits who appeared to have trouble coping, writing , \"What in the living f**k.\"\n\n'Buckle up, America!'\n\nAccording to the website for his unsuccessful 2012 U.S. Senate campaign, Bongino started as a police cadet with the New York Police Department in 1995 and became a full officer in 1997. After two years spent patrolling the streets of Brooklyn, he joined the Secret Service in 1999 as a special agent. The 50-year-old father of two who beat Hodgkin lymphoma during the pandemic joined the USSS' Presidential Protection Division in 2006 and remained on protective duty with former President Barack Obama.\n\nIn addition to penning best-selling books in the time since, including \"Exonerated: The Failed Takedown of President Donald Trump by the Swamp,\" Bongino has long hosted a massively popular podcast that has consistently ranked high among the top political commentary shows.\n\n\"Great news for Law Enforcement and American Justice!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Dan Bongino, a man of incredible love and passion for our Country, has just been named the next DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FBI, by the man who will be the best ever Director, Kash Patel.\"\n\n\"Dan has a Masters Degree in Psychology from C.U.N.Y., and an MBA from Penn State. He was a member of the New York Police Department (New York's Finest!), a highly respected Special Agent with the United States Secret Service, and is now one of the most successful Podcasters in the Country, something he is willing and prepared to give up in order to serve,\" added Trump.\n\nFollowing Trump's announcement, Bongino thanked the president, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and FBI Director Kash Patel on X, then retweeted a post that said , \"THE DREAM TEAM. KASH PATEL. DAN BONGINO. FAFO. Buckle up, America!\" The acronym used in the message shared by the FBI deputy director, \"FAFO,\" stands for \"f**k around and find out.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Supreme Court Justices Barrett and Roberts side with liberals to deny sentencing delay in Trump hush-money case\n\nTrump will be sentenced on Friday morning.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled against a bid from the attorneys for President-elect Donald Trump to delay the sentencing in the case involving hush money paid to adult movie worker Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe court ruled in a narrow 5-4 vote against Trump on Thursday.\n\n'The Biden/Harris DOJ forced Bragg to concoct anything to embarrass TRUMP.'\n\nJustices John Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett sided with the liberal justices on the court.\n\n\"First, the alleged evidentiary violations at President-Elect Trump's state-court trial can be addressed in the ordinary course on appeal. Second, the burden that sentencing will impose on the President-Elect's responsibilities is relatively insubstantial in light of the trial court's stated intent to impose a sentence of 'unconditional discharge' after a brief virtual hearing,\" read the ruling.\n\nTrump will face sentencing on Friday at 9:30 ET, although he will be allowed to attend the ruling via video conference.\n\nHe was found guilty by a jury of 34 counts of falsifying business records over $130,000 that was paid out to Daniels in order to keep her from speaking to the press about her claims of an extramarital affair with Trump. He denies the charges.\n\nTrump became the first U.S. president to be guilty of criminal charges and, barring any extraordinary event, will become the first U.S. president to be elected despite being a felon.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan has signaled that he would give Trump an \"unconditional discharge\" that would allow him to avoid prison time, any fine, or probation.\n\nMerchan had previously denied postponing the sentencing on the basis that Trump's immunity claims did not apply to acts he committed privately.\n\nTrump excoriated the judge in a post on social media.\n\n\"Ultimately, the Biden/Harris DOJ forced Bragg to concoct anything to embarrass TRUMP. But it was even more so what the CORRUPT and TOTALLY CONFLICTED POLITICAL HACK Judge did, and is doing, on this sham trial,\" wrote Trump.\n\n\"The Judge fabricated the facts, and the law, no different than the other New York Judicial and Prosecutorial Witch Hunts. That's why businesses are fleeing New York, taking with them millions of jobs, and BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAXES,\" he added.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Liberals lose their minds over church's sign about open borders, vilify black pastor as a 'white supremacist'\n\n'We understand that immigration is a hot topic today and wanted to use that to turn people's attention heavenward.'\n\nA church in Illinois has caused a stir after putting up a sign about illegal immigration and open borders . Liberals are having a meltdown over the sign, even vilifying the black pastor as a \"white supremacist.\"\n\nThe New Hope Community Church is located in Palatine, Illinois, roughly 30 miles northwest of Chicago .\n\n'People are getting triggered by the word \"immigration.\"'\n\nOn Feb. 5, the church featured a new sign that read: \"Heaven Has Strict Immigration Laws. Hell Has Open Borders.\"\n\nPastor James Pittman noted that there was no controversy about the sign for the first \"six days it was up\" until \"someone got wind of it.\"\n\nLocal news outlets ran stories about the sign and then CNN reportedly requested an interview.\n\nPittman told WLS-TV , \"Immigration is a topic in the communities, so what we've been doing on our sign for quite some time is take what's going on in the community and turn it towards heaven.\"\n\nPittman said he is open to having conversations about the sign's message.\n\n\"The immigration we were talking about is very clear in the sign: heaven and hell. And our message is very clear, the scriptures are clear, not everybody makes it to heaven,\" Pittman stated.\n\nPittman addressed the alleged controversy in a 14-minute video .\n\nThe New Hope Community Church issued a statement on its official Facebook page that read:\n\nHowever, some in the Palatine community are up in arms about the church's sign.\n\n\"Part of why we moved to Palatine was the diversity being able to show our kids that, and everyone should have opportunity, and love each other, and seeing something like this is really upsetting,\" said Palatine resident Katharine Huddleston.\n\nLisa Beth Szczupaj - president of the Palatine Elementary District 15 school board - told the Daily Herald , \"It is unfortunate that a couple of phrases that some adults feel to be clever are posted in the face of many innocent schoolchildren having to ask parents, friends, and adults what they mean and why. Pulling kids into the edginess and politics of the moment is absolutely inappropriate and causes real fear for our school-age children.\"\n\nResident Theresa Greinig added, \"I couldn't quite believe that that was a message going out in my community.\"\n\nGreinig told WLS that she is mobilizing the community to create \"signs of positivity\" to place around the New Hope Community Church.\n\nSome critics have allegedly called Pittman a \" white supremacist .\" Pastor Pittman is black.\n\nComments on the church's official Yelp business page were disabled after it was inundated with likely fake negative reviews this week.\n\n\"This business recently received increased public attention, which often means people come to this page to post their views on the news,\" Yelp stated on the New Hope Community Church's page.\n\n\"While we don't take a stand one way or the other when it comes to this incident, we've temporarily disabled the posting of content to this page as we work to investigate whether the content you see here reflects actual consumer experiences rather than the recent events,\" the statement continued. \"Please note that we apply this same policy regardless of the business and regardless of the topic at issue.\"\n\nBefore the comments were turned off, several detractors slammed the church's Yelp page with one-star reviews in the past week.\n\nA Yelp user claimed, \"The church sign on display promotes so much hate. I'm sad for our diverse community of Palatine to have read such ignorant messages.\"\n\nAnother user wrote, \"Do NOT. And I repeat, do not go here. This is not your normal warm, welcoming, compassionate church. These people are bigots and racists against Latinos. Starting from the pastor and down to all the parishioners. Look for another church and give your donations there. Do not even step foot in there if you're undocumented or LGBTQ+. You've been warned.\"\n\nA commenter said, \" Not a good church! Don't come here. They do not welcome immigrants or minorities. Do yourself a favor and find a better church!\"\n\nAnother added, \"C hurch that promotes hate and racism. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place.\"\n\nOne review read, \"DO NOT RECOMMEND. Racist, discriminatory, unwelcoming church. Not sure what type of 'God' you praise ... but God stated to love thy neighbor and your message is NOT it. SHAME ON YOU.\"\n\nThe church had received a total of 14 negative reviews in the past decade, n ine of which were posted in the past week after the church made headlines with its sensitive sign.\n\nA majority of the recent one-star reviews were made by Yelp reviewers who were not from Illinois, including four from liberal California and one from Washington, D.C.\n\nDespite the backlash, Pittman declared that he is sticking to his faith and doesn't plan on changing the sign anytime soon.\n\n\"We push one man and one man only here and that's Jesus Christ,\" Pittman proclaimed.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Liberals moving into your state? Don't retreat, convert them by doing this...\n\nConservatives must push back against encroaching liberalism as more liberals move to Republican states, threatening to turn them from red to blue\n\nThough the trend has been going on for years, news on Thursday reconfirmed that Californians are fleeing their socialist dystopia - streets riddled with used heroin needles and the homeless' pungent feces - for the cleaner plains of Texas.\n\nThe same Texas that came within two tiny points of electing Beto O'Rourke , the anti-gun, dirt-eating hippy. I mention Beto for  one reason: Texas is no longer red, it's purple. Even Republican leadership in Texas is worried they may lose control due to this changing demographic of the Lone Star State. But it needn't be that way.\n\nConservatives usually offer one of two options when faced with encroaching leftism:\n\nYou can bet your Texas-shaped waffle iron not every Californian fleeing the sunshine and fecal state is a leftist. Many of them are conservatives following the second option above.\n\nWhy do conservatives just complain when liberalism is set to ruin everything? The one explanation I've heard for years, and the one I tend to live by myself, is: \"Conservatives just want to live their lives in peace.\" Get up. Go to work. Come home. Take care of the 2.1 kids. Paint the picket fence white.\n\nSo how's living your life in peace working out? Is the left leaving you alone? Or are the family stick figures slapped on the back of the Honda Odyssey just not doing much in keeping the left from creeping into every single avenue of your life? How long before that same Honda Odyssey is packed full of Skyler and Braden's stuff heading to a \"red\" state because you're tired of liberals ruining everything you just want to be left alone to live your life?\n\nLather, rinse, complain, and move to somewhere even uglier.\n\nThere's a word for doing the same thing and expecting a different result.\n\nLiberalism advances and conservatives retreat. Liberals are morally wrong, intellectually clueless, spread failure like it's success, and they seem to do so rather successfully. They own Hollywood, education, most of media. When they ascend to power they abuse it. They bully anyone who strays from their dogma, even other leftists.\n\nWhy stay and fight when you're unsure how to fight a foe that has absolute control over every industry of influence.\n\nThe left isn't winning because they have superior arguments. The left isn't winning because their leaders are smarter than ours. They're not winning because they're changing people's minds.\n\nThe left wins because it hits people in the gut. The left wins because it knows how to craft a narrative and tell a better story. The left has a mastery of language, specifically how to use language to push their agenda, that the right cannot match.\n\nRepublicans and conservatives lost the abortion fight the minute some leftists labeled abortion as \"a woman's right to choose.\" Well, shoot. Who's against choice? Who's against body autonomy? If America is an independent, individual rights-promoting kind of place, why deny women the right to control their bodies?\n\nObviously chopping and sucking an unborn baby out of the womb has zero to do with body autonomy. That's how the left sold it, and the left has been hitting men and women in the feels about abortion \"rights\" ever since. Then pro-lifers come along with their \"choose life\" bumperstickers and \"we value life from womb to tomb\" rhyming talking points and get laughed at. It's like showing up to a burning building with a squirt gun.\n\nWhat does work at changing people from pro-choice to pro-life is the gut punch. Usually by seeing an abortion. If you've seen a photo of an aborted fetus or watched tiny hands, tiny feet, and broken ribs coming out of the birth canal, you know I'm right.\n\nSo, how to apply gut punches to issues that aren't as heartbreaking as killing unborn babies?\n\nConservatives argue based on principles and intellect while talking with someone operated by their feelings. There is rarely a cogent conversation when two people aren't even talking on the same level. Emotions dictate what thoughts and memories get remembered. The left capitalizes on that and drives their agenda based on emotions.\n\nFine. Let's do the same.\n\nBefore one can sell conservatism, we must first emotionally tie liberal failures with liberalism. Liberals don't associate the problems liberalism causes with liberalism itself. Otherwise they wouldn't keep voting for it then leave the mess of it and voting for it again.\n\nYes, yes, a lot of liberals are insane. Granted. But hear me out.\n\nNo Californian voted for heroin needles in their streets. No Californian wanted to walk pass homeless people dropping deuces on parking lot curbs. Californians were sold on feelings of \"we need to help the homeless people, and this program/politician is the way to do it!\" When those same Californians move to Texas and vote for some Democrat, they're not voting for poop in your streets. They're voting to help some pet group the Democrat is promising to help.\n\nLather, rinse, move, and vote for the same policies and officials.\n\nHere's my advice, Texans. Skip the lecture on how crappy it is to vote Democrat. It is crappy, I'm just suggesting we try something else to break some cycles. Instead, tie Democrat promises of \"helping the homeless\" to poop in the streets. Were I working for the California GOP, I'd create a sort of leaflet campaign with pictures of heroin needles on the streets overlaid with text \"Thanks, Elected Democrats\" and on the back an entire timeline of who, what, when, where, how and why the heroin needle got on the street. You're free to use that, California GOP.\n\nTie the programs, policies, and elected officials who instituted the failures to the failure itself. Being careful to lay the blame on the programs and officials instituting them, not the voters.\n\nYes, I know the voters voted in the politicians who pushed their crap ideas. Again, crap ideas are never sold as crap.\n\nThis isn't going to be easy. Liberals are not going to hear a lecture anymore than you will. But they might answer a non-confrontational question. \"How did San Francisco, a beautiful city, get so overrun with poop?\" you might ask. \"How did the Californian bureaucracy get so insane?\" you could try. \"I heard there were heroin needles everywhere, how did that happen?\"\n\nMake the leftist answer. They'll usually say \"I don't know.\" That's when you offer some ideas of what could be to blame.\n\nSure, that's simplistic. It won't always work. But a lot of the time, a liberal is a liberal by default, not necessarily by choice. After all, Hollywood, education, and most of media is liberal.  They're not used to thinking about why they believe what they believe. They've just heard nothing else. Sometimes just planting a seed is enough to let it grow.\n\nAnd when it isn't, you don't pop open a beer (or wine bottle) at the end of the day and ignore the changing political landscape of the state you know and love. Instead, you go to a city meeting and make your impassioned rant you had for your cellphone in the car to an audience of people who vote, and the people they voted for. Hopefully it's good, hopefully it inspires others to do the same, hopefully it plants seeds. Hopefully, you get it on camera and tweet it to me.\n\nFighting back may be hard. It will for sure be annoying, frustrating, and require getting out of your comfort zone. But it sure as hell is a lot easier than relocating your entire life to a place the left will eventually get to anyway. As they are right now.\n\nCourtney Kirchoff"

      "text": "Brett Kavanaugh Confirmation Hearings Kick Off with Fireworks\n\nShare This article\n\nWASHINGTON - Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh is taking center stage on Capitol Hill Tuesday.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee began the confirmation process with opening statements this morning, which will be followed by two days of questioning.\n\nDemocrats don't want Kavanaugh on the high court so they immediately tried to shut down the hearings, demanding more documents about Kavanaugh's previous government service. As one Democrat after another persistently tried to block the proceedings, quarreling and confusion ensued, and Republicans accused them of turning the hearing into a circus.\n\nNumerous hecklers contributed to the raucous scene, shouting repeatedly throughout the first few hours of opening statements.\n\nMany Democrats had refused to meet with Kavanaugh in the lead up to the hearings and had already tried numerous tactics to delay the hearing. But Republicans put the brakes on any effort to push the hearings until after the midterm elections.\n\n\"Let there be no misunderstanding that there would be any kind of delaying tactic that would take us past the first Tuesday in November,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told reporters in July.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's second Supreme Court nominee has already been a vicious confirmation battle. Specifically, his stance on Roe v. Wade has been a center point of contention. Liberals believe Kavanaugh will try to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court ruling which created a right to abortion. But several key senators have indicated they're satisfied with Kavanaugh when it comes to the abortion issue.\n\n\"He said that he agreed with what Justice (John) Roberts said at his nomination hearing in which he said that it was settled law,\" said pro-choice Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who met with Kavanaugh last month.\n\nMany Democrats, however, want more than that. Just last month, Democratic lawmakers demanded almost a million pages of documents on the judge from the National Archives. And during this week's confirmation hearings, they plan to use their time to pick apart his stance on abortion and other issues.\n\n\"How much more do they need to know to vote no? And yet they're really pushing hard for everything,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said.\n\nKavanaugh enters the ring with respected credentials: He earned a Yale law degree, clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy and has a vast judicial record with more than 300 opinions.\n\nHis confirmation could influence the court for decades.\n\n\"I think Judge Kavanaugh is satisfying people that he's going to be an independent person, that he's going to leave his personal views out of it - that he's going to look at the law and look at the facts of the case,\" Grassley said.\n\nRepublicans hope to get Kavanaugh seated on the bench by Oct. 1, the start of the next Supreme Court session.\n\nThe GOP has a razor-thin majority in the Senate and will need every vote to push this nominee through.\n\nShare This article\n\nBen Kennedy is an Emmy Award-winning White House correspondent for CBN News in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "4 Big Reasons the Media's Comey Freak-Out Exposes Rampant Bias\n\nShare This article\n\nSure, it's a big story. No doubt, there are a lot of questions. But c'mon news media! Enough already with your rabid anti-Trump agenda.\n\nIt's been virulent since day one, but the firing of FBI Director James Comey has taken the media's frenzied bias over a cliff.\n\nWe all know there's an investigation going on right now at the FBI into Russia's possible election meddling, but the media's coverage on this has been based on one assumption all along - that Trump and his team are guilty before being proven innocent.\n\nI mean, how else could their chosen candidate, Hillary, have lost to this guy?\n\nSo, I get it. The media is angry because they think Trump's firing of Comey means they won't get their desired result of some sort of proof to back up their agenda.\n\nYes, we're all concerned about Russian meddling in the U.S. election. We simply can't have our adversaries eroding public confidence in our electoral system or our institutions.\n\nBut I think the mainstream media (MSM) is just as big of a problem when it comes to eroding the public trust.\n\nLast fall, a Gallup poll showed this: \"Americans' Trust in Mass Media Sinks to New Low.\"\n\nIt's been on a steady decrease since 55 percent trusted the MSM in 1999. Now just 32 percent of Americans trust them.\n\nAnd their coverage of the Comey firing provides more proof of why people have turned to alternative media for the truth.\n\nHere are 4 reasons why I think the MSM's Comey coverage has been biased:\n\n1. The man now in a position to investigate Trump and Russia - Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe - is a Democrat. And when he worked on the Clinton email investigation at the FBI, McCabe's wife had just received half a million dollars from Hillary Clinton's allies at the DNC for her state Senate campaign in Virginia.\n\nThat means Trump just removed a potential neutral arbiter in Comey and replaced him with someone who may have more of an interest in targeting Trump.\n\nCase in point: McCabe undermined some of Trump's claims in his congressional testimony this week. 2. Liberals wanted Comey gone until he was gone. Well, some even wanted him gone after he was gone, now they've all changed their tune.\n\nStephen Colbert's liberal-leaning audience celebrated the announcement when it was made on his show. Their applause was thunderous until Colbert told them this was bad news, because Comey was investigating Trump and Russia. Then they booed.\n\nColbert is not the MSM, but his audience reaction is a perfect depiction of the Left's before-and-after response to Trump and Comey.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton had fired him, it would have been a blip on the media radar. They hated the guy, believing he destroyed her chances of winning the White House. But now that Trump has canned Comey, they insinuate there's a cover-up. 3. The MSM keeps pointing to different variations in the accounts about how Comey was fired.\n\nBreaking News: President Trump doesn't always get his story right. It's not a great quality for a leader. But is it really a shock to anyone at this stage in the game that his communication comes off the cuff? Remember, this is the same media that challenged the Obama admin's perfectly cohesive narrative after the Benghazi attack. Oh, wait, that didn't happen.\n\nIf only the Trump administration was as perfect about concocting some team talking points and blamed it all on protests against an anti-Muslim video, then would the media have reported the Comey story like a news story instead of some massive scandal? Not likely.\n\nOh, and the MSM still doesn't care that President Obama and Secretary Clinton could have saved American lives in Benghazi, but to quote Ms. Clinton, \"What difference, at this point, does it make?\"\n\nBut I digress.\n\n4. Elections HAVE CONSEQUENCES! The winner gets to pick the members of their team, NOT the MSM.\n\nComey himself wrote a farewell letter to staff saying that he had long believed that a president can fire an FBI director for any reason and that he would not spend time dwelling on the decision.\n\nBottom line: Comey's firing isn't fake news, but a lot of the media frenzy about it is.\n\nIf you need further proof, watch this no-holds-barred interview with Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice.\n\nJames Comey's Firing Fishy or Long Overdue?

      "text": "Kavanaugh Sworn in as Protesters Chant Outside Supreme Court\n\nShare This article\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as the 114th justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, after a wrenching debate over sexual misconduct and judicial temperament that shattered the Senate, captivated the nation and ushered in an acrimonious new level of polarization - now encroaching on the court that the 53-year-old judge may well swing rightward for decades to come.\n\nEven as Kavanaugh took his oath of office Saturday evening in a quiet private ceremony, not long after the narrowest Senate confirmation in nearly a century and a half, protesters chanted outside the court building across the street from the Capitol.\n\nThe climactic 50-48 roll call capped a fight that seized the national conversation after claims emerged that he had sexually assaulted women three decades ago - allegations he emphatically denied. Those accusations transformed the clash from a routine struggle over judicial ideology into an angry jumble of questions about victims' rights, the presumption of innocence and personal attacks on nominees.\n\nHis confirmation provides a defining accomplishment for President Donald Trump and the Republican Party, which found a unifying force in the cause of putting a new conservative majority on the court. Before the sexual accusations grabbed the Senate's and the nation's attention, Democrats had argued that Kavanaugh's rulings and writings as an appeals court judge raised serious concerns about his views on abortion rights and a president's right to bat away legal probes.\n\nTrump, flying to Kansas for a political rally, flashed a thumbs-up gesture when the tally was announced and praised Kavanaugh for being \"able to withstand this horrible, horrible attack by the Democrats.\" He later telephoned his congratulations to the new justice, then at the rally returned to his own attack on the Democrats as \"an angry left-wing mob.\"\n\nLike Trump, senators at the Capitol predicted voters would react strongly by defeating the other party's candidates in next month's congressional elections.\n\n\"It's turned our base on fire,\" declared Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. But Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York forecast gains for his party instead: \"Change must come from where change in America always begins: the ballot box.\"\n\nThe justices themselves made a quiet show of solidarity. Kavanaugh was sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts and the man he's replacing, retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, as fellow Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan looked on - two conservatives and two liberals.\n\nStill, Kagan noted the night before that Kennedy has been \"a person who found the center\" and \"it's not so clear we'll have that\" now.\n\nNoisy to the end, the Senate battle featured a call of the roll that was interrupted several times by protesters shouting in the spectators' gallery before Capitol Police removed them. Vice President Mike Pence presided, his potential tie-breaking vote unnecessary.\n\nTrump has now put his stamp on the court with his second justice in as many years. Yet Kavanaugh is joining under a cloud. Accusations from several women remain under scrutiny, and House Democrats have pledged further investigation if they win the majority in November. Outside groups are culling an unusually long paper trail from his previous government and political work, with the National Archives and Records Administration expected to release a cache of millions of documents later this month.\n\nKavanaugh, a father of two, strenuously denied the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who says he sexually assaulted her when they were teens. An appellate court judge on the District of Columbia circuit for the past 12 years, he pushed for the Senate vote as hard as Republican leaders - not just to reach this capstone of his legal career, but in fighting to clear his name.\n\nAfter Ford's allegations, Democrats and their allies became engaged as seldom before, though there were obvious echoes of Thomas' combative confirmation over the sexual harassment accusations of Anita Hill, who worked for him at two federal agencies. Protesters began swarming Capitol Hill, creating a tense, confrontational atmosphere that put Capitol Police on edge.\n\nAs exhausted senators prepared for Saturday's vote, some were flanked by security guards. Hangers and worse have been delivered to their offices, a Roe v. Wade reference.\n\nSome 164 people were arrested, most for demonstrating on the Capitol steps, 14 for disrupting the Senate's roll call vote.\n\nMcConnell told The Associated Press in an interview that the \"mob\" of opposition - confronting senators in the hallways and at their homes - united his narrowly divided GOP majority as Kavanaugh's confirmation teetered and will give momentum to his party this fall.\n\nBeyond the sexual misconduct allegations, Democrats raised questions about Kavanaugh's temperament and impartiality after he delivered defiant, emotional testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee where he denounced their party.\n\nSchumer said Kavanaugh's \"partisan screed\" showed not only a temperament unfitting for the high court but a lack of objectivity that should make him ineligible to serve. At one point in the hearing, Kavanaugh blamed a Clinton-revenge conspiracy for the accusations against him.\n\nThe fight ended up less about judicial views than the sexual assault accusations that riveted the nation and are certain to continue a national debate and #MeToo reckoning that is yet to be resolved.\n\nRepublicans argued that a supplemental FBI investigation instigated by wavering GOP senators and ordered by the White House turned up no corroborating witnesses to the claims and that Kavanaugh had sterling credentials for the court. Democrats dismissed the truncated report as insufficient.\n\nIn the end, all but one Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, lined up behind the judge. She said on the Senate floor late Friday that Kavanaugh is \"a good man\" but his \"appearance of impropriety has become unavoidable.\"\n\nIn a twist, Murkowski voted \"present\" Saturday as a courtesy to Republican Kavanaugh supporter Steve Daines, who was to walk his daughter down the aisle at her wedding in Montana. That balanced out the absence without affecting the outcome, and gave Kavanaugh the same two-vote margin he'd have received had both lawmakers voted.\n\nIt was the closest roll call to confirm a justice since 1881, when Stanley Matthews was approved 24-23, according to Senate records.\n\nAs the Senate tried to recover from its charged atmosphere, Murkowski's move offered a moment of civility. \"I do hope that it reminds us that we can take very small steps to be gracious with one another and maybe those small gracious steps can lead to more,\" she said.\n\nRepublicans control the Senate by a meager 51-49 margin, and announcements of support Friday from Republicans Jeff Flake of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine, along with Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, locked in the needed votes.\n\nManchin was the only Democrat to vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation. He expressed empathy for sexual assault victims, but said that after factoring in the FBI report, \"I have found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist who will follow the Constitution.\"\n\nA procedural vote Friday made Saturday's confirmation a foregone conclusion. White House Counsel Don McGahn, who helped salvage Kavanaugh's nomination as it teetered, sat in the front row of the visitors' gallery for the vote with deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah.\n\nSenators on both sides know they have work to do to put the chamber back together again after a ferocious debate that saw them arguing over the sordid details of high school drinking games, sexual allegations, and cryptic yearbook entries.\n\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas said, \"The Senate has been an embarrassment. We have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Trump has a net favorability rating of -4 now\n\nCNN host reacts to data analyst giving a 'reality check' about Donald Trump's approval rating\n\nA CNN data expert has given a brutal 'reality check' to liberals hoping that Donald Trump 's approval ratings might be falling amid aggressive immigration policies\n\nIt comes after separate polls by CNN and NBC indicated that Trump's approval rating was at an all-time high.\n\nTrump's overall approval rating, according to the NBC poll, is 47 percent, which is the highest he's ever polled during his political career .\n\nSimilarly, his personal favorable rating is 46 percent.\n\nThe Democrats, meanwhile, are struggling across the political sphere. In both the NBC poll and the CNN poll, the capitulation of the left-leaning party was undeniable.\n\nMeanwhile, 44 percent of Americans came together to agree that America is 'on the right track' under Trump's leadership.\n\nThis is the highest satisfaction rating in this category of registered voters since early 2004.\n\nAccording to the CNN polling , the Democratic Party's favorability rating among Americans is at record low.\n\nThe survey, conducted between March 6 to 9, found that favorability for the party is at a shocking 29 percent.\n\nThis is the lowest it has been since CNN began taking polls back in 1992. It has also plummeted 20 points since January 2021.\n\nThe poll found that 57 percent of respondents would prefer the Democrats dedicate their time and resources to stopping the Republican agenda, rather than work collaboratively in an effort to pass some Democrat legislation.\n\nAnd 52 percent of Democrat respondents said party leadership is taking party in the wrong direction.\n\nBeyond that, respondents said there is no clear hierarchy or leader to rally behind and be inspired by.\n\nWhen asked to name the Democrat they feel 'best reflects to the core values' of the party, the name with the highest amount of support was controversial New York Rep  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nEven still, she was only named by 10 percent of respondents.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris came in second with nine percent, and Bernie Sanders ranked third with eight percent.\n\nMore than 30 percent of participants in the survey did not name anybody. 'No one,' one answered. 'That's the problem.'\n\nThe Republican Party's favorability is at 36 percent - significantly higher than the Democrats.\n\nTrump is enjoying soaring popularity, while the Democratic Party suffers\n\nBut Trump continues to draw distinctions from his party across the political spectrum. The CNN data revealed that Americans are nine points more likely to describe the president individually as extreme than to use the same term to describe the Republican party.\n\nWhile the majority of voters who participated in the NBC poll disapprove of Trump's initial handling of the economy, inflation and the cost of living, his approval ratings remain between 42 and 44 percent for each marker.\n\nAnd Trump has garnered support for his Department of Government Efficiency, helmed by the world's richest man Elon Musk.\n\nVoters like the concept of slashing spending and cuts to federal departments, but they expressed some reservations about how rapid-fire it has been rolled out so far, as well as about Musk himself.\n\nThe NBC poll was conducted between March 7 and 11, with 1,000 registered voters.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

'I mean, they're crazy far-left.'\n\nComedian Bill Maher called NPR out on his show for 'crazy far-left' politics and proposed that the publication stop receiving federal funding\n\nNPR CEO Katherine Maher stood firm that her publication did not express a political bias during a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee hearing\n\nMaher was joined by author John McWhorter (right) and New York Post columnist Rikki Schlott (left) to sound off on the latest news, including the topic of NPR's federal funding\n\nHe was joined by New York Post columnist Rikki Schlott and New York Times columnist and author John McWhorter\n\nKatherine had argued during the hearing that NPR relies on federal funding to provide 'non-paywalled' content to American families which she said 'has never been more important.'\n\n'We're so polarized. These outlets became popular at a time when Republicans and Democrats didn't hate each other and weren't at each other's throats and didn't think each other was an existential threat,' Bill argued.\n\n'In that world, you can't have places like this, I think, anymore. They have to be private.'\n\nMcWhorter agreed that the publication shouldn't be federally funded and joked that even his nine-year-old daughter noticed that NPR consistently reports 'the same thing.'\n\n'It's always about how somebody can't do something,' McWhorter said his daughter told him.\n\nThe committee's questioning of the NPR and PBS CEOs drew sharp criticism from those on the left, while it was celebrated by many of Trump's supporters.\n\nThe Oversight Committee announced on Tuesday that they were looking forward to holding the executives 'accountable,' which resulted in a flurry of commentary.\n\nBill Maher slammed NPR CEO Katherine Maher (no relation) after she told Congress that the publication didn't have a political bias\n\n'No more paying for the big propaganda machine!!!' one user celebrated.\n\n'We should not be funding any news organization. That in itself is just asking for trouble. These people need to fund their own businesses- or go out of business just like everyone else,' another agreed.\n\nHowever, others slammed the decision to strip federal funding for the publications, with one comment reading, 'PBS is a beloved American institution. I watch it all the time obviously you people have nothing better to do.'\n\n'NPR and PBS are both unbiased, reliable, publicly available news sources. This regime is allergic to the truth, so naturally the MAGA minions in Congress want to intimidate and harrass these top quality public news sources,' another noted.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

      "text": "The changing face of gun ownership... Liberals reveal the bold reasons they're taking up arms\n\nBy LAUREN ACTON-TAYLOR FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 08:01 EDT, 1 March 2025 | Updated: 08:55 EDT, 1 March 2025\n\n451\n\nView comments\n\nAmericans who have never owned guns before are now buying their first firearms and reveal they feel compelled to be armed for a variety of different reasons.\n\nOver the Covid-19 pandemic, an estimated 7.5million American adults became new gun owners , half were women, 20 percent were black, and 20 percent were Hispanic, according to Harvard researchers .\n\nNot only is gun ownership becoming more diverse across race and gender , but it also appears to have bridged a divide between political beliefs as more democrats arm themselves.\n\nIn a 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center , 45 percent of Republicans say they owned a gun and 20 percent of Democrats or Democratic leaners.\n\nMen made up 40 percent of owners and women 25 percent, with 38 percent found to be White, 24 percent black, 20 percent Hispanic and ten percent Asian.\n\nAccording to the survey, 72 percent of gun owners said their major reason was for personal protection, 32 percent for hunting, 30 percent for sport shooting, 15 percent as part of a gun collection and 7 percent for their job.\n\nJohn Tsien, 47, told DailyMail.com that over time he shifted from politically conservative to more democratically leaning and it was at this point he decided to buy his first gun.\n\n'I do think it doesn't have to be a liberal democratic or conservative issue, as evidenced by the increasing number or people who are not conservative who are picking up firearms,' Tsien said.\n\nOver the Covid-19 pandemic, an estimated 7.5million American adults became new gun owners, half were women, 20 percent were black, and 20 percent were Hispanic\n\nJohn Tsien told DailyMail.com why he decided to start owning a gun\n\n'The community of gun owners is becoming more diverse politically,' he added, pointing out the growing number of liberal gun owner groups.\n\nTsien's gun ownership story began when he was much younger, as his parents had owned guns after immigrating from China during a politically charged time.\n\nBut when the father-of-three bought his first gun - a Ruger .22 caliber pistol - he had seen a spike of hate toward the Asian community in the early days of the pandemic.\n\n'I never thought it was necessary to own a firearm, but then the question becomes, you know, \"what makes it necessary to own a firearm?\" Tsien said.\n\n'And so, 2020, Covid, and we're starting to see - people call it Asian hate - but anti-Asian violence, because Covid had come from the place where I come from, the place where I have roots. So, that was when I started thinking seriously about it.'\n\nIt was the enjoyment he found while learning to shoot that became the primary reason for his gun ownership status - he felt it served as an anxiety soother.\n\nTsien told a story of how his mother kept a rifle in the kitchen to let her children play without fear of coyotes. He described it as a 'frontier kind of mentality' but argued that the rifle was a legitimate way for her to calm her fears.\n\n'The firearm is actually a salve for anxiety, and if you can reduce an anxiety in your life that you can implement fairly safely, I don't see how using that to assuage your anxiety is much different to medication or therapy practices,' he said.\n\n'The risk of a coyote attack was real, and no amount of deep breathing was going to address that actual issue.'\n\nHe found the shooting range to be a diverse place and added: 'When I started shooting there was a wave of Jewish people who had started shooting who were hiring instructors to work with them. There were a lot of people of color of different political stripes.'\n\n'It's easy to say guns are bad when you feel like you don't have any problems that a gun would help you solve, and I think that the environment is changing in this country. More people are feeling less safe for any of a number of reasons and many of them political,' Tsien said.\n\nAnna Kolanowski, 28, once believed no one needed to own a gun. It wasn't until she came out as transgender in 2021 that her opinion changed, and she felt the need for further protection\n\nThe owner of his gun range told him that they had seen an uptick in women taking up shooting.\n\n'It's easy to say guns are bad when you feel like you don't have any problems that a gun would help you solve, and I think that the environment is changing in this country,' he added.\n\n'More people are feeling less safe for any of a number of reasons and many of them political,' Tsien said.\n\nThat sentiment rings true for many gun owners, including 28-year-old Anna Kolanowski.\n\nKolanowski once believed no one needed to own a gun. It wasn't until she came out as transgender in 2021 that her opinion changed, and she felt the need for further protection.\n\n'Given that my parents had firearms when I was younger, and I wasn't really a huge fan of them. I did have this, sort of, scared respect of firearms,' she said.\n\n'Why do we have these in our home? What is the benefit of constantly keeping a loaded gun on you at all times?' she questioned, with exceptions for sport such as hunting.\n\nKolanowski told the New York Times that she realized she was 'a minority now, in a world that is pretty hostile to that minority'.\n\nJohn Alvarado, 30, said: 'We're here for a reason, and for now at least that reason is to safeguard the people that I care about'\n\n'Especially when I was earlier on in my transition, I was worried of getting clocked and just being recognized visibly as a trans person,' she added. 'If something had happened and I wasn't able to run, what would I do to defend myself?'\n\n'Detaching firearm ownership from being a sort of political signifier, so it's been a perspective shift.'\n\nSo, in 2022, she bought a Glock 43X handgun and began learning how to use it.\n\nKolanowski, who described herself as politically leftist, is not alone in her fears.\n\nVictoria Alston, a 30-year-old black woman from Arkansas, said she felt compelled to become a gun owner following her separation from her spouse.\n\n'I haven't like on my own for years. It gave me a lot of anxiety, honestly,' she said. 'So, I knew I wanted to make sure I was protected.'\n\n'Growing up, just thinking about firearms, it was never really seen - women weren't really seen having firearms. It was more masculine, so it was more for the men to always have the guns and for them to protect,' she said.\n\n'I see now, there's so many women getting attacked, we're probably the least protected humans.'\n\nVictoria Alston, a 30-year-old Black woman from Arkansas, said she felt compelled to become a gun owner following her separation from her spouse. 'I haven't like on my own for years. It gave me a lot of anxiety, honestly,' she said. 'So, I knew I wanted to make sure I was protected'\n\n'A lot of men preying on women, most of the times we're alone. We don't always have somebody, we can take with us to run down to the store or any of that,' she said.\n\n'So that puts a big target on our backs and we're an easy target. We can be vulnerable.'\n\nAfter a nighttime theft in her home, she bought a Canik 9-millimeter pistol and signed up for training at the gun range.\n\nJohn Alvarado, 30, found shifting societal and social norms were creating a dangerous society. Dangerous enough that he started buying guns to protect himself and his family.\n\nAlvarado, who is black and Latino, voted liberal for years but changed his tune during the pandemic after the mask and vaccine mandates in 2020 saw neighbors turning on each other.\n\nAs a result, he lost faith in the government and reconsidered his own beliefs.\n\n'When I first made my purchase, I was a lot more left leaning,' he said, before declaring he is now 'way more right leaning'.\n\nAlvarado began attending a conservative Baptist church with his wife, where he went on to serve on the security team patrolling the building during services.\n\nDr Ken Green said the journey toward gun ownership began after he learned that white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, had raised swastikas and chanted 'Jews will not replace us'\n\nEarl J. Brake, SR, owner of EJB's Gun Shop looks at a computer in Capitol Heights, Maryland\n\n'Bad guys, they exist everywhere. If I'm ready, always, I never have to get ready,' he said, as he explained how the birth of his sons drove him into a 'protector' role for his family.\n\n'I feel like I'm not doing my job if I don't have a firearm on my person ready to take care of something that may or may not happen,' Alvarado said. 'We're here for a reason, and for now at least that reason is to safeguard the people that I care about.'\n\nBut it was violence rather than neighborly betrayal that stirred Dr Ken Green toward buying a gun.\n\nThe attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, was the push that sent Green, a 70-year-old retired Navy dentist from California, toward buying his first gun.\n\n'You know the reason I decided to become a gun owner was not to protect myself against the Sinaloa cartel - you know, I don't have Walter White living next door to me - but to protect against the potential of this growing wave of antisemitism, ultra-right, white nationalism,' he told the NYT.\n\nGreen said the journey toward gun ownership began after he learned that white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, had raised swastikas and chanted 'Jews will not replace us.'\n\nOne month after Trump supporters stormed the capitol, Green bought a Smith and Wesson 9-millimeter handgun.\n\nGreen believes the world may have looked different had Trump not been elected in 2016 and, had he not, Green said he 'probably would not be a gun owner today'.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Their clarion calls were the loudest during Barack Obama 's presidency.\n\nThough Jones' platform is still tied up in bankruptcy auctioning , both men have been extraordinarily successful at selling their listeners things like storable food, radios, camping gear and water filtration systems.\n\nBut now that Democrats have been swept out of power, liberals are expressing their own fears about a GOP trifecta with Trump at the very top. Possible efforts to further roll back things like abortion and contraception are at the top of their minds.\n\nThat's why Juli Gittinger, a religious-studies professor at Georgia College, has stocked up on Plan B pills.\n\nA family tests out a Cold-war era nuclear bomb blast bunker in May 1955 that contains survival gear, food and water\n\nRight-wing personalities like Alex Jones and televangelist Jim Bakker have been financially successful selling doomsday prep items to their respective audiences\n\nHowever, there is a smaller contingent of liberals that like to prep too. Juli Gittinger, pictured, is one of them and started doing it after Trump was elected in 2016\n\nGittinger began prepping after Trump was elected president the first time in 2016, she told The Atlantic .\n\nShe said she has enough water in her house to last 30 days and enough food to last her 100 days. She also has iodine pills to protect herself from radiation and a machete in the event she has to cut her way through the bushes of rural Georgia to make an escape.\n\nInterestingly, the Plan B pills she bought aren't for herself, she said. Rather they're for young women who might need it in case elected Republicans at the state and federal level decide to restrict access to birth control.\n\nSo far, Republicans haven't come out and said they want to ban birth control but they did block a Democrat bill last summer that would have codified a right to contraception .\n\nGittinger isn't the only liberal-minded prepper grabbing Plan B for others.\n\nBuying supplies not just yourself and your family but for the surrounding community is a common sentiment among the more than 4,500 members of the Leftist Preppers subreddit .\n\nIn a post made to the subreddit days after Trump won the presidency , someone asked what items are on the top of people's prepper lists.\n\n'My plan is to prep not just for myself but others. I'm buying Plan B. We're looking into what other kinds of birth control you can buy in bulk. This is not necessary for my family but if it ceases to exist we want to have it available for others,' one person replied.\n\nAnother person wrote: 'I loaded up on plan b. Not for myself, I am beyond those concerns, but for the young women in my life that might need it.'\n\nWelcome to MAGAland: White House insiders reveal what's really going on behind the scenes in the new Trump administration. Listen wherever you get your podcasts\n\nSome people on the subreddit recommended people make sure their passport is up to date in case they feel its necessary to leave the country\n\nOthers talked about buying fluoride toothpaste and getting all their necessary immunizations for themselves and their kids in advance of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. possibly become the Health Secretary\n\nOther things on people's lists were over-the-counter medicines, soil, seeds and bug repellant.\n\nSome recommended people make sure their passport is up to date in case they feel its necessary to leave the country.\n\nThere was also talk about buying fluoride toothpaste and getting all their necessary immunizations for themselves and their kids.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has cast doubt on putting fluoride in drinking water to keep people's teeth healthy and the effectiveness of various vaccines including the covid jab.\n\nZoe Higgins, one of the moderators of the subreddit, told The Atlantic that she has a month's worth of freeze-dried spaghetti, beef stroganoff, chicken alfredo, and other meals.\n\nIf that's not enough, she also has flashlights, headlamps, waterproof matches, fire starters, water-purification tablets, camping stoves and propane tanks.\n\nGenevra Hsu, another subreddit moderator, said she actually began prepping in 2013 after learning survivalist techniques from her father.\n\nNow living in Virginia, Hsu has six months of meals stowed away and does her own pressure-canning, dehydrating, and freezing. Her social media profiles show her dehydrating and freezing powdered eggs in case of a bird flu epidemic.\n\nZoe Higgins, who goes by 'Leftist Prepper' on TikTok, made her own guide on what it takes to be prepared for a Trump presidency\n\nOn TikTok, Higgins goes by 'Leftist Prepper' and she made her own guide on what she believes it takes to truly be prepared for a Trump presidency.\n\nHiggins said it's important to be personally prepared with your own stockpile. For her, that's especially true because she lives in New Orleans, a city that is often in the path of hurricanes, most notably Katrina in 2005.\n\nBut like many of her fellow Redditors have said, she suggested that survival in a disaster scenario is much more likely when you connect with people in your town or neighborhood.\n\nShe recommended people join a mutual aid group wherever they live and said if their neighborhood doesn't have one, 'I would be starting one.'\n\nNafeez Ahmed, an author who has written about global crises, told the Guardian in 2016 that surviving after society collapses isn't as simple as living off cans of beans.\n\n'There's a survivalist response which is \"I'm going to hide away all by myself,\"' Ahmed said. 'You're probably not going to survive like that - you have to cooperate with other people.'\n\n'The more people who band together, the more likely you are to be able to rebuild something like a society. So I'd say share those baked beans,' he added.\n\nMichael Mills, a senior lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom, studies doomsday prepping and estimated that about 15 percent of preppers in the US are liberals.\n\nHe added that there are likely millions of preppers all with a range of different political beliefs.\n\nMichael Mills, a senior lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom, says preppers of all political bents 'lack of faith in political progress' and have 'skepticism towards political leadership'\n\nThe thing that drives all preppers, left or right, to conserve resources and have backup plans is a lack of trust in government, according to Mills.\n\n'There's this common thread that I think unites preppers of all political persuasions, which is a lack of faith in political progress as a whole and a skepticism towards political leadership,' he said.\n\nAmericans on both sides of the political aisle have record low trust in Congress , big business and the presidency. What liberal and conservative preppers appear disagree on are what the true threats to society are.\n\nLiberals are worried about climate change causing more natural disasters, while conservatives are more often fretting about the left running amok.\n\nMikhail Merkurieff , a prepper who's made a living selling survival gear he invents told Business Insider in 2019: 'We kind of joke, like, man, we have to get a Democrat back in the White House and sales will go back up.'\n\nMikhail Merkurieff, pictured, shows off one of his survival products, which is billed as a heated survival shelter\n\nThe most concrete worries prep-happy liberals have about Trump are economic in nature and largely center on his plans to dramatically increase tariffs.\n\nTrump has proposed a widespread 10 percent tariff on global imports to raise government revenue and has threatened China with tariffs as high as 60 percent if they don't do more to reduce the amount of fentanyl flowing into the United States through Mexico.\n\nSince tariffs increase the price of imports, many have rushed to buy consumer goods that typically come from outside the country or have components that are assembled or sourced in foreign countries.\n\nThese include vehicles, auto parts, technology and appliances. Higgins said she recently bought a new car out of an abundance of caution.\n\nA December survey of 2000 Americans from creditcards.com found that a third of people were buying more because they feared tariffs.\n\n'Welcome to MAGAland: Trump's Second 100 Days' is the new politics podcast bringing you the latest news and gossip from Trump insiders.

      "text": "Shocking moment California liberals scream 'Nazi' and 'fascist' at GOP Rep. during town hall\n\nBy GERMANIA RODRIGUEZ POLEO, CHIEF U.S. REPORTER\n\nPublished: 16:04 EDT, 4 March 2025 | Updated: 16:09 EDT, 4 March 2025\n\n49\n\nView comments\n\nA Republican congressman was shouted down as a 'Nazi' and 'fascist' by his constituents at a town hall in southern California .\n\nRep. Jay Obernolte, who represents the Big Bear Lake area in DC , was mercilessly heckled by the overflowing crowd at the Yucca Valley Community Center last month, as reported by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nFootage from the chaotic scene in the conservative district shows the crowd booing Obernolte, 54, as he tried to speak to his furious constituents before he was eventually escorted out by police.\n\nWhen Obernolte told the crowd to call his office when they have problems with their government, a woman shouted back to the tune of the Ghostbusters theme song: 'Who ya gonna call? The fasc-ists!'\n\n'We're not on team liberal or conservative; we're not on team Republican or Democrat . We all play for team United States of America,' Obernolte went on as the boos drowned him out.\n\nObernolte downplayed the hectic situation to the LA Times, saying the meeting was an 'anomaly' and many in the audience 'attended with the intent to disrupt rather than engage in a productive conversation.'\n\nThe LA Times reported there while some speakers identified as Democrats, there were plenty of local residents at the February 22 meeting, with at least one wearing a MAGA hat.\n\nHis constituents were furious about Obernolte's support of president Donald Trump 's mass firings of federal workers through the Government of Government Efficiency (DOGE), per the LA Times.\n\nThey shouted, 'No king! No king! No king!' in reference to Trump.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jay Obernolte was shouted down by his constituents at the Yucca Valley Community Center in southern California\n\nThe lawmaker was escorted out of the event by police after he was called a fascist by furious attendants of the community meeting\n\nObernolte defended DOGE to the crowd, saying: 'I am very glad someone is looking at all of the waste...'\n\nBut the lawmaker's pleas were drowned out by boos and chants of 'No more Musk!' and 'Do your job!'\n\n'Your surrendering to billionaires, you coward!' shouted someone in the crowd.\n\n'The American people voted for change in November, and change is what they're getting' Obernolte added.\n\nObernolte did say he disagreed with DOGE's cuts at Joshua Tree, stating they would 'devastate our communities.'\n\nWhen he promised there would be no cuts to benefits like Social Security and Medicare, the crowd called him a liar.\n\nAs Politico noted, DOGE cuts have also sparked protests at the town halls of Wisconsin rep. Glenn Grothman and Oregon rep. Cliff Bentz, among others.\n\nObernolte told the outlet that despite the protests, he is not wavering in his support of DOGE.\n\n'It's unfortunate that the other party's chosen to turn this into a political stunt,' he said.\n\nThe protests come as Democrats on the House Oversight Committee are introducing a pair of resolutions demanding the Trump administration turn over documents and information about billionaire adviser Musk's potential conflicts of interest and the firings of federal workers, The Associated Press has learned.\n\nHis constituents were furious about Obernolte's support of president Trump and Elon Musk's mass firings of federal workers through DOGE. Trump is seen with Elon Musk at the Oval Office\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nIt's the most aggressive move yet by Democrats trying to confront Trump's actions. The top Democrat on the panel, Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia, and Rep. Rep. Kweisi Mfume of Maryland are leading the effort as the party mounts a resistance against the Trump-Musk dismantling of government.\n\nDemocrats are deepening their opposition to the Trump administration's actions, particularly those of DOGE, which is blazing through the federal government, slashing jobs and programs in search of waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nThousands of federal government employees have been shown the door in the first months of Trump's administration as the White House and DOGE fire both new and career workers, tell agency leaders to plan for \"large-scale reductions in force\" and freeze trillions of dollars in federal grant funds.\n\nIt is affecting more than just the national capital region, home to about 20 percent of the 2.4 million members of the civilian federal workforce, which does not include military personnel and postal workers. More than 80 percent of that workforce lives outside the Washington area.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Those two astronauts who were up in space for 9 months, they must be like, \"Wait the liberals hate Tesla now?\".\n\n'It's like drag queens attacking wigs. Trump's trying to defend his boy, last week he was selling Teslas on the White House lawn.\n\n'This week the Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was imploring Americans to buy a Tesla.\n\n'People please, the richest man in the world is hurting, give him what you can. $5, $10, even a dollar to put a smile on an oligarch's face.'\n\nIn closing, Maher poked fun at latest figures showing that approval rating for the Democrats was at an all time low.\n\nMaher compared the burning of Tesla vehicles to 'drag queens attacking wigs' on his Friday night show\n\nBurned Teslas are shown at a Tesla Collision Center after an individual used incendiary devices to set several vehicles on fire in Las Vegas earlier this week\n\nHe added: 'People say the Democrats are in the wilderness, that's not the wilderness that's getting eaten by a bear.'\n\nHis remarks come after it was revealed that Maher will meet with President Trump after a decades-long feud at the White House.\n\nMaher has long insulted the president over his entry into politics, with Trump filing a lawsuit in 2013 after Maher made comments that his father was an orangutan.\n\nIt appears that Kid Rock, a mutual acquaintance of the two, brokered the peace talks between the two.\n\nMaher told fellow comic Andrew Schultz on an episode of his podcast Club Random set to debut Sunday that the meeting is happening.\n\n'Kid Rock was here a couple of weeks ago, and he said, \"I want you to meet Trump .\"\n\nHe said, \"I'm gonna take you to the White House.\" So, now we're gonna do that,' Maher said.\n\nThe 54-year-old musician - real name Bob Ritchie - announced he was going to take Maher, a longtime friend, for a visit on Glenn Beck's show recently.\n\n'I'm actually going to try and unite this country, and I'm starting at the end of the month I'm taking Bill Maher to the White House for dinner,' he said.\n\nMaher will meet with President Trump after a decades-long feud at the White House\n\nMaher and Trump are seen here attending the 56th Emmy Awards in September 2004 in LA\n\nTrump speaks in front of a Tesla Model S with Elon Musk outside of the White House last week\n\nAttacks on Tesla vehicles, dealerships and charging stations have been happening across the nation .\n\nProtests have also been staged at dealerships in direct response to Musk's involvement with President Trump and his running of DOGE.\n\nLast weekend, roughly 250 activists gathered outside a showroom in New York City , holding anti-Musk placards.\n\nThere have also been over a dozen acts of vandalism against Tesla vehicles, dealerships and charging stations since Trump 's inauguration.\n\nMost recently, a row of Tesla cars were seen exploding into flames after an arson attack on a dealership in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Tuesday morning .\n\nPolice said the unknown suspect, who was seen at the scene in all black, managed to completely burn out two of the cars while damaging three others.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement on Thursday that those attacking the vehicles and dealerships will face the 'full force of the law' .\n\nShe said: 'Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.'\n\nRecent attacks have been reported in Seattle, Kansas City, Las Vegas and other cities across the country.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

LEPORE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 18:35 EDT, 6 February 2025 | Updated: 09:06 EDT, 9 February 2025\n\n556\n\nView comments\n\nCNN 'black sheep' Scott Jennings reminded the network's stable of liberals why Elon Musk has been brought in to clean up the swamp for Donald Trump .\n\nMusk has been a controversial figure since joining team Trump and being named the chairman of the Department of Government Efficiency , aka DOGE.\n\nDemocrats have slammed Musk for attempting to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development and other government programs.\n\nJennings, the left-leaning network's most prominent conservative voice , defended Musk on Wednesday night, responding specifically to The View co-host and anti-Trump conservative Alyssa Farah Griffin.\n\n'The American people elected Donald Trump because they thought he was going to be a sledgehammer against this government and against the out-of-control bureaucracy,' Jennings said.\n\nDOGE has long been pitched as Musk's attempt to eliminate billions of dollars in excess Washington spending.\n\n'Elon Musk is the instrument of the destruction,' Jennings added, describing Musk's efforts as 'radical transparency.'\n\nThe Tesla , SpaceX and X CEO is an effort at making government transparent to taxpayers and therefor can't be faulted.\n\nCNN 'black sheep' Scott Jennings was at it again, reminding the network's stable of liberals why Elon Musk has been brought in to clean up the swamp for Donald Trump\n\nMusk has been a controversial figure since joining team Trump and being named the chairman of the Department of Government Efficiency, aka DOGE\n\n'Did you know your money's going here? Did you know your money's going there?' Jennings said of what Musk is doing. 'It's all upside for Trump.'\n\nMusk's role with the Department of Government Efficiency is primarily to reduce unnecessary government spending .\n\n'DOGE is saving the Federal Government approx. $1 billion/day, mostly from stopping the hiring of people into unnecessary positions, deletion of DEI and stopping improper payments to foreign organizations, all consistent with the President's Executive Orders,' DOGE said in a statement.\n\n'A good start, though this number needs to increase to > $3 billion/day.'\n\nMusk's DOGE has hit the ground running much like the rest of the Trump administration in the first week on the job.\n\nMusk's officials are now proposing the deployment of artificial intelligence to upgrade government systems.\n\nJosh Gruenbaum - head of the Federal Acquisition Service at the General Services Administration (GSA) - revealed how they're considering utilizing AI 'in our portfolios.'\n\nThat includes ways to cut down on staff around the country, he said.\n\nJennings, the left-leaning network's most prominent conservative voice, defended Musk on Wednesday night, responding specifically to The View co-host and anti-Trump conservative Alyssa Farah Griffin\n\nElon Musk walks on Capitol Hill on the day of a meeting with Senate Republicans about cutting waste\n\nWe'll be 'cutting redundant business functions and associated staffing,' Gruenbaum said, alluding to the potential of AI taking over already-established jobs.\n\nTrump's DOGE is also offering cushy 'buyout' deals to federal employees in the hopes of cutting back between five and 10 percent of the workforce.\n\nA White House official confirmed to DailyMail.com on Thursday that more than 40,000 federal workers had accepted the offer before the quickly-approaching midnight deadline.\n\nAdditionally, DOGE has set to work removing the Chief Diversity Officers Executive Council website from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.\n\nPresident Trump has been highly vocal about his intention to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion offices across federal government, describing them as 'Marxist.'\n\n'I will end all of the Marxist diversity, equity and inclusion policies across the entire federal government immediately,' Trump said in December.\n\nPrior to Trump reclaiming the White House, the website described its services as the 'principal interagency forum to implement and sustain a national strategy for DEIA across Federal government.'\n\nBut Musk's call to wipe the website from the personnel platform indicates the entire department will be - or has already been - shuttered.\n\nDemocratic Lawmakers address hundreds at the \"Nobody Elected Elon\" rally outside of the Department of The Treasury building\n\nThe department is also looking into stopping production of the penny to save taxpayers money.\n\nIn a post on X, the group pointed out that a penny now costs three cents to make - triple its value.\n\nThat cost taxpayers a whopping $179 million in fiscal year 2023, the post said.\n\nDOGE has been tasked with coming up with recommendations on how to cut federal spending.\n\nIt's unclear if it would advise permanently killing off the penny, or just halting or trimming the penny's production.\n\nMusk's DOGE has been tasked with reducing government expenditure and improving productivity within the public service.\n\nHe claims it can save $1trillion - but that number has already been worked down from the initial $2trillion he promised recently.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

LEPORE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 18:54 EDT, 18 February 2025 | Updated: 20:12 EDT, 18 February 2025\n\n293\n\nView comments\n\nA federal judge denied liberals' last ditch attempt to stop 'First Buddy' Elon Musk from accessing government data in a huge victory for the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe lawsuit against DOGE was filed by 14 states' attorneys general in a coordinated effort to strip the 'First Buddy' of his power as his nascent department gains access to swaths of sensitive data at multiple federal agencies.\n\nWhile U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan found that there are legitimate questions about Musk's authority, she said there isn't evidence of the kind of grave legal harm that would justify a temporary restraining order.\n\nThe state attorneys general argued that Musk is wielding the kind of power that the Constitution says can only be held by those who are elected or confirmed by the Senate .\n\nThe Trump administration, for its part, has maintained that layoffs are coming from agency heads, and asserted that despite his public cheering of the effort Musk isn't directly running DOGE's day-to-day operations himself .\n\nDOGE has tapped into computer systems across multiple agencies with the blessing of President Donald Trump , digging into budgets and searching for what he calls waste, fraud and abuse, even as a growing number of lawsuits allege DOGE is violating the law.\n\nChutkan, who was appointed by Barack Obama , recognized the concerns about the 'unpredictable actions' from the group of states, which include New Mexico and Arizona .\n\n'DOGE's unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion,' she wrote.\n\nA federal judge appointed by Barack Obama denied liberals' final attempt to stop 'First Buddy' Elon Musk from accessing government data in a huge victory for the Department of Government Efficiency\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan found that there are legitimate questions about Musk's authority, but said there isn't evidence of the kind of grave legal harm that would justify a temporary restraining order\n\nChutkan said their questions about Musk's apparent 'unchecked authority' and lack of Congressional oversight for DOGE are legitimate and they may be able to successfully argue them later.\n\nStill, at this point, it remains unclear exactly how DOGE's work will affect the states, and judges can only issue court only issue orders to block specific, immediate harms, she found.\n\nChutkan previously oversaw the now-dismissed criminal election interference case against Trump in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington DC last Thursday, accusing the billionaire of performing tasks that should be well out of his remit.\n\nAs part of the complaint, the group hope Musk will be banned from accessing sensitive information or having the power to make staffing decisions and wipe out entire departments.\n\nThey simultaneously have asked the court to declare that Musk's actions have no legal impact.\n\nIt comes as Musk and his newly formed army of young engineers dismantle federal departments in an effort to cut costs and reduce waste .\n\nMusk's efforts have enraged Democrats and federal employees who have taken to the streets to protest his access and cuts.\n\nProtesters rally outside the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\n\nPresident Trump continues to back Musk's efforts, describing it as a key step in fulfilling his campaign promises.\n\nThe Democratic Attorneys general, however, challenged Musk's authority to act on Trump's behalf.\n\n'We are asking the court to invalidate his directives and actions and to issue a restraining order,' Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a press conference alongside attorneys general from Arizona and New Mexico .\n\nCalifornia , Connecticut , Hawaii , Maryland , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Nevada , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington attorneys general also joined the lawsuit.\n\nNew Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez warned President Trump that he is demonstrating 'weakness' by giving Musk unchecked power.\n\nHe suggested that the President should instead be advancing his agenda through a Republican-controlled Congress .\n\n'Move fast and breaking things may work in Silicon Valley for a tech company,' Torrez said. 'It's not good governance and it's unconstitutional.'\n\nThe group of high-powered Musk critics are now urging the court to identify ways that 'any data obtained through unlawful agency access was used' and remove access that Musk and his team already have.\n\nPresident Trump continues to back Musk's efforts, describing it as a key step in fulfilling his campaign promises\n\nThey also want the court to prevent DOGE from making any more changes to the use of public funds, or government contracts.\n\nMusk's DOGE, along with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), has also been granted sweeping powers to assert greater control over the hiring of any federal employee.\n\nPresident Trump put in place a 90-day hiring freeze when he returned to the White House for his second term.\n\n'The people voted for major government reform and that's what the people are going to get,' Musk said on Tuesday, from the Oval Office. 'They're going to get what they voted for.'\n\nOne the tactics includes ridding departments of employees who are still in their probationary periods - which can last up to two years in some agencies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said that Musk's group had gone from 20 people to as many as 100.\n\n'He's a successful guy,' Trump said about Musk. 'That's why we want him doing this. We don't want an unsuccessful guy doing this.'\n\nThe DOGE team updated their government website Wednesday promising to release publicly available data on Friday of the savings that they had uncovered.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) speaks at a rally with federal workers and supporters as they protest against Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)\n\nThe team of technology experts have been terrifying government employees by entering department buildings and combing through public data looking for potential cuts.\n\nCurrently DOGE has saved the federal government $45.44 billion dollars, according to a tally conducted by doge-tracker.com.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Tuesday ordering federal agencies to coordinate with DOGE to make 'large-scale reductions in force.'\n\n'He's a successful guy,' Trump said about Musk. 'That's why we want him doing this. We don't want an unsuccessful guy doing this.'\n\nThe DOGE team updated their government website Wednesday promising to release publicly available data on Friday of the savings that they had uncovered.\n\nThe team of technology experts have been terrifying government employees by entering department buildings and combing through public data looking for potential cuts.\n\nCurrently DOGE has saved the federal government $45.44 billion dollars, according to a tally conducted by doge-tracker.com.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Tuesday ordering federal agencies to coordinate with DOGE to make 'large-scale reductions in force.'\n\nThe mass layoffs are taking place amid multiple lawsuits to stop DOGE's efforts at reshaping federal agencies.\n\nOn Wednesday, a federal judge lifted the temporary freeze on President Trump's 'buyout' offer to federal workers as the administration looks to shrink the workforce .\n\nA union which represents hundreds of thousands of federal workers and others had sued last week to stop the deferred buyout offer's February 6 deadline.\n\nDOGE estimated between five and 10 percent of government workers would take the offer and that it would save an estimated $100 billion a year.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly expressed satisfaction with the work that Musk and his team are undertaking.\n\n'I want to commend Elon because he's done a fantastic job - he doesn't need this,' Trump said earlier this week.\n\n'He's abused by you people every day. He's found more things than anybody could find. He's got the credibility to do it.\n\n'His group of people, they started off with 12, I call them 12 geniuses. They started off with 12, they went to 20, and 25 and now they're up to almost 100. People are joining to help them. This is a massive fraud that's taken place.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

'I told my friends, this guy is ruthless,' Percy told The Wall Street Journal .\n\nAfter escaping to Canada, he was shocked by the cost of living and lack of access to some of his favorite products, like low-fat Jif peanut butter.\n\n'Everything is just ridiculously expensive here. You go to the supermarket, you're paying four to five dollars for a head of lettuce, or five to six dollars for a carton of eggs,' he said.\n\nAnother former New Yorker, Stephen Shainbart, 61, moved for the 'safe and politically stable' climate but told the outlet he has experienced disdain from Canadians when they learn his nationality.\n\nGoogle searches for 'move to Canada' surged 1,270 percent in the 24 hours after U.S. East Coast polls closed on Election Day\n\nJuan Marcos Percy (picutred), 47, moved to Canada in 2016 because he was fearful during Trump's presidential campaign\n\nHeather Fitz  (pictured) moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, after the 2016 election for the country's progressive politics, but was stunned to experience the freezing cold temperatures\n\n'They feel they can insult the U.S. because it's always so big and powerful and in their face,' he said.\n\nArkansas native Heather Fitz moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, with her then-husband after the 2016 election for the country's progressive politics.\n\nShe was stunned to experience the freezing cold temperatures and 68-mile-an-hour winds that rocked her apartment building during a nor'easter.\n\n'I was like, did we make the right decision?' Fitz said. 'I was googling \"building swaying is this safe.\"'\n\nUltimately, Fitz returned to the United States at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and now lives in Tampa, Florida, where she said, 'The air doesn't hurt my face anymore.'\n\nTrump's first victory promoted former Pennsylvania resident Nathan Sanders, 51, to take an academic job at the University of Toronto.\n\nHe liked that Canada feels less politically polarized but said it is off-putting how similar yet different the two cultures are.\n\n'It's like aliens have abducted you and created a virtual reality based on your memories,' Sanders said.\n\nTrump's first victory promoted former Pennsylvania resident Nathan Sanders (pictured), 51, to take an academic job at the University of Toronto\n\nLucia Lloyd (pictured), 56, made the decision to move to Canada in 2018 after Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court\n\nStephen Shainbart (pictured), 61, moved for the 'safe and political stable' climate, but said he has experienced disdain from Canadians when they learn his nationality\n\n'But the simulation is a little off, and every once in a while, there's a glitch. The money is a different color, and there are pictures of the queen everywhere.'\n\nLucia Lloyd, 56, decided to move to Canada in 2018 after Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, she has noticed more conservative politics are arising in Canada and is fearful of Trump's declaration that the country should become the 51st state.\n\n'That's flowed over the borders,' she said. 'It's very destructive when you can't count on anything being stable or reliable.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\nThe 'Outnumbered' panelists discuss a newly discovered video of former President Barack Obama discussing wasteful government spending and a program similar to DOGE.\n\nNew York Times opinion columnist Ezra Klein said Wednesday liberals need to get upset over the failed promises of the Biden and Obama presidencies.\n\nKlein joined California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's podcast where he talked about his new book with The Atlantic's Derek Thompson, \"Abundance,\" which examines why liberal government isn't delivering and finds it's often their own well-intentioned policies and regulations getting in the way. He said the Obama and Biden administrations suffered from this problem.\n\n\"So much of the political theory of the Biden administration was that if you can show liberal democracy can deliver, you will pull people out of wanting these strongmen who say they're going to burn the whole thing down and give you something out of the ashes,\" Klein said .\n\nHe gave the example of the Biden administration celebrating the $42 billion for rural broadband passed in the 2021 infrastructure bill. But with all the multi-stage processes and red-tape, \"By the end of the administration, of the 56 states and jurisdictions that were trying to apply for the money, three had made it through.\"\n\nNew York Times opinion writer Ezra Klein, right, spoke with California Gov. Gavin Newsom about how some of the most ambitious projects of the Obama administration failed to materialize.\n\nNYT WRITER SAYS DEMS ARE 'GETTING DESTROYED' AS DATA SHOW GEN Z 'MOST CONSERVATIVE' GENERATION IN DECADES\n\n\"If the things don't move fast enough, if they don't get to the people fast enough, it's much harder for liberal democracy to make the case that it delivers,\" he said.\n\nKlein then recalled a conversation he had with former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau about California's high-speed rail effort, which has been in the works for almost two decades with little progress.\n\n\"I was saying that, the stimulus bill under Obama, that had three big headline projects for reinvestment,\" he said. \"It had high-speed rail, it had smart grid, and it had a nationwide system of interoperable health records.\"\n\n\"I remember those days,\" Newsom responded.\n\n\"Yeah. 0-for-3,\" Klein said. \"At some point, we gotta be upset about this, you know?\"\n\nNew York Times opinion columnist Ezra Klein spoke about his new book \"Abundance\" on California Gov. Gavin Newsom's podcast.\n\n\"There is the fundamental disconnect, and you're absolutely right, as it relates to these large-scale audacious projects,\" Newsom agreed.\n\n\"But at least there's a vision,\" he argued. \"At least Obama had a vision. He wanted to be big in big things, he wanted to do big things, and at least progressive states still have a vision.\"\n\n\"I'm all for vision,\" Klein replied. \"My upset - the point of this book, is that I want the things to happen.\"\n\nWhile high-speed rail has been in the works for over 17 years, California Gov. Gavin Newsom praised progressives for having a \"vision.\" (Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images/Daila Pena)\n\n\"I don't want to give anybody credit for a vision that didn't happen,\" Klein added. \"[The failure of] high-speed rail has undermined the public's faith in what can get done.

Tim Walz, D-Minn., recently revealed that he checked the stock daily to give himself a little \"boost\" during the day.\n\n\"On the iPhone, they've got that little stock app. I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day,\" Walz said, referencing Tesla's stock slump as he held up his iPhone during a Wisconsin town hall titled, \"The People vs Musk,\" on Tuesday.\n\nWalz, who called Musk an \"unelected, South African, nepo-baby\" during the event, also encouraged Tesla owners to remove the logo on their car.\n\nELON MUSK IN 'SHOCK' OVER DEM'S ALLEGED 'HATRED AND VIOLENCE,' LAMENTS 'DERANGED' ATTACKS ON TESLA PLANTS\n\nElon Musk is facing mounting attacks in the media as well as from Democrats over his role in the Trump administration. (Screenshot/MSNBC | Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images | Gilbert Flores/Billboard via Getty Images | Tibrina Hobson/Getty Images)\n\nLate-night host Jimmy Kimmel also made jokes about the Tesla stock, as well as the acts of vandalism that have targeted the company's charging stations, dealers and more.\n\n\"Please don't vandalize. Don't ever vandalize Tesla vehicles,\" Kimmel sarcastically told his audience, before pausing and looking into the camera, prompting laughter.\n\nKimmel also said that Tesla's stock was way down, \"almost disastrously so,\" as the audience loudly cheered.\n\nLincoln Project co-founder Rick Wilson published a Substack post headlined, \"Kill Tesla, Save the Country,\" on Wednesday.\n\n\"Tesla is no longer just a car company; it's a bank for fascists, a goose-stepping hedge fund bankrolling the political fever dreams of Elon Musk and his DOGE dreams of controlling the ruins of the American government as he becomes Earth's first trillionaire and then the Emperor of Mars,\" he wrote .\n\nWilson wrote that Musk had a weak spot and encouraged people to \"attack.\"\n\nTESLA VEHICLES, CHARGING STATIONS TARGETED AS PROTESTERS DENOUNCE DOGE, ELON MUSK\n\nMSNBC hosts Michael Steele, Symone Sanders-Townsend and Alicia Menendez laughed while discussing SpaceX's eighth suborbital flight test of its fully integrated Starship megarocket in early March, which ended in an explosion.\n\n\"Well, Elphaba may be defying gravity, but you know who isn't? Elon Musk,\" Menendez said on March 8, as Sanders mimicked the singing of \"Wicked\" character Elphaba, the flying Wicked Witch of the West in the \"Wizard of Oz\" adaptation.\n\nSteele went on to argue that Musk should return to his day job.\n\n\"For Elon, his response to all of this was, 'Rockets are hard.' And Mr. Musk, if they're so hard, why don't you go back to your day job and work that out and leave those of us who do government to do government, because you can't do both,\" Steele said. \"Clearly, you're failing right now at both.\"\n\nJEWISH TESLA OWNER DEMANDS HATE CRIME CHARGES AFTER CYBERTRUCK DEFACED WITH SWASTIKA\n\nMSNBC's Michael Steele, a former RNC chair and staunch Trump critic, routinely criticizes Elon Musk and the president. (Screenshot/MSNBC)\n\nLiberal personalities have also taken shots at Musk's South African roots.\n\n\"But when you have people who don't understand how the United States government works because they are freshly here and not keyed into what's going on inside the government, Elon Musk, out of South Africa,\" MSNBC's Sanders Townsend said during a March 10 conversation on the network.\n\n\"The View\" co-host Joy Behar claimed that Musk was \"pro-apartheid\" and called him a \"foreign agent\" during the show in late February.\n\n\"Elon Musk kisses his butt and strokes his tiny ego or big ego, whatever it is, and he doesn't get to do - he can take a nap,\" Behar said, characterizing Musk's relationship with President Donald Trump, adding, \"while the guy [Musk], who was not born in this country, who was born under apartheid in South Africa, so he has that mentality going on. He was pro-apartheid as I understand it,\" Behar claimed.\n\nShe continued, \"I think this is just perfectly wonderful for Trump. He can take a nap and let this foreigner, foreign agent, you know, an enemy of the United States, do his job.\"\n\nThe co-host of the ABC talk show walked back her claim about Musk later in the program and admitted she didn't really know if he was \"pro-apartheid.\"\n\nCOMEDIAN BILL BURR BASHES 'NERD' ELON MUSK AMID ANTI-DOGE BACKLASH\n\nFormer Democratic lawmaker and frequent MSNBC commentator Claire McCaskill was discussing recent polling that showed the Democratic Party had a low approval rating , and revealed she had a different takeaway than most of the headlines regarding the poll.\n\n\"I did not get the takeaway that seems to be the headline everywhere, that the Democratic Party sucks. I get it that everybody is frustrated about the Democratic Party,\" she said. \"You know what Putin's approval rating was in that poll? Six. Putin's approval rating was six. And this is the guy that he's [Trump is] cozying up to.\"\n\nShe added that Russia's approval rating was just a couple of points higher before comparing both Russia and Putin's approval to Musk's: \"They have the worst approval rating in America. I mean, theirs is even worse than Elon Musk. And that's saying something.\"\n\nAn NBC News poll conducted in March found that just three respondents polled had a positive view of Putin and just six had a positive view of Russia.\n\nElon Musk met with members of the Senate DOGE caucus at the White House. (Getty Images)\n\n\"The Daily Show\" played clips of news reports about the vandalism and violence directed towards Tesla as cheers could be heard from the in-studio audience.\n\n\"Wow. You guys like petty acts of domestic terrorism,\" Comedy Central co-host Jordan Klepper told the crowd on Wednesday, reacting to their applause. \"Wow. Okay, let me just say: nobody should be breaking the law and blowing up Teslas. Especially because if you just wait a few minutes, they'll probably do it by themselves.\"\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, joined a phone call hosted by \"Tesla Takedown,\" a protest effort encouraging people to sell their Tesla and dump their Tesla stock.\n\n\"All I want to see happen on my birthday is to see Elon taken down! Yes!\" she said while praising the group.\n\nElon Musk speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Feb. 20, 2025, in Oxon Hill, Maryland. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rebuked the attacks against Musk during an appearance on Fox News' \"Faulkner Focus.\"\n\n\"Their hatred for Donald Trump fuels everything that they do, and it's the only reason for the Democrat party today. And it's unfortunate for the American public and for Democrat voters who are looking to their party for real leadership, well they should become Republicans,\" she told host Harris Faulkner on Thursday, responding to a question about the comedians taking aim at Musk.\n\n\"Because if you look at what President Trump and Elon Musk are doing, we're making this government more efficient, we are being more accountable to the American taxpayer, we are securing our southern border, producing law and order in this country, securing our homeland. These are basic common sense principles,\" she continued.\n\nSome other liberals, including Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz. , and even country music singer Sheryl Crow have publicly touted getting rid of their Teslas.\n\n\"I feel like a rolling billboard for a man dismantling our government and hurting people. So Tesla, you're fired!\" Kelly wrote on social media. Musk had previously accused Kelly of being a \"traitor\" in response to a post the senator made about supporting Ukraine.\n\n\"Elon Musk kind of turned out to be an a‐‐hole, and I don't want to be driving a car built and designed by an a‐‐hole. So, looking forward to my new ride,\" Kelly said in the video.\n\nKelly posted an update on Sunday, announcing that he had bought a Chevy Tahoe.\n\nCrow posed in a video posted on social media in February and waved goodbye to her Tesla.\n\n\"My parents always said... you are who you hang out with. There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,\" Crow wrote on Instagram . \"Money donated to @npr, which is under threat by President Musk, in hopes that the truth will continue to find its way to those willing to know the truth.\"\n\nFox News' Aubrie Spady contributed to this report.\n\nHanna Panreck is an associate editor at Fox News.\n\nGet all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox\n\nSubscribed\n\nYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2025 FOX News Network, LLC.

That makes clear they knew this all along, but wouldn't say so, because they were protecting the vice president as a way of trying to keep Trump out of the White House. This is yet another blow to the media's plummeting credibility.\n\nBIDEN, HARRIS TEAMS IN LEAK WAR AFTER KAMALA HARRIS' 2024 ELECTION LOSS\n\nPresident Biden, from left, Vice President Kamala Harris, Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough and Maj.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nHere are some of the media post-mortems:\n\nAndrew Sullivan: \"How could an entire left-liberal worldview be more comprehensibly dismantled by reality? And yet, the primary response among my own liberal friends was rage at the electorate. They texted me to insist that Harris lost because of white people - white women , in particular.\"\n\nMaureen Dowd: \"Some Democrats are finally waking up and realizing that woke is broke...\n\n\"Kamala, a Democratic lawmaker told me, made the 'colossal mistake' of running a billion-dollar campaign with celebrities like Beyoncé when many of the struggling working-class voters she wanted couldn't even afford a ticket to a Beyoncé concert, much less a down payment on a home.\"\n\nNellie Bowles, the Free Press, said Harris \"made me furious, because she's a good and fine person who ran a truly terrible campaign. It was a campaign that exemplified all of the delusions of the modern Democrats: that you never need to say what you stand for (because people should just assume you know what's best for them), that you should never answer hard questions or appear with questionable figures, and that the only issue any American woman should care about is abortion...\n\n\"The real villain of this story is Zombie Biden and his corrupt family, who the media treated like heroes the whole way through.\"\n\nDavid Brooks: \"There will be some on the left who will say Trump won because of the inherent racism, sexism and authoritarianism of the American people. Apparently, those people love losing and want to do it again and again and again...\n\n\"Can the party of the universities, the affluent suburbs and the hipster urban cores do this [disrupt the Republicans]? Well, Donald Trump hijacked a corporate party, which hardly seemed like a vehicle for proletarian revolt, and did exactly that. Those of us who condescend to Trump should feel humbled - he did something none of us could do.\"\n\nPolitico: \"How can Harris's defenders grumble about being dragged down by Biden when she could not find one substantive policy issue on which to break from the unpopular incumbent? She waited three months, blurted out on 'The View' that she couldn't think of any difference with Biden.\"\n\nNational Review: \"She was a lousy candidate with an even lousier message, if you can call it that. The only thing she had to do was sell herself, and she couldn't manage even this fundamental task.\"\n\nCOLUMNIST CALLS OUT KAMALA HARRIS FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO ANSWER CRITICAL QUESTION ON 'THE VIEW'\n\nWell, you get the idea.\n\nIn a 107-day campaign, Harris couldn't convince enough Americans that she was authentic, that she could be commander-in-chief, or that she had abandoned the far-left policies (such as legalizing border crossings and backing inmate trans surgeries) of her last campaign. She foolishly hid from the press for a month, fostering the impression that she couldn't go off script.\n\nNow just about everyone - except those blaming her loss on racism and sexism - is saying what I've been saying for three months. Harris never should have picked Tim Walz , who did nothing for the ticket. The trans issue hurt her and she never picked an issue, that or something else, to separate from the left wing of her party. She worried too much about hurting Joe's feelings.\n\nThe VP tried to focus on kitchen-table economics, such as with her price-gouging plan. But despite low inflation and unemployment right now, many Americans still felt they were paying higher grocery prices and liked Trump's economic record better than Biden's.\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is comforted by second gentleman Doug Emhoff, as Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris delivers remarks, conceding 2024 U.S. presidential election to President-elect Donald Trump, at Howard University in Washington on November 6, 2024. (REUTERS/Mike Blake)\n\nIt may well be there's nothing Harris could have done to stop the Trump juggernaut, given his hijacking of working class and minority voters.\n\nNow the president-elect is moving quickly to tap his top appointees, having immediately named campaign manager Susie Wiles as his chief of staff - the first woman ever to hold the job.\n\nTom Homan, who was ICE director in Trump's first term, will be the border czar, not a big surprise. Homan will be in charge of the mass deportation program, and when asked if there was a way to avoid separating families, as happened last time, he said sure - deport them all together.\n\nStephen Miller, who ran the hard-line immigration policy in the first term, is expected to be named deputy chief of staff - a promotion, first reported yesterday by CNN, that probably doesn't convey the clout he'll have as a trusted member of Trump's inner circle.\n\nTRUMP WILL LEAVE THE WH WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST APPROVAL RATINGS OF ANY MODERN PRESIDENT, LARA TRUMP PREDICTS\n\nI had been told days ago that Elise Stefanik, a GOP congresswoman from upstate New York, would go into the administration. And yesterday, Trump tapped her to be U.N. ambassador. She has experience in the George W. Bush White House.\n\nThen there are insiders who are the subject of speculation. Howard  Lutnick, a Wall Street CEO, is being touted by some as a possible Treasury secretary, but has his hands full as a co-chair of the transition. Late yesterday, Trump chose former Long Island congressman Lee Zeldin to run the EPA. He's a mainstream conservative who has crusaded against excessive environmental regulations and gotten a lifetime score of 14% from the League of Conservation Voters. The choice of Zeldin was first reported by the New York Post, and he told Fox News that the administration will \"roll back regulations\" that are causing businesses to \"struggle\" and are \"forcing\" them to move overseas.\n\nAfter that, he tapped Florida GOP congressman Mike Waltz as White House national security adviser, which doesn't require Senate confirmation. As the Wall Street Journal first reported, he's a China hawk and Ukraine skeptic. \"Stopping Russia before it draws NATO and therefore the U.S. into war is the right thing to do,\" Waltz wrote. \"But the burden cannot continue to be solely on the shoulders of the American people, especially while Western Europe gets a pass.\" (Trump has now reduced by two the House Republicans' expected small margin.)\n\nOh, and Politico says some Dems are already jockeying for 2028 (Josh Shapiro and Gavin Newsom) or being talked about (Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear). Already? Can't we get a break?\n\nSo my takeaway is that for all the media chatter about a lack of guardrails, Trump is so far picking serious people with serious experience. (Wiles hasn't worked in Washington since the Reagan years, but her role is different.) They are, of course, also loyalists who will do his bidding.\n\nThen-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024, in Mint Hill, N.C. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nRFK Jr. will get a big title, but it's not clear whether Trump will follow his far-out advice on vaccines and fluoride.\n\nAnd Elon Musk will be in charge of just about everything, and the world's richest man has deluged X with hundreds of pro-Trump posts (and some high-profile liberals are bailing).\n\nBut the most striking moment was Trump's post saying Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo would not be joining the administration - not that anyone was expecting they would be.\n\nIn his posting, the president-elect said he enjoyed working with both of them and thanked them for their service.\n\nMy reaction was: Did somebody steal Trump's phone? The words idiot and moron did not appear.\n\nMaybe this is a new tone from an incoming president who finally feels vindicated. We'll see how long it lasts.\n\nHoward Kurtz is the host of FOX News Channel's MediaBuzz (Sundays 11 AM-12PM/ET).

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\n'The View' co-hosts Sunny Hostin and Alyssa Farah Griffin sparred over whether racism or sexism hurt Kamala Harris in her loss to President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nA new book aims to explain why White liberals and White conservatives often disagree on what is considered \"racist,\" or \"sexist\" and explains how both sides can better address these issues in society.\n\nIn \"Is it Racist? Is it Sexist?: Why Red and Blue White People Disagree, and How to Decide in the Gray Areas,\" sociologists Jessi Streib and Betsy Leondar-Wright interviewed dozens of White voters to see how they make judgment calls on these hot-button issues.\n\nParticipants were presented with real and hypothetical scenarios and asked to judge whether the situation or person was \"racist\" or \"sexist.\"\n\nHypothetical examples in the book include a cartoon showing a male patient lying in a hospital bed and addressing the female doctor who enters his room as \"nurse,\" and a White police officer shooting a Black teen who was holding up his cell phone, with the officer claiming he thought it was a gun.\n\nLIBERAL PUNDIT TELLS CNN 'WHITE FOLKS' SHOULD FACE 'ACCOUNTABILITY' FOR NOT 'SAVING DEMOCRACY' IF HARRIS LOSES\n\nA participant holding a Black Lives Matter sign at the protest. A coalition of activists and organizations led by activist, poet, and organizer Selu gathered across New York City in 2020. (Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nThe authors also ask participants to judge if real-life incidents were racist, such as when President Trump told the NFL in 2017 to \"get that son of a b---- off the field,\" referring to NFL players who were kneeling in protest of the National Anthem, following the example of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick .\n\nThe authors recruited 127 people, between the ages of 35-59, from various social classes and regions of the country to participate in their research for the book. They posted digital flyers in non-political online groups, inviting people to participate in a general survey about American beliefs. The participants were paid a small price for a 2-hour interview and did not know the topic of the survey beforehand.\n\nCo-author Betsy Leondar-Wright told Fox News Digital that she and Streib were inspired to write the book during the first Trump term , as backlash to the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements grew. As sociologists, they wanted to learn why there was a growing partisan divide among White voters on these issues.\n\nThrough their interviews, they determined that people fell into one of two broad categories: the \"acquitters\" and the \"convictors.\"\n\nNY TIMES ADVICE COLUMN ANSWERS WHETHER DATING WOMEN OF COLOR CAN ADVANCE 'ANTIRACISM'\n\nCriticalRace.org, which monitors CRT curricula and training in higher education, has cataloged over 700 institutions of higher education to examine DEI activities on campus. (iStock)\n\nAcquitters take accusations about racism and sexism on a case-by-case basis and examine the evidence through an \"investigative\" method. They are open to exploring alternative explanations before tending to find the person accused of racism or sexism, innocent. Acquitters tend to be conservative.\n\nAlternatively, convictors are people who notice patterns in society and analyze situations involving race and sex through an \"algorithmic\" method. These people tend to side with the accuser and find the person accused, guilty. Convictors tend to be liberal.\n\nLeondar-Wright said both sides could learn from each other on how to better tackle these topics.\n\nShe argued that acquitters need to recognize the patterns of racial disparity within society that can be seen in health care, housing, criminal justice, and K-12 education, and the patterns of gender disparity in pay, treatment by religious dominations and family responsibilities.\n\nBut the convictors could learn from the acquitters' investigative method as well. Convictors can make wrong judgment calls when they fail to ask questions, the author argued.\n\nACTRESS SLAMS 'FICKLE' #METOO MOVEMENT, CALLS OUT HOLLYWOOD FOR HAVING 'NO MORAL BACKBONE'\n\nWhether it's at family gatherings, on social media, or in the workplace, we're faced with these judgment calls all the time, author Betsy Leondar-Wright said, so it's important to examine these issues carefully and thoughtfully. (iStock)\n\nThe authors recommend adopting a \"surveyor\" approach, instead. This means not automatically judging whether someone is racist or sexist based off of one incident, but looking for patterns of behavior, before making a judgment call.\n\nLeondar-Wright said everyone will be confronted with these scenarios at one point or another, so both convictors and acquitters should respectfully listen to the other side and not presume the worst about people they disagree with.\n\nShe said her conversations with acquitters in the book opened her eyes to biases she held towards people she disagrees with, politically.\n\nBecause she identifies as a \"convictor,\" Leondar-Wright said it was \"really surprising\" how often even the most conservative people spoke up and took action against racism or sexism in their own lives.\n\nThe author recounted how one conservative woman named Alice said she took in and raised her Black friend's daughter after her friend went to prison. When Alice's mother showed racism toward the girl, Alice cut off her mother in favor of her foster daughter's well-being.\n\nWhite voters came to hold more partisan views on racism during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement, the authors say.\n\nLeondar-Wright said she wouldn't have expected someone with Alice's beliefs to take such a strong stand against racism. She found this conversation and others, \"encouraging.\"\n\n\"I do think there's a lot of racism and racial inequality in our society and a lot of gender inequality. And so I'd like to help move people in the direction of seeing those patterns, those disparities,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"I ended up a lot less hopeless about how possible that is than I was when I started out.\"\n\nKristine Parks is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.

Even though there is still plenty of road to go before the campaign kicks off, the prospective candidates could find it quite difficult to unite the party and appeal to enough of America to win back the presidency, pundits told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\n\"We are in what has been referred to as the 'invisible primary' phase of the election cycle, because it is so early and the public isn't paying attention to these early machinations,\" Len Foxwell, a Maryland-based Democratic strategist, told the DCNF. \"The only ones who are participating in the process at this point are the prospective candidates themselves and a relatively small and insular ecosystem of donors and party activists and elected officials who do this sort of thing, either as a passion or as a profession. It's a very small and limited process right now, but it's definitely happening.\"\n\nRecent polling generally indicates that Democrat voters are by far most eager to see Harris reprise her role as the party's standard-bearer, followed distantly by Buttigieg and Newsom while the rest of the field draws lower levels of support, according to Newsweek. While most Democratic politicos may not be quick to highlight flaws or challenges that could inhibit each candidate, Adolph Mongo, a Michigan-based Democratic commentator and consultant, did not pull any punches.\n\n\"A bunch of losers,\" Mongo told the DCNF in regard to many of the hot names being mentioned in connection to possible 2028 runs. \"I'm looking for someone who's gonna be more realistic, and who's going to be able to not only dish it out, but be able to take it. The Democrats, they ran a spineless 2024 campaign, they let Republicans create the narrative, and they never responded to it.\"\n\n\"Harris made the biggest boo-boo, with the pick from Minnesota, good, nice guy, a good governor. But they needed somebody that's going to be a bulldog that can attract new voters,\" Mongo said, referencing Walz. \"You know, they just dropped the ball on several issues, one on immigration, two on transgender rights. Three, they took their base for granted, black voters, Hispanic voters, they just did everything wrong. And the biggest boo-boo was they knew that the president, two or three years ago, should have just been a one term guy, and they didn't do anything and waited too late ... they might as well have just left him in.\"\n\nBeshear, who was reportedly vetted alongside Whitmer and others as a possible addition to the 2024 Democrat ticket after former President Joe Biden's candidacy imploded, sniped at Newsom Thursday for having right-wing populist firebreather Steve Bannon on his new program in comments that found their way into reports from liberal media outlets.\n\nWalz, another governor with a left-wing record in his state, is also seemingly feeling out the waters for a run of his own by embarking upon a national town hall tour focusing on vulnerable House Republican districts. Notably, Walz's first stop will be in Iowa, which happens to be one of the most important primary battleground states.\n\nFoxwell said he believes each of the names floating around as possible contenders would have a path to victory, and that some Democrats - including Newsom - are reorienting themselves on issues like protecting women's sports and tacking away from hardline positions to potentially broaden their appeal. However, the primary field figures to be \"all over the map\" given the general state of disarray the party is currently in, Foxwell added.\n\n\"Gavin Newsom, for instance, is kind of bucking the the prevalent body of opinion within the Democratic Party establishment on the issue of transgender women playing women's sports, for instance, and Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania is emphasizing cooperation and collaboration on a strategic basis with the White House, so you're seeing some of that,\" Foxwell told the DCNF. \"But I don't think there's going to be a singular approach within this primary field, because I don't think there's a singular approach in the Democratic Party for how we move forward. I think that we, as a party, are still all over the map on what happened in 2024 and how we should position ourselves at the approach of 2028. I think you're going to see that uncertainty and lack of cohesiveness of opinion in the presidential primary fields.\"\n\nNewsom recently launched a podcast program in which he frequently hosts right-of-center guests to discuss life and politics, making waves in an early March episode with Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk in which Newsom said that allowing biological men to compete in women's sports - something that most elected Democrats support and defend vigorously - is indeed \"deeply unfair.\" It remains to be seen whether Newsom's viral comments about that unfairness will stick with the voting public given that Newsom's record as California governor is loaded with radical policies on transgender issues, as well as left-wing positions on energy, public health care and more.\n\nMoore could emerge as one candidate to watch to fill the party's \"aspirational lane,\" typified by former President Barack Obama's 2008 run, according to Foxwell, who shared his view that Emmanuel is too closely-linked to an era of American politics that has come and gone. And while Newsom seems to be triangulating to best position himself for 2028, Foxwell personally thinks Newsom would be a bad pick for Democrats because the California governor \"embodies every worst negative stereotype of the modern Democratic Party\" and \"represents the privileged and affluent coastal elite who have virtually no connective tissue to working-class men and women in the battleground states who ultimately determine the outcome of presidential elections.\"\n\nButtigieg, for his part, recently opted against running for governor or senate in Michigan in the 2026 cycle, fueling speculation that he is sizing up 2028 after he came up well short in the 2020 Democrat primaries. However, Buttigieg's highest level of public service was as a member of the highly-unpopular Biden administration, and veteran political journalist Mark Halperin speculated Thursday that Buttigieg's short stature and sexual orientation may hurt him with voters.\n\nJon McHenry, vice president of North Star Opinion Research and a GOP polling analyst, said there's one participant in the \"invisible primary\" that currently stands out to him as most capable of taking down a Republican in a general election.\n\n\"I think Josh Shapiro is the Democrat most likely to beat a Republican in 2028,\" McHenry told the DCNF. \"The way he's governed in Pennsylvania, which maybe wouldn't win him a nomination on the Republican side, has still been pretty effective. He just seems like he has an ear for essentially the middle of the state of Pennsylvania, which is also essentially an ear for the middle of the country, in a way that a lot of Democrats don't seem to have. You know, Tim Walz is the perfect example. He's from Minnesota, he looks like your football coach, and he's just as completely out of touch as you can be, whereas Josh Shapiro actually seems like he gets it.\"\n\nThe issue for Shapiro, as McHenry sees it, could be that the very things that would make him a potentially formidable general election opponent may not appeal to Democrat primary voters.\n\n\"You can imagine two, three years down the road in early polling, him against J.D. Vance, or whomever Republicans nominate. I think he's going to be super competitive, but I don't know that he's going to be that competitive in a Democratic primary,\" McHenry told the DCNF. \"In a sense, some of the folks who've already run for federal office have an advantage in running to the primary, because they've already tacked fairly hard to the left to win that primary, and it's just a different consideration. If you're a successful governor, you probably aren't like the crazy left-wing, pro-Hamas crowd on the Democrat side, and frankly, a lot of the successful governors on the Republican side aren't like the MAGA folks.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Hawley Says 'Liberals Are Losing Their Minds' Over Exposing Govt Waste, Calls Out Agency Trump Should Take Down Next\n\n#image_title\n\nRepublican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley described Wednesday on Fox News how \"liberals are losing their minds\" over the Trump administration's exposure of taxpayer dollars being wasted, adding he would like to see the president take down the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) next.\n\nFollowing an X discussion space with Elon Musk on Monday about how the Department of Government Efficiency and President Donald Trump would upend the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Democratic lawmakers began pushing back , saying the move to place USAID under the control of the State Department is illegal. On \"The Ingraham Angle,\" Hawley called out Democrats' panic over the exposure of billions being wasted on international programs, some of which had a high risk of landing in the Taliban's hands and also aiding an organization linked to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n\"They're panicking big time, Laura, because their power base is being threatened. That's what's really going on here. I mean, look at what they're doing over USAID. This is because they've used that as their personal plaything. That includes billions and billions of taxpayer dollars that have gone, yeah, to fund outrageous stuff overseas like trans-affirming projects in Zimbabwe or whatever,\" Hawley said.\n\n\"But also let's not forget to fund their preferred media outlets like Politico and who knows what other left-wing rags have been getting money, federal government money from this agency, and there's been no accountability,\" Hawley added. \"So yes, what's happening is Trump is exposing all of this. He is cutting off the liberal supply chains, as it were, and the liberals are just losing their minds. They're totally losing their minds.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that he would be the USAID's new acting director, telling reporters that taxpayers needed to be assured that \"every dollar we are spending abroad is being spent on something that furthers our national interest\" and added that USAID workers have refused to \"cooperate.\"\n\nHawley went on to call out the IRS, saying that the Democrats' message to voters is how they would \"love to waste\" taxpayer dollars, through their defense of USAID.\n\n\"We need more of it. You mentioned the IRS. I love it. I love Trump's idea to get rid of the Internal Revenue Service. Let's make it the External Revenue Service. Let's start making these agencies work for the American people,\" Hawley said.\n\n\"So here's their message, I guess, Laura, to the American people, which is that 'Yes, we would love to waste your money. We'd like to take all of your money. We don't want to spend it on America. We don't want you to have better jobs. We don't want you to have higher wages. We don't want you to have a secure border. We'd love to go spend it overseas, promoting the left-wing transgender policies. We want to make sure that the trans flag is flying everywhere,'\" Hawley said. \"'We want to make sure that we're pushing every left-wing pro-abortion policy we can. That's what we want to spend your money on, America.'\"\n\nIn an executive order on Jan. 20, Trump halted the freeze on the hiring of federal civilian employees, applying the order throughout the executive branch. Within the order, Trump said that the director of the Office of Management and Budget's \"memorandum shall expire for all executive departments and agencies, with the exception of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\"\n\nA press statement later released by U.S. House Committee on Ways & Means Chairman Jason Smith supported the move, saying that Trump's cease-and-desist order to the IRS \"is a crucial first step to helping middle-class Americans and small businesses living in fear of 87,000 new IRS agents targeting them with new audits and monitoring their personal transactions.\"\n\n\"I hope, Laura, that they run on this in the midterms. I hope they run on this forever. This is exactly what the American people rejected. The Democrats wonder, 'Why are we so unpopular?' That's why you're so unpopular,\" Hawley said.\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screenshot/Fox News/\"The Ingraham Angle\")\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "'Knock It Off': Charlamagne Tells 'Liberals' To Stop 'Acting Like' Hunter Biden Pardon Is A Win For Dems\n\nRadio host Charlamagne Tha God criticized \"liberals\" Tuesday for portraying President Joe Biden's pardon of his son Hunter as a form of Democratic retaliation against Republicans.\n\nFormer Hillary Clinton spokesperson Karen Finney and co-hosts of \"The View\" suggested Monday that the pardon was a response to Republicans, particularly President-elect Donald Trump, allegedly targeting their political rivals. Charlamagne , on \"The Breakfast Club,\" awarded Biden \" Donkey of the Day ,\" and argued that the pardon serves only the president's family and should not be framed as a political victory for Democrats over Republicans.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"I'm not mad Joe Biden pardoned his son. I just wish Democrats would stop being cowards and stand on whatever business they are choosing to stand on, even though this decision is very self-serving,\" Charlamagne said. \"And that's the other thing - some of you liberals are out there spiking the football, acting like this is some sort of lick back.\"\n\n\"No, knock it off. Okay. This doesn't benefit anybody except the Biden family, and it's not a lick back. If you think it's a lick back, that's a false equivalency,\" he continued. \"You lost the election. Trump is in control of all three branches of government. Hunter Biden being pardoned? Nah, it's not the same. That's not a lick back. Get the F out of here.\"\n\nThe pardon followed months of Biden assuring the American public that he would not interfere after a Delaware jury in June convicted Hunter of knowingly possessing a firearm while being addicted to drugs and making false statements on a purchase document. Hunter had also faced nine charges related to his alleged failure to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes and his alleged submission of falsified tax forms, all of which he pleaded guilty to.\n\nBiden's statement announcing the pardon included a claim that his son was \"singled out\" in the legal process due to their relationship, which Charlamagne disputed on Monday. The radio host also asserted Monday that Democrats lack moral superiority over Republicans after the pardon.\n\n\"I just want Democrats to stop acting like they are on this moral high ground politically when they have shown us they're not. You know, whether it's skipping the primary process when Biden had stepped down and things like Biden pardoning his son,\" he said at the time. \"Stop acting like y'all are the pure party and Republicans aren't.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "'Cataclysmic For American Democracy': Liberals Melt Down Over Trump Picking Matt Gaetz For Attorney General\n\nLiberals across the political spectrum are reacting with outrage and disbelief Wednesday to President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Republican Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz as the next Attorney General.\n\nMany say they see this as a dire blow to American democracy, framing Gaetz's nomination as a calculated test of Senate Republicans' loyalty and a signal of Trump's commitment to using the Department of Justice as a tool of political retribution. Critics say that Gaetz lacks both the qualifications and the impartiality essential for the nation's top legal role.\n\nFormer prosecutor Andrew Weissmann called Gaetz's nomination a \"laughing stock on the right,\" accusing Trump of appointing someone who is not only unqualified but emblematic of the \"weaponization\" of government. In an appearance on MSNBC's \"Deadline: White House,\" Weissmann warned of a dystopian scenario reminiscent of 1984, where facts and law hold little weight.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"They are untethered to the facts and maybe also the law. So that shouldn't be surprising, and the other is really this idea that somehow Matt Gaetz is going to be the person who prevents and stops weaponization when he is the exhibit A to weaponization. I mean, we are in pure George Orwell 1984 land, where, you know, they say black is white and we're supposed to believe it,\" Weissmann said.\n\nDemocratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy expressed astonishment and said that even Republican senators reacted with \"jaws dropping to the floor\" when they heard the news. Murphy argued that Gaetz's lack of qualifications is only part of the problem and more concerning is his open support for Trump's past attempts to subvert democratic norms, including his role in defending Trump's actions on January 6.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"The entire credibility of government rests upon the belief that law enforcement is there to protect all of us. That it is an independent entity. It is not just to be used at the political whim of the president. Matt Gaetz is being nominated because he will be and is today a political agent of Donald Trump. The ramifications of this pick, this particular pick, are stunning and potentially cataclysmic for American democracy. I hope that some Senate Republicans will see that,\" Murphy said.\n\nMSNBC co-host Symone Sanders-Townsend echoed these concerns, asserting that Gaetz's nomination is a \"test\" to see if Senate Republicans will blindly follow Trump's choices. She suggested that this move could expose whether key Republicans, such as Senator John Thune, will stand up against Trump's nominees or quietly fall in line.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"Matt Gaetz is also very interesting, again, what are the qualifications if you will, and can these people get through a Senate confirmation process? ... I think this is a test frankly, and it's a test for Senate Republicans to see if Senate Republicans are going to [do,] what is their posture going to be in this new Washington D.C. world order as it relates to Donald Trump,\" Sanders-Townsend said.\n\nTrump announced on TruthSocial his intent to nominate Gaetz as attorney general, praising him as a \"deeply gifted and tenacious attorney\" with a law degree from William & Mary. Trump expressed confidence that Gaetz would address issues of \"Weaponized Government\" and bring crucial reform to the Department of Justice.\n\n\"Matt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William & Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice,\" Trump wrote in the Truth Social post.\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screenshot/MSNBC)\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The three states with the lowest rates of unsheltered homelessness are all blue ones in the Northeast: Vermont, New York and Maine,\" he wrote. \"Liberal Massachusetts has some of the finest public schools in the country, while liberal Washington and Oregon have below-average high school graduation rates.\"\n\nNicholas Kristof:\n\n\"The West Coast's central problem is not so much that it's unserious as that it's infected with an ideological purity that is focused more on intentions than on oversight and outcomes.\" pic.twitter.com/uGrKLPCvWH\n\n- Steve McGuire (@sfmcguire79) June 15, 2024\n\nHe critiqued West Coast liberals' tendency to be \"performative rather than substantive,\" citing Oregon's decision to funnel education dollars into putting free tampons in the boys bathrooms beginning in kindergarten.\n\n\"The inability of progressives, particularly in the Portland metro area, to deal with the nitty-gritty of governing and to get something done is just staggering,\" Democratic Oregon Rep. Earl Blumenauer, whose district includes most of Portland, told the NYT. \"People are much more interested in ideology than in actual results.\"\n\nKristof suggested the problem may be connected to the lack of political competition on the West Coast.\n\n\"Perhaps on the West Coast we have ideological purity because there isn't much political competition,\" he wrote. \"Republicans are irrelevant in much of the Far West, so they can't hold Democrats' feet to the fire - leading Democrats in turn to wander unchecked farther to the left.\"\n\nIn 2023, blue states had the highest rates of homelessness, with Washington, D.C., New York, Vermont and Oregon topping the list, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Jasmine Crockett acknowledged during a Sunday interview that she is prioritizing resisting President Donald Trump over passing legislation.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Democrats want their congressional lawmakers to avoid making compromises with Trump, regardless of whether it obstructs bipartisan advancements, according to a March 16 NBC News poll. \"Lone Star Politics\" host Phil Prazan asked Crockett whether there was any legislation she was \"trying to pass\" and the extent to which her role will be \"offense\" versus \"defense\" against Republicans during this session of Congress. (RELATED: 'Bunch Of Losers': Dems' Emerging 2028 Field May Not Bode Well For Liberals)\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"'Trying to pass.' Uh, no. You know, I should probably be a better politician and tell you, 'Yes, we've got all this amazing legislation that I can absolutely imagine Donald Trump signing into law.' I'm just not gon' lie,\" Crockett said. \"I think that right now, it is about preserving our basics and getting back some of the norms - the norms that make sure that people have food on the table, the norms that make sure that people aren't going through any extra layer of stress when it comes to figuring out education for their kids.\"\n\n\"So right now, I can tell you that, unfortunately, I am not working towards very much that I would consider being the progress train,\" she continued. \"I am working to make sure that I can minimize the regress train right now. And I think- and I hope - that my district appreciates that I am being honest with them.\"\n\nThe NBC News poll and a CNN /SSRS poll published the same day also found Democrats with all-time low popularity ratings of 27% and 29% among voters. At the same time, according to CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten in a Monday segment, voters have even worse perceptions of congressional Democrats than the party generally.\n\n\"Holy Toledo, 'voters' views of the Democrats in Congress:' Among all voters, disapprove 68%,\" Enten said. \"And look at the approved number, just 21%, even lower than the Democratic Party at large. This is the lowest on record for Democrats, according to Quinnipiac University polling.\"\n\nEnten also said that \"the plurality of Democratic voters disapprove of Democrats in Congress at 49%, and just 40% approve,\" describing the numbers as \"horrible\" for the party.\n\nCrockett's approach is not unique to her. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Wednesday that Democrats' role is to lower Trump's numbers in order to mitigate the president's ability to accomplish his agenda.\n\n\"We are fighting on all of the fronts to go after Trump, not have a circular firing squad, which Democrats tend to do, particularly when there's such an enemy as Trump, so that the basic premise that we are going after him on - and [House Minority Leader] Hakeem [Jeffries] and I are working on this very closely together ... is that Trump is taking things away from the middle class, from you, to pay for tax cuts for the rich,\" Schumer said.\n\n\"And we have so many different areas to go after him on. And we're already bringing his numbers down. We'll keep bringing them down more and more and more,\" he continued. \"If, you know, six months from now, his numbers are really low, he'll have not only less popularity, he'll have less authority.

      "text": "UK Parliament Liberals Block National Inquiry Into Migrant Grooming Gangs\n\nThe United Kingdom's Labour Party blocked a Conservative Party amendment that would have forced a nationwide inquiry into the decades-long epidemic of migrant grooming gangs.\n\nThe Conservatives proposed an amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill that would compel the government to launch a national investigation into the grooming gangs that have terrorized the nation for decades, according the House of Commons records. The amendment was voted down by 364 to 111, with Labour and Conservatives voting down party lines.\n\n\"Bang on from Kemi Badenoch - Starmer's argument against an inquiry is that government can't do two things at once - it can't implement previous actions and have an inquiry at the same time - that's just obviously nonsense,\" Niel O'Brien, Conservative party MP, said on X.\n\nThe vote comes days after Jess Phillips, Labour Party member and minister for the Home Office for Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls, blocked an inquiry by the town of Oldham into Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer's conduct while overseeing the prosecution of a migrant grooming gang's sexual abuse of children in the town from 2011 to 2014. The situation came to international attention when billionaire and Donald Trump confidant Elon Musk expressed his discontent with Phillips on X.\n\nBREAKING: Keir Starmer will order his MPs to block a national inquiry into the grooming gangs scandal.\n\nHe may want to sweep it under the rug, but we think the victims deserve justice.\n\nAgree? Sign the petition: https://t.co/W9aNhEgZI2 pic.twitter.com/M0RIM6YrO7\n\n- Conservatives (@Conservatives) January 8, 2025\n\nIn 2014, the town of Rotherham found that at least 1,400 girls were sexually exploited by mostly Pakistani migrants between 1997 and 2013. The Mirror in 2018 revealed that \"up to\" 1,000 underage girls were raped and abused in the town of Telford, starting in the 1980s.

      "text": "Doocy Asks Trump If He's Concerned Canada Would Become Blue State If Added To US\n\nFox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked President Donald Trump Friday if he was concerned about Canada becoming a political haven for Democrats if it were to become America's 51st state.\n\nTrump has floated the idea of annexing Canada as the 51st state of the U.S., stating that the neighboring nation has \"ripped\" off the U.S. with tariffs on lumber, dairy products and other essential imports. The president told Doocy that Canada may not be as liberal as generally believed and expressed optimism that it would become a \"great\" state.\n\n\"You say this in all the talk about Canada becoming the 51st state, they would be a very, very blue state. Very, very big, and very, very blue,\" Doocy said.\n\n\"Yeah, it might be, but you know, you have that artificial line that looks like it was drawn by a ruler. I don't mean a ruler like a king, I mean a ruler like a ruler,\" Trump said. \"This way, and it's just an artificial line that was drawn in the sand, or in the ice. You add that to this country, what a beautiful landmass, the most beautiful landmass anywhere in the world. And it was just cut off for whatever reason, it would be great,\" Trump began.\n\n\"Now, is it liberal? Maybe, but a conservative [Pierre Poilievre], until I got involved, I don't care who wins up there, frankly, I'd probably do better with the liberal than the conservative to tell you the truth, but just a little while ago, before I got involved and totally changed the election which I don't care about, probably it's to our advantage actually. But the conservative was leading against who I call Governor [Justin] Trudeau. The conservative was leading by 35 points, so I don't know about that,\" the president continued.\n\nWATCH:\n\nCanada's new liberal prime minister , Mark Carney, and conservative leader Pierre Poilievre are currently neck-and-neck in the polls, according to CBC News. For the first time in nearly three years, the liberals have a three-in-four chance of winning more seats in Parliament if an election were currently held.\n\nTrump imposed a 25% tariff on Canada and a 50% tariff on Canadian aluminum and steel over its involvement in the illegal immigration crisis and the fentanyl epidemic that has plagued the U.S. He initially intended to place 25% tariffs on Mexico, though he postponed these tariffs until April 2 after speaking with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.\n\nThe president told Fox News' Laura Ingraham Tuesday that Canada is one of the \"nastiest\" nations to negotiate with and said he is being tougher on them than some U.S. adversaries because it is destined to become the next U.S. state.\n\nCarney said he would be prepared to meet with Trump on a \"more comprehensive approach to trade\" if Canadian sovereignty was respected in a March 12 statement.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Byron Donalds Has Message For Democrats, Media Who 'Vilify' Black Conservatives\n\nRepublican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida told Fox News host Trey Gowdy Sunday night that he and other black conservatives are targets of Democrats and liberal media outlets because they \"don't fit the narrative.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump carried 13% of the black vote in 2024, according to CNN's exit poll, compared to 12% in 2020 and 8% in 2016 . Donalds accused Democrats and corporate media outlets of trying to \"vilify\" black conservatives after Gowdy described having a \"front-row seat\" to the hostility towards Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and former Republican Rep. Mia Love of Utah, who recently announced a terminal cancer diagnosis.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"The reason why is because we don't fit the narrative that the media has been trying to sell people in our country, that the Democrat Party is the only home for black people is simply not true, simply not the case,\" Donalds told Gowdy. \"As a matter of fact, black people are actually more conservative than the Democrat Party is. So when you see a Mia Love or you see a Tim Scott or you see myself and so many others come along, they have to vilify us, they have to demonize us.\"\n\nScott , who gave the response to President Joe Biden's 2021 address to Congress, faced racist attacks from liberals that included the \"Uncle Tim\" hashtag campaign on Twitter . Love, a two-term Republican congresswoman from Utah who was the first black woman to represent Utah in Congress, was snubbed along with other Republicans by Ebony magazine in a profile of black women running for Congress in 2018.\n\n\"This is something that we've had to develop over the course of our lives. I got into politics when I was 30,\" Donalds told Gowdy. \"That's when I realized that I was a conservative and that I had to be able to sell that, not just to myself and convince myself, but to convince people of my community to support me. That's why that media has to vilify us and destroy us, but it's not going to work. We are not going to stop.\"\n\nTrump endorsed Donalds Feb. 20 for the 2026 gubernatorial race in Florida, where term-limited Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' seat will be open.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

One where inept bottom feeding lawyers can hide behind a shield of political emotion and you can invent crimes to punish your enemies.\n\nThe other kind of legal fighter will mourn the death of justice in America as we know it.\n\nYou've heard how biased and prejudicial this case has been...\n\nNow that closing arguments have been given, here are three vignettes that capture just how willing democrats are to defile our justice system in their rabid hatred for Trump, the once and future president of the United States.\n\nFirst, Judge Juan Merchan, whose daughter is stuffing her bank account from her dad's get Trump circus, bluntly showed his prejudice when he slapped a gag order on Trump - stripping a sitting candidate for president of his First Amendment right. Meanwhile, Michael Cohen, the prosecution's star witness and a felony liar, was given no gag order - Cohen was allowed to gab all over TikTok and raise money from this charade. And he did. Meanwhile, on the witness stand, Michael Cohen couldn't remember important facts, admitted to stealing from Trump, and conceded Trump never knew about the details of so-called hush money payments in 2018. This was the crux of the prosecution's argument, Cohen was their star witness, and they couldn't prove any of the crimes for which they want to lock Trump up for 136 years.\n\nTheir whole case rests on Michael Cohen, a proven liar, and a bimbo dirty films actress who herself admitted that she never had an affair with Trump to begin with.\n\nSecond, acting Judge Merchan gave the Trump team a perfect launchpad for winning this case on appeal. When Michael Cohen was on the stand, he was allowed to yak to his heart's content about election law - an area of law of which he hasn't the first clue and experts everywhere mocked him for his ignorance. But Cohen sat there and schooled the jury on a very complicated body of law under the federal election commission.\n\nSo, when Trump's attorneys tried to correct Cohen's bumbling misinterpretations about election law by bringing in the former FEC commissioner himself as an expert witness, Judge Merchan wrinkled his nose. Merchan put so many restrictions on the FEC commissioner, the commissioner could not be presented to the jury. Legal professionals on all sides laughed. No matter their politics, it was clear Merchan was stretching the law in order ensure there was prejudice against Trump. Incidentally, under New York rules of evidence, an expert \"cannot be precluded from offering an opinion on an ultimate issue in the case if it is beyond the knowledge of the jury and would help them.\" Merchan's antics will not survive appellate court.\n\nThe third travesty was this: Trump was not judged by a jury of his peers. He was judged by a panel of penniless New York liberals. Not a single person on that jury is a self-made billionaire and former president of the United States. I doubt any of them could afford to fuel Trump's jet for even an hour. I doubt any of them have owned skyscrapers or put together multimillion dollar deals across oceans. A jury of Trump's peers? Fellow billionaires; deal makers; politicians; resort magnates; go and find Trump's actual peers - had this sham trial been tried before a jury of Trump's actual peers... this case would have been laughed out of court. Because a jury of Trump's peers would understand what they're witnessing: a sweaty bureaucrat with a J.D. dancing for his DNC slave masters - forced into manufacturing a 'crime' to fit the man... all in order to save a decrepit Biden from a rising Trump.\n\nThis case backfired big time. But the real casualty is America's trust in our justice system. For that, the Democrats should never be forgiven.\n\nShare this post!\n\nSponsored Ad\n\nAccessibility Tools"

He has been succeeded by Mark Carney. Trudeau Out, Carney In, Canada Swaps One Globalist for Another!- different face , same agenda . Au revoir, petit Trudeau! pic.twitter.com/aY87pS6KL5\n\nIn his victory speech, Carney told cheering supporters that \"Canada never ever will be part of America in any way, shape or form.\"\n\nThe new prime minister said that Canada's tariffs against the United States will remain until the Americans \"show us respect\" and added that Canadians \"are always ready when someone else drops the gloves.\"\n\nCarney said that while \"Donald Trump thinks he can weaken us with his plan to divide and conquer,\" Conservative Official Opposition Leader \"Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered.\"\n\nThe winner received 86% of the vote, or 131,764 votes of the 151,899 that were casted from the almost 400,000 party members who registered to participate in the leadership election.\n\nThe new Liberal leader told party members that they need to be prepared to fight \"the most important election of our lives\" where the \"stakes have never been higher.\"\n\nHe said that Canada is the \"greatest country in the world and now our neighbors want to take us. No way,\" said the new prime minister, while referring to President Donald Trump's previous remarks about annexing Canada to become the \"51 st state.\"\n\nAfter Trump announced the tariffs against Canada in February, Carney said in a statement that \"Canada will not bow down to a bully. We won't stand by as illegal U.S. tariffs hurt our workers and their families. As Canadians, we need to face this challenge as one united team.\"\n\nIn December, outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reportedly approached Carney to serve as Canadian finance minister, which caused the incumbent, Chrystia Freeland, to leave the Cabinet and resign, in which she wrote that she and the prime minister had \"found [themselves] at odds about the best path forward for Canada.\"\n\nA month later Trudeau announced his intention to step down as Liberal leader and prime minister, saying that if he's \"having to fight internal battles, [he] cannot be the best option\" in a general election scheduled to be held on later than October 20 th .\n\nHowever, opposition parties have said they will force an earlier national vote through a no-confidence motion in the House of Commons against the Liberal minority government when Parliament is recalled on March 24 th .\n\nLast Saturday, Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper reported that Carney will call a snap election before March 24 th resumption of Parliament, with voting day on either April 28 th or May 5 th .\n\nMeanwhile, Carney is expected to meet with Trudeau on Monday to go over the transition that will see him sworn into office by Friday.\n\nCanada's Conservative party under their new leader, Pierre Poilievere, have said they are ready for a \"change election,\" said Laura Kurkimaki, who served as deputy national campaign manager for the Conservative Party during the last federal election in 2021.\n\n\"We've had 10 years of a Liberal government, and Canadians are tired of that,\" said Kurkimaki.\n\n\"The next election will be about who is going to make life more affordable for Canadians,\" said Kurkimaki. \"What's going on in the U.S. impacts that, of course, and creates economic uncertainty in Canada.\"\n\nCarney is also known as a major advocate for climate change policies and has repeatedly stated taht you cannot have a stable climate until their are no more \"zero net emissions.\"\n\nCanada's new PM, Mark Carney: \"We can't stabilize climate until we get to ZERO NET emissions\" Good luck, Canadians pic.twitter.com/zlo5qyApuG\n\nDuring an election in Canada, parties face spending limitations. However, the writ is dropped to launch the election period, parties can spend as much as they want on advertising, and the Conservatives raised more than double (about $29 million) last year than the Liberals, at about $11 million.\n\nStay informed!

Because they tend to dominate our media and cultural institutions, white liberals are often shocked to learn that the vast majority of Americans do not agree with them.\n\nDuring the 2020 Democratic primary, for example, Vox was compelled to publish a column explaining \"Why Elizabeth Warren is losing even as white professionals love her.\" It's not a coincidence that Warren was one of the most avid users of the term \"Latinx\" throughout her failed campaign.\n\nFollowing the 2020 general election, in which former president Donald Trump won a larger share of the non-white vote than any Republican candidate since 1960, white liberals responded by blaming Hispanic Republicans for the rise of \"white supremacy.\" Saner individuals, such as Rep. Ruben Gallego (D., Ariz.), responded by imploring his party's (mostly white) leaders to stop \"using the term Latinx.\"\n\n\"When [Latinx] is used I feel someone is taking away some of my culture,\" said Gallego, who has since banned the use of the term in his office. \"Instead of trying to understand my culture they decided to change it to fit their perspective.\"\n\nPublished under: Democratic Party\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Shock Report: Liberals Don't Practice What They Preach!\n\nThe thing that annoys conservatives the most about liberals when it comes to economics isn't so much that they disagree. People disagree all the time about all sorts of things, but disagreement alone doesn't tend to get the blood boiling. No, what annoys conservatives about liberals is the stunning and blatant hypocrisy in virtually every pronouncement that they make.\n\nFor instance, remember when the Obama administration announced it was going to crack down on unpaid internships? Here's a New York Times report from way way back in 2010 on the topic:\n\nMany regulators say that violations are widespread, but that it is unusually hard to mount a major enforcement effort because interns are often afraid to file complaints. Many fear they will become known as troublemakers in their chosen field, endangering their chances with a potential future employer.\n\nThe Labor Department says it is cracking down on firms that fail to pay interns properly and expanding efforts to educate companies, colleges and students on the law regarding internships.\n\nThere are any number of problems with ending unpaid internships, of course-the largest one being that such opportunities for unskilled employees will simply vanish, thus closing off an avenue of entry into a preferred profession for those lacking experience-but liberals don't care about pesky little things like \"unintended consequences.\" What's right is right! And what's right is increasing the minimum wage and paying interns! Except for interns that, um, work at the White House, apparently . They can still be paid zero dollars:\n\nMaurice Pianko, a New York attorney who's led lawsuits on behalf of unpaid interns , said he believes the Obama administration has been strong on worker issues but should consider reevaluating its policy on internships. Having unpaid interns undermines the concept of a meritocracy when only certain applicants can afford to spend a few months without income in one of the most expensive cities in the country, Pianko said. The internships, he noted, already tend to go to the well-connected as it is. ...\n\nAs for choosing to pay the interns, \"It would cost them next to nothing and set a nice precedent,\" Pianko added, noting that interns could be paid minimum wage.\n\nThen there's unionization. We've been told again and again that the cards are stacked against employees, most of whom are abused by their corporate overlords. If only they unionized, they could have a better life! But winning unionization elections via secret ballot is relatively difficult, so the left has pushed for \"card check\" campaigns that would unionize a business once a bare majority of individuals sign cards announcing they want to form a union. Media Matters, for instance, has been pretty insistent on the awesomeness of pro-card-check legislation. Here they are correcting George Will on the topic; here they are defending card check from the Washington Examiner ; here they are slamming Megyn Kelly for daring to point out the problems with card check.\n\nOf course, when Media Matters employees wanted to form a union, the company's big shots decided that card check is okay for manufacturers and grocery store workers but totes terrible for liberal watchdogs:\n\nThe apparent decision by executives at Media Matters for America to oppose the unionization of their staff has left employees at the progressive media watchdog feeling stunned and betrayed, according to a statement from pro-union workers.\n\nMedia Matters management recently declined to recognize the union through the \"card check\" process, instead exercising its right to force a union election under National Labor Relations Board oversight. If an employer wants to keep a workplace union-free, the latter route can give it time to delay the proceedings, bring in union-busting consultants and pressure workers to vote down the union.\n\nAgain: Most conservatives totally agree with David Brock and the other fat cats at Media Matters. They should have the right to demand a secret ballot election! Employees shouldn't be subjected to the intimidation and thuggish tactics that card check campaigns invite. What grates isn't Brock and Co's decision. What grates is the hypocrisy of it all. Nick Denton may have been exaggerating a bit when he said that hypocrisy is the only sin left. But it's certainly the most vexing sin.\n\nConservatives are tired of being preached to about money in politics by politicians and hacks and flacks that swim Scrooge McDuck-style in pools of money provided by environmentalist billionaires and union slush funds. We're sick of being lectured about inequality by explainers living in million-dollar condos and columnists who earn six figures a year lecturing about the dangers of wealth in their spare time. It's getting boring to hear the left whinge about the minimum wage and unpaid internships and the awesomeness of unionization even as it fights tooth and nail against the implementation of any of these things.\n\nIn other words: practice what you preach, bros. And until you do, kindly mind your business.\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Liberals Are Unwittingly Pushing Anti-Semitism, Top Senate Dem Says\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Wednesday that liberals are unwittingly pushing anti-Semitism in the wake of Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks.\n\n\"Anti-Semites are taking advantage of the pro-Palestinian movement to espouse hatred and bigotry towards Jewish people,\" Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor. \"But rather than call out this dangerous behavior for what it is, we see so many of our friends and fellow citizens, particularly young people who yearn for justice, unknowingly aiding and abetting their cause.\"\n\nSchumer, the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in American history, referenced in the speech Americans who excused or celebrated Hamas's Oct. 7 terror attacks on Israel.\n\n\"Many of the people who expressed these sentiments in America aren't neo-Nazis or card-carrying Klan members or Islamist extremists,\" Schumer said. \"They are, in many cases, people that most liberal Jewish Americans felt previously were their ideological fellow travelers. Not long ago, many of us marched together for black and brown lives. We stood against anti-Asian hatred. We protested bigotry against the LGBTQ community. We fought for reproductive justice out of the recognition that injustice against one oppressed group is injustice against all.\"\n\nIt was apparent that, \"in the eyes of some, this principle does not extend to the Jewish people,\" he said.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times after the speech, Schumer, calling himself a progressive, said that he \"had lots of good relationships with all the people who are protesting\" but recognized that \"the Jewish people are anguished.\"\n\n\"I had to say it, because I don't think they know it. I don't think they're of bad will,\" he said of the liberals he was admonishing, according to the Times .\n\nSchumer in his speech derided the use of the phrase \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" which many pro-Palestinian marchers have chanted.\n\n\"Obviously, many of those marching here in the U.S. do not have any evil intent,\" Schumer said, \"but when Jewish people hear chants like, 'From the river to the sea,' a founding slogan of Hamas, a terrorist group that is not shy about their goal to eradicate the Jewish people in Israel and around the globe, we are alarmed.\"\n\nHe added later that he believed there are many who use the slogan \"not because they hate Jewish people but because they support a better future for Palestinians. But there is no question that Hamas and other terrorist organizations have used this slogan to represent their intention to eliminate Jewish people not only from Israel but from every corner of the earth. Given the history of oppression, expulsion, and state violence that is practically embedded in Jewish DNA, can you blame the Jewish people for hearing a violently anti-Semitic message loud and clear any time we hear that chant?\"\n\nDemocrats have been divided over the war between Israel and Hamas. In the days following the Oct. 7 attacks, members of the progressive \"Squad\" criticized American aid to the Jewish state, with Rep. Cori Bush (D., Mo.) calling for a ceasefire. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called those statements \"repugnant.\" Earlier this month, 22 Democrats joined with nearly all House Republicans to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) over her use of the phrase \"From the river to the sea.\"\n\nPublished under: Anti-Semitism , Chuck Schumer , Hamas , Israel\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "The REAL REASON Liberals Are 'Madder Than Hell' About the VA Healthcare Scandal\n\nPresident Obama is \" madder than hell \" about the long-running scandal in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system. He finally addressed the issue publicly on Wednesday. His liberal allies , meanwhile, would also like everyone to know that the scandal is a \"serious problem,\" but perhaps not as troubling as the fact that REPUBLICANS HATE VETERANS.\n\nThe VA scandal looks pretty bad-dozens may have died as a result of excess wait times-so liberals don't really have a choice but to be outraged, even as they insist that Obama, who has been in office for five years now, is in no way responsible.\n\nBecause I love it when liberals write about what's REALLY motivating Republicans/conservatives, here's another reason the VA scandal is incredibly inconvenient for liberals: For years, they've been touting the VA as a model for socialized medicine. And now, they look pretty foolish for doing so.\n\nHere is Paul Krugman, writing in 2006:\n\nAmerican health care is desperately in need of reform. But what form should change take? Are there any useful examples we can turn to for guidance?\n\nWell, I know about a health care system that has been highly successful in containing costs, yet provides excellent care. And the story of this system's success provides a helpful corrective to anti-government ideology. For the government doesn't just pay the bills in this system -- it runs the hospitals and clinics.\n\nNo, I'm not talking about some faraway country. The system in question is our very own Veterans Health Administration, whose success story is one of the best-kept secrets in the American policy debate.\n\nHere is Krugman again, in 2011:\n\nWhat Mr. Romney and everyone else should know is that the [Veterans Health Administration] is a huge policy success story, which offers important lessons for future health reform. ...\n\nAnd yes, this is \"socialized medicine\" - although some private systems, like Kaiser Permanente, share many of the V.H.A.'s virtues. But it works - and suggests what it will take to solve the troubles of U.S. health care more broadly.\n\nThis argument has been fairly popular in liberal circles for years. Phillip Longman has written extensively about how great the VA healthcare system is and why it should serve as a model for broader healthcare reform.\n\nIn 2009, wonkstar Ezra Klein wrote that expanding the VA healthcare system to non-veterans was \"one of my favorite ideas.\"\n\nAs recently as September 2013, organizations that support government-run healthcare, such as Physicians for a National Health Program, were praising the VA healthcare as an example of a single-payer system that provides \"better care for more people at far less cost.\"\n\nWe are constantly told by liberals that isolated disasters don't speak to the efficacy of Big Government writ large. As The New Republic 's Brian Beutler writes , devoted liberals shouldn't allow the VA scandal to \"shake their belief in a fallible government's ability to do big, important things.\"\n\nHow's that going ?\n\nUPDATE : Here is Think Progress getting in on the action. In an October 2013 post \"attacking\" Ted Cruz for supporting healthcare for veterans but not supporting Obamacare, Igor Volsky writes:\n\nSince undergoing major reforms during the Clinton administration, the fully integrated structure of government doctors and hospitals in the Veterans Health Administration provides veterans with benefits that are the envy of the rest of the health care system . A study by the RAND Corporation found that \"VA patients were more likely to receive recommended care\" and \"received consistently better care across the board, including screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow up.\" [emphasis added]\n\nPublished under: Barack Obama , Democratic Party , Health Care , Obama Administration , Veterans Affairs\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Analysis: What If Woke Liberals Didn't Get To Label Everything?\n\nIt goes without saying: The mainstream media is run by liberal activists. This ideological bias manifests itself in several ways, including the words journalists are allowed to use when discussing controversial issues.\n\nFor example, the New York Times might publish an article about how \"a group of anti-fascist uterus-bearing individuals deployed Molotov cocktails to peacefully express their grievances over Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' law, which critics say could prevent access to gender-affirming care and reproductive freedom for undocumented Latinx immigrants, substance-affected unhoused citizens with prior justice system involvement, and full-figured sex entrepreneurs.\"\n\nThe story would read a lot differently if it wasn't written, edited, and published by liberal activists and members of the cultural elite who are constantly trying to impose their \"correct\" opinions on the general public. The woke words and phrases used in media reports would make a lot more sense to the average American if these people weren't in charge-if journalists were forced to abide by the Washington Free Beacon Alternative Style Guide for Reporting on Issues of Controversy (ASGRIC):\n\n• Undocumented immigrant → Foreign-born fugitive from justice\n\n• Gender-affirming care for minors → Child abuse\n\n• LGBTQQIP2SAA+ rights → Gay rights\n\n• Drag Queen → Gender appropriator\n\n• Abortion → Extrajudicial fetal assassination, anti-life health care\n\n• Death penalty → Justice affirming care\n\n• Assault rifle → Freedom friend, justice dispenser\n\n• Racially inclusive → Racially obsessed\n\n• Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion → Six-figure consulting fees\n\n• Black Lives Matter → Scam PAC\n\n• Pro-Palestinian activist → Jew hater\n\n• Teachers' unions → Anti-child activists\n\n• Tax cuts → Restorative justice\n\n• Democracy dies in darkness → Democracy thrives on Jennifer Rubin columns\n\n• War on Women → Kinetic military action against individuals with an active uterus\n\n• #MeToo era → Brief period of anti-male activism from 2017 until Tara Reade's credible accusation of sexual assault against Joe Biden\n\n• Speak truth to power → Leave Joe Biden alone\n\n• Hillary Clinton → Crooked\n\n• Long Covid → Mental illness\n\n• New York City Subway → Public toilet\n\n• WNBA fans → Liars\n\n• Soccer → Performative falling\n\n• Bicycle → Morally abhorrent nerd-conveying road hazard\n\n• Happy Holidays → Merry Christmas\n\n• God bless you → God bless America\n\nPublished under: Abortion , Death Penalty , Transgender\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Liberals Lash Out at Biden as Presidential Primary Approaches\n\nWith President Joe Biden on the cusp of launching his reelection bid, the Democratic Party's liberal flank is attacking the president with increased fervor, with one senator going as far as to speculate whether he will support the unpopular octogenarian come 2024.\n\nIn the last two weeks alone, Biden has faced intense criticism from a slew of liberal members of Congress, including Sen. Ed Markey (D., Mass.) and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), Raúl Grijalva (D., Ariz.), and Greg Casar (D., Texas). Markey was one of four congressional Democrats to hammer Biden for approving a 30-year oil and gas project in Alaska, saying Biden was accelerating \"the ever more devastating impacts of climate change.\" Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, attacked Biden for pledging to sign a bill blocking changes to the Washington, D.C., criminal code, while Grijalva and Casar expressed disgust after the president reportedly considered reviving the Trump-era practice of detaining illegal immigrant families at the southern border.\n\nThe criticisms come as Biden moves forward with plans to run for reelection in 2024, despite polling that shows a majority of Democratic voters don't want the 80-year-old to seek a second term. High-profile liberals such as California governor Gavin Newsom (D.) and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders (I.) have reportedly begun privately preparing presidential bids should Biden refrain from running, and New Jersey senator Bob Menendez (D.) said Tuesday that Biden's actions on illegal migrant detention could affect his support for the incumbent.\n\n\"I would remind the administration that they're the ones who ended family detention,\" Menendez told NBC News. \"It would be a horrible policy to reinstate.\" Asked if enacting the Trump-era immigration policy would \"affect his support for Biden in 2024,\" Menendez answered, \"We'll see how the administration acts, and then we can make all types of judgments about that.\"\n\nThe White House did not return a request for comment.\n\nWhile Sanders and fellow liberal senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) have largely refrained from joining the progressive pile-on against Biden, both Sanders and Warren appeared to tacitly criticize Biden's bailout of Silicon Valley Bank, which collapsed Friday in the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. Sanders said in a Sunday statement that \"now is not the time for U.S. taxpayers to bail out Silicon Valley Bank,\" while Warren in a Monday New York Times op-ed attacked the idea of regulators working to \"ensure that billion-dollar crypto firms won't lose a dime in deposits.\"\n\nWhile neither Sanders nor Warren mentioned Biden by name in their Silicon Valley Bank responses, Warren is embroiled in at least one public battle against the Biden administration. Vice President Kamala Harris, CNN reported Sunday, has refused to take phone calls from Warren after the Massachusetts senator suggested Biden pick whoever makes him \"comfortable\" as his running mate in 2024. Harris's team found the remark \"pretty insulting.\"\n\nBiden has not yet formally announced his reelection campaign, though his wife, First Lady Jill Biden, all but guaranteed during a February Associated Press interview that Biden would run again. \"He's not done,\" the first lady said. \"How many times does he have to say it for you to believe it?\" Most Democratic officials have responded by publicly supporting Biden, even as they privately say Biden is too old to campaign for a second term. Still, some liberal institutions are publicly calling for a successor-left-wing magazine the Atlantic , which is owned by liberal billionaire Laurene Powell Jobs, last month published \"The Case for a Primary Challenge to Joe Biden.\"\n\n\"Yes, this would be a radical move, and would anger a bunch of Democrats inside the various power terraria of D.C., starting with the biggest one of all, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. There would be immediate blowback from donors, the Democratic National Committee, and other party institutions,\" staff writer Mark Leibovich wrote. \"But do it anyway.\"\n\nPublished under: 2024 Election , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , Bernie Sanders , Democrats , Ed Markey , Elizabeth Warren , Gavin Newsom , Joe Biden , Raul Grijalva\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Vox Sheds Light on Heartbreaking Plight: White Liberals Suffering from Wealth Anxiety\n\nVox Dot Com occasionally stumbles upon some extraordinary journalism, such as the time its senior correspondent Matthew Yglesias interviewed anti-income-inequality evangelist Thomas Picketty , a Frenchman, about the perils of wealth accumulation in the bar of the sumptuous St. Regis Hotel in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe website has done it again, this time with a freelance contribution from Adam Roberts, who submitted an illustrated essay on the travails of one of society's most neglected minorities: Rich white liberals suffering from wealth anxiety. Fitting, since that's also Vox 's target demographic.\n\nRoberts recounts his shock and dismay upon learning that his family was actually super wealthy thanks to his forbears's early involvement in the oil and banking industries, and to their considerable equity holdings, which included shares in large military contractors. He found this extremely problematic, because these were the same industries he was \"ethically opposing\" in his daily life, whatever that means.\n\nAfter inheriting about $1.2 million, our hero was overcome with self-doubt and moral anxiety. He laughed awkwardly when his friends, most of them commoners, cracked jokes about \"some idiot rich kid with a trust fund.\" He agonized over the decision of whether or not to buy a home out of concern for the harmful effects of gentrification. Even smaller purchases, such as movie theater popcorn, tormented him due to his apprehension about \"consumerism\" and climate change.\n\nRoberts' belief in the inherent immorality of our economic system led him to ask questions like: \"Is there any amount of private wealth that is moral?\" He wishes he were taxed more, but also has anxiety about giving money away. He says he's already donated more than $400,000 to \"movements for social justice,\" and plans to give even more away in the coming years.\n\nThrough his job as national organizer for Resource Generation, Roberts helps other young people suffering from wealth anxiety to \"become transformative leaders working toward the equitable distribution of wealth, land, and power.\"\n\nPlease keep these tortured martyrs in your thoughts and prayers.\n\nPublished under: Income Inequality\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Not Funny: Liberals Are Furious Conservative Supreme Court Justice Has Sense of Humor\n\nJustice Samuel Alito made a joke during oral arguments Monday, a seemingly innocuous exchange that caused liberals to call for his impeachment.\n\nLiberals lambasted Alito and called for him to be impeached for employing \" outlandish hypotheticals \" involving black children dressed in Ku Klux Klan robes. Vanity Fair dubbed the justice \"the biggest sleazebag on the Supreme Court,\" and at least one Twitter user called for the impeachment of Alito and, inexplicably, Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\n\"How can anyone-especially Gen Z who saw this court literally overturn the right to an abortion-take this court seriously with people like Alito & Thomas on the bench?\" said Victor Shi, the self-proclaimed youngest 2020 Democratic delegate for Joe Biden. Another Biden delegate said , \"Anyone surprised Alito ... is also racist & cracks KKK jokes?\"\n\n\"Klan jokes aren't funny under any context,\" tweeted Columbia law professor Katherine Franke.\n\nSupreme Court justices frequently use hypotheticals to test a particular jurisprudence. Bloomberg earlier this year hailed then-retiring justice Stephen Breyer as the \"king of hypotheticals,\" referencing a case in which he described a mob of mutant \"tomato children\" terrorizing Boston.\n\nAlito's comments came as the justices debated the limits of government-compelled speech. Justice Elena Kagan said that a black Santa Claus should not by law have to entertain a child dressed in a Klan outfit, \"whether the child was black or white or any other characteristic.\" In response, Alito quipped that \"you do see a lot of black children in Ku Klux Klan outfits, right?\" drawing laughs inside the courtroom.\n\nThe justices were hearing arguments in 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis , which centers on a Colorado web designer who says the state's public-accommodation law compels her to design wedding websites for same-sex couples, in violation of her religious beliefs.\n\nKagan and Alito were each responding to Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who compared Smith to a mall photographer who only photographs white children on Santa's lap. According to Jackson, both are engaged in unlawful discrimination.\n\nBut Smith's attorney Kristen Waggoner argued the Court has an obligation in the case to uphold its ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges , the landmark 2015 case legalizing same-sex marriage, which included protections for religious proponents of traditional marriage.\n\n\"The Court's promise in Obergefell is to protect those who would believe marriage is between a man and a woman from having to express a view that violates their conscience,\" Waggoner said on Monday.\n\nSmith has also expressed in interviews that she is comfortable serving same-sex couples as clients as long as she is not forced to promote a message that violates her conscience.\n\nAlito expressed at a Federalist Society event in 2020 that his remarks often get twisted by the press.\n\nPublished under: Humor , Media , Same-Sex Marriage , Samuel Alito , Supreme Court\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
