      "text": "America is facing a stark choice\n\nWoman shouting with a megaphone (Shutterstock)\n\nIn what was billed as his \"farewell address,\" President Biden yesterday warned America that the nation is succumbing to an \"oligarchy\" of the ultra-wealthy, and the \"dangerous concentration of power\" they pose to democratic ideals:\n\nHe's right, of course.\n\nFascism starts with the Trump derriere-kissing we're now witnessing by the wealthiest people in America, who own the biggest megaphones and thereby determine what information Americans get. What they get back from Trump is raw power to do whatever they want.\n\nElon Musk - the richest person in the world - controls X, which under his leadership has become a cesspool of lies and bigotry.\n\nMusk has posted or replied to more than 80 posts about the Los Angeles fires, many of which downplayed the role of climate change - placing blame instead on individual female firefighters of color and lesbian firefighters, including posting their names and faces.\n\nHe boosted an hour-long propaganda video by right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones that claimed the fires were \"part of a larger globalist plot\" to cause the collapse of the United States; Musk replied simply, \"True.\"\n\nHe repeatedly amplified claims that the Los Angeles Fire Department's investments in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs cost lives by wasting money that could have been spent on disaster response, suggesting that the destruction could have been mitigated if more white men had been retained.\n\nMusk has made it clear that his platform's main role during the upcoming Trump regime will be to back whatever Trump chooses to do and criticize Trump's critics with more lies and bigotry.\n\nJeff Bezos - the second-richest person in America - owns Amazon. His Prime Video just announced it will spend a whopping $40 million for a documentary about Melania Trump, for which she is an executive producer, and stream it on Amazon Prime.\n\nWhat else will Amazon promote or censor, to curry favor with Trump?\n\nBezos also owns The Washington Post . Just before the election, he killed a Post endorsement of Kamala Harris . Earlier this month, a Post cartoonist quit after the newspaper spiked a cartoon showing Bezos and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg kneeling before Trump.\n\nMark Zuckerberg - the third-richest person in America - owns Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. He's sucking up to Trump by ridding his platforms of content moderation so that they, too, can amplify Trump's lies and bigotry.\n\nAnnouncing the end of fact-checking on his platforms, Zuckerberg says he thinks it will \"take another ten years\" of fact-free operation before Meta is \"back to the place that it maybe could have been if I hadn't messed that up in the first place.\"\n\nZuckerberg says the deciding factor was the \"cultural tipping point\" of Trump's election.\n\nNot only will Zuckerberg fire most of the 40,000 fact-checkers who have screened his platforms' posts for accuracy, but he will be moving the few who remain from California to Texas, \"where there's less concern about the bias of our teams.\"\n\nSo Texas workers will be less \"biased\" than California workers? As Dan Evon of the nonprofit News Literacy Project notes, the move \"provides an air of legitimacy to a popular disinformation narrative: that fact-checking is politically biased.\"\n\nTraining materials for Meta's remaining trust and safety workers include examples of speech that Zuckerberg now wants permitted :\n\n\"Immigrants are grubby, filthy pieces of shit.\"\n\n\"Gays are freaks.\"\n\n\"Look at that tranny (beneath photo of 17 year old girl).\"\n\nTrump praised the move, saying \"I think they've come a long way.\"\n\nA reporter asked Trump if his threats to put Zuckerberg in prison caused the change in policy. \"Probably,\" Trump responded. Perhaps the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit against Meta played a role as well?\n\nZuckerberg has also promoted prominent Republican Joel Kaplan to be Meta's chief global affairs officer and put Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a close friend of Trump, on its board.\n\nMy friends, none of this has anything to do with freedom of speech. It has everything to do with the power of money.\n\nThe three richest Americans want to decide what the rest of us will know about the coming Trump regime.\n\nConcentrated wealth is the enemy of democracy. As the great jurist Louis Brandeis is reputed to have said, \"America has a choice. We can either have great wealth in the hands of a few, or we can have a democracy. But we cannot have both.\"\n\nAs we slouch into the darkness of Trump II, America needs people and institutions that speak truth to power, not align themselves with it.\n\nWhen we the people regain power, three reforms are critically necessary to begin to tame the oligarchy:\n\nMy friends, we will prevail.\n\nNOW READ: If only more Democrats had the guts of Michelle Obama\n\nRobert Reich is a professor of public policy at Berkeley and former secretary of labor.

      "text": "The fundamental choice before us has not been this stark since World War II\n\nActivists attend a protest against cuts to government agencies by tech billionaire Elon Musk and his young aides at the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), outside the SpaceX's facility in Hawthorne, California, U.S., March 1, 2025.\n\nAfter Trump and Vance's disgraceful treatment of President Zelensky on Friday, some of you might feel ashamed of America. You might even feel ashamed to be an American.\n\nThe proper locus of shame is Trump and Vance. I'm ashamed that they, along with Elon Musk, are now leading our nation. I'm also ashamed that their Republican lackeys in Congress are enabling and encouraging them. I'm ashamed that Democrats in Congress are so supine.\n\nYet I urge you not to give in to the sort of resignation or cynicism that believes nothing can be done - that we are powerless and have no choice but to watch our nation and everything it has stood for be hijacked by Trump, Vance, and Musk.\n\nWe have enormous power and many choices. When the American people understand what is happening - as they are beginning to - no Republican in Congress will be safe. Even now, majorities of independents and Democrats, and even some 30 percent of Republican voters, believe we must stand with Ukraine.\n\nThe fundamental choice has not been as stark since World War II: democracy and freedom, or dictatorship and tyranny.\n\nTrump and his sycophants are siding with the latter. The rest of us must loudly, proudly, and boldly proclaim our allegiance to the former.\n\nTrump is emboldening the dark forces of dictatorship everywhere. Taiwan is reporting more Chinese military drills around the island.\n\nEurope and all free people around the world must rally at this time of American emergency. If the United States won't seize Russia's frozen assets and put them into an account for Ukraine to pay for further arms, Europeans must do this and let Ukraine buy from European defense contractors.\n\nIf you yourself want to help Ukrainians, you might consider United 24 (the Ukrainian state platform for donations, including many important projects); RAZOM (an American NGO, tax-deductible for U.S. citizens, that cooperates with Ukrainian NGOs to support civilians); Documenting Ukraine (an initiative that helps give Ukrainians a voice, also tax-deductible for Americans); and Come Back Alive (a Ukrainian NGO that supports soldiers on the battlefield and veterans).\n\nA final thought. What we are witnessing from Trump and Vance and Musk - their bellicose bullying, their outright lies, their fear-mongering, their disrespect and disdain for others, their emboldening of dictators around the world - is not all bad if it awakens America.\n\nThe more Americans see and absorb the horrors of this regime, the greater the likelihood we will mobilize against it. Not all of us, of course, but the great majority.\n\nAs bad as this regime gets, it will clarify for Americans what is happening to this country, and what we must do to get it back on the track toward social justice, democracy, and widespread prosperity.\n\nYes, the regime is harming many innocent people. Its lawless cruelty is sickening. But there will be a reckoning.\n\nI have always believed America is not a nation of bullies. We have protected the vulnerable, comforted the afflicted, granted refuge to those fleeing violence and persecution, and given voice to those who otherwise would not be heard.\n\nThese ideals are found in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, Emma Lazarus's poem affixed to the Statue of Liberty, FDR's second inaugural address, and Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" sermon at the 1963 March on Washington.\n\nThey connect us with previous generations of Americans who risked everything -some of whom sacrificed their lives - to preserve democracy and achieve a greater good.\n\nDo not feel shame in America. Feel pride in the ideals we share. Feel honored that you are an activist warrior on the right side of history. Feel strength in our conviction. Feel power in our cause.\n\nWe will prevail against Trump - against his bullying, his brutality, and his barbarity.\n\nNOW READ: Could stupidity and cowardice save America in the end?\n\nRobert Reich is a professor of public policy at Berkeley and former secretary of labor.

      "text": "Trump voters need to be held accountable for their choice - here's why\n\nFor now, I'm not getting involved in the debate over what Kamala Harris did wrong. For one thing, whatever conclusions are drawn now will almost certainly be forgotten by the time of the next election. For another, the debate takes vital attention away from the choice of the majority of American voters, which is to say, their terrible choice.\n\nWhy did they break for Donald Trump ? Lots of worthy people are going to spend lots of time exploring that question. I won't, though. What I know is that Trump campaigned on easily proven lies. What I also know is his supporters chose to believe them. What I care about now are the consequences of that choice, and those consequences are going to be bad for all of us, including everyone who voted for him.\n\nThis month, the president-elect said among the first things he's going to do is eliminate the US Department of Education. That agency not only sends federal money to local school districts, it makes sure children are treated equally. This is usually understood in terms of race, but special-education is protected too, and it needs it. There was a time in American history when special-needs kids were told to sink or swim.\n\nMy kid is one of those kids, and if the funding and protection she now has disappears, I'm going to take that personally. I'm going to blame everyone who supported Trump. I won't care if they didn't believe he'd follow through on his pledge. I won't care if they didn't know about it. I won't care if they were lied to by the rightwing media apparatus. I won't care if the kids of Trump voters are themselves victims of their parents' bad choices. I'm going to blame them and I will be right to.\n\nALSO READ: The end of left-leaning news?\n\nIgnorance is no defense in law.\n\nIt should be no defense in politics either.\n\nTrump has also promised to impose punishing tariffs on imported goods from countries like China and Mexico. Tariffs are a tax and every adult knows how a tax works. Yes, some of his supporters pretended not to know that importers pass that cost on to consumers. But whether they did or didn't is going to be irrelevant to me when I'm paying two or three times more for necessities like food and clothing.\n\nAs I'm standing in the checkout at Stop & Shop, sticker-shocked for the umpteenth time, I'm not going to be wondering what Kamala Harris could have done to persuade white working-class Americans to vote for her. I'm not going to feel sympathy for them, knowing that they decided to impoverish themselves out of spite and resentment. No, I'll be too busy cursing them for the titanic a--holes they are.\n\nTrump has also promised to deport millions of so-called illegal immigrants. He said he'll only go after \"the bad ones\" and his supporters, even some Latinos, decided to believe a liar. But I'm not going to care how they came to that decision if the government starts snatching taxpayers out of their homes, arresting and detaining whole families, including US citizens, in the insane belief that doing so is going to make America great again. Why should I care about why they voted the way they did when the consequence of that choice brings chaos to communities, decimates the labor supply and raises prices?\n\nTrump has denied it, but his Republicans are looking forward to taking another crack at repealing the Affordable Care Act. Tens of millions of Americans depend on Obamacare, including independent businesspeople, like me, who could not do what we do without the law. Voters who supported Trump are included in that number, but again, it does not matter to me whether they knew a vote for him was a vote for abolishing affordable insurance. I tend to lose interest in the reasons behind another person's choices if those choices ruin me.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that Trump inflamed resentments in order to win. What's missing from that story is that the resentments are over race, or rather racism. Fact is, lots of white people feel like nonwhite people are taking something from them when they do better for themselves. Trump has made an art form out of getting white people to believe nonwhite people are robbing them, making them poorer, even when the economy is rapidly benefiting those same white people.\n\nWell, when it comes to resentment, you haven't seen anything yet.\n\nIf Trump does what he says, by the time he's done, America is going to be poorer, sicker, weaker and more chaotic. In some cases, he will have done irreparable harm, as he did last time he was president, including to the people who supported him. And he will have done it because ... well, it doesn't matter. They made their choice and it was terrible.\n\nAnd the rest of us will be right to resent it.\n\nNOW READ: There's no 'waiting it out'"

      "text": "School choice nightmare: Vouchers are endangering the rights of families\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated.\n\n\"I am the type of parent who always made sure my kids had the good teachers and always took the right classes,\" said Esther Kempthorne in an interview with Our Schools. So, in 2014, when she moved with her husband and two daughters to their new home in Washington County, Maine, in a bucolic corner of the state, near the Canadian border, she made it a top priority to find a school that would be the right educational fit for their children.\n\nThis article was produced by Our Schools .\n\n\"We settled in Washington County hoping to give our children the experience of attending one high school, making lasting friendships, and finally putting down some roots,\" said Esther's husband, Nathan, whose career in the military had sent the Kempthorne family traveling the world, changing schools more than 20 times in 17 years. \"Both of our children were born on military bases while I was on active duty with the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force,\" said Nathan, whose role in military intelligence often meant that he was deployed to high-risk assignments in war zones.\n\n\"We said that when we got to Maine, we weren't going to keep bouncing from school to school,\" said Esther.\n\nBut after some firsthand experience with the education programs provided by the local public schools, the Kempthornes decided to investigate other options the state offers. One of those options was the state's provision that allows parents who live in a district that doesn't have a school matching their child's grade level the choice to leave the public system and transfer their children to private schools, with the \"home\" public school district picking up the cost of tuition and transportation, subject to state allowance.\n\nBecause the rural district the Kempthornes lived in did not have a high school, they took advantage of that option to enroll their daughters-at taxpayer expense-in Washington Academy , an elite private school founded in 1792 that offers a college track curriculum and access to classes taught by faculty members from a nearby university.\n\nTheir decision to leave the public school system for Washington Academy seemed all the better when Esther, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Mexico, got a full-time job teaching Spanish at the school.\n\nThinking back on how the Kempthorne family negotiated the school choice landscape in Maine, Nathan recalled, \"I thought we were finally going to be okay.\"\n\nBut the Kempthornes weren't okay. Far from it, in 2021, the Kempthornes found themselves in the front seat of their car while they were traveling in another state, using Nathan's iPhone to call in via Zoom and provide testimony to a Maine legislative committee on why Washington Academy, and other schools like it, pose significant threats to families like theirs and how the state needs to more heavily regulate privately operated schools that get taxpayer funding.\n\nFighting through tears, they spoke of \"racism\" and \"bullying\" at Washington Academy and the school administration's unwillingness to acknowledge and address the school's culture.\n\nIn his written testimony, Nathan wrote of \"a disturbing pattern of systemic racism and institutionalized oppression, harassment, and bullying behavior based on race, ethnicity, country of origin, gender, and sexual orientation that has occurred for years at [Washington Academy].\"\n\nIn her letter of resignation from the school, presented to the committee, Esther wrote of a school environment where she and her daughters, who identify as Hispanic, experienced \"racist, anti-immigrant sentiments.\" She wrote , \"As the racist anti-immigrant rhetoric became more mainstream, we had to teach our daughters how to defend themselves without our intervention, and they did. However, such self-defense has been exhausting and stressful for my children, and it should not be their responsibility to constantly deflect harassment; rather they should be guaranteed a safe educational environment by school leaders.\"\n\nAlthough their daughters eventually graduated from Washington Academy and went on to college, the family became totally uprooted because of their experience at the school. Nine years after building their dream home in rural Maine, they now find themselves living in an apartment in New York City, embroiled in a years-long battle with Washington Academy and Maine officials, which has absorbed countless hours of their time and thousands of dollars of their life savings.\n\nEsther has been unable to reenter the classroom as a full-time teacher due to the lingering effects of the traumatic experiences she had from teaching at Washington Academy, and both parents and daughters speak of long-term adverse mental health effects stemming from the years they spent at the school.\n\n\"We sold everything,\" Nathan said in his spoken testimony to the committee. \"We lost everything in your state and we left for our safety. Our children are completely traumatized. They lost all their friends.\"\n\nThe Kempthornes' story about the consequences of leaving the public education system for a private school is a cautionary tale about what can happen when a system designed to provide parents with taxpayer-supported private school options fails to consider the potential risks when students and parents transfer to these schools that are less subject to government oversight.\n\nTheir story is even more significant given the current trend across the country where states have increasingly been adopting charter schools, voucher programs, education savings accounts , \" backpack funding ,\" and other so-called school choice options that use taxpayer money to fund alternatives to the public system.\n\nThese options are favored by politicians on the right and left , and, at least one state, Arizona , has a voucher program called the Empowerment Scholarship Account Program , which every student in the state is eligible to tap.\n\nThis rapid expansion of school choice options is taking place even though there is ample anecdotal evidence and a growing body of research showing that parents in a school choice marketplace often make questionable choices they sometimes come to regret.\n\nAs the Kempthornes came to learn, private education providers that are not governed within the public domain pose legal problems that parents often either don't know about or don't understand, and local and state government officials often either have no authority to intercede on parents' behalf or are reluctant to assert what little authority they do have.\n\nThe Kempthorne family's saga, which is still enduring, is a sharp counterpoint to advocates who promote school choice as a simplistic solution for families without acknowledging that transferring taxpayer-funded education services from the public to the private realm will actually complicate parents' and students' lives.\n\n'Kids Just Being Kids'\n\nThe first time Esther became fully aware of the racist culture simmering below the privileged veneer at Washington Academy was when, a week after Donald Trump had won the 2016 presidential election, a student stood up in her class and asked when she would be \"going home,\" which she took to mean as being a reference to her Mexican heritage.\n\nWhen she described the incident to her family, her story seemed to trigger her daughters to recount how frequently their peers had told them to \"go back to where you came from\" and to make references to \"build the wall\" and other anti-immigrant rhetoric from the Trump campaign.\n\n\"It got really weird really fast after Trump got elected,\" Nathan told Our Schools. \"What had been less overt got more direct.\"\n\n\"Because I am from Mexico and was the only Hispanic and [adult] of color in the school, I knew why this was happening,\" Esther said. While she understood that \"impressionable\" teenagers might \"parrot\" what powerful influencers like Trump say, she felt adults in the school had a responsibility to address the situation. But when she started talking to her colleagues about it, her fellow teachers and school staff members dismissed her concerns with comments about \"kids just being kids\" and saying that the behaviors were just the \"latest fad\" that would end soon. Some chided her for being \"political.\"\n\n\"This was painful for me because I was, after all, the only person of color [on the staff] and the only one bringing up the issue,\" Esther said.\n\nIn 2019, after a shooting in an El Paso, Texas, Walmart , in which victims were targeted for their Hispanic heritage, the Kempthornes asked to talk to Washington Academy administrators and faculty about the treatment of nonwhite students in the school.\n\nEsther suggested that there should be a schoolwide buildup to national events related to race, such as National Hispanic Heritage Month and Black History Month, but it became apparent to her that if that were to happen, she would have to lead it, and that made her feel vulnerable.\n\nWhile administrators pledged to address the issue of racism in the school, it became apparent to the Kempthornes that some school staff were reluctant to admit there was a problem. Ultimately, the Kempthornes maintain little was done other than to mention the issue during a student assembly.\n\n\"I felt very alone,\" Esther said.\n\nNoose in the Classroom\n\nMatters took a decidedly scarier turn in March 2020, when Esther found a noose hanging from a window shade in her classroom. Initially, she didn't know what it meant.\n\n\"In Mexico, a noose is a confession of suicidal thoughts,\" she said, so she wondered if its presence was related to the mental health of one of her students. But her school was about to go remote due to COVID, and she didn't mention the incident to school administrators or anyone else.\n\nIt was only after she heard about a news story from Deer Isle, Maine, about a noose discovered hanging from a utility line, that she mentioned the incident to her husband who told her about the racist threat the symbol was meant to convey. That made her recall recent incidents in which students brought Confederate flags to school, and she put the two things together.\n\nThe Kempthornes' youngest daughter, Natalia (now Natalia Kempthorne-Curiel), asked current and former Washington Academy students to send her their stories about incidents of discrimination occurring at the school, which she compiled and sent in a letter to the school's administration.\n\nSeveral anecdotes mentioned in Natalia's letter stem from a Black Lives Matter rally that students helped organize in which, \"Students and former students at the rally lined up their trucks with big American flags waving in the back and drove past the Black Lives Matter protest multiple times yelling 'go home,' flipping them off, and playing 'Dixie' loudly over their truck horn[s].\"\n\n\"Multiple students reported that white students routinely flew Confederate flags on school grounds,\" read another entry in the letter , \"with no repercussions.\"\n\nInternational students at the academy seem to have been a particular target for abuse, according to several comments included in the letter , and \"were afraid to report acts of racism or xenophobia because they feared retaliation, and because the perpetrators would not be held accountable for their actions.\"\n\nIn addition to her letter, Natalia also posted an online petition accusing Washington Academy and its board of trustees of creating \"a systemic and institutionalized culture of discrimination within our school\" and calling for the school administration to take several steps to address \"harassment and discrimination\" in the school.\n\nFeeling disappointed in the school's response to their grievances, the Kempthornes embarked on an extensive campaign to contact a broad range of officials and organizations outside of the school.\n\nLocal officials, many of whom had business and professional relationships with Washington Academy board members and administrators, were slow to respond to the family's complaints or took no action at all. The Maine Education Association , the statewide union Esther had joined, claimed it was prevented from interceding on her behalf because the school is private.\n\nWritten appeals the family made to 19 members of state government-including a U.S. senator, a U.S. House representative, committee chairs in the Maine House and Senate, the Maine Department of Education commissioner, the Maine attorney general, and the governor-to request support received responses that ranged from merely officious to sympathetic, but failed to result in any concrete actions.\n\nThe state legislative hearing that the Kempthornes provided testimony to was so hastily thrown together that Nathan and Esther weren't able to schedule their appearances in advance, so they had to call from the front seat of their car, while they were traveling out-of-state.\n\nEven though Maine has a statutory provision that prohibits discrimination, the Maine Human Rights Commission (MHRC) , which is responsible for enforcing it, proved to be reluctant to apply its regulatory authority to a prestigious private academy. (In an apparent conflict of interest, at the time the Kempthornes were making their appeals, Arnold Clark was chair of the MHRC and an attorney working out of an office from the same address as attorney Dennis Mahar , who serves on the Washington Academy board of trustees and once served as the board's president, according to Nathan.)\n\nThe Kempthornes hired an attorney for their case, but the legal fees eventually exceeded their wherewithal.\n\nEven their closest friends in the community demurred from speaking out on their behalf.\n\n'He Really Didn't Want to Talk With Us'\n\nWith their oldest daughter already having moved away from home and attending college, and Natalia eligible for early graduation from Washington Academy, the Kempthornes began to think about moving away. When close acquaintances advised them to leave for safety reasons it seemed to solidify their decision and in August 2020, they put their house up for sale and left Maine.\n\nBut their contempt for Washington Academy remains. \"Neither as a parent or a teacher did I ever get a [written communication] from Washington Academy's Head of School Judson McBrine or Assistant Headmaster Tim Reynolds [now retired] that they were aware of the open discrimination and were taking steps to address it,\" said Esther. It wasn't until after her resignation, in July 2020, and more than a month after her daughter Natalia had reported intense discrimination, that Esther received a short email from McBrine to discuss her resignation letter.\n\nIn September 2020, a local television station reported that at least one of Nathan's letters about the noose incident had prompted Washington County lawmakers to request the state attorney general to conduct an inquiry into the matter. McBrine is quoted as saying, \"We will not tolerate racism at Washington Academy.\"\n\nIn January 2021, local news outlet WGME reported that Washington Academy had hired an outside investigator to conduct an investigation about the noose incident. The investigation \"could not substantiate the allegation, according to an attorney representing the school,\" WGME reported.\n\nThe lawyer the school chose to conduct the investigation worked for Eaton Peabody in Bangor, which specializes in representing employers, not employees, according to its description of the firm's experience in handling labor and employment cases. The investigating attorney, Sarah Newell, also represents employers, according to her legal profile , which spotlights her successful litigations, including that she \"[s]uccessfully defended a disability discrimination case before the Maine Human Rights Commission,\" and, \"[s]uccessfully defended a nursing home in labor arbitration.\"\n\nAlso, after the Kempthornes left Maine, in August 2020, Washington Academy announced in November 2020 that it had hired a firm to conduct an \"equity audit\" of the school, the results of which were posted on the school's website in May 2021. To conduct the audit, the school hired Boston-based Carney Sandoe and Associates, a firm that, according to its website , works exclusively with \"independent, private, boarding, and charter schools,\" mostly on faculty recruitment and leadership searches.\n\nAccording to the Kempthornes, no one from Carney Sandoe and Associates reached out for their input for the audit, but when Nathan heard of the audit, he contacted the firm's diversity consultant at the time, Lawrence Alexander, who spoke briefly with Nathan, but never contacted Esther or Natalia.\n\n\"He really didn't want to talk with us,\" said Nathan.\n\n'I Was Not Surprised'\n\nElizabeth Sprague first met Esther Kempthorne when a local advocacy group Sprague participated in invited Natalia to speak to the group about her environmental advocacy work at Washington Academy.\n\nA few months after Natalia spoke to the group, Sprague came across an unsettling message on her social media feed from a follower who expressed feelings of being personally unsafe at work. In an exchange of messages that ensued, Sprague learned the follower was Esther, and the unsafe place was Washington Academy.\n\n\"When I found out it was Washington Academy, I was not surprised,\" said Sprague. Other parents she knew had complained to her about the culture in the school. Two teachers at the school had spoken to her about feeling the need to self-censor their comments about the school's culture because of religious fervor that was rife in the school, even though the school is officially nonsectarian.\n\nSprague, who grew up in the Washington County area and has family members who've lived there since the 1600s, said Washington Academy has long been regarded as an \"aspiring\" school. Sprague attended the school in her freshman year of high school, and she had a family member who taught there. \"He was very evangelical,\" she said, and \"proselytized\" students in the classroom, with, apparently, no interference from the school administration.\n\nWashington Academy is one of several Maine \"town academies\" that benefit from what's known as \" town tuitioning ,\" in which private schools receive public funding from districts that \"tuition out\" students to the schools rather than paying to educate them in their \"home\" district. These Maine academies had from 80.4 to 99.3 percent of their student enrollments funded with public dollars in the fiscal year 2020-2021. Most of them also obtain additional income by operating expensive residential programs that enroll students, often from countries outside the U.S.\n\nThe practice of using town tuitioning programs as alternatives to providing public schools started in Vermont , according to Education Week, but has since spread to New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, as well as Maine.\n\nSupporters of these programs call them a \" model of educational choice ,\" according to Education Week, and although supporters of vouchers haven't always held up town academies as their ideal, they've more recently been describing them as the \" oldest school choice program in the nation \" and calling for expanding them so that all students are eligible to attend the town academies.\n\nBut the rationale for having town academies and funding them with public money seems to no longer hold, if it ever did.\n\n'A Common Myth'\n\n\"A common myth is that town academies in New England exist in rural areas which have a scarcity of public schools due to the relatively low population density of families with school-aged children and a lack of funding to support district schools,\" according to Bruce Baker, an education professor at the University of Miami in Florida. \"But that's not the reality.\"\n\nAccording to Baker, many of these schools started in the early 1800s, or earlier, as private secondary schools for their communities prior to the existence of public high schools \"and in many cases,\" prior to the creation of the nation's system of public common schools. \"Some, like Burr and Burton Academy in Manchester , Vermont, were originally funded by local businessmen,\" he noted.\n\nGiven that origin, town academies that are in operation today are \"holdovers,\" according to Baker, \"of what were once proxy public schools that never converted to district public schools,\" although a few have, such as Bellows Free Academy in St. Albans, Vermont, which converted from private to public in 2008.\n\nContrary to the town academy narrative, some of the schools are in communities that have sufficient populations to educate school-aged children. For instance, New Bedford Academy in New Bedford, Massachusetts, is located in a city with a population exceeding 100,000 , according to the 2021 U.S. census. Norwich Free Academy is located in Norwich, Connecticut, a community with a population of more than 40,000.\n\nAlso, the notion that town academies are needed in Maine because public schools are few and far between seems hardly the case. \"The distances between publicly funded town academies and competing public high schools in Maine is often negligible,\" Nathan Kempthorne wrote in an email, pointing out that the distance between Washington Academy and Machias Memorial High School in Machias is only 4.2 miles , and John Bapst Memorial High School , a town academy in Bangor, is only 2.5 miles from Bangor High School and 2.1 miles from Brewer High School .\n\nPublic schools in rural communities are quite commonplace. \"More than 9.3 million-or nearly one in five students in the U.S.-attend a rural school,\" according to a 2019 report by the Rural School and Community Trust. \"This means that more students in the U.S. attend rural schools than in the nation's 85 largest school districts combined.\"\n\nWhereas rural public schools are subject to the same government oversight that all public schools are subject to, that oversight does not extend to private schools, even when they get a substantial portion of their funding from the public.\n\n\"In private schools, students end up losing basic constitutional rights and essentially don't have due process rights,\" Todd DeMitchell told Our Schools. DeMitchell is a professor emeritus at the University of New Hampshire at Manchester who studies laws governing school policies and the impact of court cases on these policies.\n\nAccording to him, if the Kempthornes had their children enrolled in public schools they would have had access to certain rights protected by the U.S. Constitution, including Title 6 , which addresses race, and Title 9 , which addresses discrimination on the basis of sex. Washington Academy, being a private school, is exempt from these protections.\n\nDeMitchell pointed to a 1987 decision by a federal court that ruled a private academy in New Hampshire had the right to fire a teacher who, contrary to school policy, grew a beard, because the school argued successfully that it was \"not a state actor,\" according to DeMitchell. That ruling's logic has been extended to a potential 2023 U.S. Supreme Court case in which a North Carolina charter school is arguing that it has the right to require girl students to wear skirts at school because it also is not a state actor. (Charter schools are also privately operated schools that are funded almost exclusively with public money.)\n\nAlong with their problematic funding rationale, town academies also have issues with being truly diverse and inclusive schools. For instance, they've \"long struggled\" to serve students with disabilities, according to Baker. And the student populations of these town academies tend to be more white and affluent than their surrounding communities, with any purported claims of student diversity being largely due to their enrollments of international students in residential programs.\n\nAccording to a 2017 report on Vermont's town academies by ProPublica, \"Of the almost 2,800 Vermonters who use publicly funded vouchers to go to private schools in state, 22.5 percent qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, according to state education data. (The data excludes out-of-state private schools.) By contrast, 38.3 percent of public school students in Vermont have family incomes low enough to qualify them for the lunch discount.\"\n\nThese tendencies toward serving select populations of students likely lead to problems with creating an inclusive school culture, as is noted in a letter from \"community members\" of the John Bapst Memorial High School town academy in Maine.\n\nMuch like Natalia's letter to Washington Academy, the letter from the John Bapst community members provides numerous testimonials of incidents and school conditions that reflect racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, misogyny, and economic discrimination.\n\n\"Many of the issues being brought to light within this letter are rooted in the demographics of John Bapst,\" the document states .\n\n'Did Not Do Enough Research'\n\n\"In hindsight, I clearly did not do enough research,\" Nathan now admits. But is it really that simple?\n\nLike most families, the Kempthornes feel they know what's best for their children, including their education, but the couple perhaps seems especially amply prepared for that role.\n\nAlthough Nathan had dropped out of high school, he joined the military and earned his GED, getting 96 percent of his credits while on active duty on base. He completed both his bachelor's and master's degrees using the GI Bill. \"There was no way I was going to have a child and not have a college degree,\" he said.\n\nEsther received her bachelor's degree in business administration from a university in Mexico and had frequently worked for the state department during their deployments. When she got part-time work in Maine, teaching Spanish in nearby Machias Memorial High School and Milbridge Elementary School , she seemed especially well positioned to research potential new schools for their children.\n\nBut after the Kempthornes enrolled their daughters in the local public school, it didn't take long for them to realize their children were academically far ahead of their peers (Natalia skipped a grade in her elementary school). While the elementary school was \"tolerable,\" they were concerned their daughters would flounder in the local secondary schools.\n\nAlso, Esther and Nathan felt their daughters, who identified as Hispanic, would benefit from schools with a more racially diverse student population.\n\nThe reputations of the local secondary schools were not particularly sterling. Machias Memorial High School, where Esther taught, did not impress her, and a closer secondary school, Narraguagus Junior-Senior High School , was generally considered low performing among parents. Certainly, the reputations of those schools were not helped by the poor ratings they get on the popular school rating site Great Schools.\n\nAlso, the Kempthornes could not help but notice how under-resourced their local schools were.\n\nAccording to an annual analysis of education funding compiled by the Education Law Center for the year 2022, Maine has an uneven track record in funding education. While the analysis gives the state a grade of \"A\" for the level of per-pupil revenue it provides to schools, compared to other states, it grades Maine an \"F\" for how the state distributes education funding to school districts with high levels of student poverty.\n\nA similar school finance profile for 2019-2020 gives Maine's financial commitment to schools 62 points out of a 100-point scale, but notes that while the state is \"a high effort state\" compared to other states, its current effort level is below its pre-recession (2006) level, and, \"Educational opportunity in [Maine] is severely unequal.\"\n\nIn addition to the funding disparities, the Kempthornes also noticed how much Maine's public education policy emphasized career and technical education (CTE), a term recently coined to replace what's traditionally been called vocational education. That emphasis is reflected in the state's recent commitment of $25 million to a two-year initiative to fund students to get paid work experiences with employers. On the website of Machias Memorial High, the school's CTE program is the only content area described under the heading of \"academics.\"\n\n\"We kind of panicked when we thought we'd have to move again because of subpar education,\" Nathan recalled. Their commitment to move to Maine and build their dream home near a picturesque seashore had been years in the making. To finance the move, Nathan had taken more dangerous assignments for the higher pay, and the family had scrimped on expenses to save up for the construction of their new home.\n\nGiven their situation, it's understandable why the Kempthornes would be attracted to a school like Washington Academy. According to Private School Review , \"85 percent of graduates [of the school] go on to post-secondary programs, college, or university.\" The school's academic program ranges from \"hands-on courses in marine technology and computer-aided design to AP classes in advanced math and literature to college courses taught by [Washington Academy] faculty and online through our university partners,\" according to the school website .\n\nFurther, the school offered the more ethnically and racially diverse student body the Kempthornes wanted. Of its population of roughly 90-some boarding students-nearly a quarter of the roughly 400 student enrollment-most come from outside the U.S., according to the Kempthornes, primarily from China.\n\n\"When we toured Washington Academy,\" Nathan recalled, \"the differences in resources and course offerings between it and the local public schools were stark.\"\n\nAnd with the tuition being funded by the public, what families would turn that down?\n\n'Who Really Has the Choice?'\n\nIn describing the reality of the school choice landscape the Kempthornes confronted in Maine, Nathan could be speaking for an increasing number of American families when he said, \"Either you accept a system in which you have zero recourse to discrimination or you accept subpar education in a system in which you have at least some rights.\"\n\nWhat kind of choice is that?\n\nAdvocates for school choice prefer to ignore that question. \"Their idea of an education free market is predicated on caveat emptor,\" as Todd DeMitchell put it, \"even if parents often don't have the information at hand to make those kinds of decisions.\"\n\nWhile it's hard to believe the Kempthornes should have known the situation they were walking into, it's even harder to argue that they should have just accepted it.\n\nBut in a school choice playing field that so unevenly advantages the education provider over the parent, the question becomes, \"Who really has the choice, the parent or the school?\" according to DeMitchell. \"When a school has a particular kind of culture, who really has the choice? The school is effectively saying, We choose to allow you to be discriminated against. And that's your choice?\"\n\nAuthor Bio : Jeff Bryant is a writing fellow and chief correspondent for Our Schools.

      "text": "Why school choice policies fail to live up to the hype\n\nby Danielle Sanderson Edwards , Michigan State University\n\nThe Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work.\n\nAlthough school choice policies are often presented as a way to let families select the best schools for their children, my research found that few students using school choice can access high-achieving schools far from home.\n\nIn my peer-reviewed study - recently published in Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis - I examine who uses school choice and whether most families enroll their kids in schools with high test scores and graduation rates in Detroit. Ninety percent of Detroit students are economically disadvantaged.\n\nThanks to state laws passed in the mid-1990s, Detroit students can attend charter schools , various Detroit public schools and schools in nearby districts . Over 30% attend Detroit charter schools and 20% attend schools outside Detroit . The schools that are located in the school districts surrounding Detroit - and that serve Detroit students - have higher average test scores and graduation rates than Detroit schools.\n\nUsing education data for Detroit students during the 2017-18 school year, I found that students from poorer neighborhoods and families without access to a car were less likely to choose schools far from home. Instead, most families chose schools within Detroit that had better student outcomes than other Detroit schools but lower test scores than many schools in the surrounding school districts. Even those who left Detroit were less likely to attend the highest-achieving schools outside the city.\n\nSo, the ability to attend the highest-quality schools serving Detroit students is limited by distance even when many different options are available. This is the case even after accounting for other preferences, such as school demographics and programs.\n\nDetroit isn't unique in its school choice options. Almost all states permit public school students to attend charter schools or schools in other districts . These policies allow students to attend schools other than their neighborhood school.\n\nIn theory, school choice could raise student achievement by increasing access to high-achieving schools and creating competition among schools for students, forcing schools to do more to improve achievement to attract families. However, there is little evidence that school choice policies broadly result in widespread achievement gains.\n\nMy research shows that one reason choice may fail to live up to its promise is that many students are unable to physically access high-performing schools outside their neighborhood.\n\nLittle is known about how local differences in school choice rules affect student access. These differences can include enrollment regulations, whether or not transportation is provided or the relative ease or difficulty of the application process.\n\nIn surveys and interviews, families report that inadequate transportation is a barrier not only to attending preferred schools but to attending school regularly . A 2020 study shows families choose higher-quality schools when they have access to transportation , and school buses can increase regular school attendance by as much as 25% for low-income students.\n\nHowever, fewer than half of states make transportation mandatory for students using school choice.\n\nAdditionally, complex application procedures likely impede enrollment in choice schools, especially for families from underrepresented backgrounds.\n\nFor upcoming studies, my colleagues and I collected data from Michigan school districts concerning local between-district enrollment policies. This includes enrollment caps, transportation provisions and application deadlines. We plan to examine how local school choice rules could allow families to self-segregate on the basis of race or income.\n\nPreliminary findings show, for example, that early application deadlines may restrict access to high-achieving districts for low-income students and students of color.\n\n[ Over 100,000 readers rely on The Conversation's newsletter to understand the world.

      "text": "'Choice' has become an excuse for charter and voucher schools to discriminate\n\nWhen prominent advocates for \"school choice,\" such as U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, talk about how a market-based approach for education works, the very stories they might cite as successes actually reveal serious shortcomings of charter schools and vouchers, especially about how they can have detrimental effects on parents, children, and communities. Take, for example, the case of Krystl Newton.\n\nWhen the private Christian school Newton's daughter attended closed, she was able to find a charter school near their home in Wake County, North Carolina, that provided a school culture similar to the private academy, with strict discipline, high academic standards, and none of the \"gang stuff\" (her words) she heard plagued the public schools.\n\nHer daughter thrived in the new charter, so when Newton's younger son reached kindergarten age, she was pleased the charter would enroll him under their family-members-first policy.\n\nBut after his kindergarten year, when he was ready to move to first grade, there was a problem.\n\nEarly in the boy's development, Newton had observed symptoms of what she came to believe was a developmental disability resembling Tourette's Syndrome. Although an official diagnosis of the disorder couldn't be made until the child turned eight, Newton had already consulted specialists and gone to the trouble of developing an Individualized Education Program (IEP), a document that is developed for each public school child who needs special supports due to a physical, mental, or emotional disability. Because her daughter also had a mild form of disability when she enrolled in the charter, Newton assumed the charter would be fully accepting and supportive of her son's situation too.\n\nBut the charter administrators felt otherwise.\n\n\"They wouldn't accept our information,\" she told me in a phone conversation, referring to her son's IEP and other documents advising how to conduct his education program. Instead, the charter administrators said they would rely on their own \"team\" to develop a plan for her son and would \"let you know\" what the school would choose to support.\n\nThe plan the charter school ultimately came up with had few of the supports her son would need, Newton believed. Also, the school offered no recourse or way for her to appeal their decision. \"They really had no intention of accommodating my son's needs,\" she said.\n\nFortunately, during the summer when her son was between kindergarten and first grade, Newton learned of a nearby public school that had the supports her son needed-including visits from an occupational therapist and access to instruction in a smaller class size. By the time I spoke with her, her son was attending a public middle school and \"thriving,\" she said. The special education staff had \"partnered with our family,\" she told me. \"It was a terrific move.\"\n\nThe feel-good story school choice advocates would make of this outcome is that Newton and her children benefited from having a community where there were lots of school options, and the fact they ultimately found a place for her son in a public school, while her daughter eventually graduated from the charter, is proof a market-based system in which parents have to essentially \"shop\" for schools to find the \"best fit\" for each child is what works best.\n\nBut Julie Mead has a problem with that.\n\nDoes 'All Children' Mean All ?\n\n\"When public funds are tied to programs, there's an expectation that the programs are then accessible to the entire community,\" she told me in a phone interview. In Newton's case, although the charter her children attended received public funds from the state and was subject to federal laws that ensure students with disabilities have free appropriate public education, the charter school was in fact not accessible to all public school children simply by the way it tailored its program to exclude students with more severe disabilities.\n\nMead, a University of Wisconsin professor, recently co-authored with Suzanne Eckes a policy brief for the National Education Policy Center warning that redirecting public funds to charter schools and voucher programs to pay for private school tuition subsidizes discrimination with taxpayer money.\n\nThe brief points to numerous research reports and news accounts finding that private schools participating in voucher programs often deny access to students and families on the basis of religious or sexual identity, learning ability, or fluency in English. Studies also show charter schools often enroll racially and economically homogeneous student populations and tend to have fewer students with special needs.\n\nThe authors contend that expanding more charters and voucher programs increases discrimination in schools because federal laws don't hold public, private, and charter schools to the same standards, state legislatures too often ignore discrimination in creating charter and voucher programs, and privately operated schools have a free hand to design programs to discourage-or even prevent-undesirable students from enrolling.\n\nCharters on Murky Legal Ground\n\nThe authors find discrimination is more likely in voucher programs than in charters, because private schools aren't subject to the same laws as public schools. However, they point out that because of recent court decisions, charters inhabit a murky legal ground where their status as public or private entities is not settled.\n\nIn the case of Newton's son, federal law requires that the charter provide necessary services for his education, no matter how costly and regardless of whether the school had ever offered the services before his enrollment.\n\nBut as the NEPC report explains, charter schools have programming authority that allows them to \"exclude some populations.\" Charters are free to gear their instructional services to specific ethnic or racial student populations. Or, as in Newton's case, charter school officials can assure parents that their school has the necessary services to provide for a specific disability, and if the parents, as Newton did, opt for a school with existing expertise instead of the charter, then, \"in such cases,\" the brief explains, \"the [charter] school official would not have discriminated, but the result-a school that serves fewer students with disabilities-occurs just the same.\"\n\nNo doubt, the practices of charter schools will continue to be matters for litigation. However, few parents have the time or wherewithal to take these cases to court, charter authorizers and state officials who oversee these schools have few incentives to enforce stricter non-discrimination guidelines, and the charter industry shrugs off the problem.\n\nBut the real value in the NEPC brief is how it takes on the argument made by school choice cheerleaders that evidence of discrimination and exclusion in the privately operated education sector doesn't matter.\n\nChoice to Discriminate\n\nThe brief looks back at DeVos' contentious budget hearing in the House earlier this year when Massachusetts Representative Katherine Clark asked her how a Department of Education under her leadership would respond to instances when schools receiving federal dollars were found to discriminate on the basis of race or sexual identity. In response, DeVos indicated her emphasis would be on states having \"flexibility\" and \"parents making choices on behalf of their students.\"\n\nSince that hearing, DeVos has backtracked somewhat on allowing federal money to go to schools that discriminate against LGBT students, but on numerous occasions when she has been questioned about the problematic track record of school choice, her backstop argument has been that parental choice matters more than academic outcomes or social justice consequences, including increased inequality or discrimination.\n\nUnfortunately, joining DeVos and school choice advocates in the Republican Party in their argument are a lot of Democrats. For instance, Peter Cunningham, communications director for former-U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, has suggested that fighting discrimination that causes racially segregated schools is \"maybe ... not worth it.\"\n\nIn op-eds for prominent media outlets, Cunningham has declared that efforts to racially integrate schools have \"hit a wall,\" and because \"ending poverty and integration are politically difficult and financially expensive goals,\" the more important aim is to press for \"needed reforms\" in schools. At the very top of the \"reforms\" he advocates for are \"the rights of parents and the best interests of children.\" He declares, \"No one can dispute the right of parents to choose their child's school.\"\n\nWhile the primacy of parental choice might work well on a bumper sticker, Mead explains why this can create problems in a public education system that is supposed to serve the needs and interests of all students.\n\nUnderstanding the Trade-Offs\n\n\"People need to understand what the trade-offs are between these choice options and parent and student rights,\" Mead says.\n\nMead, who started her career as an educator of children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, says the popular view of \"choice\" espoused by many-that parent choice has primacy over issues of equity-reminds her of what happened after the U.S. Supreme Court Brown v. Board ruling that outlawed racially segregated public schools. In retaliation to the ruling, many states in the South set up segregated academies for white students and justified the schools with arguments for parent choice .\n\nArguments for the primacy of parent choice today are far more sophisticated, with proponents saying that parents who opt into charter and voucher schools that are racially or ethnically homogeneous are choosing \"culturally affirming\" schools for their children. School choice proponents decry non-discrimination laws as \"one-size-fits-all\" impositions on privately operated schools. And rearguard defenders of the accountability movement from the presidential administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama contend that as long as student scores on standardized tests improve, the widespread segregation proliferating in the privately operated education sector doesn't matter.\n\nRepresentatives of the charter industry generally fight every effort to ensure their schools don't discriminate. In North Carolina, where Newton lives, a charter school advocate who appeared at a prominent forum on charters said it was \"not fair\" for charter schools to have the same percentages and severity of special education students that local public schools have.\n\nThe hands-off message the charter industry leaders convey to lawmakers, many of whom receive substantial campaign donations from the industry, is that any regulations with the objective of \"protecting students and taxpayers\" are \"harmful constraints\" on their schools. And policies governing their schools should \"focus on what a charter school is achieving, not how it does the work.\"\n\nThese arguments come dangerously close, says Mead, to \"transferring guarantees that we should have in society to provide all students with access to education to a permission-based system where we grant permissions to violate guaranteed access.\"\n\nShe concedes, \"It's certainly difficult to create systems that are non-discriminatory. But if you get a system that departs from those guarantees of access and excludes large parts of the public, it's no longer politically defensible.\"\n\nHer concern is, \"As we shift into systems of choice, then we'll shift accountability from the collective to the individual. So at some point, it leads to a situation where parents who've been wronged in the system are told, 'If you're not happy then it's your fault; you should have chosen better.'\"\n\nWho Gets to Choose?\n\nNo doubt, our public education system has struggled at fulfilling the promise to guarantee an education for every student. But during the previous century, a progressive movement in the country gradually opened the schoolhouse door to students of low-income and working-class families, girls and women, and students of all races, religions, languages, and abilities.\n\nYes, there are still great inequities in the system. But why would we introduce new agents that likely make inequities worse?\n\n\"We need to find ways to ensure equitable access,\" says Mead. \"I'm not ready to give up that goal.\"\n\nWhat she and co-author Eckes recommend is for Congress to amend federal anti-discrimination laws to ensure state voucher programs operate in non-discriminatory ways and for federal agencies to consider withholding tax-exempt status and other benefits from schools that don't meet non-discrimination standards.\n\nAt the state level, legislatures should include explicit anti-discrimination language in their voucher laws to ensure that private schools participating in publicly funded voucher programs do not discriminate against students and staff. And state lawmakers should adopt or amend charter school laws to ensure that throughout the life of a charter school (from proposal to renewal) there is a regulatory function that ensures every charter is attracting and retaining reasonably heterogeneous student populations.\n\nAs for Newton, her experience with school choice has persuaded her to urge parents with special needs children to \"give public schools a chance.\" About charter schools, she explains that while these schools advertise themselves as schools of choice, the reality is \"as much as you choose it, the school chooses you.\"\n\nTo learn more about school privatization, check out Who Controls Our Schools?

      "text": "FCC chair smacks down Ron DeSantis' 'dangerous' attempt to censor pro-choice ad\n\nFloridians are preparing to head to the polls to vote on Amendment 4 in just four weeks, which would enshrine abortion rights into the Florida state constitution. Republican Governor Ron DeSantis' attempted censorship of an ad supporting Amendment 4 just hit a wall, courtesy of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Jessica Rosenworcel.\n\nOn Monday, Slate reported that DeSantis was contemplating taking media companies to court for airing the ad, which informs Floridians that the state's current six-week abortion ban endangers the lives of pregnant individuals. The DeSantis-controlled Florida Department of Health argues that the ad's claims are \"false\" and \"dangerous,\" and violate the Sunshine State's \"sanitary nuisance\" law.\n\nUnder that law, any TV station that airs the ad could be prosecuted with a second-degree misdemeanor, and those stations' employees could face 60 days in jail if found guilty. But on Tuesday, Reuters reported that Rosenworcel stepped in to publicly remind Florida's two-term governor that actually following through on those threats would conflict with the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"The right of broadcasters to speak freely is rooted in the First Amendment,\" Rosenworcel stated. \"Threats against broadcast stations for airing content that conflicts with the government's views are dangerous and undermine the fundamental principle of free speech.\"\n\nJournalist Jason Garcia first reported on DeSantis' threats to prosecute TV stations, which was laid out in an October 3 letter from the Florida Department of Health. That letter - which was addressed to Tampa-based NBC affiliate WFLA - acknowledged the right to air political speech outlined in the First Amendment, but maintained that those rights do \"not include free rein to disseminate false advertisements, which, if believed, would likely have a detrimental effect on the lives and health of pregnant women in Florida.\"\n\nThe ad in question is entitled \"Caroline,\" and features the testimony of a woman who was diagnosed with a brain tumor while she was in the middle of pregnancy. She noted that the state's strict six-week abortion ban - which kicks in before many pregnant individuals even know they're pregnant - bans her from obtaining life-saving healthcare in her home state.\n\n\"The doctors knew if I did not end my pregnancy,\" Caroline said in the ad, \"I would lose my baby, I would lose my life, and my daughter would lose her mom. Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine.\"\n\nOutside of the letter from the state's health department, DeSantis is also using state resources in a full-court press aimed at stopping Amendment 4's passage. In late September, Mother Jones' Ari Berman reported that state police were \" showing up at Florida voters' homes \" to question them about signing petitions in favor of the measure, and the Florida Agency for Heath Care Administration launched a website with \"politically charged language\" in opposition to Amendment 4.\n\nAmendment 4 is currently ahead in polls, with the Hill reporting in September that it had 55% support among likely Florida voters in a survey conducted by the outlet in coordination with Emerson College. That poll only found 26% of respondents were fully opposed to the measure, while another 20% said they were still unsure about how they would vote."

      "text": "Out-of-state, conservative organizations lead charge to ban ranked choice voting in Ohio\n\nA Senate committee heard from supporters last week of a measure effectively banning ranked choice voting in the state. The measure is bipartisan - proposed by Sens. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, and Bill DeMora, D-Columbus. But its public backers so far are mostly conservative and right-wing groups.\n\nOnly three organizations showed up in person - Opportunity Solutions Project, The Heartland Institute and The Honest Elections Project. But the Trump-aligned administration in-waiting, America First Policy Institute, submitted written testimony as did the Heritage Foundation.\n\nNotably, no local governments in the state currently use ranked choice for their elections. Although a handful of Ohio cities used it briefly in the early 1900s, there's no groundswell of local elected leaders calling for its return.\n\nUnder the Senate proposal, any municipality that did so would lose its share of the local government fund - a vital source of revenue.\n\nOpportunity Solutions Project got bashed last year when it was the sole advocate to show up on behalf of HJR 6. That measure was the first attempt to raise the threshold for state constitutional amendments, which sponsors argued was necessary to keep \"out of state interests\" from the gaming the process.\n\nOpportunity Solutions Project is based in Florida.\n\nThe organization has lobbied for electoral changes in several states, especially in the wake of former President Trump's false claims of a stolen election. Frank Strigari, the state Senate's former chief counsel, spoke on their behalf. He argued \"this is not really truly a one-side issue when it comes to partisanship,\" after citing Democratic and Republican-led governments that have opposed the approach. Strigari added that ranked choice leads to votes being \"thrown in the garbage.\"\n\nThis claim, however, is disingenuous. Ranked choice removes the lowest placed candidate in successive rounds. Voters who backed that candidate would then see their votes applied to their next highest choice.\n\nIf, for instance, a voter made two selections, but the tallying went through three rounds and their picks are no longer in the race, their ballot is \"exhausted.\" That is to say, although it was counted, it no longer has an impact on the tally. To say that ballot was \"thrown in the garbage\" is about the same as saying any vote cast for a candidate other than the eventual top two finishers is wasted.\n\nCameron Sholty, from Heartland Impact, argued \"it's important to understand that this is not just an Ohio challenge. This is not just a solution in search of a problem. It is actually a solution to combat, and to counter, in fact, a very real problem.\"\n\nInstead of citing a single Ohio example, however, Sholty described efforts in other states including Missouri and Wisconsin. His organization is part of the Heartland Institute, which made a name for itself sowing doubt about climate change and the link between smoking and cancer.\n\nJason Snead's Honest Elections Project is a business alias for The 85 Fund, a Leonard Leo-connected non-profit that spends heavily on conservative causes. He argued multiple rounds of tallying open more opportunities for legal challenges. Snead also noted a more complex ballot will make recounts more time consuming.\n\nBut argued ranked choice voting threatens \"the American tradition of one person, one vote,\" but then went on to discount the validity of those voters' choices.\n\n\"It is dubious to say that a candidate who wins by redistributing votes truly enjoys majority support,\" he argued. \"There's clearly a difference between a first and a third-place pick. To a voter the latter may signify indifference to a candidate, outright opposition, or it may signify nothing at all.\"\n\nAlthough there aren't any Ohio cities pushing for ranked choice, grass roots groups are organizing around the issue. Rank the Vote Ohio is the state chapter of an organization pushing for ranked choice voting in 29 states.\n\nBy letting voters express support for more than one candidate, the group contends, they're less likely to compromise - casting votes for a candidate who isn't their top choice because that candidate is unlikely to win. Those concerns about a \"spoiler\" candidate dramatically reduce the potential impact of independent and third-party candidates. In response, Rank the Vote believes candidates will emphasize broad appeal in their campaigns, rather than divisive rhetoric.\n\nRank the Vote Ohio director Kyle Herman adds the proposed legislation tramples on constitutional 'home rule' authority, \"which empowers local governments to make decisions based on their local needs instead of a one-size-fits-all approach dictated by the state.\"\n\n\"This is why the Ohio Supreme Court ruled in 1923 that Ohio cities have a constitutional right to use ranked choice voting,\" he added in reference to the case Reutener v. City of Cleveland .\n\nWhile Rank the Vote Ohio is itself part of a multi-state organization, he dismissed the Senate bill's supporters as \"out of state lobbyists,\" and argued they're \"part of a national front that is trying to undermine election integrity by suppressing voters' choices and subverting majority rule.\"\n\nFollow OCJ Reporter Nick Evans on Twitter.\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nSUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.\n\nOhio Capital Journal is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

REUTERS/Jonathan Drake\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) as Donald Trump's next secretary of state would no doubt be \"a hawkish choice\" as the president-elect continues to build out his incoming administration, according to Axios co-founder Mike Allen , who adds the pick also sends a reassuring signal.\n\n\"This is to be reassuring to people around the world, to Republicans, to Democrats in Washington, of the choices that president-elect Trump had,\" Allen told CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins during an interview Monday near Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Florida. \"Marco Rubio is a very traditional Republican.\"\n\nAllen, who described Rubio as \"a great American story,\" noted that the Florida senator is the son of two Cuban immigrants, and would be the nation's first Latino secretary of state. Rubio, who Trump famously mocked as \"little Marco\" during the 2016 campaign, is also somebody who can carry Trump's message, a trait the former president \"really values.\"\n\nALSO READ: What Trump's win really means for America\n\n\"The world is so different than when President Trump was in office before, now president-elect Trump is coming into wars,\" he said. \"This is a hawkish choice. He's been hawkish over the years on China, on Iran, on Cuba, but, as the reporting suggested earlier, he's moved toward Trump, including on the issue of a negotiated settlement for Ukraine, one of the biggest things on his plate, no question.\"\n\nAllen added that he views the administration picks that Trump has announced so far as \"confirmable.\"\n\n\"All very, like, responsible, reassuring to Republicans who were sort of hoping for the best Trump.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education building is seen in Washington, Nov. 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Private school vouchers and other school choice initiatives would expand under an order coming from President Donald Trump telling government agencies to repurpose federal dollars.\n\nThe Education Department is being told to use discretionary money to prioritize school choice programs and give states new guidance on how they can use federal money to support K-12 voucher programs.\n\nThe executive order that he plans to sign Wednesday could free up some pockets of federal money to be used on school choice, but it is not clear how far he could move the needle with federal money alone. The vast majority of school funding comes from state and local sources, and school choice policies are generally the purview of state governments.\n\nThe order says traditional public schools have failed students and that the new administration will reverse course \"by opening up opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\"\n\nOther agencies, including the departments of Defense and Health and Human Services and the Bureau of Indian Education, would be directed to help states and families find ways to use existing federal money for school choice programs.\n\nThe signing, as conservative groups are celebrating National School Choice, comes the same day that results from a national exam found that America's students have continued to fall behind in reading and made little improvement in math in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The order cites the National Assessment of Educational Progress finding that 70% of eighth-grade students were not proficient in reading and 72% were not proficient in math.\n\nResponding to the results, the Trump administration said it is \"committed to reorienting our education system to fully empower states, to prioritize meaningful learning and provide universal access to high-quality instruction.\"\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise to expand school choice , long a key part of the Republican education agenda. He promised to create \"massive funding preferences\" for states that adopt universal school choice - a policy that lets almost all families use taxpayer-funded education money to attend private schools, homeschooling or other options beyond local public schools.\n\nArizona became the first state to adopt universal school choice in 2022 and several Republican-states have followed. Opponents say the policy is designed to gut public education.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump also tried to expand school choice and he made Betsy DeVos, a prominent school choice advocate, as education secretary. DeVos worked with governors to expand state policies but failed to get Congress to pass legislation that would have provided tax breaks for donations made to scholarships for private schools or other education options.\n\nTrump has nominated billionaire professional wrestling mogul Linda McMahon to serve as his next education chief. McMahon, whose Senate hearing has not been scheduled yet, has called for an expansion of school choice policies.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Rand Paul, R-Bowling Green, speaks at the Americans for Prosperity-Kentucky rally for Amendment 2 at La Gala in downtown Bowling Green, Ky., Monday evening, Oct. 28, 2024. (Grace Ramey McDowell/Daily News via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The election of Donald Trump returns an ally of school choice to the White House, this time with a Republican-controlled Senate - and potentially House - that could be more supportive of proposals that fizzled during his first term.\n\nAlthough proposals to expand private schooling suffered high-profile defeats in several states, Trump's victory has brought new optimism to advocates of supporting school choice at the federal level. One of their main priorities: tax credits for donations to organizations that provide private school scholarships.\n\nJim Blew, who served as an assistant secretary in the U.S. Education Department in the first Trump administration, said he's hopeful the new Congress will greenlight ideas like tax credits for scholarships.\n\n\"The new members are all very clearly supportive of school choice, and I think that's going to change the dynamics,\" said Blew, who co-founded the conservative Defense of Freedom Institute.\n\nPrivate school choice comprises several ways of using taxpayer money to support education outside of traditional public schools, including vouchers , education savings accounts and tax-credit scholarships. The idea of giving this option to all families regardless of income - known as universal private school choice - has soared in popularity in recent years and is now enshrined in law in a dozen states. Nearly three dozen states have some form of private school choice.\n\nYet the concept has faced pushback - and not just from groups like teachers unions that have long advocated for keeping public money in public schools. Some conservatives in states with large rural communities have questioned the programs' merits, citing the lack of private schools in sparsely populated areas. In those areas, public school districts are often the largest employer.\n\nIn Tuesday's election, voters in Kentucky rejected a measure to enable public funding for private school attendance, and Nebraska voted to partially repeal a law that uses taxpayer money to subsidize private education. A proposed constitutional amendment in Colorado that would've established schoolchildren's \"right to school choice\" also was defeated .\n\nConcerns about diverting money from public education appeared to gain traction in deep-red Kentucky and Nebraska. Ferial Pearson, the chair of an organization in Nebraska that advocates for public education, said it would continue working to provide public schools \"the support and resources they need to thrive.\"\n\nIn Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday that voters sent a clear message that taxpayer money should go to public schools.\n\n\"This should end any and all debate. And this should end any attempts to take money away from our public schools to send them to unaccountable private schools,\" Beshear said at a news conference. He renewed his pitch for larger pay raises for public school teachers and other school personnel, along with his plan to establish universal pre-K across Kentucky.\n\nTo some observers, it was unsurprising that even states that voted for Trump took a stand against school choice.\n\n\"Especially in the wake of the pandemic, with all the school closures and learning loss and chronic absenteeism , parents want something different - but they also like their public schools,\" said Liz Cohen, the policy director at FutureEd, a nonpartisan research center at Georgetown University. \"People want something new, but it doesn't mean they want to get rid of everything.\"\n\nCohen, who has studied private school choice expansion across the country, emphasized decisions on a ballot measure \"feel a lot more local and specific than who you're voting for for president.\"\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump touted school choice as a form of greater parental rights, aimed at countering what conservative critics describe as leftist indoctrination in classrooms and promoting a free-market approach to education.\n\nOne of his platform pledges is to \"serve as a champion for America's homeschool families\" and \"to protect the God-given right of every parent to be the steward of their children's education.\" He proposes allowing homeschooling families to use 529 college savings plans for spending on their children's educational expenses, an option he advanced for private-school families during his first term.\n\nIn that term, Trump tapped Betsy DeVos - a fervent supporter of school choice - as his education secretary. That administration, however, struggled to get its school choice pitches off the ground. An effort to provide federal tax credits for scholarship donations flopped, as did proposals to slash federal public school programs by billions of dollars.\n\nWith a more favorable Congress, those initiatives could have a better shot. U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and the frontrunner to chair the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, has supported tax incentives for scholarship donations. And Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he will focus the next Congress on \"maximizing school choice for parents and holding woke university administrators accountable.\"\n\nSome conservatives argue there would be benefits to leaving the issue to states.\n\n\"I ... worry that we're going to return to the political dynamics of Trump's first term, which were very bad for the charter schools sector in blue states,\" said Michael Petrilli, the president of the Fordham Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \"Because Trump strongly supported school choice, including charter schools, he made those issues radioactive on the left, so reform-oriented Democrats were sidelined or silenced.\"\n\nIn other races around the country, preliminary results show victories for school board candidates in Los Angeles and Chicago were concentrated among candidates who promoted traditional public education over alternatives such as charters.\n\nIn Texas, various pro-voucher legislators endorsed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott won their races. Abbott had sought to unseat GOP legislators who'd voted against a plan to subsidize private school tuition with public money. The newly elected candidates could give Abbott the votes needed to pass that voucher legislation.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Bruce Schreiner contributed to this report from Louisville, Ky. ___\n\nThe Associated Press' education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic, File)\n\nWyndham Hotels & Resorts rejected an unsolicited $8 billion buyout offer from Choice Hotels, a smaller chain that went public Tuesday with its bid after negotiations broke down.\n\nWyndham, which runs Days Inn, La Quinta, Ramada and a host of other brands, on Tuesday called the proposal \"opportunistic\" and said that it undervalues its growth potential. The offer was rejected unanimously by its board, the company said.\n\n\"Choice's offer is underwhelming, highly conditional and subject to significant business, regulatory and execution risk,\" Wyndham Chairman Stephen Holmes said in a prepared statement. \"Choice has been unwilling or unable to address our concerns.\"\n\nWyndham has engaged Choice and its advisors multiple times to explore the risks of a potential deal, Holmes said, but decided it would likely take more than a year to determine what would be required to clear antitrust review.\n\nChoice Hotels International said it went public with its bid after six months of negotiations broke down.\n\n\"A few weeks ago, Choice and Wyndham were in a negotiable range on price and consideration, and both parties have a shared recognition of the value opportunity this potential transaction represents, said Choice CEO Patrick Pacious. \"We were therefore surprised and disappointed that Wyndham decided to disengage. While we would have preferred to continue discussions with Wyndham in private, following their unwillingness to proceed, we feel there is too much value for both companies' franchisees, shareholders, associates, and guests to not continue pursuing this transaction.\"\n\nChoice, based in Rockville, Maryland, is offering $49.50 in cash and 0.324 shares of Choice common stock for each Wyndham share they own, a 20% premium to Wyndham's last closing price.\n\nWyndham shareholders, under the most recent offer, would be able to choose either cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. Wyndham would also get two seats on the new board.\n\nThe deal has a total value of about $7.8 billion. When including debt, it's valued at approximately $9.8 billion.\n\nC. Patrick Scholes of Truist Securities said in a note to clients that he believes Choice is making an attractive offer to Wyndham's shareholders, but that Holmes, who is very well versed in mergers and acquisitions, may be \"strategically holding out for a somewhat better offer from Choice or from someone else.\"\n\nChoice first approached Wyndham in April, offering $80.00 per share, with 40% of that cash and 60% Choice stock, but was rejected, Choice said.\n\nIt bumped the offer to $85 per share as the board chairs and CEOs of each company met, then on Tuesday the offer was increased to $90 per share.\n\nChoice operates about 7,500 hotels in 46 countries. It's seeking to absorb a much larger chain in Wyndham, which operates nearly 9,300 hotels that also include Howard Johnson, Super 8 and Travelodge.\n\nWyndham, based in Parsippany, New Jersey, posted a profit of $355 million last year with revenue of $1.5 billion.\n\nLike most hotels, it has benefited from booming travel in recent years.

That has cooled a bit this year as people become more cost conscious about their trips due to inflation and after spending more freely for more than a year.\n\nWyndham's shares are up more than 170% since it stock price tumbled close to $25 each at the start of the pandemic.\n\nShares of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Inc. jumped 9% in afternoon trading Tuesday.\n\nShares of Choice Hotels International Inc. fell more than 5%.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Not all elections look the same. Here are some of the different ways states run their voting\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nThe U.S. general election this November will decide the country's direction, but it is far from a nationally administered contest. Here's a look at some notable caveats, edge cases, and oddities in certain states for the 2024 election.\n\nFILE - A man tallies the votes from the five ballots cast just after midnight, Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2020, in Dixville Notch, N.H.

(AP Photo/Josh Reynolds, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. general election on Nov. 5 will decide the country's direction, but it is far from a nationally administered contest. The 50 states and the District of Columbia run their own elections, and each does things a little differently.\n\nHere's a look at some notable variations in the 2024 election:\n\nTo win the presidency outright, a candidate must receive at least 270 of the 538 votes in the Electoral College. In 48 states, the statewide winner gets all of that state's electoral votes, and that's also the case in the nation's capital.\n\nIn Maine and Nebraska, the candidate who receives the most votes in each congressional district wins one electoral vote from that district. The candidate who wins the statewide vote receives another two.\n\nIn 2020, Democrat Joe Biden received three of Maine's four electoral votes because he won the popular vote in the state and its 1st Congressional District. Republican Donald Trump received one electoral vote from the 2nd Congressional District. Trump won four of Nebraska's five votes for winning the popular vote in the state as well as its 1st and 3rd Congressional Districts; Biden received one electoral vote for winning the 2nd Congressional District.\n\nIn ranked choice voting, voters rank candidates for an office in order of preference on the ballot. If no candidate is the first choice for more than 50% of voters, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes redistributed to their next choice. This continues, with the candidate with the fewest votes getting eliminated, until someone emerges with a majority of votes.\n\nMaine uses ranked choice voting in state-level primaries and for federal offices in the general election. That means Maine voters can rank presidential, Senate and House candidates on ballots that include the Democrat and the Republican who advanced out of their respective party primaries, plus third-party and independent candidates who qualify.\n\nThe presidential ballot will include Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris, plus three other candidates. In the six years since implementing ranked choice voting, the state has used it twice in races for Congress in its 2nd Congressional District. The 2020 presidential race did not advance to ranked choice voting, with the winners of the state and in each congressional district exceeding 52% of the vote.\n\nAlaska holds open primaries for statewide offices and sends the top four vote-getters, regardless of party, to the general election, where the winner is decided using ranked choice voting. In all legislative and statewide executive offices, Alaskans can rank up to four names that can include multiple candidates from the same party.\n\nThe exception is the presidency, which is eligible for ranked choice voting in Alaska for the first time. This year, there will be eight presidential tickets on the ballot, and Alaskans can rank all candidates if they choose to. The last time the winner of the presidential contest in Alaska failed to surpass 50% of the vote was in 1992, when third-party candidate Ross Perot won almost 20% of the national popular vote.\n\nBut in 2022, both Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski won their elections after both went to ranked choice voting.\n\nAnother wrinkle this year? In Alaska, where ranked choice voting was implemented by ballot measure in 2020, there's a voter initiative on the ballot this fall to repeal it.\n\nCalifornia and Washington hold open primaries in which all candidates run on the same ballot and the two top vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of party. This year, there are two House races in Washington that include candidates of the same party, one with two Republicans and one with two Democrats. There are four in California: three with only Democrats and one with only Republicans.\n\nThe winning party in those six districts will be reflected in The Associated Press' online graphic showing the balance of power in the House at poll close, rather than once a winner is declared because the party of the winner is a foregone conclusion.\n\nLouisiana holds what it refers to as its \"open primaries\" on the same day the rest of the country holds its general election. In Louisiana, all candidates run on the same open primary ballot. Any candidate who earns more than 50% of the vote in the primary wins the seat outright.\n\nIf no candidate exceeds 50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters advance to a head-to-head runoff, which can end up pitting two Republicans or two Democrats against each other. Louisiana refers to these contests as its \"general election.\"\n\nThat will change for elections for the U.S. House starting in 2026 when congressional races will have earlier primaries that are open only to registered members of a party. Certain state races will continue to hold open primaries in November, but the change will prevent future members of Congress from waiting until December - a month later than the rest of the country - to know whether they are headed to Washington.\n\nIn Nebraska, any measure that receives approximately 123,000 valid signatures qualifies for the ballot. This year, two measures relating to abortion met this threshold.\n\nOne would enshrine in the Nebraska Constitution the right to have an abortion until fetal viability or later, to protect the health of the pregnant woman. The other would write into the constitution the current 12-week ban , with exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the pregnant woman.\n\nThis marks the first time since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade that a state has measures that seek to roll back abortion rights and protect abortion rights on the ballot at the same time.\n\nIt's possible voters could end up approving both measures. But because they're competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the measure with the most \"for\" votes will be the one adopted, according to the Nebraska secretary of state.\n\nIn primary elections, a handful of states, mostly in the South, go to runoffs if no candidate receives at least 50% of the vote. In races with more than two candidates, runoffs in those states are common. Several states held primary runoffs this year.\n\nGeorgia uses the same rules in general elections. The last three Senate races there went to runoffs because a third-party candidate won enough of the vote to prevent the Republican or Democratic nominee from exceeding 50% of the vote.\n\nBut this year, runoff possibilities may be confined to downballot races such as state legislature. There's no Senate race there this year, and the U.S. House races have only two candidates on the ballot.\n\nThis is common in states that span multiple time zones. In most states, polls close at the same time in each time zone.\n\nThe AP will not call the winner of a race before all the polls in a jurisdiction are scheduled to close, even if votes already reported before that time make clear who will win the race. So if there is a statewide race in a state where polls close at 8 p.m. local time, but some of the state is in the Eastern time zone and some of the state is in Central time zone, the earliest the AP can call the winner is 8 p.m. CST/9 p.m. EST.\n\nThe AP will still show the results as they arrive from counties with closed polls.\n\nSome of the biggest states with split poll close times are Florida, Michigan, Texas and Oregon. Tennessee is an exception, as even though the state is in both the Eastern and the Central time zones, all counties coordinate their voting to conclude at the same time.\n\n____\n\nRead more about how U.S. elections work at Explaining Election 2024 , a series from The Associated Press aimed at helping make sense of the American democracy.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nFILE - Students and parents rally at the Ohio Statehouse in support of possible changes that would increase eligibility for taxpayer-funded school vouchers to K-12 students statewide, May 17, 2023, in Columbus, Ohio. National Republicans are poised to support \"universal school choice\" as part of the policy platform they adopt at the 2024 Republican National Convention, which starts next week on Monday, July 15, 2024. (AP Photo/Samantha Hendrickson, File)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - National Republicans are poised to support \"universal school choice\" as part of the policy platform they adopt at next week's convention in Milwaukee, a goal supporters see as the culmination of decades advocating for parents' autonomy to pick their children's schools. To opponents, it's a thinly veiled blueprint for gutting public education.\n\nThe term can mean different things to different people - from erasing school boundaries, to open enrollment, to being able to curate your child's individual curriculum, to parental control over K-12 course content.\n\nBut education experts across the political spectrum interpret the GOP platform's wording as favoring the type of approach adopted in states like West Virginia and Ohio , which make available taxpayer-funded vouchers, or scholarships, that can follow a child regardless of income to any public or private school.\n\n\"In our way of thinking, this is kind of your money, your children and your choice for where they want to go to school,\" said Lisa B. Nelson, CEO of the American Legislative Exchange Council, which launched an Education Freedom Alliance in January to fight for just that. About a dozen states now have such programs, and proposals are in play in another 16, according to the alliance.\n\nNelson said this is the first time the GOP platform has gone beyond merely supporting school choice to calling for it as a universal option. It remains unclear how that would come to pass, given the platform also calls for shuttering the U.S. Department of Education, founded in 1979, and sending education policy-making \"back to the States, where it belongs.\"\n\nRepublican Donald Trump's presidential campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the platform.\n\n\"Republicans believe families should be empowered to choose the best Education for their children,\" the platform says.\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for President Joe Biden's re-election campaign, said eliminating the department - which oversees Head Start , administers college financial aid programs , conducts education research and enforces civil rights laws - \"isn't just bad policy, it would rip vital support away from our most vulnerable children, leaving them less likely to graduate from high school or attend college.\"\n\nChad Aldis, vice president for Ohio policy at the conservative Thomas B. Fordham Institute, said declaring universal school choice as a policy goal and carrying it out are two very different things.\n\n\"I think empowering families with high-quality options is the right approach, but the details on how much funding is available, whether there are income constraints, those are the types of questions that would have to be answered,\" he said.\n\nState programs have faced a host of legal and practical questions as they've expanded voucher programs. The scholarships were once available only to low-income students in academically struggling districts, but they've evolved into catch-all offerings applicable to public, private, religious and charter schools. Opponents argue the expansive programs take money away from public schools that serve most of the country's students and benefit higher-income families choosing to attend expensive private or religious schools.\n\nThe Hope Scholarship Program in West Virginia survived a constitutional challenge in 2022, but the number of school districts signing onto a lawsuit against Ohio's EdChoice has ballooned since the voucher program became universal last summer.\n\nThis year's Republican plank also calls for treating \"Homeschooling Families equally,\" which could take universality to yet another level.\n\nKim Anderson, executive director of the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union, said Republicans' plan would \"throw chaos into the lives of American families\" without addressing what parents tell her members are their two highest priorities: the availability of mental health services and school safety.\n\n\"Public education has been a common good in this country since its inception, and to eliminate public education puts our democracy and our economy and the fabric of a diverse, inclusive society at risk,\" she said.\n\nOther policy priorities include: stripping federal funds from any school that engages in \"inappropriate political indoctrination,\" guaranteeing that students can pray and read the Bible in school, \"hardening\" schools' disciplinary standards as a way of curbing violence, eliminating teacher tenure and adopting merit pay, and rejecting efforts to nationalize civics education.\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, decried the entire GOP education platform, saying it sets up \"a defunding mechanism and a mechanism to give a tax break to the wealthy.\"\n\n\"My question to them is, what are they afraid of?\" she said. \"Why are they afraid of critical thinking? Why are they afraid of freedom to learn and freedom to teach? Why are they afraid of honest history? Why are they afraid of diversity?\"\n\nALEC's Nelson said supporters of choice believe vigorous competition makes all schools better.\n\nAnd calls for broadening school choice are not coming exclusively from Republicans. In Louisiana, six Democrats voted in favor of a universal school choice bill in April.\n\n\"As I watch children in poverty, trapped in failing schools, who can hardly read, I'd be damned if I will continue to defend the status quo,\" Democratic Rep. Jason Hughes, who represents New Orleans, opined on the floor before casting his vote.\n\nDemocrats also have voted in favor of expanded school choice in Nebraska and Pennsylvania. In Georgia, state Rep. Mesha Mainor left the party last year in part because of a differences over school vouchers.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File)\n\nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) - An uncommon system of voting could be central to which party controls the U.S. House this fall - or even the presidency.\n\nIn Maine and Alaska, voters in competitive congressional districts will elect a winner using ranked choice voting .\n\nRather than cast a single vote for their preferred candidate, voters rank their choices in order of preference on the ballot. If a candidate is the first choice of more than 50% of voters in the first round of counting, that candidate is the winner.\n\nBut if no candidate surpasses 50%, the count continues in round two. The candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes redistributed to their next choice. This continues with the candidate with the fewest votes getting eliminated until someone emerges with a majority of votes.\n\nRanked choice voting has become more popular in recent years, particularly at the municipal level.\n\nVoters in two dozen cities and counties - from New York and Minneapolis to Boulder, Colorado - used ranked choice voting in 2023, according to FairVote , a nonpartisan organization that advocates for the expansion of ranked choice voting. Seven other cities voted in favor of preserving, adopting or expanding ranked choice voting.\n\nProponents of ranked choice voting argue the system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions, eliminates the spoiler effect and discourages negative campaigning. Opponents say it's confusing and can result in a candidate without the largest number of first-choice votes ultimately prevailing.\n\nBecause they take place over multiple rounds that are tabulated only once all first-choice votes are counted, elections in Alaska and Maine that advance to ranked choice are often resolved a week or more after Election Day.\n\nMaine adopted ranked voting in elections in 2016 in a statewide referendum. It is used in all statewide primaries with more than two candidates. In general elections, it is used for federal offices including the presidency but not in state races, such as for governor or the Legislature, because it runs afoul of the Maine Constitution.\n\nIt quickly came into play - twice - in Maine's 2nd Congressional District. Then-GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin won the most first choice votes in 2018, but lost to Democratic Rep. Jared Golden when votes were reallocated after removing the third- and fourth-place finishers. The process repeated four years later when Golden beat Poliquin in a rematch.\n\nA federal judge twice upheld the constitutionality of ranked voting in separate challenges by Poliquin in 2018 and a group of voters in 2020.\n\nThis year, only two candidates are explicitly on the ballot in the 2nd District - Golden and Republican Austin Theriault - but the race could nonetheless go to ranked choice voting because votes will be counted for a third candidate whose write-in candidacy has been recognized by the state.\n\nIf no first-round winner receives a majority of the vote on Election Day, then the ballots are shipped to the state capital, where the ballots are entered into a computer. The process takes about a week before the final tally is run and the winner declared.\n\nAlaskans approved the use of ranked choice voting in a 2020 statewide initiative. It is used in all general elections, including for the presidency, but not in state primaries. Alaska's state primaries are open, so all candidates, regardless of party, run on the same ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election.\n\nPresidential primaries are different. Candidates can make the ballot by winning a recognized party's primary or successfully petitioning the state Division of Elections. This year, there will be eight presidential tickets on the ballot in Alaska; voters can rank all of them if they choose.\n\nThe first use of ranked choice voting - and when it first came into play - was in a 2022 special election for the state's at-large congressional district. Now-Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat, received the most votes in the first round of voting, while two Republican candidates finished second and third. She surpassed 50% of the vote when the third-place candidate was eliminated.\n\nPeltola went on to win the regularly scheduled election, which also used ranked choice voting, later that year. She faces Republican Nick Begich, one of the two candidates she defeated in 2022, and two others in November.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lisa Murkowski was reelected in 2022 in a race that went to ranked choice voting.\n\nAlaska will vote next month on a ballot measure that would repeal the state's new open primary and ranked choice general election system.\n\nThe more candidates in a race, the more likely it is that candidates will split the vote and nobody will win a majority, advancing the election to ranked choice voting. The presidential ballots in Maine and Alaska will include more than just Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, so it's possible those states' races could wind up going to ranked choice voting.\n\nMaine is one of two states that gives an electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district along with two to the statewide winner, and ranked choice voting could go into effect if no presidential candidate receives a majority in one of the districts.\n\nIn 2020, before Alaska's ranked choice voting was in place, Trump received about 53% of the state's vote. Democrat Joe Biden won Maine with about 53% of the vote that year.\n\n____\n\nSweedler reported from Washington.\n\n____\n\nRead more about how U.S. elections work at Explaining Election 2024 , a series from The Associated Press aimed at helping make sense of the American democracy.

      "text": "The Power of Choice\n\nPoet, Pulitzer Prize winner, and since 1950 the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard, ARCHIBALD MACLEISH is much in demand as a commencement speaker, primarily because, as a passionately loyal American , he has the gift and eloquence to call out of others the self-assurance which this country needs if we are to be reliable in our many commitments. The words that follow were spoken at the Radcliffe Commencement. but they were also written with the Atlantic in mind.\n\n1\n\nWHAT is in question in this country is the survival of the American confidence that men can choose the future.\n\nFor some weeks past we have been listening to a national argument which the American press agrees to call the Great Debate. The consensus of opinion seems to be that the press is wrong: that the Great Debate is neither great nor much of a discussion. Senator Wiley's early demand that the highest and most responsible military officer of the Republic be required to testify to what the Senator called personal feelings and private animosities raised understandable doubts as to the elevation of the proceedings. And the effect of the whole dispute on the Congress and the country has been something less than illuminating. When the principal arguments were all in, the popular verdict apparently came to this: that General MacArthur was wholly right and that General MacArthur'sopinions were altogether wrong.\n\nNevertheless the press, for once, was wiser than the people. The confused and interminable altercation now going forward in Washington and in the Republic is, without any doubt whatever, a debate, and the debate deserves the adjective. Upon its issue will depend the kind of country this country is to be.\n\nWhat is in debate is not merely our policy in the Far East - whether or not the Korean War should have been extended to China. What is in debate is the underlying question General MacArthur was obliged to face when his proposal was challenged on the ground that the extension of the Korean War might mean war with Russia and so a third world war. What is in debate is the view of human history, of the freedom of human choice, which we as Americans are prepared to hold.\n\nIn the past it has been our American conviction - a conviction implicit in our actions rather than explicit in our words-that history is made by men , not men by history. It is not only possible, we have thought, but a self-evident truth that a free people, if it possesses the virility and the inventiveness and the daring, can choose for itself the kind of world it wishes to live in and then create that world. A free people is capable, that is to say, of the pursuit of happiness - the pursuit of human happiness. We have not believed that men's lives, or the forms of their societies, or the future to which they are committed are determined in advance by the patterns of the stars or the prophecies of the books or the necessities of the blood or the character of the countryside into which they are born, or even by the laws of economics. Above all, we have not believed, as older societies believed before us, that the events of human history - either disasters or triumphs - are inevitable.\n\nThe whole idea of the inevitable has been repugnant to us. Nothing, we have opined, is inevitable but death and taxes. Anything else in the world can be changed, including - including particularly- the prophecies. Anything else can be changed and, for the most part, has been: forms of government, dogmas of belief, methods of husbandry, habits of life - even the man himself: even the compulsion of the blood, the shape of the head, the length and weight of the body, and the color of the hair. We have had no respect for fate: we worshiped God, not fate. We have had no particular reverence for history: wo believed in men, not history. History was the history men made, not the veiled divinity that told them what they had to be.\n\nOur confidence, in brief, was in the future. Which is to say that our confidence was in the power of human choice to make the future. We considered that a free people can make the future for itself: master its destiny.\n\nThat was the American position: the position made evident in our actions from the first movement west across the continent; made articulate sometimes also in our words. We had no illusions about the orthodoxy of our view. We knew perfectly well that the great majority of mankind disagreed with us and always had. The orthodox conception of man's place in the universe, man's relation to time and to event, had always been the very different conception that man is the victim of the inevitable, whose only escape from the ineluctable design is to accept it. The authors of that reckless and willful phrase about the pursuit of happiness in the Declaration of American Independence had every reason to know how their affirmation would be received in older, wiser, and less courageous countries. We have learned since, throughout the history of our literature, how stubborn, how bitter, and how vindictive that reaction can be: how scornfully the believers in fate can speak of our precarious belief in man and in man's future; how sneeringly the servants of determinism can dispose of our \"idea of progress,\" as they choose to call it; how contemptuously the worshipers of certainty can dismiss our self-confidence, our self-reliance, above all the rash impiety of our willingness to think for ourselves, and say as we think, and do as we say.\n\nNevertheless, and until this time, we have held to our convictions. We have nourished an inarticulate belief that there is a relation of some kind between the individual human freedom vve mean to have and the rejection of the dogma of inevitability. Freedom and inevitability, we have thought, cannot live together. No nation can be free which does not keep the future open in its people's minds.\n\nNow, it appears, we are no longer certain. The world has changed. The dogma of inevitability has made new converts throughout half the earth, and the menace of their fanatic faith has made still further converts, even among us. Fear has accomplished what persuasion never could. Americans - many Americans it seems - are ready to accept the doctrine of inevitability for themselves and to force it on their fellow citizens. Unless we accept the inevitable, they tell us, the inevitable will destroy us. And the country listens, ponders, doubts. And the issue is joined. The petty debate over the personality of a man becomes the great debate over the destiny of the Republic.\n\nTHE MacArthur controversy is, of course, the occasion of the Great Debate, not the cause. General MacArthur did not invent the view of human history he apparently accepts. The controversy which centers on his name has, however, posed the underlying issue in terms which no one can mistake, and has related it to a decision which the country, largely because of the controversy, can no longer avoid. That decision is a decision affecting our survival as a people and, very probably, the survival of our world.\n\nOnly on the surface is the difference between MacArthur and his critics a military difference. Actually it is a difference of belief, a difference of essential philosophy: a difference touching the freedom of the people of the United States to choose, in the greatest dilemma they have ever faced. Fundamentally what General MacArthur and General Bradley disagree about is the freedom of the people of the United States to pursue their traditional policy of peace and the defense of human liberty in the modern world. To General MacArthur the risk of Russian intervention and, so, of world war should not deter us from extending the Korean War to China and winning a \"victory,\" because the risk of Russian intervention has already been taken: because events, that is to say, are out of our hands. To General Bradley, the chance of Russian intervention should deter us because events are not out of our hands: because, as the General puts it, we have avoided war with Russia thus far and if we can continue to avoid it long enough we may be able to avoid it altogether.\n\nNeither General knows or pretends to know what Russia will actually do. Both agree that Russia may attack us at any moment - that the rulers of Russia will be restrained neither by humanity nor by moral scruple: only by fear. Both are aware that the Russians themselves regard war between the Soviets and the United States as inevitable: their doctrine of economic determinism makes it so. The difference between the two men is a difference as to our freedom of action under these circumstances. To one, we can still choose between the struggle for freedom and peace on the one hand and world war on the other; to the second, we are already, in effect, at war: the millstones are turning, the grain must be ground.\n\nThis is the difference also between the two opinions which have been formed, regardless of party, behind the principal figures of the debate. Those on the one side talk in terms of what they call \"realism\" and \"courage,\" by which they mean the \"realistic\" acceptance of the inevitability of war, and the \"courageous\" adoption in China and, presumably, elsewhere of a policy based upon what they regard as the unblinking recognition of that fact. Those on the ot her continue to talk in terms of hope, contending that we have not yet lost control of the great election between peace and war: that it is still possible, if we have the courage and the patience, to avoid world war on the one hand and Communist domination of the earth on the other.\n\nTo men of the second opinion there is room for maneuver in the narrow strait between these two dangers. We can make ourselves too strong to attack and too important to the world to isolate: the party of peace and the fortress of power; the standard of effective freedom to which men, still free, can rally. We can gain allies for ourselves and arm them. We can strengthen the economy of the free world and build backfires of hope in the exploited areas where hunger and despair make tinder for the Russian torch. We can put together regional alliances - strong points of mutual confidence such as the Atlantic Pact within the structure of the United Nations and find means to give the defeated peoples of Germany and Japan a stake in the common future. We can implement the Charter of the United Nations by building out of the United Nations command which already exists in Korea a permanent United Nations police force and so enlist the universal longing for peace behind our purposes rather than the purposes of the Russians. We can turn our faces toward a free and peaceful future for the world, planning it, organizing it as we can under the Point Four program or otherwise, giving mankind a measure of hope instead of a certainty of slaughter, and so breaking the evil spell the Russians, with their alternatives of spiritual slavery or inevitable war, have woven.\n\nTO MEN who hold the first opinion - to the \"realists\" - all this is folly if not actually something worse than folly. It is folly to talk of avoiding war: we are already at war. So MacArthur: so Wedemeyer. It is nonsense to concern ourselves about what our allies think: our allies have no choice, they will think as we think or go without. So MacArthur: so the McCormick-McCarthy fringe. It is ridiculous to offer relief to suffering peoples: there is no time for relief - we cannot even be sure the grain we send to the starving in India will help us. As for the United Nations and regional alliances and the Atlantic Pact - all this is legalistic trifling. In the last analysis there are only the Russians and ourselves. The chips are down. The time has come to act: to act in China-to act wherever action is necessary- to act, that is, by force.\n\nIt is this latter position which reveals the true issue of the Great Debate. If you ask the \"realists\" why the chips are down; why there is no time; why war with Russia and hence world war is inevitable, they will reply, many of them: Because the Russians are committed; because the Russians will allow us no time; because the Russians say war is inevitable. But this can hardly be the actual reason. No American believes, and least of all the patriotic Americans who urge this view upon the country, that the Russians possess the exclusive power to decide the future for us all: that American intentions no longer count in the great decision. Certainly no American who knows the facts of record could believe anything so humiliating to his country and so false. It has yet to be demonstrated that American determination and persistence, backed by American strength and the strength of our friends in the free world, are incapable of deterring the Russians from an action which would precipitate the most terrible of all wars - a war fought with the weapons of extermination. On the contrary, the facts of record powerfully suggest that the Russians have already been deterred and may be deterred again.\n\nNo, the real reason why the advocates of this opinion believe in the inevitability of a war which has thus far been avoided - a war which no one wants and every decent man must dread for the world's sake if not for his own the real reason why the advocates of this opinion believe in the inevitability of war is that they accept the inevitability of war as dogma. War between the United States and Soviet Russia is inevitable to them, not because we cannot continue to avoid it in the future as we have in the past, regardless of Russian desires, but because war between the United States and Soviet. Russia is inevitable. It is not that they \"want\" war. MacArthur's partisans are no more the war party than Truman and Acheson and Marshall and Bradley are friends of the Communists. Both characterizations are insults to the public intelligence. MacArthur is doubtless as honest in saying that he hates war as Aeheson in demonstrating by the record of his office that he has been one of the foremost opponents of Communism. But MacArthur and his supporters, however they may hate war, accept it. They accept it as \"already here.\"They accept it as inescapable. They accept it as inevitable in the nature of things. They accept it for reasons beyond reason. And, accepting it, they reject as weakness, or as folly, or as what they call appeasement, the notion that the United States can continue to avoid war and still stand firm: that a free people can shape the future for itself even in a world which holds the Russians: that men can master their destiny even though destiny presents it self in the vast, impersonal terms in which it shows itself to us, and even though whole peoples make a religion of submission to it.\n\nWhether General MacArthur's \"realists\" realize it or not, it is their position and not the position of their opponents which approximates the philosophy they detest - the philosophy all decent men detest. The dogma of the inevitability of war between the United States and Russia is Communist dogma. Its origins are Marxist. Long before it was orthodox belief among MacArthur's followers here, it was orthodox belief among the Communists in Russia. A full generation ago when the economic and political interests of the United States and the Soviet Union conflicted nowhere on earth and no American newspaper publisher - not even the most unprincipled- shouted for a Russian War, war between Russia and the United States was already official doctrine in the Soviet Union. The Commissars had consulted the oracles. The sacred viscera had been observed. The holy texts had been deciphered and the flight of birds. War was in the tarot cards and war would therefore come. Why? Because the theory said so. Because the words were written in the book.\n\nThe whole proposition was, in its origins, a product of authoritarian superstition - a superstition which reads the future of mankind in the lea leaves of the economic systems: war or peace, life or death. And it was by authoritarian propagation that it was domesticated in this country. The first to tell us that war between the Soviet Union and the United States was inevitable were former Communists: men who had left the discipline of the Communist Party but had not lost the habit of the Party's thought. And the first to welcome the assurance were those in the United States whose inclination had always been authoritarian and who found authoritarian ideas - even the ideas of their enemies - more palatable than a traditional American liberalism they had never understood.\n\nIndeed, even at the present moment, the propagation of the dogma of inevitable war by certain politicians and certain publishers pursues the authoritarian pattern. Those who criticize the dogma are to be silenced. An Administration policy aimed at the avoidance of war is to be discredited as motivated by Communist sympathy if not actually by subversive purpose. Advocacy of peace is to be stigmatized as treason to the United States. And the full Communist doctrine of the inevitability of war between the United States and Russia is to be forced upon the country as American doctrine until-ultimate irony - all who refuse to accept it can be denounced as Communists.\n\nWhat the consequence of the Great Debate will be in terms of military policy is not, I think, in doubt. The country plainly prefers our present attempt to shape a future narrowly for ourselves between the two disasters of war and Communism to any \"realistic\" alternative thus far advanced. Indeed the country would welcome a determined and an idealistic effort to make that future more truly ours in place of the mere negation of Communism which we seem now to intend. We do not want war with Russia or with anyone else, and we will avoid war so long as it is in our power to do so. We are not yet convinced that we have lost that power.\n\nBut whether, in rejecting the proposal now before us, we will reject also the authoritarian philosophy on which that proposal rests, depends upon our willingness to see what the issue of the Great Debate actually is.\n\nThose who would impose the dogma of inevitable war as the determining consideration in the great decision we have to make are so vociferous in their claims of superior patriotism that they may confuse the actual issue in the minds of many men. The actual issue is whether we still believe, in a time of totalitarian governments and authoritarian ideologies and the mechanization of human life, in the proposition which the founders of this Republic regarded as self-evident: whether we still believe that history is lived by men, not men by history; whether we still regard the future as open to our aspirations, nol foreclosed to us by our fate; whether we still think of the \"arable field of events\" - Keats's great phrase - as arable by men, not frozen around them by an icy will; whether we still consider mankind to be capable of the pursuit of happiness or whether we have grown ashamed of that highhearted language and think of men now as mechanical figures helpless in the predetermined web of time.\n\nThe actual issue, that is to say, is the issue which torments our generation everywhere: the choice between the belief in ourselves and the belief in authority, in the predetermination of events. It was never, perhaps, in human history, more difficult or more dangerous for men to believe in themselves. But it was also never more necessary - never more necessary, surely, for us in the United States. For unless we can hope, unless we can keep the future open, unless we can continue to believe in our power to shape the future for ourselves, the future will be war and the war will be destruction for the world. It is, to me at least, inconceivable that in a country in which the tradition of belief in man is as vigorous as it is with us - a country shaped, indeed, by that tradition - the dogma of inevitability should take hold. And yet the seed is here. The labor is to crush it."

      "text": "A Remarkable School-Choice Experiment\n\nAre principals the key to improving schools?\n\nIn 2012, Los Angeles Unified School District set up an experiment. It offered parents in some parts of the city a new option: Instead of automatically sending their middle schoolers to their neighborhood high school, parents could instead pick between a few high schools in their area.\n\nSchool choice is usually about providing parents an option outside the traditional public-school system. From 2010 to 2021, public charter-school enrollment in the U.S. more than doubled , even as states across the country have made it easier for parents to use public funding for homeschooling and private-school options.\n\nBut Los Angeles did something different. It recognized the growing appetite for choice and wondered whether the normal public-school system could help satisfy it. The experiment was the sort ripe for an economics paper and, thankfully, someone took notice . Economist Christopher Campos's paper reveals that when public high schools were forced to compete for enrollment, achievement gaps narrowed, and college enrollment took off.\n\nIn today's episode of Good on Paper , I talk with Campos about why students improved in this new system, and we grapple with tough questions about school segregation, the no-excuses model, and the role of principals in student outcomes.\n\nListen to the conversation here:\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\n[ Music ]\n\nJerusalem Demsas: During the Obama administration, school choice was a central part of the national policy discussion. Political and policy debates between teachers' unions, parents, students, and policy wonks dominated, with liberals usually opposing school-choice reforms and conservatives supporting them.\n\nThat conversation is less central now-at least in Washington-but slowly, and without much fanfare, the school-choice movement has been racking up political wins across the country.\n\nAnd it's not just limited, targeted voucher programs. Activists have gotten some states to even allow parents to remove their public-school dollars from the system and use them for private school or even homeschooling.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nBut I have a question: Is it possible to get some of the benefits of school choice within the public-school system?\n\nThis is Good on Paper , a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives. I'm your host, Jerusalem Demsas, and today we're exploring just that question through an interesting paper that I don't think has gotten enough attention.\n\nOne of the great parts of my job is when I randomly come across an expert on a topic I'm less familiar with and it opens up a whole new line of inquiry and discussion.\n\nA couple of years ago I was in Chicago, and I met today's guest, Chris Campos. He's a labor economist at UChicago who focuses on the economics of education. And the research project he told me about then has been in the back of my head ever since.\n\nCampos is an L.A. native, and in 2012, the Los Angeles Unified School District, or LAUSD, tried something new.\n\nGiven the demand from parents for more school choice, LAUSD decided to run an experiment: What if they gave some high school parents their pick of a few different public high schools? School choice-but within the public-school system.\n\nWhat would that do for their students? How would that change the schools?\n\nChris was able to study this change closely, and his findings have really interesting implications for the future of public schools in America.\n\nChris, welcome to the show.\n\nChris Campos: Thank you for having me. Excited to be here.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. So we're going to talk about education, and we're going to get into a really interesting paper that you wrote about Los Angeles. But I feel like every time I start any conversation about education or schools or making schools better, we have to start at what even it means to say that something is a good school. And how do economists think of it, like you, and how do parents think of it? So just bare bones, how do we define what a good school is, what a good school does?\n\nCampos: All right. That's a fantastic question. I think economists-which is what I am by training-we tend to look at how students learn over time and, in particular, how much a particular school may contribute to student learning over time. So sometimes this is referred to as academic growth, achievement growth. And so statistical measures that capture how much schools contribute to student learning is what economists tend to use as their measures of school quality.\n\nNow, with that said, test scores aren't the only things that schools affect. Schools affect a host of noncognitive outcomes, as well. And so we could think about alternative measures, which are also capturing how schools affect these alternative measures. For what I'll be talking about today, it'll primarily be focused on learning-related or achievement-related outcomes.\n\nDemsas: How do parents think about it? Because when people tell me, Oh, my kid goes to a good school, doesn't go to a good school , do I think that they have learned whether or not the educational systems and priorities of their elementary school are causally increasing their student's ability to attend college? Or are they saying something else?\n\nCampos: Yeah. That's something that I've done some work on in separate papers. If you just survey parents-and a lot of researchers have done that-and you ask them what they prioritize when they're choosing schools, it's a pretty robust finding that most parents will tell you that they're concerned about safety.\n\nSafety is at the top of the list. Whether it be low- or higher-income parents, that's what they'll say. Achievement tends to come next. But if you start trying to distinguish the difference between an achievement level or a growth metric, parents aren't always able to tell the difference between the two.\n\nDemsas: And when parents are thinking about safety, and they're trying to assess achievement or whether or not their kid's school will be good, what heuristics are they using? Are they looking at online databases, or are there other heuristics they're looking for, searching for?\n\nCampos: Right. So I think there's these popular platforms, such as greatschools.org, that parents tend to heavily rely on. And in those platforms, they'll rank schools based on a host of factors. And some of these include growth metrics in some states where that data is publicly available, and in other locations that'll include just information about average achievement at schools.\n\nBut anecdotally, some parents that don't have access to these platforms or are unaware of them tend to just rely on heuristics, such as: Where do high-income kids go to schools? And they'll tend to associate a school that has high-income students as a higher-quality school. Or they'll use proxies, such as race, as well, to identify good schools. That doesn't necessarily mean those are schools that are most causally improving student learning, but these are heuristics that some parents tend to rely on when choosing schools if they find it challenging to observe these notions of school quality.\n\nDemsas: So part of this conversation is based around parent choice. Like, even when we're thinking about the classic view of how people pick their schools-where they move to a neighborhood, and they look for the schools when they're in that moving process-there's obviously an element of choice in there. But increasingly, choice in the American public-school system has been a range of things, from charter schools, and then also being able to use state dollars for homeschooling and private schools is increasingly normal.\n\nAnd that has been part of this broader movement that giving parents this option to pick where their kids go to school is better because it allows them to make the determination for their own family and discriminate between different educational opportunities. I know there's a lot of big literature here on school choice, and I'm asking you to oversimplify for us, but what do we know about how expanding school choice in these ways affects student outcomes? What's the lay of the land right now about that shift in the American educational landscape?\n\nCampos: The original school-choice reforms, advocated by Milton Friedman in the 1950s and the 1960s, are focused on educational-voucher programs. In more recent decades-the 1990s to start, in particular-there's been this rapid rise in charter schools. Voucher schools are private schools, while charter schools are still publicly funded but privately managed.\n\nBoth types of choice schools tend to compete with incumbent school districts for students. But even within public-school districts, there's still a substantial amount of school choice. In school districts with unified enrollment schemes, families have a substantial amount of choice. In others, they may have access to magnet programs or other programs that allow them to enroll in schools that are not their zone schools.\n\nSo when it comes to evaluating these reforms and what we know about their effectiveness, there's different perspectives one can take. To begin, one can ask: Do the students and families who exercise choice-whether it be the vouchers or the charter schools or the magnet programs-do they benefit from that? And so there's a host of studies studying these so-called participant effects.\n\nI'll start with vouchers. I'm going to focus on lottery-based evidence, and my overall sense of the literature, or read of the literature, is that there isn't strong evidence that vouchers causally improve student learning. So we can think about the Washington, D.C., Opportunity Scholarship Program that produced no test-score impacts. The study was roughly 2,300 students, where 60 percent of them were randomly offered a voucher program. Then you can follow these kids over time and just compare those that were offered vouchers to those that were not, and you're not finding much of an impact on test scores.\n\nThree voucher programs in New York City, Dayton, and Washington, D.C., are also a kind of quasi-experimental design. They find no average impacts on achievement. And there's this other popular voucher program, the Louisiana Scholarship Program, which found substantially large negative impacts on academic achievement, as captured through test scores on English and language arts and mathematics.\n\nSo most lottery-based studies of voucher programs in the United States tend to find no measurable impact. This Louisiana study is one that finds really large negative impacts. So that's participant effects for voucher programs.\n\nWe can think about the same types of studies when it comes to the charter literature. When it comes to charter schools, particularly in urban areas, there's numerous studies that have shown significant positive impacts on academic achievement, particularly in math and English and language arts. And they've been particularly beneficial for lower-performing students, nonwhite students, low-income students, and students with disabilities.\n\nBut most of the findings in this literature come from large urban areas, and they cover very few states. A lot of the most compelling evidence comes from Boston. Boston is not necessarily the most representative city in the United States, so there's limited generalizability in the results we have in the charter literature.\n\nWhen it comes to market-level effects-or studies of how choice programs affect the overall market-those are a bit more elusive because they're harder to study. And so this segues right into what I've been able to do in my Zones of Choice study, where they introduced centralized assignment systems in roughly 40 percent of the district-40 percent of high school students-and the other 60 percent remained in the status quo, with neighborhood-based assignment. And because there's this partial coverage of the Zones of Choice Program within LAUSD, this allows me to get at these market-level effects.\n\nDemsas: Can we back up a quick second? Because I think that the L.A. setting is really interesting, and I think that giving a lay of the land is going to be helpful here. So Los Angeles-it is a highly Hispanic school district. I mean, at this point, it's 70, nearly 75 percent Latino. And when they decided to do the Zones of Choice system-the ZOC system, which is what you're talking about-what exactly is that? What was the context in which they were making that shift?\n\nCampos: Right. So the ZOC program-or the Zones of Choice expansion that happened in 2012-was predated by a pilot, which was called the Belmont Zone of Choice. And the Belmont Zone of Choice organically formed after this large school-construction program that led to many new schools in the school district due to overcrowdedness.\n\nA lot of these new schools did not have attendance-zoned boundaries like most other schools in the district, so they were kind of just floating around. And, at the same time, there's this increased demand for charter schools, so a lot of families were leaving to charters. And the charter-enrollment share as of 2023, if I remember correctly, is roughly 36 percent, so the charter-school sector has a big presence in LAUSD. But going back to 2007, it was still on the rise.\n\nAnd so school-district administrators sensed that families had this inherent demand for more options. And so they experimented with this pilot, the Belmont Zone of Choice, where they clustered in some of these new schools, some existing traditional public high schools that were part of the district, into a larger zone of choice. And within this zone of choice in the Belmont area, families were allowed to enroll in any one of these schools. And so families could apply to different schools, and if there was oversubscription, a lottery would determine who got assigned to what school. But in this era-this is going back to 2007-it was very informal. There aren't really many records of how assignment was done during this era.\n\nAnd if we fast-forward five years, many of the same issues the district was facing-with charter competition, not being sure what to do with these extra schools that were just around the school district-they decided to expand the program, and they created 16 zones of choice to span-\n\nDemsas: And these are geographically bounded areas?\n\nCampos: That's correct.\n\nDemsas: Okay.\n\nCampos: So instead of a family having one neighborhood school, they're now going to have several nearby options, but their options are still going to be restricted based on the address.\n\nDemsas: And how did they decide which schools to include in the zones of choice? I know you said that basically, like, half of L.A. was split up into these zones, and the other half remained in the existing neighborhood school system?\n\nCampos: Right. If we look at where these zones are concentrated at, most of them are going to be in South, Central, and East Los Angeles, some in the San Fernando Valley, but most of them are going to be concentrated in these regions of the district that are relatively disadvantaged. Most of the census tracts that are part of the Zones of Choice Program are in the bottom quartile of the median income distribution in Los Angeles, as measured in the 2010 census, so really disadvantaged neighborhoods.\n\nAnd so, from one perspective, they were trying to introduce choice in sectors of the district where there was a lot of charter competition. Another perspective is, if you try to change the attendance-zone boundaries of families in West L.A., that's nearly impossible because you're going to-\n\nDemsas: West L.A. is, like, the richer part of L.A.\n\nCampos: The richer part of L.A., exactly. You're going to have a lot of parents that are going to go to the school-board meetings and complain about this and make the policy nearly impossible. So you're going to see that most of these zones are going to be in these disadvantaged neighborhoods where maybe there's not as much representation during the school-board meetings. And so the individual that was tasked with creating these zones of choice, I think he was a bit strategic in choosing neighborhoods where families would be a bit more amenable to the creation and molding of these new zones of choice.\n\nDemsas: Okay. Just to describe the process by which this works: Instead of your neighborhood school, you have now up to-and this is just high schools, right?\n\nCampos: That's right.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. So you have now three or five different high schools that you can pick that are all within a geographically bounded area. And then when people are finishing middle school, they get to apply. Or is it that they just rank their preferences? Or that it's a lottery system? How does it work?\n\nCampos: Every fall, at around September, parents are informed about the Zones of Choice Program in the case they had not heard about it. These are parents with children that are in eighth grade. And then the school district has a Zones of Choice office, and administrators at that office start arranging and scheduling numerous information sessions, where they communicate features of the program to parents. Schools organize open houses where they pitch themselves to students and try to make the best case for why they should go to that school or enroll in a given program.\n\nAnd then there's a deadline, usually November 15 or mid-November, where parents are required to submit an application, ranking every option in their zone of choice. And they have an incentive to submit an application because if they do not submit an application and they're part of the zones of choice program, they may be assigned a school that is not necessarily one that they prefer.\n\nDemsas: And what percentage of people submit applications? Is it high or-\n\nCampos: From what I've looked at the data, it's nearly everyone.\n\nDemsas: Okay.\n\nCampos: For the most part, yeah. Everyone submits an application; very few people don't. It's conditional on you being part of the district in eighth grade. I'm sure there's many families that are not part of the district in eighth grade, and so we never really observed them in the data input.\n\nAnd so then they submit an application, and then there's some centralized algorithm that then allocates students to schools based on their preferences and their priorities. And priorities tend to be geographic, sibling-based. But outside of that, there's no additional priorities. There's no screening mechanisms in this particular setting. This is in stark contrast to a place like New York City, where screening is particularly common, but not in the Zones of Choice setting.\n\nDemsas: And so what did you find? How did creating these small educational markets affect school quality?\n\nCampos: Right. Because roughly only 40 percent of the district gets these Zones of Choice Programs, and the other 60 percent does not, you can just compare trends between affected neighborhoods or students to unaffected students or neighborhoods, and then that differential change before and after the policy is expanded in 2012 informs us of how the overall policy affected student outcomes.\n\nBefore I get to the results, let me just tell you a bit about how ZOC students were doing before the program expands. So as ZOC students are entering high school, before the program comes into place, they're performing roughly 21 to 23 percent of a standard deviation more poorly on standardized exams.\n\nYou may ask, What is a standard deviation? So we can start by asking ourselves how much students typically learn in a year between grades seven and eight. Taking a number from an existing paper, that amount is roughly 26 percent of a standard deviation. And this allows us to translate that 23 percent of a standard deviation incoming-achievement gap that ZOC students face to roughly 159 learning days, given that a school year has 180 days.\n\nSo one way to interpret that 23 percent of a standard deviation incoming-achievement gap is that ZOC students are performing on standardized exams roughly equivalent to just having learned 159 less days than non-ZOC students. So that's an alternative way to view the incoming-achievement gap. So ZOC students are relatively disadvantaged, living in relatively disadvantaged neighborhoods in L.A. County, and also performing more poorly on academic standardized exams.\n\nWe fast-forward seven years, and the program leads to a roughly 16 percent of a standard deviation improvement on standardized exams. If we translate that to learning days, it's roughly 139 additional learning days.\n\nDemsas: Wow.\n\nCampos: So it nearly eliminates that incoming-achievement gap. We can also look at college enrollment, and we find that college enrollment increases by roughly 5 percentage points and that improvement in college enrollment is sufficiently large that it eliminates the pre-ZOC college-enrollment gap.\n\nDemsas: Okay. So basically the students who are in the ZOC schools-which you explained that these are the parts of L.A. that are disadvantaged, less likely to have a backlash from rich parents-these students are now basically closing the gap between themselves and the higher-income areas of Los Angeles when it comes to learning days and college enrollment.\n\nCampos: That's right.\n\nDemsas: Wow.\n\nCampos: It's exactly that. It doesn't fully close the gap for achievement, but it gets very close. And for college enrollment, it flips and goes the other way, so it's essentially closed. That doesn't mean that inequality has fully gone away in Los Angeles. Schools are still vastly unequal, and there's a lot of variation in terms of student outcomes. But at least the ZOC-non-ZOC gaps have essentially closed as of 2019.\n\nDemsas: And specifically we're talking about test scores in specific areas? When we say closing the achievement gap, what are you looking at?\n\nCampos: Test scores, standardized exams, math and reading or English and language arts, and college enrollment. And so, if we then look at college enrollment, you may ask, What colleges are ZOC students getting nudged into?\n\nWhen we look at that, we find that a majority of these students are going to California State University campuses, and there's really not much of an impact on community-college enrollment, and if anything, a diversion away from private schools.\n\nDemsas: Were you surprised by this-the size of this effect?\n\nCampos: Yes, definitely I was. I was not expecting it. This was initially supposed to be a different paper on how residential decisions responded to the program. But I had the data, so I went ahead and looked at what happened to achievement. And I found these results, and then I spent roughly two months trying to kill the results. It shocked my prior. But yeah, that's kind of how research goes.\n\nDemsas: All right. Time for a quick break. More with Chris when we get back.\n\n[ Break ]\n\nDemsas: Back to the effects you were able to find in your research, I wanted to ask: Did the composition of schools-is that what's driving this? Is the composition change from when the ZOC started such that now there are more higher-performing students just coming into the Zones of Choice areas?\n\nCampos: I was very concerned about this just because, having a decent understanding of L.A. County, the Zones of Choice neighborhoods have been gentrifying substantially in the past 10 years. And so I was concerned that a portion of these effects were going to be driven by this gentrification, the fact that these zones are now receiving relatively higher-income people than before the policy expansion.\n\nWhen I look at that in the data, I don't find evidence of any differences and changes in student composition between ZOC and non-ZOC schools. And I think this is due to the fact that, although these neighborhoods are gentrifying, the people that are gentrifying these neighborhoods either don't have kids yet or, if they do, they're very young, and so they're not going to these high schools. So although there may be some change in the composition of these neighborhoods in terms of amenities and things like that that comes with gentrification, I'm not finding it directly impacts the results in the paper.\n\nDemsas: Okay. And then also, within the zones of choice, is there compositional sorting such that now you're getting higher-performing students just sorting themselves into better schools, and that's what's getting the benefits?\n\nCampos: Okay. When it comes to how students were sorting within the ZOC, one other perhaps surprising finding that I find in this particular setting is that I can look at the types of choices parents are making when applying to schools because they submit these rank-ordered preference lists to the district that then determines the assignment of students to schools. And then with these rank-ordered preference lists, I can get measures of school popularity. And then I can just ask, What best predicts these measures of school popularity? Is it school quality? Is it student composition or other school factors? What is most predictive of demand in these particular markets? And I'm finding that school quality-or these notions of value added that economists tend to use-are most predictive of demand in these ZOC markets.\n\nAnd so what this is saying is that families are providing schools in the ZOC markets incentives to care about factors that contribute to student learning because that's what's driving their demand. And it's not that parents are selecting based on the composition of kids at a school, because that would produce alternative incentives, where schools wouldn't necessarily care about contributing or investing in factors that contribute to student learning. They would instead be investing in things that would attract high-achieving students.\n\nAnd so because I'm finding in the data that parents' choices strongly lean towards higher-value-added or higher-quality schools, this is providing schools the incentives to invest in these things that contribute to student learning, which is then contributing to the overall impacts I'm finding in the study.\n\nDemsas: There is a 2020 AER paper about whether parents value school effectiveness, and they're looking at a quarter of a million applicants to the New York City high school system. And they basically find that there's no evidence that households are responding to causal school effectiveness. And they find that people are mostly looking for peer quality. And, as we talked about earlier, that's usually just measures of whether it seems like there are higher-income students or there are whiter students in the schools. And that's how they're deciding whether or not to send their kids there or whether they think that school is a good school.\n\nAnd so what's interesting about the design of your study-the design of this Los Angeles school system Zones of Choice-is that because it's so segregated, the Zones of Choice, you can't actually discriminate based on race or on the income of your peers by that much. And so you have a system where parents are not able to default to that heuristic, and then they choose to make decisions based on causal effectiveness.\n\nSo talk a little bit about that for me because I think that's kind of a weird finding. It's like people want to discriminate based on these things, and you have to take it away from them in order for them to care more about causal stuff? Or is there some other way I should be thinking about this?\n\nCampos: Right. Yeah. The fact that families are selecting schools based on schools' causal effectiveness is somewhat surprising of a finding here. And so, as you point out, these zones are extremely segregated. At the time of the study, 88 percent of the students in the ZOC are classified as Hispanic by the school district. This is well above 67 percent of Hispanic students elsewhere in the district at the time.\n\nAnd so exactly as you point out, within a zone, when a parent is choosing a school, they can't find the school that has all the rich kids. Or they can't find a school that has all the white kids. And so it doesn't mean that in a place like New York City, families are necessarily discriminating. But they're using these heuristics that make it somewhat easier, at least to them, to identify these effective schools-where in the ZOC setting, because they don't have this easy heuristic, they're forced to go find other things to differentiate the schools.\n\nAnd when they do that, it turns out that whatever it is they're then choosing to select schools on tends to be something that's going to be more correlated, or more strongly associated, with schools' causal effectiveness. At least, that's what I think is going on in the Zones of Choice because, at the core, I don't think families are necessarily observing school value added and making decisions based on that in this setting. But they're using something else. They're doing something else because they don't have these proxies for quality.\n\nDemsas: I guess that's part of my question here because what would they be looking at? I lean in your direction that people don't want to just say, I want to send my kids to the place where white kids are. They're trying to say, I want to send my kids to the place that maybe has high investment, or whatever, and they're using it as a proxy, as you say. But without that, is it the case that there are actually good proxies that more places could be using to actually evaluate whether or not a school would make their kids better off?\n\nCampos: Right. So in the data that I have, it's really hard to figure out what that thing is. Anecdotally, at least, back when I was a graduate student and I was going to some of these information sessions, I think parents do get a lot from talking to the principals in these open houses where several principals were present, or in these information sessions where they get a lot more information that you could associate with soft skills or things like that that aren't necessarily objective measures of quality but that are nonetheless going to be correlated with these objective measures of quality.\n\nAnd I think in a place like New York City, where a family has hundreds of schooling options, it's impossible for them to go and learn about all of these hundreds of options. In the ZOC setting, families are required to learn about anywhere between two to five campuses, so it's a bit more manageable.\n\nAnd so I think because you eliminate these proxies for qualities, such as race or income, but at the same time you make the choice set sufficiently small, you make learning about your options sufficiently feasible. And so everyone does pick up on other things. It's unclear what those things are, but I think it's a combination of eliminating the sorting on race and income and making these choice sets sufficiently small that it makes it manageable for families to learn about their options.\n\nDemsas: And I know you said you looked at survey data about students, but when you were at these information fairs, were the kids present too? Like, were you able to talk to them or any qualitative stuff on your interactions with them?\n\nCampos: Nothing systematic, to be honest. It's on my to-do list to do a more qualitative study with the principals, to just directly ask them how they perceive the program, how they engage and interact with it. But that's been held up.\n\nDemsas: When we met a couple years ago, and you were telling me about this study that you were working on, I think at first I didn't fully grasp that this was only happening within a segregated school system and that the effects were not just happening because you were desegregating.\n\nMy first essential assumption was like, Oh, yeah. This will happen because you have moving-to-opportunity stuff that's going on here, where people are now able to go to the better neighborhood schools. And you're then desegregating and sending the kids from the higher-income neighborhoods also to the lower-income schools. And that's not what's happening at all, which feels odd to me because my expectation is that the large gains that we would expect to see from schools is going to happen if we can get desegregation. Does this change your sense of whether desegregation is required to get better outcomes for students in these high-risk populations?\n\nCampos: I don't know if it's moved my prior on that, necessarily. I think what this study does do is serve as a case study into where these school-choice reforms-or this implementation of these centralized assignment systems-can be effective and some of the features of it that potentially facilitate the effectiveness of the program.\n\nI do still think that there is a value to desegregating schools. There's a ton of research supporting those ideas. But it is a bit strange, as you point out here, that there's this potential trade-off, where you could have a very successful school-choice program, but perhaps you need to eliminate the sorting on race and income and create this homogenous market to then facilitate parents selecting effective schools to then incentivize schools to invest in things that contribute to student learning.\n\nBut it's unclear, from a policymaker perspective, if you want to have these kids and their K-12 education in highly segregated schools. But at the same time, they're experiencing substantial improvements in achievement. They're going to college more often. So it's unclear how we should weigh those two factors.\n\nDemsas: To me, I'm very interested in the mechanism to get these better outcomes. What are the schools actually doing then? If they are seeing these increased college enrollment and better test scores, what's actually happened to get that to happen?\n\nCampos: I'll give you something that comes out of the data, but it's also not going to be the most convincing part of the paper. But this is always a weakness of most empirical papers in the social sciences. So what did these schools do differently that could lead to such stark changes? Given the data that I have, I have two primary sets of findings-and this is all suggestive.\n\nThe first relates to changes in schooling practices. I find a sharp increase in suspensions: roughly 31 percent increase in suspension rates in ZOC schools-\n\nDemsas: Wow.\n\nCampos: -relative to the pre-ZOC mean, and a sizable drop in absenteeism. And so these two findings are consistent with a setting with stricter disciplinary practices and increased expectations. And so these two practices are part of a broader bundle that tends to be referred to as the no-excuses approach to urban education.\n\nAt the same time, I also find, perhaps reassuringly, that ZOC students are also experiencing increases in their SAT scores. Some of these learning gains that we're capturing in these standardized exams do seem to also be materializing in the SAT that these students that are going to college are taking. And so this is going to mediate this increase in college enrollment rates among ZOC students. So these are the two things that I'm finding, at least that stand out the most, as substantial changes within the school.\n\nDemsas: I'm interested in this because firstly, I think a lot of people have a kind of expectation that when they see that a charter school, for instance, has led to improved outcomes, what's happening is either they're screening on the front end or they're just expelling kids on the back end. Did you find evidence that they're selectively expelling low-performing students?\n\nCampos: Absolutely not-not in this particular setting. And another concern that people have in the charter literature is that these potential high suspension rates potentially impact student well-being. And so in LAUSD, since 2010, they run this school-experience survey, where they survey essentially every child in the school district, and they ask them about their happiness and their overall well-being. And I'm finding no detrimental impacts on student happiness or well-being, and if anything, improvements in those measures.\n\nDemsas: And is that relative to the non-ZOC students or just-\n\nCampos: That's right. Relative to non-ZOC students.\n\nDemsas: Okay. The no-excuses model and what you just mentioned with a harsher disciplinary system or, at least, a stricter disciplinary system in schools-this has been studied extensively in the literature. Does this push against-or is this affirming-what we already know about how this affects outcomes?\n\nCampos: Right. So I think the charter literature made-there was a lot of progress on that in the 2010s, and it's stagnated since. And the research ended and said there's successful charter schools in urban locations, and the no-excuses approach tends to be very predictive of positive charter impacts.\n\nIn recent years, the no-excuses approach has rebranded to high expectations, high support because of some of the reasons that you mentioned earlier. It's unclear if what I'm finding in this paper necessarily links back to that, because these are public schools. These aren't charter schools. But I'm just finding evidence of a similar change in a schooling practice that's been associated with positive learning impacts in other settings. So I think that's as far as I can take it here.\n\nDemsas: A lot of this, though, this change that happens-it's not predetermined that it would. I could imagine a world in which these zones of choice pop up, but it's not like Los Angeles city schools was saying, We're going to take away your funding if you're on the bottom end of people's prioritization. And I would imagine, even before Zones of Choice, there were a lot of people who were working in schools who cared a lot about making the kids better off.\n\nSo what was the push, incentive to actually make them change any processes inside the school? Why would zones of choice actually do that?\n\nCampos: Right. That's a great question. And sometimes people ask the same question in a different way, and they ask me, Are principals or teachers lazy if you don't have the school-choice programs? The answer to that is no. I've never talked to a principal whom I doubted cared about the welfare of their students. They're all fantastic and deal with a host of different problems. And in many ways, they're superheroes.\n\nAnd so I can talk about a scenario where a well-meaning principal would naturally respond to this policy, and it wouldn't really imply that they didn't care before the policy, right? So in the status quo, with neighborhood-based assignment, principals have a somewhat fixed set of students they educate every year because neighborhoods determine enrollment flows.\n\nIn the Zones of Choice area, it's not obvious what kids a principal is going to receive, because some kids may opt to go to a different school that is not their neighborhood school now that we've expanded the attendance-zone boundary. If we introduce the fact that, although LAUSD does not use a student-centered funding formula-as you pointed out-school-funding levels are still positively associated with enrollment. Therefore, any loss of enrollment could lead to the loss of a teacher, a counselor, a nurse, etcetera. And in this scenario, any well-meaning principal is going to naturally care about the enrollment because it could potentially affect the number of teachers the school has, the counselors, nurses, and so they're going to naturally care about having higher enrollment.\n\nAnd whatever is going to contribute to more enrollment levels is what the principals are going to be responding to. And so both in the pre-ZOC era and the post-ZOC era, principals are equally caring about their children, but just now they have to respond to different incentives to ensure that they sustain the same level of education for their students.\n\nDemsas: To me, though, that incentive to prevent low enrollment is existing whether or not you have the system or not, right? Like, in a school system that doesn't do zones of choice and just has neighborhood schools, people will move away from really, really bad schools.\n\nLike, it's obviously harder and it's over longer timelines. People don't just move every year. But you know you do see declining enrollment and declining funding and, you know, losing teachers and guidance counselors in schools that are doing very, very poorly. So, is it that they're just worried about losing enrollment, or is it that now they're actually kind of being ranked in a very obvious way?\n\nCampos: So career concerns are probably definitely a thing that principals are thinking of. I can hypothesize here most, but if you've just followed the trajectory of many school district administrators, you'll see that many start off as teachers, they become assistant principals, and they become principals, and then at some point get promoted and end up in some administrative position in the school district.\n\nAnd so if they do have career concerns, obviously being the highest-performing principal in the zone of choice is probably something you're going to embellish on your résumé or make sure it's very salient on your résumé. And so once you introduce these additional career concerns, it's an additional incentive principals may have to really perform really well once you create these zones-of-choice markets-in comparison to the status quo, where it's just neighborhood-based assignment.\n\nDemsas: It's funny, though, because there's a pretty big effect size you're finding, and obviously I know that you're saying it's hard to figure out exactly what the exact mechanisms are happening here are. But if it is that principals are now changing school policy as a result of this concern about declining enrollment,\n\nthat means principals have huge impact-their individual person has, and I guess maybe it's also other administrators. But a handful of people at a school can vastly change the outcomes without changing funding, without changing who the teachers are, without changing who the students are.\n\nThat's remarkable. Is that surprising to you? Are you worried about the durability of that?\n\nCampos: I think that's a great point. And I totally agree. If you ever just go to one of these public schools or just any public school, in general, you really see and get a sense that the principal really sets the tone and the culture of the school. So they do have a lot of power to change just the overall environment, so that I definitely wholeheartedly believe.\n\nAnd yep, I also agree that one interpretation of this study is that principals do have enormous sway in changing the educational trajectories of their children without significantly altering funding structures and things like that.\n\nDemsas: Well, this is a great place for our final question. What is something that you thought was good on paper but didn't pan out how you expected?\n\nCampos: Right. This is a fascinating question because I think no matter how good we think something is on paper, there tends to always be a dissenting opinion somewhere. ( Laughs .)\n\nDemsas: ( Laughs .)\n\nCampos: So in that spirit, let's go with the topic of school closures-or extended remote instruction-during the pandemic and, in particular, from fall 2020 onward.\n\nAt the time, there was mounting evidence, even from governments such as Switzerland, suggesting that transmission was not as high among children. But school administrators in the United States were balancing the potential health concerns of teachers, students, and other staff against the educational implications of extended lower-quality remote schooling. It was a tough position to be in.\n\nWith the growing-yet-mixed evidence suggesting children were not as contagious, some advocated for opening schools. If we take the evidence at the time, keeping schools open seemed to be good on paper. But this position stood in stark contrast with the lived experiences of many disadvantaged families, perhaps in multigenerational households. On the off chance one of their children gets COVID-19 and it spreads within the family, that could lead to devastating consequences. And so from their vantage point, the health risk of parents, students, staff, and teachers were vastly greater than the short-run learning loss to students.\n\nAnd so to district officials with sizable shares of disadvantaged families, it was evident that keeping schools closed or in remote status was good on paper. So at the time, both perspectives were still clouded by a lot of uncertainty. If there would have been a new COVID-19 variant that children did effectively transmit, the picture would have changed. School closures may have proved to be a good thing. But that turned out to not be the case, and the additional learning loss induced by extended school closures was immense.\n\nSo existing research shows that school districts that remained in person experienced smaller declines in learning, as captured by passing rates on standardized exams. And while the pandemic seemed to have widened achievement gaps, other existing work shows that those gaps were not as wide in districts that remained in person. And so that's my example.\n\nDemsas: And did you think it was good on paper? At the beginning of the pandemic, were you like, Yeah, this is reasonable. We should probably close down schools ?\n\nCampos: Yeah. I would go back and forth, but I think probably leaning more towards keeping them closed or keeping them remote a bit longer. It's like the mask debate early in the pandemic, right? There's so much uncertainty. Why aren't we just all risk-averse and wear masks and figure out later if it was effective or not? That's how I felt about school closures or openings in fall of 2020. I was like, There's still too much uncertainty. But the evidence was mounting that kids weren't transmitting COVID-19 as much as adults.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nDemsas: Yeah. Well, Chris, thank you so much for coming on the show.

      "text": "Our Burden of Choice\n\nVOLUME 153\n\nNUMBER 6\n\nJUNE 1934\n\nBY MARGARET CAREY MADEIRA\n\nTHERE is a limit beyond which free and independent thought and action cannot be carried by the average man, except at too great a cost. The development of individualism to a new climax since the turn of the century has been accompanied by consequences which indicate that the limit has been reached, that the burden of choice imposed on us by our autonomy is too heavy for many of us to bear. The vague discontent, the nervous pursuit of pleasure, the high rate of divorce, are suggestive of general moral discomfort, and the increase of mental disorder and crime which has accompanied our liberation from the bonds of custom may well be the price of our new privileges. Moreover, in the widespread tendency toward group action that has already expressed itself in Communism, Fascism, National Socialism, perhaps even in the will-tosurrender so prevalent in the America of to-day - in this tendency one is tempted to see an effort on the part of the mass of the people to rid themselves of the responsibilities of autonomy. 'Rugged individualism ' seems recently to have lost its charm over a wide area of the earth's surface.\n\nThe very foundations of our thinking would be severely shaken if we accepted as probable the hypothesis that we are suffering from and seeking to shift the burden of choice. We should look with new eyes at our most cherished beliefs; we should be forced to reconsider assumptions that we have come to regard as axiomatic, and the consequences for many of our dogmas would be incalculable. It covers too wide a field to be susceptible of absolute proof, but I am going to set forth the reasons why to me, who am Protestant, liberal, individualistic, unorganizable, and therefore biased in its disfavor, this hypothesis seems nevertheless to furnish the most illuminating interpretation of certain aspects of our life to-day.\n\nNo interpretation of contemporary life, illuminating or otherwise, can be attempted without some appreciation of the value of habit and custom as means to mental and emotional economy. It is only by realizing the degree to which man has relied on these devices, through the long period of his development, that we can appreciate the consequences of our present degree of emancipation. The importance of habit as a mechanism that relieves us of mental stress would no doubt be admitted without argument by anyone who gave the matter a moment's consideration. If every semi-automatic action that we perform in the course of the day were the result of conscious decision and deliberate effort, we should have little energy left for anything else. We are so accustomed to the blessings of our habits that we are hardly aware of them; but if one should attempt even to catalogue the parts of his acquired machinery he would find himself faced with an impossible task, so many and so various are these little devices that contribute to the smooth running of our lives.\n\nCopyright 1934, by The Atlantic Monthly Company, Boston, Mass. All rights reserved.\n\nThink, for example, of the series of complex actions you perform from the time you are called in the morning until you arrive at your office. If you had to decide whether or not you would get up, which shoe you would put on first, whether or not you would brush your teeth or say your prayers, you would probably stay in bed. In fact, if by some miracle all our habits could be destroyed without loss of our sanity, if each one of these actions that we perform without a struggle had to be preceded by attention to the situation, consideration of the pros and cons, conscious decision and effort, we should find ourselves imprisoned within a nagging round of small duties - duties which we normally perform without even noticing that we perform them. It is undoubtedly true that we consider, and probably correctly consider, the power of conscious decision as an indication of an advanced state of mental development. It is true that we tend to be contemptuous of the man who is a 'creature of habit,' who allows himself to become so completely mechanized that he is incapable of deviating from the beaten path except at the price of exquisite mental pain. Nevertheless, we all probably agree that without the help of habit we should have no time and no energy left for those matters which seem to us worthy of conscious decision. Paradoxically, it is routine that saves us from servitude.\n\nWilling though we are to give habit its due, we of this generation tend to consider custom an obsolete impediment to the freedom of man. We condemn it as blind and irrational, which it undoubtedly is, and in our pride of intellect we believe ourselves to be beyond and above the need of its support. The service that custom performs for the group is, however, closely analogous to the service that habit renders to the individual. In fact, to a considerable extent the two overlap, many personal habits being the outgrowth of custom. The human being is obviously a social animal. The human group is inclined to develop a pattern of behavior to which the members of the group are expected to conform, and generally do conform without doing any apparent violence to their being. Custom sets the pattern of behavior for the group to follow, if not without thought, at least without much emotional wear and tear. The pattern may be good or bad, from a biological or sociological point of view; the amazing thing is the extent to which the human being not only can but actually wants to adapt himself to it as long as the authority of the group is behind it.\n\nIn a society in which the fabric of custom has not been torn by contact with the steel blade of modern civilization, custom not only dictates what the members of the group shall do, but even to a great extent what they shall feel - even determines the most complex emotional relationships. For instance, according to a custom that prevails among a number of widely separated primitive peoples, the marriage of the children of two brothers or two sisters is barred as incest, whereas, according to the same custom, marriage is favored between the children of a brother and a sister. To illustrate further, among many of those peoples who trace descent through the mother, the father's authority over his children is not recognized. The nearest male relative on the mother's side is charged with the bringing up of the child, and assumes not only the responsibilities but the attitude of parenthood. According to another curious custom often found among primitives, a man may not take a second wife who is not a member of the first wife's family without their special permission. They are jointly responsible for the services that a wife is normally expected to perform; and, if she has no children or dies, it is their duty and privilege to furnish from their ranks a supplementary or a second wife. One could continue almost indefinitely with such illustrations.\n\nIn fact, when one considers how easily man's emotional energy has been harnessed by custom, even in great civilizations such as that of the Chinese, when one realizes to what complete tyranny over his personal life man has adjusted himself, and still is adjusting himself, the emphasis of certain schools of modern psychology on the dangers of repression seems misplaced. Perhaps the psychologists had better look elsewhere for the source of our misery. As has already been suggested, it may lie not so much in the mass of restrictions that civilization has imposed on us as in the strain and confusion entailed by our liberation. For the result of the breakdown of custom has been to throw on the individual the burden of an infinite number of conscious decisions which formerly were made for him or so weighted for him by custom that he did not have much trouble making them.\n\nIn the last two thousand odd years there have been long periods of stability in the Western world when, to paraphrase Wordsworth, custom has lain 'upon us with a weight, heavy as frost and deep almost as life.' There have, of course, been movements of social integration, when the hold of custom has been strengthened. On the whole, however, the tendency on this side of the planet has been toward the development of free and independent thought and action.\n\nIn the Western world, so far as I know, the first clear crystallization of thought in regard to individualism was that of Socrates. Before his time the Sophists had done their bit, undermining the traditional moral code, and the naïve faith of their fathers exercised only a faltering control on the Athenian youth of his day. To those who followed him or whom he buttonholed for the purposes of discussion, Socrates preached a new morality, founded on the assumption by the individual of the burden of choice. He taught them that the ultimate measure of all things was man's invisible soul, and that neither fate nor the gods, but we ourselves, shape our destiny. By such teaching he encouraged his listeners to look upon themselves as individual centres of thought and force rather than as atomistic and passive components of society. Such individualism was disturbing to the common people of Athens, and when they came into power this corrupter of youth was condemned to death. 1 The teachings of Socrates, however, refined and enriched by Plato, continued to exercise a profound influence. During the so-called Hellenistic period which lies between the conquests of Alexander and the fall of the Roman Empire, Plato's mystic successors continued to emphasize the value of the 4 soul ' and ultimately contributed to the development of the metaphysical individualism of Christianity.\n\nLike Socrates, Christ sought to direct his people to a new way of life. While he tried to revivify the values that were characteristic of Jewish ethics, he was contemptuous of compliance with convention for convention's sake, and demanded of his followers compliance of the heart with the will of God. His exaltation of the humble and his belief in the value, in God's eyes, of the individual human soul have been powerful forces in the development of the dignity of man, and have made indirectly an important contribution to the development of individualism.\n\nOrganized Christianity, through the medium of the Catholic Church, has continued through the centuries to emphasize the value of the individual human soul. The very structural necessities of the Church, however, have demanded the submerging of the individual in the organization and have inspired vigorous repression of individual thinking in the field of faith. In theory the Church has not been concerned with what men thought about matters not related to religion. In practice, however, she has frequently clamped down on intellectual liberty, since in almost every field of knowledge one encounters sooner or later the assumptions of faith. The Church has also been hostile to moral individualism, and has played a dominant rôle as a conservative force by the development and maintenance of a pattern of behavior for her adherents.\n\nUndoubtedly certain Protestant sects have striven to exact, and have succeeded temporarily in exacting, more in their requirements as to the minutiae of conduct than the Catholic Church. Undoubtedly, also, there have been periods in the Church's history when her control over conduct, especially of the privileged classes, has been amazingly lax, and in certain parts of the world, as in Mexico, she has failed tragically in her avowed mission. Nevertheless she has maintained a fair degree of control over her adherents for nineteen hundred years. Probably her most effective means of discipline has been the institution of confession, in accordance with which the penitent surrenders to the priest, in whom the authority of the Church is incarnate, the burden of choice - the responsibility of deciding what should be done to atone for past actions and of suggesting future behavior. This institution has not only provided the Church with a powerful tool for the shaping of conduct, but has no doubt also been of great value from the point of view of the mental health of the believer.\n\nTo a great extent man functioned as a member of a group in the Middle Ages. What the Church did not decide for him was largely taken care of by his caste or his guild. There seems to have been little individual autonomy; even in aesthetic activity, the individual was lost in the group, in the silence of anonymity. (It is a long way from the rôle of the mediaeval artist to that of the artist of to-day, hell-bent on self-expression.) Probably many of the conditions of life in the Middle Ages were appalling as far as physical hygiene was concerned. Nevertheless the well-knit hierarchical organization of mediaeval society and the limited play that it gave to individualism seem to have provided better bases for mental health than our society of to-day.\n\nWe have, of course, no dependable clinical evidence, but there seems to be ground for the belief that, except for an occasional epidemic of collective frenzy such as the convulsive dancing that was probably an aftermath of the Great Plague, the people of the Middle Ages were mentally much healthier than we. The mere fact that insanity was attributed to possession by the devil would appear to suggest that it was considered to be an exceptional and solemn phenomenon. Moreover, allusions to cases of insanity in the clinical sense of the word are, I believe, relatively rare in the texts of the Middle Ages, though the words 4 mad ' and 'madness' are frequently found in the indefinite and clinically neutral sense in which we often use them to-day. One must, of course, take into consideration the fact that before the spread of syphilis and alcoholism the main contributing causes of certain forms of insanity were, happily for the Middle Ages, nonexistent. However, the greater simplicity and the more leisurely rhythm of life were, no doubt, the main reasons for the relative freedom of these times from the Great Plague of to-day.\n\nIn the fourteenth century certain events combined to diminish the prestige of the Church and to promote the disintegration of custom. To some extent, no doubt, the weakening of the Church's control and of the hold of custom contributed to the rebirth of the individual which we know as the Renaissance, as a result of which man became, in Western Europe generally, more self-conscious, more confident of his powers, more aware of his dignity as man. The Reformation was one of the varied expressions of this new dignity. By its emphasis on the individual conscience, it gave a tremendous impetus to intellectual individualism and subsequently to other forms. At first the Bible, reverenced as the word of God, the basis of all belief, the light for all darkness, displaced the Church as the final authority for Protestants. The substitution of one superior and exterior authority for another was, however, only temporary, for Protestantism had been born of the rebellion of individual consciences against the collective spiritual yoke, and it could not but be faithful to the individualism from which it sprang. The consciences that had defied the Catholic Church preserved their initial autonomy in the right of the individual to interpret the very scriptural authority that they had set up for themselves. The loss of a final authority resulted in the setting up of innumerable authorities and the subsequent impairment of all authority, with the inevitable assumption by the individual of the burden of choice. Even in the supremely important matter of individual salvation, where, according to Calvinistic doctrine, the decision lay with God, the individual obtained no relief from responsibility. As God generally did nothing to indicate his intentions, the believer was left entirely in the dark concerning his eternal fate. His anxious uncertainty about God's decision and the obsessing intensity with which his individual problem presented itself to him were bound to incline him to preoccupation with himself, to a brooding individualism which is reflected in the attitude of introversion so often displayed by writers of Calvinistic origin.\n\nModern rationalism had its real beginning in the second half of the seventeenth century. Not only was it in itself an expression of individualism, but by its disintegrating influence on the force of custom it prepared the way for a further individualistic expansion. Together with romanticism, it furnished the basis of the anti-clerical, anti-authoritative movement known as the Enlightenment, which, under the guidance of Voltaire, Rousseau, and the other lesser stars of the Encyclopedist galaxy, reached its climax in France toward the end of the eighteenth century. These prophets of the new dispensation opposed the authority of nature to that of dogma, the clear daylight of reason to the torch of faith. Their challenge to the Church and to secular authority echoed through Europe, was heard even in the American colonies, and culminated in the French Revolution. It may indeed be reasonable to interpret the French Revolution as a reaction to the disintegration of custom, as a mass movement to reëstablish the group on the basis of a new code which would be compelling to all. Whatever potential benefits might have been inherent in democratic solidarity, however, were counteracted by the individualistic unrest which had been excited in men's minds by the Enlightenment. This unrest continued after the disillusion of the Revolution and during the period of reaction. It is to some extent the very definition of modern romanticism which offers us the tragic, when not ludicrous, spectacle of the individual claiming for himself all the burden of choice and at the same time complaining with eloquent groans about the load that his pride imposes upon his weakness.\n\nDuring the last century, the industrial revolution, the tremendous development of science, the extension of education, the unparalleled increase of contact between peoples, the feminist movement - all have contributed to the further breakdown of fundamental custom and directly or indirectly to the development of individualism. The reaction to these influences in this new country was of course radically different from the results that they produced in the Old World.\n\nThe Puritan code certainly had a remarkable vitality, and in a large part of the country effected a superficial conformity to its standards. It was utterly alien, however, to many people of colonial stock, and to the great armies of immigrants who swarmed to our hospitable shores. Some of these groups of newcomers clung with tenacity to their traditional way of life, but it was difficult to maintain the old ways in the new country, and, generally speaking, in one or two generations the young were thoroughly 'Americanized.' That, unfortunately, was apt to mean that they wanted to get rich more than anything else, and as quickly as possible. Since we have no caste distinctions in America, except as applied to certain races which we in our inscrutable wisdom have decided to consider inferior, the only constant standard of value which has been generally recognized is that of wealth. The fact that wealth was accessible to so many in this new land made it appear to be within the reach of all, and the desire to acquire the tangible evidence of superiority has resulted in an incontinent greed for money which only reached its climax in the boom of the last decade.\n\nThe general social fluidity that has existed in America has, of course, had great advantages. No doubt much ability has come to the fore because of the elasticity of class lines, and among the greatest of this nation are men who rose from the simplest beginnings. On the other hand, the very lack of exterior limitation has created a profound discontent and has all too often resulted in our failure to develop any pride in occupations that are considered to be humble or any sense of dignity related to the efficient performance of inconspicuous duties. The ambition of the American parent, which we have perhaps exalted beyond its deserts, has generally been to advance his children beyond himself socially as well as economically. The handing down of craft or trade from one generation to another which is usual in older societies has become less and less common in this country. This has been due in part to the decreased demand for many skills resulting from industrialization, but more still to the fact that neither a man's work nor his position in the world is, generally speaking, determined by tradition. The burden of choice as to what he should at least try to be has rested on him, and his natural desire has been to 'better himself.' At the outbreak of the World War, the people of this nation were vigorously bending their individual energies toward this end, and as a people we were considerably less integrated than we had been a hundred years before.\n\nAll war is probably to a certain degree an integrating force. Therein lie, no doubt, its fatal charm and its perennial popularity. The World War was certainly no exception. In fact, one is tempted to wonder whether it was not to a certain extent a partial reaction to individualism; whether, indeed, without such a reaction it would have been possible to compel the peoples of the Western world to make such colossal personal sacrifices. It is bewildering and profoundly disturbing to realize, as many of us have been forced to do, that in spite of the agony they endured, in spite of the horror and suffering they witnessed, many of the most civilized and sensitive men look back on the years of the war with a kind of nostalgia, of which they are themselves ashamed - look back on those terrible years as to a time when morally they were at peace. The fact that the burden of choice had been lifted from them, that they had been liberated from their convulsive little selves, evidently created in the minds of many men a state of grim contentment. The integrating effect of war was apparent even among the civilian population. The cheerfulness with which most of us bowed to the inevitable indicates that it was a relief to us actually to deal with an inevitable. The courage and energy with which apparently soft people turned to exacting tasks suggest that it was a comfort to find life exacting.\n\nOn the other hand, the war was a violently disintegrating influence on the old order. Social inhibitions relating to sex and class and race went down before it. Many of us can remember the amazing speed with which old values melted away in the crucible of war, old barriers disappeared. Many of us found ourselves almost immediately in a new world. As long as the war lasted, it imposed its own discipline, but with the coming of peace the extent of the destruction became clear. Not only had the moral standards of civil life cracked during the war beyond repair, but millions of men came back to civilization who, except for brief intervals, had been subjected for years to a discipline wholly at variance with that given lip service by the communities to which they returned. The peace brought bitter disillusionment to those who had gone to war with the conviction of a sacred mission, whose moral justification for war had been the end to be achieved. To many of them, regardless of nationality, it seemed that all the high-sounding words, all the talk about idealism, had meant nothing after all. The peace was damned, and the men who had survived the agony were a drug on the market. Youth turned with violent contempt from conventional morality, now discredited in their eyes. Custom had lost its authority for them, and, to an extent unparalleled in human history, the individual was left with the burden of choice.\n\nThis statement would probably be disputed by those critics of modern industrial civilization whose complaints are based on their belief that life has been standardized by mechanization. Perhaps they do not see the woods for the trees. Standardization in detail we certainly have as a result of machinery, with all the loss of opportunity for creative self-expression which that implies. Our lives themselves, however, have as certainly become less and less standardized. What is more, the very machinery that has standardized the individual product has resulted in the production of an infinite variety of each product, of an infinite variety of products, and has thus increased the variety of possible experiences.\n\nFor example, if one wants to-day to buy such a simple thing as a button, one is confronted with a bewildering selection of round, square, oblong, convex, flat, concave, dull, shiny objects, having as their single common denominator the fact that they can be sewed on. Even such a humble choice involves consideration of a confusing array of alternatives, an expenditure of energy out of all proportion to the importance of the decision. Compare, if you will, this embarrassment of riches with the simplicity of choice in an unmechanized world such as that of the Mexican Indians, where one design of earring or one pattern of blanket will suffice for a whole village, generation after generation.\n\nThe appalling number of alternatives between different wants that we may satisfy is another minor addition to our present woe. What is more, and worse, is that there is no end in sight. As long as there is profit in the creation of new wants, new wants will be created and our lives will be further confused thereby. Indeed, one still finds people to-day who are naïve enough to believe that the United States of America can be saved by the development of some great new source of comfort or pleasure comparable to the automobile in its general appeal.\n\nAs for the new experiences that mechanization has contributed, those that provide only vicarious delights, such as the movies and cheap literature, are of no mean importance. By far the most profound influence on our way of life, however, is exerted by our amazing mobility. Even a generation ago, most of the people of this country stayed in one place most of their lives. To-day the roads are swarming from sea to sea, from Canada to Mexico, and many people spend a great part of their lives trekking restlessly to and fro, with inevitable consequences as far as home life and social integration are concerned.\n\nAs a result of mechanization, then, as well as by the removal of inhibitions, the possibilities in the way of experience have been vastly increased for us. Probably we have sacrificed in intensity what we have gained in extensity; for, though our horizons have been pushed back and back, the world within them has been curiously flattened out. Too often our lives seem like blank paper on which we might write almost anything, but on which we are not strongly impelled to write anything, for the range of possibilities is too wide for selection and the choice is too free. The possibility of fulfilling a multitude of desires has robbed many of these desires of their poignancy, and the yielding to such desires may be as often the measure of their weakness as of their strength; for, paradoxically, people often do what they think they should n't because they don't want to enough, because their desire is n't strong enough even to provoke their resistance. Hence, at least in part, the vague discontent, the nervous grasping for pleasure, the search for bigger and better sensations, which have been especially characteristic of the post-war world. As to the high rate of divorce, it would be folly to attribute so complex a phenomenon to a single cause. However, among the contributing causes is certainly the fact that the removal of the obstacles to a greater variety of experience in marriage has belittled its importance. When there is no sense of finality, marriage is no longer so brave an adventure; when change is relatively easy, people are not inclined to give all they have. Even love itself is apt to become a trivial affair, to fail to cut a channel deep enough in the territory of the heart so that the stream of emotion will be contained within the banks of that channel.\n\nThe briefest consideration of what choice involves should make clear what our new responsibilities are costing us in the way of wear and tear. Every conscious decision entails a certain degree of tension, varying from simple attention all the way up the scale, according to what the individual believes to be the importance of the decision. The breakdown of the social machinery results, therefore, in a constantly recurring state of tension due to the vast number of decisions that modern man has to make for himself. This, however, is only half the story. The fact that to-day a multitude of forces play on the average man which either did not exist in his grandfather's day or from which his grandfather was mercifully protected by social inhibitions leads to a widespread lack of integration of personality. Too often for our own comfort, the whole personality is not on the side of the decision, and the result is the continuation of a state of tension after the decision has been made.\n\nThe question is whether the human nervous system can stand as much strain as is now imposed on it. The evidence appears to indicate that in the case of a large proportion of the population it cannot. The assumption certainly seems to be warranted that the increase of insanity which is peculiar to modern civilization is directly related to the increased mental and emotional strain entailed by the responsibilities that our self-determination has forced upon us. The commonest form of mental disease is dementia præcox, or schizophrenia, which actually means splitting of the mind and implies a break in the internal harmony of the personality. This type of disorder develops among introverts - that is, people who are inclined to live within the world of their own mind. They are generally intellectual, seclusive, reserved, and disinclined to action. It would seem reasonable to infer that a contributing factor to this form of insanity, perhaps the principal factor, is the burden of choice, and that the symptoms represent the mind's reaction to the uncertainties that choice involves; for the characteristic mark of dementia præcox is the withdrawal from reality, to a world where no decisions have to be made. A curious piece of corroborating evidence is the frequency with which patients suffering from dementia præcox develop the delusion that they have discovered the solution of all the problems of the world, the unifying principle.\n\nThe much discussed ' inferiority complex,' which plays such an important part in current interpretations of both mental disease and crime, furnishes more food for thought. According to the hypothesis here advanced, there is ample ground for the development of a sense of inferiority in the members of a disintegrated society. Few men are strong enough to stand alone. Few of us are entitled on rational grounds to anything but a sense of inferiority. It is the isolation of the individual from the group, the emphasis on the individual as a separate entity, that has exaggerated the importance of the inevitable inferiority of the average man and has created the necessity in his own mind for the development of compensatory mechanisms.\n\nSometimes associated with the sense of inferiority, and sometimes, I believe, independent of it as a factor in delinquency, is a morbid egotism which is probably traceable to loss of the normal relationship between the individual and the group. Furthermore, the removal of inhibitions due to the breakdown of custom, and parlicularly to the loss of restraints that has come with the decline of family life, is a direct factor in the increase of crime that is too obvious to require further emphasis.\n\nIt should not be impossible to subject this part of the hypothesis to proof, although reliable data on many points may not be available for some years. If, however, the relationship between insanity and crime, on the one hand, and, on the other, the breakdown of custom and the development of individualism, is established, then we shall find less insanity and crime in those societies of the Western world where custom has disintegrated less swiftly than in our own; we shall find less in those groups whose faith has protected their code of custom from destruction, as in the case of Catholics, Quakers, Orthodox Jews. We shall find more insanity and more crime among groups which have suddenly lost the code of their forefathers, such as the children of our immigrant population. We shall find a decrease of insanity and of crime in those societies that have been welded anew into a unit and have vested the group with authority. In the course of a few years there may be sufficient data to prove or disprove these assumptions.\n\nLet us now return to the group movements referred to in the first paragraph and see whether in the light of what has been said they can be interpreted as reactions to individualism. The first of these movements, the Communist Revolution, look place in October 1917, after Russia had been at war for over three years. The war had driven the Russian people to a frenzy of despair and had united a coherent and active minority in a passion of indignation against the national government. Despair, however, was nothing new in Russia. In fact, despair seems to have been a quite normal attitude of mind on the part of articulate people in pre-revolutionary Russia, and the great mass of the people were sunk in a bog of hopeless apathy. The general pessimism and sense of futility deepened after the unsuccessful revolution of 1905. The young turned frequently to suicide, or to sexual pleasures as an escape. In fact, probably the happiest people in Russia before the war were the revolutionists, in spite of imprisonment and exile, in spite of the sacrifice of all the warm delights of life. They at least knew where they were trying to go and had surrendered themselves to a cause greater than that of personal happiness.\n\nThe second group movement took place in Italy in October 1922, four years after the termination of the war. It was preceded by a period of chaos, during which the weakness of the government became increasingly apparent. This disorganization was, no doubt, largely due to the détente following the war, but was further accentuated by dissatisfaction with the terms of peace, which left the Italian people with the conviction that the reward had not been commensurate with the sacrifice they had made. As in Russia, however, the foundations of the Fascist Revolution had existed before the war in a widespread sense of inferiority; together with the reaction of a small but determined minority to this state of mind. The tragedy of Caporetto had further deepened the sense of inferiority; in fact, one is tempted to wonder whether the general need of the Italian people to wipe the shameful memory from their minds may not have been in part responsible for the striking of the aggressive, virile attitude characteristic of the revolutionary movement.\n\nIn Germany, the disintegration which prepared the way for reaction was enormously speeded up after the war, when for fifteen years the nation tried unsuccessfully to function as a republic. With the collapse of the old régime, much that was noble and fine in the German character seemed to decline, with no compensating loss of what to us seem its unlovely features. In Germany also, however, there existed before the war the faith which, fanned to a bright flame, was later able to weld the German people together more closely than ever they have been welded in our time. This faith was the mystical belief in the superiority of the German people, which originated, strangely enough, in France, and had developed into a religion for many Germans during the last seventy-five years.\n\nThe common elements of these three movements are of far greater importance than their divergencies of purpose. All three are anti-democratic and dictatorial. All three are or have been ruthless to the point of great cruelty to dissidents. All three demand a nationalistic programme of economic control, directed toward economic independence and involving, of necessity, some form of socialism. But the basic common element is the surrender of the individual to the group.\n\nIn attempting to evaluate the psychological effects of these revolutions, one's own political views are wholly irrelevant, and one's moral convictions are out of place. We are considering these revolutions from the point of view of their psychological consequences, and from that point of view alone. There can hardly be any question about the startling and profound changes they have made in the psychology of these three peoples - changes that probably could not have been made in the component individuals treated as individuals by any science known to man. By the submerging of the individual, he has been exalted.\n\nThe Russian Communist is a man made new by faith in his cause and by the surrender of his will in order to serve it. Into the new faith he has poured the mysticism that formerly united him with God; for man is at best a fragmentary creature, seeking always to be made whole, and when one means of completion fails him, he finds another. In the service of this new faith incredible miracles have been performed by a people who, a few years ago, were drifting without hope and without conviction. The average Russian citizen, with the exception of the tragic remnants of the old régime and the prosperous peasant, appears to have been swept along with the current. There are, of course, still individualists in Russia, lonely, isolated, unable to yield, whose lives are like ineffectual trickles of water that sink swiftly into the ground and are lost, while the great river of the common life roars by.\n\nIn Italy, to-day, even the humblest laborer need no longer see himself as an insignificant inhabitant of a country whose main source of strength is its beauty. He is part and parcel of a great race, whose past he shares, whose glory is his. He has led the thundering legions; he has invaded, conquered, and ruled the greater part of Europe, and he holds his head high.\n\nIn Germany, the exaltation that has lifted the hearts of the people since the National Socialist Revolution has been heightened by the fact that this new and complete integration of the German nation has brought with it a sense of release from the humiliation of defeat and of long-continued poverty, a shifting of the blame for all past failure to non-German shoulders. The German of to-day (provided his great-greatgrandmother was not a Jewess) sees himself no longer defeated, nor poor, nor humble, nor alone, but as a symbol of his race, and his self-esteem and his faith in his race are the same.\n\nSuch are the blessings of surrender, of the preference of moral comfort over liberty.\n\nIt may be that, without freedom from one's self, all other freedom is vain, and that this essential freedom is better promoted under a system of government which demands self-surrender than under one such as ours that encourages individual autonomy. It seems unlikely, however, that AngloSaxons who have been for centuries imbued with the love of liberty will ever yield themselves as completely as have these other peoples to any faith, whether in a cause or a race or a religion. Moreover, the heterogeneity of our population would act as a deterrent to integration on the basis either of race or of religious faith, unless that faith were more inclusive than those that now light our various ways. There are, nevertheless, certain current tendencies in this country that are definitely suggestive of a reaction to individualism and that point to the possibility of a new integration of the American people. In the field of manners and morals, there has been a decided tempering of the impatience with all restraint which our extreme individualism had fostered in the younger generation. Bad manners have ceased to be smart; grace and courtesy even have their exponents. The youth of to-day appear to be far less hysterical than the youth of ten years ago and may well be steadier than their parents. The recent orgy of spending as a means of self-expression has ended in the disillusionment of many of us who took part in it, and the greater satisfaction of a life of enforced simplicity has developed in us a far better sense of values than we ever had before.\n\nIt is, however, in the field of politics and economics that the recent changes have been most striking. Among the startling developments is the apparent willingness on the part of the great mass of the people to yield to the Federal Government almost dictatorial powers over their economic life, even at the price of liberty. With President Roosevelt's accession to power, our traditionally truculent and distrustful attitude toward Washington was supplanted by one of almost supine abandon and childlike faith, carried to such a point that even intelligent and dispassionate criticism was looked upon as high treason. This was true not only of the unfortunates who saw in the New Deal a means of relief from their private woes, but also of a large proportion of the privileged, who welcomed with enthusiasm a leader who knew what he wanted and seemed to know how to get it. Even if the expected miracles have not materialized, even if the glory of last spring has been somewhat dimmed, there nevertheless remains behind the President a quality of support that is without precedent, and an attitude toward the Federal Government that is unparalleled.\n\nClosely associated with the surrender to the government of economic rights which we formerly cherished is the abandonment of our belief in the efficacy of laissez faire. During the last century our thinking in the field of economics has been dominated by this doctrine, which harmonized not only with the immediate interests of the capitalist class, but to a considerable extent with the realities of life in a rich and new country. Supported by a few biological generalizations culled from evolutionary theory, this development of individualism has constituted a faith to which those who ruled the destinies of this fair land gave complete adherence. The needs of the 'unfit' have been met after a fashion, for, regardless of theory, we are a kindly people. Our government has on the whole, however, been operated for the successful in the interests of the successful. 'Rugged individualism' is so far out of harmony with our present-day thinking that the expression has an almost comic flavor, but we should not forget that Herbert Hoover's political and economic philosophy was fairly representative of that of the best people of this country before the implications of the depression sank into their minds.\n\nTo-day a stupendous effort is being made to base the operations of government on the needs of the whole people, even at the expense of the successful. Whether this effort is the fruit of madness or of sublime wisdom, whether the extension of the functions of government in the interests of the weaker members of society has gone too far or not far enough, whether the economic nationalism that appears to be an inevitable part of our programme may not result in infinite complications - these are questions that only the future can answer. Clearly, however, the policies of the Federal Government are based on the conception of our society as an organism of which no part can decay without injury to the rest. Clearly, too, in the minds of a great portion of the people is the conviction that the victory over our present-day devil cannot be won by any individual or by any class alone.\n\nIn this conviction, in the enthusiasm for a great leader, there may be found the means by which a temporary integration of the American people can be effected. But that is not enough for our salvation. The depression will pass; the enthusiasm, in any event, will die. Perhaps in the deeper realization of our inevitable brotherhood, perhaps in our increased awareness of values other than material, there may lie the germ of a lasting faith by means of which the diverse peoples of this nation may be united in a common purpose.\n\nIf, moreover, the reasoning presented above is sound, - if the burden of choice imposed by the conditions of modern society is too heavy for us to bear, if we are suffering from and seeking to shift the weight of that burden, - then the implication is clear. We need a unifying faith, by means of which some part of the responsibilities that we are now carrying may be lifted from us, in the light of which our way may be made clearer before us. We need a body of convictions in harmony with our corporate welfare by which our decisions may be weighted. We need a way of life which only faith can blaze. For few of us are strong enough or wise enough to make our way alone."

      "text": "The Choice Republicans Face\n\nToo many members of the GOP are refusing to defy partisanship. They're failing the Alexander Hamilton test.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nMore than 200 years ago, Alexander Hamilton defied partisanship for the sake of the country's future; if he hadn't done so, American history might have taken a very different course. Today, Republicans face the same choice.\n\nBut first, here are three new stories from The Atlantic .\n\nA Red Line\n\nAlexander Hamilton loathed Thomas Jefferson. As rivals in George Washington's Cabinet, the two fought over economics, the size and role of government, and slavery. They disagreed bitterly about the French Revolution (Jefferson was enthralled, Hamilton appalled). Hamilton thought Jefferson was a hypocrite, and Jefferson described Hamilton as \"a man whose history ... is a tissue of machinations against the liberty of the country.\"\n\nBut starting in late 1800, Hamilton broke with his fellow Federalists and provided crucial support that put Jefferson in the White House. He was willing to set aside his tribal loyalties and support a man whose policies he vigorously opposed-a choice that saved the nation from a dangerous demagogue but likely cost him his life.\n\n\"History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes,\" Mark Twain probably never said . The quote's attribution is apocryphal, but the point seems apt, because about 220 years later, Republicans face the same choice Hamilton did. They now have to decide whether felony charges, fraud, sexual abuse, and insurrection are red lines that supersede partisan loyalty.\n\nAlexander Hamilton's red line was Aaron Burr, whom he regarded as a dangerous, narcissistic mountebank and a \"man of extreme & irregular ambition.\" Burr was Jefferson's running mate in the 1800 election, in which he defeated the Federalist incumbent John Adams. But under the original Constitution, the candidate with the most electoral votes became president, and the second-place finisher became vice president. Bizarrely, Jefferson and Burr each got 73 electoral votes, and because the vote was tied, the election was thrown to the House, which now had to choose the next president. Many Federalists, who detested and feared the idea of a Jefferson presidency, wanted to install Burr instead.\n\nThe result was a constitutional crisis that threatened to turn violent. \"Republican newspapers talked of military intervention,\" the historian Gordon Wood wrote in Empire of Liberty . \"The governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania began preparing their state militias for action. Mobs gathered in the capital and threatened to prevent any president from being appointed by statute.\"\n\nHamilton was faced with a difficult choice. He was a leading figure among Federalists; Jefferson was the leader of the faction known as Democratic-Republicans. And the 1790s were a historically partisan era. Yet \"in a choice of Evils,\" Hamilton wrote , \"Jefferson is in every view less dangerous than Burr.\" Washington, in his Farewell Address (which Hamilton helped draft and which Donald Trump's lawyers misleadingly quoted this week), sounded the alarm about the growing partisan factionalism that he thought was tearing the country apart. Political parties, he said, could become \"potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of government.\" Hamilton was convinced that Aaron Burr was exactly the sort of cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled man that Washington had warned against.\n\nEven though Jefferson was \"too revolutionary in his notions,\" Hamilton was willing to swallow his disagreements, because Jefferson was \"yet a lover of liberty and will be desirous of something like orderly Government.\" In contrast, \"Mr. Burr loves nothing but himself-thinks of nothing but his own aggrandizement-and will be content with nothing short of permanent power in his own hands.\"\n\nDefying his fellow Federalists, Hamilton waged a vigorous and ultimately successful campaign to derail the scheme to install Burr. Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot after a group of Federalist congressmen flipped their votes for Burr, choosing to abstain instead.\n\nHamilton's career in politics, already badly damaged by scandal, was effectively over. Burr, who became vice president, never forgave Hamilton, and on July 11, 1804, he fatally shot Hamilton in a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey. Burr was charged with murder but served out his term as vice president, immune from prosecution. Three years later, he was arrested and charged with treason after he allegedly plotted to seize territory in the West and create a new empire. He was acquitted on a technicality, and fled the country in disgrace.\n\nBut for Hamilton's willingness to defy partisanship, American history might have taken a very different course.\n\nLike Hamilton, we live in an age of fierce loyalties that make crossing party lines extraordinarily difficult. If anything, it is even harder now, especially for Republicans living with social pressures, media echo chambers, and a cult-like party culture compassed round , in the words of John Milton. Many public figures in the GOP have shown that they cannot break free of partisanship even in the face of rank criminality.\n\nFor example: Former Attorney General Bill Barr and New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu acknowledge Trump's lies about the 2020 election, and his culpability in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. But both men have said they would vote for Trump. Sununu has said that he would do so even if Trump is convicted of multiple felonies, suggesting that his crimes would be less important than his political differences with the Democrats. Former Vice President Mike Pence has said he would not endorse Trump, but he has also ruled out voting for Joe Biden.\n\nEven former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who declared that Trump \"is wholly unfit to be president of the United States in every way you think,\" cannot bring himself to support the Democratic incumbent. We're still waiting for Nikki Haley to say how she will vote in November.\n\nSo far, only Liz Cheney seems to be taking a position that rhymes with Hamilton's choice two centuries ago. \"There are some conservatives who are trying to make this claim that somehow Biden is a bigger risk than Trump,\" she said . \"My view is: I disagree with a lot of Joe Biden's policies. We can survive bad policies. We cannot survive torching the Constitution.\" Alexander Hamilton would, I think, approve.\n\nRelated:\n\nToday's News\n\nDispatches\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nWe're All Reading Wrong\n\nBy Alexandra Moe\n\nReading, while not technically medicine, is a fundamentally wholesome activity. It can prevent cognitive decline , improve sleep , and lower blood pressure . In one study, book readers outlived their nonreading peers by nearly two years. People have intuitively understood reading's benefits for thousands of years: The earliest known library , in ancient Egypt, bore an inscription that read \"The House of Healing for the Soul.\"\n\nBut the ancients read differently than we do today. Until approximately the tenth century , when the practice of silent reading expanded thanks to the invention of punctuation, reading was synonymous with reading aloud. Silent reading was terribly strange, and, frankly, missed the point of sharing words to entertain, educate, and bond.

On social media, how-to graphics and videos abound, as do doctrines about the one true way to discipline your children, or feed them, or get them to sleep through the night. Parent forums, blogs, and product - recommendation sites are full of suggestions for the only swaddle that works, the formula that tastes milkiest, the clicking animatronic crab that will get your tummy-time-averse baby to hold her head high. Scrolling through all of this advice can make it seem as though parenting is largely about informed, research-based decision-making-that choosing the right gadgets and the right philosophy will help parenting itself go right.\n\nThis logic can feel particularly visceral for a parent considering how to be a good steward of the environment. (Do I genuinely need a special $160 blender to avoid giving my baby prepackaged food? Or can I just mash steamed veggies with a fork?) Worrying about waste can turn into a variation on the pursuit of perfect parenting-but not worrying about it is illogical. Our children will inherit the climate crisis. Personal decisions cannot undo that fact; can, indeed, hardly mitigate it. Deciding to be a parent anyway means you had better hope that our species and societies can work out a new way to thrive on a changing, warming, conflict-riddled planet-because if not, what have you done?\n\nChoice , the Booker Prize-nominated writer Neel Mukherjee's fourth novel, addresses this question head-on. It's a triptych novel in the vein of Susan Choi's Trust Exercise and Lisa Halliday's Asymmetry , which use their three parts to repeatedly surprise and challenge readers. Compared with these novels, Choice is both more ambitious and less successful, harmed by the fact that its second and third sections just cannot compete with its blistering first.\n\nBut that first section is a barn burner. Mukherjee starts Choice with the story of Ayush, an editor at a prestigious London publishing house, whose obsession with the climate crisis lands somewhere between religious fervor and emotional disorder-especially as far as his kids are concerned. Ayush and his economist husband, Luke, have twin children, Masha and Sasha, and his portion of Choice is a beautiful, horrifying, detailed, and messy evocation of parenthood, full of diapers and dirty dishes and \"Can you help Daddy make dinner?\" It also presents having children as a moral crisis, a stumbling block Ayush can't get past. He tries bitterly to lessen his family's consumption-we see him measuring the exact amount of water in which to cook the twins' pasta, boiling it in the electric kettle because he's read that it uses less energy than a stovetop pot -but he can't get away from the belief that Masha and Sasha are \"not going to have a future anyway.\" His conviction that they're doomed weighs more and more heavily on his parenting decisions, eventually convincing him that he can no longer parent at all.\n\nReaders meet Ayush in a scene nearly too painful to read. Home alone with his kindergarten-age twins, Ayush skips their bedtime story in favor of a documentary about an abattoir. Mukherjee describes this moment in vivid visual detail, contrasting the children's sweet bedroom decor (cherries on the bedding; sea creatures on the night-light) to the laptop screen, which shows slaughtered pigs on a floor \"so caked with layers of old solidified blood and fresh new infusion that it looks like a large wedge of fudgy chocolate cake.\" Unsurprisingly, the twins sob hysterically as the video plays; their distress upsets Ayush so acutely that he cannot talk. But rather than comfort them once he regains speech, he doubles down on the decision that he has to teach them about cruelty to animals-and about their complicity in it. He puts his children to bed not with an apology or a lullaby, but with the stern reminder that \"what you saw was how our meat comes to us.\"\n\nRead: The books that help me raise children in a broken world\n\nAyush seems like a monster in this scene-and not an unfeeling one, which signals to the reader that he may be as much tortured as torturer. Mukherjee swiftly makes it apparent that this is the case. We see him begging Luke to help teach their too-young children to weigh the morality of \"things that don't appear to be choices,\" such as eating meat; Luke, in turn, begs Ayush to examine the roots of his unhappiness and anxiety, his compulsion to conserve energy far beyond what could reasonably be useful. Ayush yearns to \"shake off his human form\" and become one with nature-or, more ominously, vanish into it. At one point, Ayush takes his children to explore some woods outside London, an activity that many parents might relate to: He wants to share the wonder of the natural world with his children, both as a bonding activity and as a lesson in ecological stewardship. But he can't focus on Masha and Sasha. What he hears instead is that the \"great trees are breathing; Ayush wants to still his heart to hear them.\" Mukherjee only implies this, but it seems that all Ayush's experiences lead to this paradox: His love for the Earth makes him want to erase himself from it.\n\nAyush's relationship with his children is also shaped by a desire to remove himself, as well as a significant amount of attendant guilt. He is the twins' primary parent, despite the fact that he never wanted children-a revelation that Mukherjee builds to slowly. Ayush's anxieties about choosing parenthood are legion. He's upset by the ecological impact of adding to the Earth's human population, and believes that his twins will face a future of walled cities and climate refugeeism. Having grown up South Asian in Britain, he's frightened of exposing children to the racism he's faced his whole life; he also has a half-buried but \"fundamental discomfort about gay parenting,\" of which he is ashamed. Most of all, before having children, he didn't want to have a baby who could become like him-\"a consumed, jittery, unsettled creature.\" His own unhappiness, he feels, should have precluded him from having children. Yet he acquiesced, a choice he partly disavows by suppressing his memory of why he did. Not only does he go along with having children; he takes daily responsibility for raising them.\n\nOn the surface, this is the case because Ayush earns less than Luke, a dynamic the novel explores with nuance. In straight partnerships, the question of who parents more is very often gendered, which Mukherjee acknowledges: At one point, Luke, who has a big job and generational wealth, dismisses Ayush with a sexist reference to the \"pin-money\" he earns in publishing. But there are more layers here. Ayush, it seems, takes responsibility for his children in order to atone for not having wanted them. Luke, who pushed for fatherhood, is the more patient and affectionate parent, while Ayush is busy fretting over the environmental impact of disposable diapers. Luke is also much kinder and more open to Ayush than Ayush is to him: Although Luke is an economist, with a genuine belief in the rationality that undergirds his discipline, he's motivated far more by his emotions than his ideas.\n\nAyush believes himself to be the opposite. His domestic decisions are often logical (or logical-seeming) responses to climate anxieties, but this impulse becomes more disturbing as it influences his child-rearing. Sometimes, he seems to care more about raising Masha and Sasha as environmentalists than he does about any other aspect of their upbringing-almost as though he wants to offset having had them to begin with. He doesn't necessarily want to be this way: After the somewhat-failed forest outing, Ayush takes the twins on a walk around London and teaches them to come up with similes and metaphors to describe what they see, making a game of comparing dandelions to egg yolks and lemons. Here, he successfully keeps his attention on his children, but he still spins a tender moment into one of moral exigency. \"Will this remain in their memory,\" he wonders, \"make them look up and out, make them notice, and, much more importantly, notice again?\" For Ayush, this qualifies as optimism. He's trying to control his children's way of seeing the world, but he is also trying to offer them the gift of coexisting, happily, with the Earth.\n\nRead: The book that captures my life as a dad\n\nMukherjee does give Ayush one way of communing peacefully with nature: his relationship with his dog, Spencer. The writer Joy Williams has said that any work of fiction should have an \"animal within to give its blessing,\" which Spencer certainly does in Choice. Mukherjee describes Ayush's devotion to his dog in lush detail; the book's most beautiful passages have Spencer in them. Ayush's heart breaks when he realizes that Luke does not see \"you, me, and the dog\" as family enough; it breaks far more deeply when Spencer grows too old to \"bound to the door ... surprised by joy, impatient as the wind, when any member of his family comes in.\" Among Ayush's most treasured memories is a spring morning with Spencer: Then a puppy, he had rolled in wild flowers so that his \"silky golden throat and chest had smelled of violets for a brief second, then the scent had disappeared. Ayush had sat on the ground, sniffing Spencer's chest for another hit of that elusive perfume, but it was gone.\"\n\nAyush plainly sees Spencer as his child, and yet the dog also gives him a way to experience the \"elusive perfume\" of a pleasurable connection with the planet. As Spencer ages and that link is harder to sense, Ayush's unhappiness grows. He understands that he is grieving preemptively for Spencer, but the approaching loss of his dog-an event he cannot control or avoid-does not motivate him to snuggle with Spencer or prepare his children for the loss. Instead, it makes him want to leave his family when Spencer does-as if, without the connection to nature that the dog offers, he can no longer bear to be caged in his family home.\n\nBy the end of his section of Choice , Ayush has completely lost the ability to make rational decisions. He betrays Spencer in a scene perhaps even more painful than the book's opening, thinking that he's doing his beloved dog a service; he also betrays his children, his husband, his life. All of his efforts to control his family's ecological impact, to do the right research and calculations, to impart all the right moral lessons, lead directly, maybe inexorably, to this tragic point. At the novel's start, he tells Luke that he wants their kids to understand \"choices and their consequences.\" But it ultimately becomes clear that he can't accept the consequences of his choice to have children. He can't save the planet for his children; nor can he save it from them-and so, rather than committing to guiding them into a future he can't choose or control, he abdicates his responsibility for them.\n\nMukherjee leaves Ayush's family behind rather than linger on the aftermath of these betrayals. He moves on to two narratives the reader will recognize as parts of books that Ayush edited: first a story about a young English academic who begins meddling in-and writing about-the life of an Eritrean rideshare driver, then an essay by a disillusioned economist who describes the misery that ensues when an aid organization gives a Bengali family a cow that is meant to lift them from poverty, but radically worsens their situation instead. Mukherjee imbues these sections with a propulsive mix of anger and grace, but neither is especially complicated. Emily, the academic, has no one who depends on her, and her odd choices concerning the rideshare driver, Salim, have no real consequences for anyone but herself. Sabita, the mother of the family that gets the cow, is so wholly at the mercy of her material conditions that choice is hardly a relevant concept to her-something that she understands, though the cow-providing \"people from the city\" do not.\n\nEmily's section primarily serves as a portrait of choice amid abundance. Sabita's, meanwhile, underscores the central idea of Ayush's: that our efforts at control are, by and large, delusions. For parents, this can be especially painful to accept. We want our choices to guarantee our children's safety, their comfort, their happiness. For Ayush, who believes fervently that his twins will grow up to inhabit a \"burning world,\" the fact that he can't choose something better for them drives him away from them. By not showing the consequences of Ayush's actions, Mukherjee leaves incomplete the book's exploration of parenting. What his abdication means to Masha, Sasha, and Luke is hidden. What it means to the reader, though, is clear. In Choice , there is no such thing as a perfect decision or a decision guaranteed to go right. There are only misjudgments and errors-and the worst of those are the ones that can never be undone.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "The Novelist's Choice\n\nFOR a number of years, in my desultory novel-reading, I have found myself occasionally dropping into a particular line of speculation. As I re-read The Mill on the Floss , for instance, I fall to wondering what kind of story it would have made if George Eliot had allowed Tom to tell it. He would have done it bluntly, honestly, without condoning his own faults and mistakes, we may be sure; but also, we may be equally sure, without condoning Maggie's. We should probably have been left in the dark as to the motiving of her acts. Stephen Guest would have fared rather badly, Philip Wakem even worse, and Mrs. Tulliver and Sister Glegg and Sister Pullet would hardly have come in as characters at all, since Tom had none of the special sort of humorous sense to which they appeal. Very likely Tom would have failed as signally to do justice to his own character as to Maggie's - his powers were not in the line of conscious self-portrayal.\n\nThe more I speculate about this, the more amused and interested I am. And when, after it, I come back to the real story, as it was actually written, I find myself keener to appreciate the things which I discover there - the embodied result of the novelist's choice to tell her story as she did and not otherwise.\n\nI have sometimes tried Henry Esmond in the same way. I fancy it told, for example, through the letters or the diary of Beatrix. What a stormy recital it would be! Fragmentary, capricious, concealing more than it revealed, for Beatrix would never have been what is called simply honest, even with herself. And yet, whatever she wrote, however she posed, whatever tricks of the spirit she perpetrated, I fancy we could have guessed at her story and her nature in spite of herself. The more one thinks of it, the more one longs for a chance to try, anyhow - to have at those letters or that diary. And then one remembers, - to be sure! there are no letters, there is no diary; we were only supposing. What a pity! Yet could we, for their sakes, give up the story as it is?\n\nOr, again, imagine the story told in the modern, dramatic way: not by any character acting as narrator, not by the author as author, not by anybody self-confessed, but allowed to enact itself upon the pages of the book as upon a stage - a few stage-directions supplied in place of scenery and real action, each participant speaking in turn, and the reader left to orient himself as he can. Fancy the beginning: -\n\n'My name is Henry Esmond.'\n\n'His name is Henry Esmond, sure enough,' said Mrs. Worksop.\n\n'So this is the little priest,' said Lord Castlewood. 'Welcome, kinsman.'\n\n'He is saying his prayers to Mamma!' said little Beatrix.\n\nBut no, don't fancy it! Let us stop right here, and go back to those leisurely and deliberate first chapters as they now stand. Already one feels a little ashamed of having allowed one's self to lay such unhallowed hands upon the tale, and one determines to cease experimenting, at least upon Henry Esmond, and leave him to the undisputed possession of his grave, decorous and altogether delightful narrative. And yet, this habit of speculation once formed, one is tempted ever afresh to its indulgence - tempted often at the most unexpected point: as I read over the pretty drama of Romeo and Juliet, I am by some freak of the mind led to wonder what their story would sound like, told by Juliet's nurse.\n\nIt seems curious that writers themselves have not experimented in this way with their own material. Browning, indeed, the king of experimenters, did it once. But, except The Ring and the Book, I do not think of anything of the kind. And The Ring and the Book is so much more than a study in storytelling that it is as well to leave it with this passing mention.\n\nObviously, it makes a difference, this choice of the novelist. It is, of course, only one of the things that go to determining what a novel will be like, but it is surely one. Thackeray is always Thackeray, whether he chooses to tell his tale through the mouth of one of his characters or to step forward in his own person and talk frankly about his people as they pass before him. He is still Thackeray, yet there is a vast difference between the atmosphere of Esmond, which gives us the peaceful and deliberate reminiscences of an old man, and the atmosphere of Vanity Fair, where the author is avowedly himself, like a showman with his puppets. Perhaps it was the choice of the novelist that produced the difference, perhaps it was something inherent in the two tales, as he regarded them, that led to the choice. At all events, the choice itself is worth thinking of.\n\nThe expedient of putting a story into the mouth of one of the actors in it - that is, the autobiographical method - has great antiquity, being at least as old as the Odyssey. Vernon Lee, in an interesting if whimsical essay of hers on 'Literary Construction,' maintains that it is essentially an expedient of immaturity. ' I have no doubt,' she says, 'that most of the stories which we have all written between the ages of fifteen and twenty were either in the autobiographical or the epistolary form . . . and altogether reproduced, in their immaturity, the forms of an immature period of novel-writing, just as Darwinism tells us that the feet and legs of babies reproduce the feet and legs of monkeys. For, difficult as it is to realize, the apparently simplest form of construction is by far the most difficult; and the straightforward narrative of men and women's feelings and passions, of anything save their merest outward acts - the narrative which makes the thing pass naturally before the reader's mind - is by far the most difficult, as it is the most perfect.'\n\nStevenson, whose powers as a storyteller can hardly be called immature, yet averred that it was the easiest way. He writes to Edmund Gosse, 'Yes, honestly, fiction is very difficult. . . . And the difficulty of according the narrative and the dialogue (in a work in the third person) is extreme. That is one reason out of half a dozen why I so often prefer the first.'\n\nEvidently here he was thinking more of style than of construction, and one would like to know the rest of the halfdozen reasons why he preferred the first person for his stories. Perhaps we can guess at some of them. For the autobiographical form seems to settle a good many other matters besides this one of literary pitch. It prescribes in many ways the point of view. The general attitude of the actor-narrator toward the chain of events which he relates, is predetermined by his own part in those events.\n\nBut probably the strongest justification for the form is that it carries with it a certain air of genuineness. A man's own story has a value as such, as the newspaper interview testifies every day. It imposes upon us, in spite of ourselves, a prepossession in favor of its truth. Now, whatever else the novelist may wish to do, he always, first of all, wishes to create in his readers this illusion of reality. He wants to have his story seem true. He knows, indeed, that it is not true. We know it is not true. He knows that we know. And yet, he will spend months in dull research for the sake of supplying his tale with certain small earmarks of veracity that may, perchance, trick the public into a moment of doubt. He will furnish forth his story with elaborate introductions and appendices, accounting for his own share, and the publisher's share, in it, with the hope that he may be able to persuade us, at least for half an hour, that he, the author, is really and truly only the 'interested friend' to whom the papers were left; that he has really been only the recipient of a dying confession, only the discoverer of a long-hidden diary. And if he succeeds, what triumph! Is there any one who would be proof against the flattery implied in such inquiries as were aroused by Nancy Stair as to the real genealogy of the Stair family?\n\nTo this endeavor to make his story seem like the narrative of actual occurrences the novelist has been partly driven by the attitude of his readers. ' Convincing ' is the critic's word now -a novel must be 'convincing.' The word is modern, the attitude which it connotes is modern. Not that readers of old did not find pleasure in giving themselves up to the story-teller. But they gave themselves up more easily than readers do now. The old storyteller began his tale smoothly enough: 'There was once a beautiful girl, who had a cruel step-mother and two wicked step-sisters.' Very good. His listeners, with a habit of acquiescence, accepted at once the beauty of the heroine, the cruelty and wickedness of the others. For them the tale was sufficiently convincing. Even the fairy godmother passed unchallenged. Who knew that fairy godmothers might not exist somewhere?\n\nBut we have lost the habit of acquiescence. We are proving all things, and we hold fast to very little. We challenge, we scrutinize, we dissect. We have opinions about the limits of the possible, the probable, and the inevitable. And nothing really satisfies us but the inevitable.\n\nTo make his tale seem inevitable, then, is the author's ambition, and he is aware that if he is to do this he cannot get to work in the old manner. If he begins, ' There was once a beautiful girl, with a cruel step-mother and two wicked-' 'Ah, wait!' says his reader, 'this will never do. Cruelty and wickedness are easy words to say, but the things themselves are not to be thus lightly denominated. One must discriminate. How about the step-mother's point of view? In just what Way was she cruel? How did she become so? How do you know she existed at all? She does not seem to us a very real person. She is not convincing. I don't think I care to finish this story.'\n\nThe modern story-teller cannot help being conscious of this attitude on the part of his readers. Probably he has it himself, to some extent, toward his own material. What wonder, then, if, aware of the effectiveness of the expedient, he passes his story over to one of his characters, and loads upon his shoulders the burden of making it 'convincing.'\n\nThis seems, on the face of it, an easy way out. It shifts responsibility from the author to the hero, or whoever it is who is telling the story. 'How do I know? I know because I was there. She was my step-mother.' It is the old reply of Æneas to Dido: 'Quorum pars magna fui.'\n\nAnd not merely an easy way out, but often an excellent way. We have only to run over a few titles, to realize the possibilities of the autobiography as a literary form: Henry Esmond , Robinson Crusoe, Lorna Doone , Jane Eyre, Kidnapped, David Balfour, Peter Ibbetson, Harry Richmond, Joseph Vance, - good books, indeed!\n\nWith such a list before us, it may seem presumptuous to hint that the autobiographical form has its limitations and its drawbacks. Yet I believe it has. For, first, there is a danger in it arising from a fact inherent in human nature: the fact that heroes and minstrels are not usually made of the same stuff. One does things; the other tells about them. The person whom adventures befall is not necessarily the one who is best able to relate them. It is not always so, of course. There are rare beings who are born with the hero and the minstrel soul bound together within them - the Odysseus and the Æneas souls. For them it is very well. It was well for Odysseus, in the hall of the Phæacians, and for Æneas, in the court of Dido, to tell their adventures. They were doubly gifted, for action and for expression. But what if Achilles had tried to tell his story? Or Ajax his? Poor, inarticulate Ajax! There was plenty to tell, but what a botch he would have made of it! He is better off, he and Achilles too, in the hands of Homer.\n\nThe race of the inarticulate has not yet died out. It never will. But we would not wish to miss the telling of their stories because it must be done by other lips than theirs. The story of Quasimodo, the story of Tess, the story of Dorothea Brooke, the story of Clara Middleton, the story of Isabel Archer, these are all, for various reasons, stories which could never have come from the characters themselves. Some of them, perhaps, could have told, but never would have done so. Others would, perhaps, but never could. Most of them probably neither would nor could. And we are glad, when we think about them, that their authors did not force them to the confessional against their natures.\n\nAuthors are not always so considerate. I have read autobiographical novels where the pleasure of the story was continually clouded by a feeling of protest that it should have been told thus. David Balfour, in certain parts of it, gives me this feeling. When he is telling his adventures it is well enough, though even there I should sometimes be glad if the story could have been told quite directly and simply by the author. I should like to know how David looked now and then, as well as what he did. And, of course, David was not the kind of fellow who would ever know how he looked; still less could he ever have written it down as part of an account of his life. But when it comes to his love affairs,and I find him writing these down in some detail, I must protest, 'Oh, David! You know you never would have told that!' And then I find myself suddenly regarding David with suspicion. I long to step into the story and pull his hair and see if it is not, after all, only a wig - to pull his nose, and see if the mask does n't come off, disclosing, not David at all, but David's author, Stevenson.\n\nAh, there is the danger! The story must be told, the secrets must be laid bare - secrets guarded not by big keys and heavy boulders of rock, but by the walls of impenetrable reserve in our own human nature. If they are not told, we are baffled and disappointed. If they are told, we are critical. It is a dilemma.\n\nSometimes, indeed, the problem is successfully met. In Lorna Doone , for example, John Ridd, - plain John Ridd, - telling his own love story, manages to steer along the narrow channel between too much reserve and too little. He loves Lorna,- he is not ashamed to confess that to all the world, - but as to what he says to Lorna about it, or what she says to him, this is a matter which in his opinion is nobody's business but his and hers. And one can almost see the shy, yet humorous, half-smile and heightened color with which he backs away from a love scene and cannily edges round it, to take up the narrative again further on. One could wish that David Balfour had learned a lesson of John.\n\nMoreover, as I have already suggested in the case of David, the autobiographical form is unsatisfactory in another way. If, on the one hand, it gives us too much of the hero-autobiographer's private soul, so that we pray for a little decent reserve, on the other hand, it often gives us too little of his public face, too little of the commonplace externals of his personality. And here again the trouble arises from certain universal facts of human experience. For we arc accustomed to get at people from the outside. We look at their faces, we watch them walk, we listen to their voices, we notice what clothes they wear and how they wear them, we regard them in their goingsout and their comings-in, and after a while we arrive, or think we arrive, at a certain intimacy with what we call their souls. We say we know them. Perhaps we do, and perhaps we don't, but at any rate, such knowledge as we have is reached in this way. It is the way we are accustomed to; we know how to value and allow for its data, how to discount its deceptions - perhaps we even like its baffling reserves.\n\nNow, in the autobiographical novel, all this is reversed: instead of approaching the hero from the outside, we approach him from the inside. Instead of looking into his eyes, we look out of them. In a sense, doubtless, we know him better than if we had approached him through the ordinary channels, but in another sense we do not know him so well. It is too much like the way we know - or rather the way we fail to know - ourselves. And so, in the autobiographical novel one sometimes grows a little tired of looking from within, out. One longs to stand off and get a good plain view of the hero's nose, and his eyes. One wants to see him walk down the street, instead of walking down the street inside him.\n\nAuthors realize this, at least by flashes, and they try to gratify us, sometimes in very amusing ways. Here is Marcelle Tinayre, for example, in Hellé, which is the autobiography of a young girl. She is beautiful,-she manages to imply that without involving herself in any breach of decorum, -but she must in some way be described more fully. So the author makes her stand before a mirror in her ball-gown and set down what she sees there. The ruse is obvious. The action, which would have been natural - indeed inevitable -for a person like Marie Bashkirtseff, is for Hellé entirely out of character. But what would you have? The reader must be told what she looked like.\n\nOn the other hand, such an expedient is sometimes entirely successful. There is a scene in Jane Eyre, where Jane, in a frenzy of mingled jealousy and self-martyrdom, sets herself down before her mirror and paints with remorseless fidelity her own plain face, then paints from memory a portrait of the beautiful lady whom she imagines to be her rival in the affections of Rochester. The action is perfectly natural. I believe Jane was always looking in the glass, not because she admired herself, but because she did not. And this pricking consciousness of her own appearance pervades the whole narrative, so that one has in its perusal very little of this sense that I have been speaking of, of viewing the hero entirely from within.\n\nThis could be achieved in the fictitious autobiography of Jane, just as it was in the real autobiography of Marie Bashkirtseff; but there are types of women with whom it could not be done - women like Dorothea Brooke or Clara Middleton. Clara, struggling hopeless in the net of circumstance, yet flashing keen lights on the people about her, could never turn such light on herself. She was unaware of her own physical loveliness, - her walk, her hair as it curled about her ears and neck. Call such things trifling and external if you will, yet it is through such trifling externals that some of our deepest and most instinctive impressions arise.\n\nBut if self-portraiture is not natural to all women, still less is it so to most men. In Simon the Jester, for example, we find our hero writing thus: 'I looked at him and smiled, perhaps a little wearily. One can always command one's eyes, but one's lips get somet imes out of control. He could not have noticed my lips, however.' Instantly we detect the note of falseness here. Such a man would not have carefully written down the fact that he smiled wearily, and that his friend did not notice his lips. Oscar Wilde would have been aware of such a fact about himself, and when in Dorian Grey he makes his hero run to the mirror to catch his own expression before it fades, we do not challenge it, though we may perhaps question whether Dorian Grey was worth writing about at all. But we do not expect such things from Simon de Gex - we do not expect such things from most men. Of course the fact was, that the author of Simon wanted us to know that Simon's smile was a weary one, and no way of making this clear occurred to him, except that of having Simon himself admit that he smiled wearily. This little passage is not a momentary slip. It is typical of the whole book, which might be used as an illustration of the way in which an unfortunate method of telling the story acts as a handicap from beginning to end. With a rather unusual and very interesting situation to set forth, the author has thrown away his chance of making it seem 'inevitable' by setting up at the start a postulate in which we can never acquiesce - the postulate of Simon de Gex writing himself up.\n\nClearly, description of the hero by himself is dangerous tactics. Yet, where it is not attempted, we miss it. The weakness of the latter part of De Morgan's Joseph Vance is, I believe, due not entirely to the fact that his father died out of the story, but also, among other things, to the fact that Joseph himself, being grown-up, could no longer regard himself impersonally enough to make his personality vivid to us. And readers of the book, if they are at all like me, carry away from it a vivid picture of Joseph Vance the boy, but a very pale picture of Joseph Vance the man.\n\nIt is, perhaps, the endeavor to escape from some of these pitfalls that beset the autobiographical form, and yet to profit by its opportunities, which leads writers to try another expedient. - that is, to let the story be told, not by the hero, but by the hero's friend. The Belovèd Vagabond is done in this way, and very cleverly done. Clearly, it could never have been told by the Vagabond himself. An outside view of him was indispensable. He could never, without stepping entirely out of his own character, have set forth, or even dimly suggested, the portrait of himself, of his whole whimsical, lovable personality, as it is set forth by his young friend and protégé, the street waif, little Asticot.\n\nThe objection to this method is, that the teller of the story, not having the hero's decisive influence on the action, is apt to fade into a nonentity, a shadowy person, so that one scarcely remembers him. In The Belovèd Vagabond this is not true of the first part of the book. There, as in Joseph Vance, the narrator is looking back upon his own child-self. But as little Asticot grows up, and becomes the narrator of his patron's story, he himself recedes, we have no clear picture of him.\n\nSimilarly in The Newcomes, the narrator-friend keeps himself so entirely in the background that I fancy many of us have not realized at all that the story is actually told by one of the characters, and not by Thackeray himself. And I think we may all admit that Pendennis, considered simply as the narrator of the Newcomes' history, is very close to a nonentity.\n\nBut if a nonentity, why there at all? If the actor-narrator pales to a mere literary convention, what is there to gain by keeping him?\n\nVery little to gain, and something to lose. For, whether hero or hero's friend, the teller of the story, once committed to his task of accounting for himself, and for his possession of all the facts of the narrative, cannot lay it down. He must keep on accounting for himself. Every time he narrates an event of which he was not himself an eye-witness, he must explain how he found out about it. If he fails to do this satisfactorily, the entire fabric of probability so carefully built up by the author topples and falls. How does little Asticot know that the English lady is his master's old love? How does he know there was an old love at all? He must account for it. - and does. He saw some old letters, some verses - he put two and two together. We are satisfied this time, but the question may arise again, and we shall need to be satisfied again.\n\nPendennis, conscious of this necessity of accounting for his information, was not so inclined to meet it in this way. He was aware that he could never follow the rules of the game if he interpreted them too strictly, and so made a sort of general confession, a blanket apology, which is worth quoting at length because it so clearly sets forth the difficulties which beset the actor-narrator: -\n\n'In the present volumes, where dialogues are written down which the reporter could by no possibility have heard, and where motives are detected which the persons actuated by them certainly never confided to the writer, the public must, once for all, be warned that the author's individual fancy very likely supplies much of the narrative; and that he forms it as best he may, out of stray papers, conversations reported to him, and his knowledge, right or wrong, of the characters of the persons engaged. And, as is the case with the most orthodox histories, the writer's own guesses or conjectures are printed in exactly the same type as the most, ascertained patent facts. I fancy, for my part, that the speeches attributed to Clive, the Colonel, and the rest are as authentic as the orations in Sallust or Livy, and only implore the truth-loving public to believe that incidents here told, and which passed very probably without witnesses, were either confided to me subsequently as compiler of this biography, or are of such a nature that they must have happened from what we know happened after. For example, when you read such words as que Romanus on a battered Roman stone, your profound antiquarian knowledge enables you to assert that Senatus Populus was also inscribed there at some time or other. . . . You tell your tales as you can, and state the facts as you think they must have been. In this manner Mr. James, Titus Livius, Sheriff Alison, Robinson Crusoe, and all historians proceeded. Blunders there must be in the best of these narratives, and more asserted than they can possibly know or vouch for.'\n\nThere are very few heroes, or hero's friends, who have taken such liberties, but then few have told so good a story as The Newcomes. I fancy we are ready to grant Mr. Pendennis all the privileges he demands, yet I cannot help feeling that Thackeray set him rather too hard a task-a task which, indeed, he might better have assumed himself. In fact, I have this feeling about many of the novels cast in the autobiographical form. They may be good stories as they are, but they might, I suspect, have been just a little better if the author had not limited his own powers by bundling himself up in the clothes and the mask and the wig of one of The characters. I do not feel this about all such novels. Some of them seem to me just right as they are, and after any number of experiments with them - fancying them re-written in this way and that - I come back to the author's choice as the best. This is the case with Lorna Doone and Henry Esmond and Jane Eyre and Kidnapped and Treasure Island and Joseph Vance.\n\nIt seems like a curious company of books to be named in one sentence. Yet, after all, they are of only two kinds: stories of inner experience, told by an introspective hero; and stories of adventure, told by a hero of naïve temperament with a clear grip on the practical in life. That is, in each case, the hero is fitted to his task. John Ridd could not have written Esmond's story nor Esmond John Ridd's, but John Ridd was perfectly capable of writing his own, and Esmond his. Jane Eyre's story, told by any one but herself, would lose something of its value. Told by herself, it is wonderfully impressive as a human document. The life she portrays could not, perhaps, have been what she saw it, but this is how she actually did see it. There never was a man like Mr. Rochester, perhaps. But nobody cares about that. What we are concerned with is her idea of Mr. Rochester. And we are convinced that there was a woman who felt about a man what she felt about Mr. Rochester. The whole book is, in fact, lyric. It is the record of a temperament buffeted about by the impact of people and circumstance, which are viewed only as they affect this temperament. Whether you like that kind of temperament or not is another matter. Given the subject, the book rings true, and the lyric form was undoubtedly the best for it.\n\nIn his search for the 'inevitable,' then, the writer has, after all, nothing to gain by resorting to the expedient of the actor-narrator, unless this actornarrator is himself inevitable, - unless his part as teller of the story fits him so perfectly as to require no apology. This will hardly be the case except with a very limited class of adventure stories, and with a larger class of stories which are the records of an introspective nature. With these exceptions, he usually does better if he works with free hands, - if, taking as his own the apology of Pendennis, he quietly supplies the missing words of the inscription, tells his tales as he can, and states the facts as he thinks they must have been. And if his understanding of life be deep enough, he will create in us the illusion of reality just as surely as if he had sought to establish it by letters and diaries.\n\nEven when freed from a certain kind of accountability, he need not necessarily take any more liberties with his characters than the hero would have done. Pride and Prejudice, for example, is told almost as Elizabeth would have told it herself if she had written it. Hardly any information is given but what she knew, and Darcy's character is not fully cleared up until it is cleared in her eyes. In the Three Musketeers the story is told as D'Artagnan might have told it. What is a mystery to him remains a mystery to the reader. His estimate of the other characters dominates the story. Yet, not being told by him, but by an irresponsible author, the tale is carried on with a lightness and freedom that D'Artagnan himself, writing in character, could hardly have achieved. Howells, in The Rise of Silas Lapham, tells the story from the standpoint of Mr. Lapham, or, now and then, from that of Mrs. Lapham. We are allowed to follow, to some extent, the workings of their minds, but their two daughters are treated externally. As we follow their fortunes and try to predict the outcome, we have little more to go upon than their parents had. This is Howells's usual method, and it is the method of much modern writing.\n\nMr. James, in The Other House, carries the external point of view to such an extreme that at the end of the book, when the evidence is all in, there is still room for question, among intelligent people, as to what really happened; and even more room for disagreement as to what the motives of the characters were. Mr. James also furnishes us the best example I can think of, of the other extreme, where the treatment is exclusively internal. In a curious piece of writing, In the Cage, which I cannot help thinking was a bit of pure experimenting, he attempts to set forth the spiritual states of a girl telegrapher - states of which she herself was only dimly aware, impulses which never reached consciousness, feelings which she never more than half confessed, even to herself.\n\nBetween these two extremes most of the best story-telling is done. Authors do not often openly assume omniscience: they treat their material from the standpoint of an impartial witness. Yet, when omniscience is needed to explain character and interpret motive, -\n\nit is assumed without apology, and the reader grants it without demur. If we think of parts of Vanity Fair and Middlemarch and The Mill on the Floss, of Richard Feverel and The Portrait of a Lady, of Somehow Good and Tess, and many others, we realize what we should be giving up if writers had tied themselves down to the autobiographical form. The more one thinks of it, the more one feels sure that, tempting as it is, its restrictions outweigh its opportunities.\n\nAnd yet - one comes back to Esmond, and one remembers Joseph V ance, and one cannot be satisfied to end the matter in a hard judgment like that. For there is a certain quality in these stories which endears them to us in a peculiar way, and which, I believe, is specially fostered by the autobiographical form in which they are cast. There is a certain type of story with this quality potentially inherent in it, which no other manner of telling could so well bring out. It is a story like Henry Esmond, the story of a long life, told as by one who has lived it, while he rests, near its end, and looks back.\n\nThe love of reminiscence is deeprooted in us. We do not need to have length of years in order to possess it. All we need to have is a consciousness of the past as past. Some years ago, a little friend of mine, then four years old, attained a new phrase: 'Don't you remember?' I say ' attained,' because it was evident that she had not only enlarged her field of expression by a new word, but that she had enlarged her field of experience by a new sensation, - the sensation of reminiscence. For the phrase, 'Don't you remember?' always ushered in a story out of her small past, some event of the preceding winter or summer, some glimpse of history in which she had been actor or witness. It was always uttered with shining eyes and a flush of delight, which deepened if I was able to catch her reminiscence and recognize and enjoy it with her. Yet the things remembered were very simple, -a drive, a walk, a kitten, a child watering his garden or falling down. The pleasure came, clearly, not from the original quality of the experience, but from the very act of remembering. She was tasting the pure pleasure of reminiscence. Watching her, I fell to wandering what was the precious quality of this pleasure whose flavor she was beginning to taste.\n\nThe charm of memory lies, I think, in the quality which it gives things, at once of intimacy and remoteness. The fascination to us of recalling our past selves, our former surroundings, lies in our sense that they are absolutely known to us, yet absolutely out of our reach. We can recall places, houses, rooms, until every detail lives again. We can turn from one thing to another and, as we look at each, lo, it is there! It has a reality more poignant than the hand that we touch or the flower that we smell. Sometimes, it is true, present experiences, even as they occur, have something of this quality. They do not need to recede into the past to gain this glamour. Certain places have it: cathedrals sometimes, and still lakes. Certain things foster it: firelight, and silence, and the steady fall of rain. Certain moments give birth to it: the luminous pause between sundown and dusk, afternoon with its slant of light through deep grass or across a quiet river. This, I fancy, was what Tennyson was thinking of when he called the lotus land the land 'wherein it seemed always afternoon.' In that land these magic moments were prolonged, and thus it became the land of reminiscence.\n\nMy little friend was a thought too young, perhaps, to have entered into this land. It is a place where we do not expect to meet many children. Girls in their twenties sometimes slip in, when they have time, and boys in their teens, and then again, - well, perhaps, boys in their fifties. Indeed the forties and fifties are the usual time for a first real sojourn in these pleasant meadows. One looks over the hedge, or slips through a gap, half by accident, and finding it fair within, one comes back. And again one comes back, and each time one stays longer and wanders farther. And as one growls to know it better, one discovers that there is more than a meadow beyond the hedge. There are many meadows, and great woods and rivers and cities. And the delight of it is, that everything there is like something one has seen before, only lovelier. For, just as still water interprets and recreates the life it reflects, so in the land of memory life is rendered again with a tenderness that is a most precious kind of truth.\n\nIt is not to every one, nor to any one at all times, that the mood of reminiscence comes in its perfection. Often its rarer pleasures are obscured by a pain that is no necessary part of its quality, oftener they are never given the chance to reveal themselves. They require for their enjoyment a contemplative spirit, a soul at leisure, that the waters of memory may be still and clear, mirroring the images of things now plainly, line for line, now blurred and softened by light winds of oblivion that make the vision all the more lovely.\n\nBut this is not a contemplative age, nor is leisure of spirit its chief characteristic. There is little encouragement given to the reminiscent mood, either in literature or in life. Literary endeavor is in the direction of conciseness and swiftness. Its motto is Stevenson's: 'War to the adjective! Death to the optic nerve!'\n\nThis is very good. But there is another kind of thing that is good, too: the kind of thing that comes with the brooding vision, with the remoteness that permits a broader focus and a greater deliberateness of treatment, that finds expression in abundance of delicately-wrought detail. This it is which, for lack of a better name, I am calling the reminiscent manner. One meets it in some poetry, and now and then in such prose as Richard Jefferies's. Its most complete and exquisite embodiment is surely in that rare and perfect prose lyric, Walter Pater's Child in the House. One might expect to find it most of all in the real autobiography, since this is the avowed form of reminiscence. But they are disappointing, these genuine autobiographers. For one thing, they are hampered by their facts. Stevenson was quite right when he said that a finished biography was 'not nearly so finished as quite a rotten novel'; and not only in finish but in other ways it is at a disadvantage compared with fiction. Sometimes its writers may have mistaken notions of their obligation to suppress their own personalities; they must always have instincts of reserve which we cannot fail to understand. At all events, they do not wander in the fields of reminiscence with the free step and the joyous abandon that we could desire. Yet, even so, the rule holds that we have noticed with regard to novels: the chapters dealing with their 'early years' often possess a charm that is lacking in the rest of the narrative. For there is a power in the long backward look that inevitably transfigures.\n\nAnd so it is often to the make-believe autobiographies that we turn for something that is in its essence not makebelieve at all, but a reality of experience. The satisfaction that they give is not of a kind to be justified or made clear by reading sample passages. It is born of the writer's attitude, which through intimacy with him we come to share. Merely to think of Henry Esmond is often enough to throw one into a mood of contemplative reminiscence. A lover of Joseph V ance has but to open the book anywhere for a moment and the color of his thought is changed - he is captured by this charm of the long backward look and the brooding vision. And if through the magic of the mood we are floated a little aside from the remorseless current of immediate living, yet the realities which we thus come to feel are indeed realities, whose recognition we deeply crave, and to whose expression in literature we give eager and loving welcome."

      "text": "A Good Country's Bad Choice\n\nAnd what I got wrong about the 2024 election\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for The Decision , a newsletter featuring coverage of the 2024 race and what comes next.\n\nOnce she became the nominee, I expected Vice President Kamala Harris to win the 2024 presidential election.\n\nMore exactly, I expected ex-President Donald Trump to lose.\n\nWhat did I get wrong?\n\nMy expectation was based on three observations and one belief.\n\nObservation one: Inflation was coming under control in 2024. Personal incomes rose faster than prices over the year. As interest rates peaked and began to subside, consumer confidence climbed . When asked about their personal finances, Americans expressed qualms, yes, but the number who rated their personal finances as excellent or good was a solid 46 percent , higher than in the year President Barack Obama won reelection. The same voters who complained about the national economy rated their local economy much more favorably.\n\nNone of this was great news for the incumbent party, and yet ...\n\nObservation two: All through the 2024 cycle, a majority of Americans expressed an unfavorable opinion of Trump. Almost one-third of Republicans were either unenthusiastic about his candidacy or outright hostile. Harris was not hugely popular, either. But if the polls were correct, she was just sufficiently less unpopular than Trump.\n\nArguably undergirding Harris's popularity advantage was ...\n\nObservation three: In the 2022 midterm elections, abortion proved a powerful anti-Republican voting issue. That year in Michigan, a campaign based on abortion rights helped reelect Governor Gretchen Whitmer and flipped both chambers of the state legislature to the Democrats. That same year, almost a million Kansans voted 59 percent to 41 percent to reaffirm state-constitutional protections for abortion. Democrats posted strong results in many other states as well. They recovered a majority in the U.S. Senate, while Republicans won only the narrowest majority in the House of Representatives. In 2024, abortion-rights measures appeared on the ballot in 10 states, including must-win Arizona and Nevada. These initiatives seemed likely to energize many Americans who would likely also cast an anti-Trump vote for president.\n\nIf that was not enough-and maybe it was not-I held onto this belief:\n\nHuman beings are good at seeing through frauds. Not perfectly good at it. Not always as fast as might be. And not everybody. But a just-sufficient number of us, sooner or later, spot the con.\n\nThe Trump campaign was trafficking in frauds. Haitians are eating cats and dogs. Foreigners will pay for the tariffs. The Trump years were the good old days if you just forget about the coronavirus pandemic and the crime wave that happened on his watch. The lying might work up to a point. I believed that the point would be found just on the right side of the line between election and defeat-and not, as happened instead, on the other side.\n\nMy mistake.\n\nRead: Donald Trump's most dangerous cabinet pick\n\nIn one of the closest elections in modern American history, Trump eked out the first Republican popular-vote victory in 20 years. His margin was about a third the size of President Joe Biden's margin over him in 2020. For that matter, on the votes counted, Trump's popular-vote margin over Harris was smaller than Hillary Clinton's over him in 2016.\n\nYet narrow as it is, a win it is-and a much different win from 2016. That time, Trump won by the rules, but against the expressed preference of the American people. This time, he won both by the rules and with a plurality of the votes. Trump's popular win challenges many beliefs and preconceptions, starting with my own.\n\nThrough the first Trump administration, critics like me could reassure ourselves that his presidency was some kind of aberration. The repudiation of Trump's party in the elections of 2018, 2020, 2021, and 2022 appeared to confirm this comforting assessment. The 2024 outcome upends it. Trump is no detour or deviation, no glitch or goof.\n\nWhen future generations of Americans tell the story of the nation, they will have to fit Trump into the main line of the story. And that means the story itself must be rethought.\n\nTrump diverted millions of public dollars to his own businesses, and was returned to office anyway.\n\nHe was proved in court to have committed sexual assault, and was returned to office anyway.\n\nHe was twice impeached, and was returned to office anyway.\n\nHe was convicted of felonies, and was returned to office anyway.\n\nHe tried to overthrow an election, and was returned to office anyway.\n\nFor millions of Americans, this record was disqualifying. For slightly more Americans, however, it was not. The latter group prevailed, and the United States will be a different country because of them.\n\nAmerican politics has never lacked for scoundrels, cheats, and outright criminals. But their numbers have been thinned, and their misdeeds policed, by strong public institutions. Trump waged a relentless campaign against any and all rules that restrained him. He did not always prevail, but he did score three all-important successes. First, he frightened the Biden administration's Justice Department away from holding him to account in courts of law in any timely way. Second, he persuaded the courts themselves-including, ultimately, the Supreme Court-to invent new doctrines of presidential immunity to shield him. Third, he broke all internal resistance within the Republican Party to his lawless actions. Republican officeholders, donors, and influencers who had once decried the January 6 attempted coup as utterly and permanently debarring-one by one, Trump brought them to heel.\n\nAmericans who cherished constitutional democracy were left to rely on the outcome of the 2024 election to protect their institutions against Trump. It was not enough. Elections are always about many different issues-first and foremost usually, economic well-being. In comparison, the health of U.S. democracy will always seem remote and abstract to most voters.\n\nRead: Trump's first defeat\n\nEarly in the American Revolution, a young Alexander Hamilton wrote to his friend John Jay to condemn an act of vigilante violence against the publisher of a pro-British newspaper. Hamilton sympathized with the feelings of the vigilantes, but even in revolutionary times, he insisted, feelings must be guided by rules. Otherwise, people are left to their own impulses, a formula for trouble. \"It is not safe,\" Hamilton warned , \"to trust to the virtue of any people.\"\n\nThe outcome of an election must be respected, but its wisdom can be questioned. If any divine entity orders human affairs, it may be that Providence sent Trump to the United States to teach Americans humility. It Can't Happen Here is the title of a famous 1930s novel about an imagined future in which the United States follows the path to authoritarianism. Because it didn't happen then, many Americans have taken for granted that it could not happen now.\n\nPerhaps Americans require, every once in a while, to be jolted out of the complacency learned from their mostly fortunate history. The nation that ratified the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 was, in important ways, the same one that enacted the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850; the nation that generously sent Marshall Plan aid after the Second World War was compensating for the myopic selfishness of the Neutrality Acts before the war. Americans can take pride in their national story because they have chosen rightly more often than they have chosen wrongly-but the wrong choices are part of the story too, and the wrong choice has been made again now.\n\n\"There is no such thing as a Lost Cause because there is no such thing as a Gained Cause,\" T. S. Eliot observed in a 1927 essay (here he was writing about the arguments between philosophical Utilitarians and their critics, but his words apply so much more generally). \"We fight for lost causes because we know that our defeat and dismay may be the preface to our successors' victory, though that victory itself will be temporary; we fight rather to keep something alive than in the expectation that anything will triumph.\"\n\nSo the ancient struggle resumes again: progress against reaction, dignity against domination, commerce against predation, stewardship against spoliation, global responsibility against national chauvinism. No quitting."

      "text": "More Is More: Why the Paradox of Choice Might Be a Myth\n\nIt's widely assumed that overwhelming people with options -- whether in TVs or delicious jams -- can make them less likely to make a decision. But maybe that's wrong.\n\nIt could be one of the most memorable economic studies of the last half century.\n\nResearchers presented an array of tasty jams and enticed shoppers to buy a jar. In one version, there were six varieties shown to shoppers. In another, there were 24 jams. The second, larger array attracted more traffic. But the smaller array led to ten times more purchases.\n\nSometimes, they concluded, too many options repel us. The researchers called it \"the paradox of choice.\" You might call it \"feeling overwhelmed by options.\" But some economists are calling it something else: \"complete hogwash.\"\n\nA few years back, the FT 's Tim Harford reported that if the paradox of choice were real, it wouldn't explain why Starbucks boasts 80,000+ drink combinations or why supermarkets offer dozens of varieties of cheese and nearly-identical yogurt and milk products. It's possible, of course, that Starbucks and grocery stores weren't smart about maximizing their profits. But perhaps these fabulously rich international corporations had learned a different lesson about choice: that less isn't always more. More is more.\n\nThe non-paradox of choice got some intellectual ballast when a team of psychologists and economists tried and failed to replicate the famous jam experiment:\n\nAfter designing 10 different experiments in which participants were asked to make a choice, and finding very little evidence that variety caused any problems, Scheibehenne and his colleagues tried to assemble all the studies, published and unpublished, of the [paradox of choice].\n\nThe average of all these studies suggests that offering lots of extra choices seems to make no important difference either way. There seem to be circumstances where choice is counterproductive but, despite looking hard for them, we don't yet know much about what they are. Overall, says Scheibehenne: \"If you did one of these studies tomorrow, the most probable result would be no effect.\"\n\nBut what about the other end of the choice spectrum? What about shoppers who don't have any choice at all? That's the subject of a new article by Daniel Mochon on \"single-option aversion\" in the new Journal of Consumer Behavior .\n\nTo understand single-option aversion, think about bread. A few years ago, Williams-Sonoma had a problem. They couldn't get anybody to buy their breadmaker, which retailed for $279. So they did something that might strike you as bizarre: They started selling a $429 model, as well. Of course, nobody bought the expensive version. But sales of the cheaper model doubled.\n\nWhy?\n\nYou could offer a few reasons. One is that the fundamental rule of prices is that consumers don't know what anything should cost (especially breadmakers) so we're persuaded by clues. The expensive breadmaker here acted as a clue -- a decoy that told other shoppers: Hey, you are getting an amazing deal on this breadmaker!\n\nBut another possible reason is that we're incredibly reluctant to certain items -- especially expensive items -- when only one option is presented. If you walked into a Best Buy store, and there was only one TV left, would you buy it? Even if it was pretty much what you were looking for? Mochon's research would suggest that many of you wouldn't. When he offered DVD players to participants in one study, just 9% said they would buy a Sony model when it was the only option. When paired with a Philips DVD player, the number went up to 32%. The mere presence of options quadrupled willingness to buy. Mochon replicated the finding with TVs and donations.\n\nIn a sentence, when shoppers are given a take-it-or-leave it option, it makes them more interested in searching for comparisons. The paradox of choice theory assumes that too many similar options -- e.g.: multiple varieties of Belgian dark chocolates, or many kinds of jam with strawberry as a main ingredient -- confuse what we're really looking for. But Mochon suggests that similar options heighten distinctions and make us more certain about our final choice.\n\n\"This research suggests that stores should be mindful of offering too few options,\" Mochon said. \"Even if consumers can find an option that they like, they may be unwilling to purchase it without considering other similar options first.\" That's why Best Buy doesn't offer two TV or two cameras. It offers hundreds. It's why Starbucks and Whole Foods aren't irrational to give their shoppers a bounty of options. Sometimes, choices can paralyze us with anxiety and exhaust us. But sometimes, choices reduce anxiety by making us feel like we've searched exhaustively -- and now we're ready to buy.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

      "text": "ICE Barbie Kristi Noem Says Migrant Kids Made 'Choice' to Come to U.S. Illegally\n\nFreelance Reporter\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested on Sunday that children brought to the country illegally by their parents \"have a choice\" in the matter.\n\nIn a discussion about detaining undocumented families, CBS host Margaret Brennan asked if Noem was comfortable with children being locked up in detention centers along with their parents-a policy the Trump administration revived after taking office.\n\n\"Remember, everybody has an option,\" Noem said on Face the Nation . \"They have an option to be here legally or illegally, and they can self-deport as well.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The kids don't really have a choice in this,\" Brennan interjected before she was cut off.\n\n\"Well, the kids do have a choice,\" Noem said. \"If they have parents, they make a choice to keep their families together, if they want to or not.\"\n\nBrennan appeared puzzled at Noem's suggestion that children choose to \"keep their families together\" or do otherwise.\n\nNoem appeared to backtrack, shifting the responsibility back onto parents.\n\n\"If parents make a decision to leave their children behind, then that's a choice that they made as a family,\" she added.\n\nAs part of President Donald Trump's campaign to deport \"millions\" of undocumented immigrants, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement began detaining parents with deportation orders along with their children at a facility in Karnes City, Texas , on Thursday. President Joe Biden had discontinued the practice -which began under former President Barack Obama and continued through Trump's first term-in March 2021, according to the Washington Post .\n\n\"We've got detention facilities across the country, and there's specific ones that are built specifically for families if they are detained,\" said Noem, who has earned the nickname \"ICE Barbie\" for getting dolled up on a series of the agency's raids.\n\nTrump faced withering criticism in his first term for not only detaining immigrant families but also separating parents from children in a policy known as \"forced separation.\" The Trump administration eventually ended the practice after public outcry.\n\nBrennan asked Noem whether DHS planned to resume breaking up families.\n\n\"I don't know that we're actually reviving it,\" Noem snapped back before unleashing criticism on Trump's predecessor.\n\n\"Biden didn't follow the law,\" Noem said. \"He made decisions to ignore federal law in how he handled immigration and enforcement within our borders.\"\n\n\"If you break our law, then there's going to be consequences,\" she added.\n\nNoting that DHS has run up against capacity issues under the president's deportation spree, Brennan asked whether the administration would use military bases like Fort Bliss in Texas to detain immigrants.\n\n\"There is, yes, a plan to use the facilities at Fort Bliss for detention facilities,\" Noem said.\n\nFreelance Reporter\n\nmauriciofca@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Melania Trump Reveals She Is Pro-Choice in Memoir Bombshell\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nMelania Trump , the wife of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump , proudly professes her support for abortion and a woman's right to choose in her forthcoming memoir, according to The Guardian .\n\nSeveral of Melania 's strongest pro-choice excerpts were published by the newspaper, which obtained a copy of the book, on Wednesday.\n\n\"Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes,\" the former first lady writes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.\"\n\nThe report comes just hours after Melania's husband confirmed for the first time that, if re-elected to the White House, he would veto a national abortion ban.\n\nTrump previously sidestepped the question, saying at last month's presidential debate that he hadn't discussed the matter with his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance , who'd previously claimed that the former president would veto a federal ban.\n\nAt the debate, Vice President Kamala Harris also said, \"Understand, if Donald Trump were to be reelected, he will sign a national abortion ban.\"\n\nTrump shot back that was a \"lie,\" and there was no reason to sign a ban \"because we've gotten what everybody wanted.\"\n\nHe leaned into that line of argument in an all-caps Truth Social post on Tuesday night, saying that the question of abortion was \"up to the states to decide based on the will of their voters (the will of the people!)\"\n\nAt the end of August, Trump also said that he would personally vote \"no\" to repealing Florida's restrictive six-week abortion ban-an upcoming ballot measure that Melania, as The Guardian pointed out, seems poised to vote \"yes\" on.\n\n\"I have always believed it is critical for people to take care of themselves first,\" Melania writes in Melania . \"It's a very straightforward concept; in fact, we are all born with a set of fundamental rights, including the right to enjoy our lives. We are all entitled to maintain a gratifying and dignified existence.\n\n\"This common-sense approach applies to a woman's natural right to make decisions about her own body and health.\"\n\nIn Melania , Melania outlines several \"legitimate reasons\" for pregnant patients to seek abortions, including rape, incest, danger to the life of the mother, and congenital birth defects, according to The Guardian .\n\nShe also acknowledges that many \"opt for abortions due to personal medical concerns,\" and appeals to the reader for compassion and understanding.\n\n\"Our next generation,\" she implores, \"must be provided with knowledge, security, safety, and solace, and the cultural stigma associated with abortion must be lifted.\"\n\nHer stance is a pointed break from that of many in the Republican Party, although the official party platform hews closer to Trump's leave-it-to-the-states position.\n\nThe platform, released this summer, saw the party drop its long-standing support for broad federal restrictions on abortion, infuriating anti-abortion advocates who attacked the new language as watered down.\n\nThe same advocates, however, were pleased at the inclusion of language linking abortion to the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment, suggesting that future courts could yet expand the legal concept of fetal personhood.\n\nSince the fall of Roe v. Wade , around half of U.S. states have introduced bans or restrictions on abortion, with 13 states passing so-called trigger bans prior to the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that took effect immediately after.\n\nThough nominally tight-lipped about her personal life and political views, Melania has opened up-to a point-in recent interviews pegged to her book, which is slated to hit shelves Oct. 8.\n\nLate last month, she said on Fox & Friends that her husband would have liked to have more children after they welcomed Barron in 2006, a year after they wed.\n\n\"I was always perfectly fine with one. And Donald was encouraging to have more,\" she said. \"And I said, like, 'I'm completely fine with one because it's [a] very busy life.'\"\n\nMelania called the couple's set-up \"just perfect.\"\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\namanda.mcdougall@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

The Democratic nominee beat out GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump in the 2024 edition of Nickelodeon's \"Kids Pick the President\" campaign, in which America's future voters are encouraged to make their voices heard in a less-than-scientific online poll. The result, a 52-to-48-percent edge for Harris, mirrors the prediction of some-perhaps more rigorous-national polls, with the election a week away. Harris has a four-point popular vote lead in the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll while other major pollsters have the race essentially deadlocked . Over 32,000 kids cast their digital ballot during Nickelodeon's polling period from Oct. 3 to Oct. 23. The result was officially announced in a half-hour special last night, hosted by TV host and former NFLer Nate Burleson and his daughter Mia. Meanwhile, Harris and Trump both continue to campaign feverishly to win over swing-state residents of legal voting age ahead of the general election on Nov. 5.\n\nNews Reporter\n\nliam.archacki@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War!,\" Trump wrote . \"IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. If we don't make a 'deal,' and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It's time to 'MAKE A DEAL,'\" he added \"NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!\"\n\nThe threat comes a day after Trump, who has long drawn criticism for his amiable relationship with the Kremlin, issued a rebuke to Putin, saying from the Oval Office that the war was \"destroying Russia.\"\n\nTrump did, however, cushion the blow of his ultimatum with a healthy amount of boot-licking.\n\n\"I'm not looking to hurt Russia,\" he wrote in the post. \"I love the Russian people, and always had a very good relationship with President Putin - and this despite the Radical Left's Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX. We must never forget that Russia helped us win the Second World War, losing almost 60,000,000 lives in the process.\"\n\nTrump sustained a friendly-and occasionally fawning-relationship with Putin over the course of his first presidency.\n\nThat connection reportedly didn't completely dissipate when Trump left office in 2021. Putin and Trump exchanged as many as seven secret phone calls between 2021 and 2024, according to a book released by legendary journalist Bob Woodward in October of last year.\n\nOn the campaign trail, though, Trump, who opposes America's aid to Ukraine's war effort, often bragged that he would bring a quick end to the conflict that has raged for nearly two years.\n\nNews Reporter\n\nliam.archacki@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

While living in Wisconsin, she met Bartell, and the two quickly entered a serious relationship. They married during the pandemic, which is around the time Muñoz's visa lapsed. Since then, she had been working to obtain permanent residency.\n\nWhen the couple tried to return to the continental U.S., an immigration agent pulled Muñoz aside to ask if she was an American citizen. She admitted that she was not and tried to explain that she was in the process of getting a green card.\n\nDespite being married to a U.S. citizen, she was arrested and remains in a detention facility in Louisiana. Muñoz has no criminal record.\n\nICE did not respond to the Daily Beast's request for comment on the situation.\n\nDuring the early days of his presidency, Trump has sought to crack down on immigration and deport undocumented immigrants en masse.\n\nBartell told Newsweek that the ordeal has been painful.\n\n\"It's all been a nightmare really, taking things as they come and moving forward,\" he said. \"We have an attorney. The system for getting people through seems to be very inefficient, so it is taking longer than it should.\"\n\nBartell said that he doesn't blame the president.\n\n\"He didn't create the system, but he does have an opportunity to improve it,\" he told Newsweek . \"Hopefully, all this attention will bring to light how broken it is.\"\n\nDespite standing by Trump, Bartell isn't afraid to criticize ICE and its procedures.\n\n\"ICE never really has any information, it seems,\" he said. \"The system needs to be revamped for better processes and communication between departments.\"\n\nThe couple met in the tiny town of Wisconsin Dells, Wisc., which has a population of 3,000. They married after dating for two years but hadn't been able to go on a honeymoon during the pandemic.\n\nThey were saving up for a house together, and Muñoz was already caring for Bartell's 12-year-old son, according to USA Today . She worked and paid taxes.\n\nBartell shook as he watched his wife taken away. It took him a week to track down her whereabouts, although the two have since spoken on the phone.\n\nWhile Trump has said that his initial immigration crackdown will target dangerous criminals, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed at a press conference in January that people who overstay their visas will not be spared.\n\n\"If an individual is overstaying their visa, they are, therefore, an illegal immigrant residing in this country, and they are subject to deportation,\" she said.\n\nBartell has launched a GoFundMe to raise money to fight for his wife's release as well as the bond, which he said could be as much as $10,000. The campaign has raised nearly $900 of its $3,000 goal.\n\nNews Reporter\n\nliam.archacki@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

But the sheer amount of inconsistencies he and his GOP cronies have employed to clarify his stance on abortion has Seth Meyers seeing red.\n\nIn 2016, Trump made a campaign promise to appoint enough anti-abortion justices to get Roe v. Wade overturned. Ever since he made good on that promise, he's been bragging about it every chance he gets-including as recently as Monday of this week .\n\nBut now that that decision has proven to be very unpopular with voters in all parties, and in even the most conservative states, Trump and his cronies are doing their best to repaint the former president's stance on a woman's right to choose.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Trump is now trying to trick everyone into thinking he's actually a moderate on abortion, who opposes a national abortion ban,\" fumed Meyers on Wednesday.\n\nResponding to a video posted earlier this week in which Trump relayed that \"Many people have asked me what my position is on abortion and abortion rights,\" Meyers said: \"Oh, people keep asking you what your position on abortion is? You know what that means, my man? You're a shit communicator. You were president for four years, you never shut your fucking mouth, and yet people are still wondering where you stand on one of the biggest issues of our times.\"\n\n\"And I get that it's confusing,\" Meyers continued. \"I mean, he seems pro-life, but he definitely seems like a guy who paid for an abortion or at the very least once told a woman he would go halfsies. But the reality is, no one is confused. We all know what Trump's personal opinion is on abortion: Whatever will help him today.\"\n\nPerhaps even more irksome to Meyers is the way that Trump's Republican colleagues are also trying to turn their presumptive presidential nominee into a moderate.\n\n\"Trump and his allies think they can trick everyone into thinking he's a moderate on abortion by lying and claiming he'll leave it up to the states-which he won't,\" said an exasperated Meyers.\n\nHe then shared a quick clip from Fox News in which conservative radio host Mark Simone declared that Trump is \"the pro-choice candidate,\" prompting Meyers to introduce a new segment: \"Seth Tries Really Hard Not to Lose His Shit.\"\n\n\"Trump is the pro-choice candidate? Are you out of your fucking mind,\" Meyers began to respond, then thought better of it and tried again: \"I'm sorry, I believe you are mistaken. Your statements are misleading and you are failing to provide an accurate good faith analysis of the facts. You're inverting the truth for political purposes and gaslighting your viewers by grossly misrepresenting the details of the situation.\"\n\n\"Let me put it another way,\" Meyers offered-then delivered a 10-second response that had to be completely bleeped out, except for one random \"piece of shit.\"\n\n\"Well, I failed,\" Meyers concluded in response to the new segment title.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The FBI Makes a Bizarre Claim About Pro-Choice Terrorism\n\nContributing Editor\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nThe FBI is expanding its focus on domestic terrorism, and that includes pro-choice violence-even though such violence is so vanishingly rare, it's all but nonexistent.\n\nIn testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray disclosed that the bureau has recently \"changed our terminology as part of a broader reorganization of the way in which we categorize our domestic terrorism efforts.\" It's part of a much-heralded reinvigoration of the bureau's domestic terrorism focus after a rising tide of mostly white-supremacist terrorism.\n\nAmong four broad categories of domestic terrorism that the FBI confronts, Wray said, is \"abortion violent extremism.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut Wray wasn't only talking about the pro-life extremism that murders abortion providers in their churches , he hastened to add, but \"people on either side of that issue who commit violence on behalf of different views on that topic.\"\n\nHis questioner, Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA), was puzzled at Wray's seeming equivalence: \"People on either side of that issue don't commit violence.\" In fact, the FBI pointed The Daily Beast to just one episode of pro-choice-inspired terrorism-one that did not involve an actual act of violence, but rather a threat in an online comments section.\n\nBut Wray persisted: \"Well, we've actually had a variety of kinds of violence under that, believe it or not. But at the end of the day.\" Bass asked, \"Really, that blow up buildings and threaten doctors?\" Rather than responding, Wray moved on to detailing the FBI's next domestic-terrorism category, one about \"animal rights and environmental extremism.\"\n\nWray's comments weren't the first instance of the bureau promoting the idea of pro-choice violence as a real threat.\n\nIn 2017, the FBI distributed a brief \"Abortion Extremism Reference Guide\" at a counterterrorism training for local law enforcement, listing \"pro-choice extremists\" as a group of domestic terrorists. The document, first reported by Jezebel , claimed that these extremists \"believe it is their moral duty to protect those who provide or receive abortion services\"-though even this document noted that only one \"pro-choice extremist\" had ever been prosecuted. Additionally, an earlier FBI training document obtained by the ACLU in 2012 referenced pro-choice violence but did not \"provide a single example of violence against abortion opponents,\" the ACLU wrote.\n\n\"Abortion violent extremism\" of any sort accounts for a only small percentage of FBI domestic terrorism cases. Wray on Wednesday that the \"top threat\" of domestic terrorism comes from what he called \"racially/ethnically motivated violent extremists.\" Out of approximately 850 current cases that a senior FBI official cited in congressional testimony last May , about half concern anti-government extremism and another 40 percent concern racist terrorism. That leaves around 85 cases of violence motivated by animal rights, ecological degradation, abortion and miscellaneous cases. An FBI spokesperson confirmed the total caseload and the breakdown are still current.\n\nBut abortion extremism doesn't have an \"either side.\" The primary case of pro-choice violent extremism that the FBI pointed The Daily Beast toward-the same one cited in the 2017 FBI document-is the 2012 conviction of Theodore Schulman, who had a long history of threatening anti-abortion activists.\n\nSchulman's ultimate downfall was the result of posting a threat in the comments section of religious conservative outlet First Things: \" if Roeder is acquitted, someone will respond by killing \" Princeton's Robert George and Father Frank Pavone of Priests for Life, he wrote. That itself spoke to the discrepancy in violence between the two sides. \"Roeder\" was a reference to Scott Roeder, who murdered abortion provider George Tiller in the foyer of a Wichita church in 2009.\n\nOther instances of anti-abortion violence include a trio of bombings at Florida abortion clinics in 1985, a string of arson attacks on a Washington clinic in 1983, and a 2015 shooting at a Colorado Planned Parenthood that killed three. Between 1993 and today, anti-abortion activists murdered 11 people and attempted to kill another 26, according to the National Abortion Federation .\n\n\"Anti-choice violence as we know it is constant, pervasive, and escalating dramatically, and it threatens the civil liberties as well as the lives of our patents, our members, our society,\" NAF President Katherine Ragsdale told The Daily Beast.\n\nWray's comments, she added, are a \"danger to public perception.\"\n\n\"It tars everyone with the same brush when in fact pro-choice folks simply are not doing this,\" she said.\n\nThe Daily Beast has filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FBI to document the extent of its focus on alleged pro-choice violent extremism.\n\nMila Johns, a domestic terrorism researcher affiliated with the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), said violence was \"very much lopsided in the other direction,\" the anti-abortion side, and called Wray's equivalence \"a very political statement.\"\n\nSTART maintains the Global Terrorism Database, which tracks terrorist attacks across the world since 1970. The database records about 300 incidents related to anti-abortion violence and none for pro-choice violence. However, an Austin woman in 2016 was charged with throwing a crude Molotov cocktail at anti-abortion protesters. And last year, an 85-year old anti-abortion protester in San Francisco was knocked to the ground after he attempted jamming the bicycle spokes of a man who appears to have stolen a pro-life group's banner.\n\nTroy Newman, the president of Operation Rescue-a radical anti-abortion group that moved its headquarters to Wichita, Kansas, specifically to target Dr. Tiller-said his movement has been on the receiving end of threats. He estimated he had made between 20 and 50 complaints to federal law enforcement over the last two decades, for everything from anthrax scares to online intimidation. Wichita resident Christopher Thompson, he noted, was sentenced to 12 months in jail last year for making menacing calls to Operation Rescue's office and employees.\n\nBut when asked about specific instances of pro-choice violence, Newman cited only the murder of James Pouillon, an Operation Save America activist who was shot while protesting abortion outside a high school in 2009. (The judge in that case said the killer's motivations were not tied to abortion .) Newman declined to give examples of abortion-rights violence of the scale and magnitude of that enacted by the anti-abortion movement. \"You got your scorecard and I got mine,\" he said. \"All of them are terrible.\"\n\nThe FBI's position is that pro-choice activists and groups not concerned with violence don't need to worry about the new domestic terrorism categorization. \"We don't investigate ideology or rhetoric or anything of that sort,\" Wray testified.\n\nAn FBI spokesperson declined to comment, but pointed to comments from the bureau's former assistant director for counterterrorism, Mike McGarrity, from last June. \"It is important to remember that in line with our mission to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States, no FBI investigation can be opened solely on the basis of First Amendment-protected activity,\" McGarrity testified to a House panel in June. \"Rather, domestic terrorism investigations on individuals are opened on the basis of information concerning the occurrence or threat of violent criminal actions by the individual in furtherance of an ideology.\"\n\nHowever, prior episodes during the 18-year-old war on terror show the FBI does not always hold a rigid distinction between ideology that isn't to be investigated and violence that is. In 2011, its counterterrorism training at Quantico included instructional material that held Islam was an ideology, rather than a religion, with violence baked into its doctrines. The point of the training was to portray Islam itself as a threat to national security -which, for an investigative entity with broad domestic powers, was ominous enough for the Obama administration to order the training materials removed .\n\nMichael German, a former FBI special agent who investigated domestic terrorism, said the FBI was not only engaging in a false equivalence but \"the manufacturing of an imaginary violent movement,\" reminiscent of its now-discarded \"black identity extremism\" category.\n\nThe bureau \"seems to be grasping a tiny number of unrelated incidents that are not part of any organized effort to falsely imply that such a 'domestic terrorist' movement exists,\" said German, now with the Brennan Center for Justice. \"This is a misleading analysis of dubious purpose, apparently to satisfy some political constituency, which is not what an objective law enforcement agency should be doing.\"\n\nBut for some in the reproductive rights space, the threat posed by anti-abortion violence is enough that they are willing to accept dubious FBI categorization to ensure it gets investigated.\n\n\"Those of us in this movement have lost friends and family,\" Ragsdale said. \"By all means, investigate the escalating violence.\"\n\n\"And if politics requires you to have a category that says pro-choice violence, go right ahead,\" she added. \"I'd be interested to see if anything ever pops up.\"\n\nContributing Editor\n\nspencerackerman@gmail.com\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nWe look at the results of Tuesday's U.S. elections with The Nation 's Amy Littlefield and John Nichols, who say the results leave no doubt that protecting and expanding abortion rights is motivating voters across the country. Ohio approved a state constitutional amendment to protect reproductive access, overcoming numerous procedural hurdles from opponents, and Democrats won key races for the governor's mansion in Kentucky and the Virginia statehouse based on enduring voter anger over abortion restrictions. \"This is one of the best nights for Democrats in an off-year election that we've seen in a very, very long time,\" says Nichols, who adds that the results suggest the electorate is more progressive than pundits often claim. Littlefield notes that after decades of abortion being treated as a third rail in U.S. politics, Democrats now \"need the abortion rights movement more than the movement needs them.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We begin today's show with results from Tuesday's election, which included major victories for abortion rights advocates after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.\n\nIn Ohio, voters overwhelmingly approved a state constitutional amendment to, quote, \"make and carry out one's own reproductive decisions,\" including contraception, abortion, fertility treatment and miscarriage care. Republicans had tried to derail the measure with misinformation and undemocratic procedural changes, and the conservative legal activist Leo Leonard's dark money network spent $18 million opposing it.\n\nIn Kentucky, Democratic Governor Andy Beshear was reelected in the otherwise red state, defeating Republican Trump-endorsed Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who backed the state's near-total abortion ban and is known for calling the police killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville justified.\n\nIn Virginia, Democrats maintained control of the state Senate and ended Republican control of the House after a campaign focused heavily on abortion rights. The victory will block Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin from enacting parts of his far-right agenda, including a ban on abortions after 15 weeks.\n\nFor more on all of this, we're joined in Madison, Wisconsin, by John Nichols, The Nation 's national affairs correspondent, and in Boston by Amy Littlefield, abortion access correspondent at The Nation .\n\nWe welcome you both back to Democracy Now! Amy, let's begin with you. Clearly, across the country, the choice was choice. Can you talk first about Ohio and what happened there, and take us to Mississippi, to Virginia and Kentucky?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : Amy, before I start, I just want to thank you and the entire team at Democracy Now! for your coverage of Gaza. Thank you for reminding us why we need independent media in this moment. And thank you for bringing us a modicum of hope during this horrific Israeli bombardment in the form of voices of resistance around the world speaking out, demanding a ceasefire now.\n\nAnd I feel honored to be able to add my own tiny ray of hope this morning, Amy, to the show, and that is that in Ohio, voters resoundingly approved a measure to enshrine abortion rights, as well as the right to continue a pregnancy, to seek contraception, to seek miscarriage care and fertility treatments in the Ohio state Constitution. Was it close? It was not close. Fifty-seven percent of voters, last I checked, approved this measure.\n\nAnd they did so despite an overwhelming amount of official misinformation, I mean, starting with the fact that the summary that voters saw in the ballot box referred to the unborn child and had misleading information that was approved by the Ohio state Supreme Court, which, fun fact, the Ohio Governor Mike DeWine's son sits on that court. It came after Ohio Republicans on the official state Senate website, which the Associated Press pointed out is privileged in search results because it's an official website, were using inflammatory language referring to the dismemberment of children, in order to defeat this ban.\n\nIt comes after an attempt to kneecap direct democracy in the state by making it harder to pass initiatives like this over the summer, which Ohio voters saw through and resoundingly defeated. And then, for good measure, you saw Secretary of State Frank LaRose come in and purge 30,000 Ohio voters from the rolls at the last minute. And still Ohio voters resoundingly approved this abortion rights amendment.\n\nOhio is the seventh state to vote directly on abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , and it is the seventh state to go for the abortion rights position. So, we are 7-and-0 now for the pro-choice position. And importantly, it is the first state that is Republican-led to vote on a proactive pro-choice amendment like this, with this swirling official misinformation.\n\nAnd, you know, there is an important caveat here, Amy, which is that the amendment in Ohio does allow abortion to be banned after viability. A lot of abortion rights supporters I talked to saw this as a concession that wasn't necessary. And I think looking at the overwhelming margin that this passed by and the fact that anti-abortion forces in the state were using inflammatory language about abortion up until birth and abortion at every stage of pregnancy, regardless of the fact that this allowed the Legislature to ban abortion after viability except to save the health of the pregnant person, should raise questions about concessions like that in the future.\n\nBut I think the overwhelming message, Amy, coming out of the election on Tuesday is that voters are still big mad about the Dobbs decision. And I have to say, you know, after I came on the show following the Kansas results last summer, and then after the midterms, at every step of the way media pundits are saying, \"Are people still mad about Dobbs ? Are they going to stay mad about Dobbs , or is that anger going to fade?\" I'm sorry, Amy, this is insulting to insinuate that. It's not like we all experienced a moment of collective hysteria after the Dobbs decision and all got our periods and got mad temporarily and then forgot that Republicans single-handedly overturned a 50-year-old constitutional right. Yes, voters are still angry about it. Yes, they see through the Republican misinformation. Yes, abortion rights are popular and always have been. And voters overwhelmingly demonstrated that on Tuesday.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Amy, I'm wondering if you could talk about the Pennsylvania Supreme Court election, which has also garnered a quite amount of attention. Can you talk about the candidates there and their backgrounds?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : Yeah. So, I mean, state supreme courts are hugely important, Juan, of course, for a whole array of rights, including voting rights. And we saw the issue of mail-in ballots being a crucial issue in Pennsylvania in the last election, of course. So, we saw a Democrat defeating the Republican candidate, Carolyn Carluccio, who had been among the Republicans who, since the Dobbs decision, have run as fast as they can away from the issue of abortion. She had a résumé that referred to herself as a defender of life at all stages, and she scrubbed that from her website in the lead-up to this election. And so, again, I think we see another spot on the map where abortion rights was a decisive factor in buoying Democrats to victory in a race that is increasingly crucial, not just for abortion rights, but a whole array of progressive priorities across the board.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, I'd like to bring in John Nichols, The Nation 's national affairs correspondent. John, what's your takeaway from this, the election results and the large number of, quote, \"Democratic victories\"?\n\nJOHN NICHOLS : Well, I think it is a lot of Democratic victories. In fact, this is one of the best nights for Democrats in an off-year election that we've seen in a very, very long time. It's not just the top-end results, for governor of Kentucky, for the Virginia Legislature and things like that, but it's when you burrow down into the results, and you go to mayoral races, city council races, school board races, county executive races across the country. It was just a remarkably strong night for Democrats.\n\nAnd what it suggests is that there's something more going on in our politics than the polls and the punditry. And this is a big deal. We tend to be, because of a lot of the collapse of local media around the country, very reliant on national media outlets, that get a poll and then talk about it for a week or have a group of pundits on. And we lose sight of these elections around the country, which are not polls, but are actually people voting.\n\nAnd so, let me just remind you of a couple of things that had happened last night. In addition to Andy Beshear winning in Kentucky as a supporter of abortion rights and someone who vetoed an anti-trans bill, someone also who marched on the UAW picket line - and Andy Beshear is not a leftist, by any means; he's considered to be something of a moderate - but he won in Kentucky on a lot of issues that are considered to be kind of hot-button issues of the moment. In Virginia, you saw not just a Democratic win for the Legislature, but a rebuke to Governor Glenn Youngkin, who tried to make the race there a referendum on abortion rights and a host of other issues, trying to advance a right-wing agenda. In New Jersey, it looks like Democrats picked up seats in the state Legislature. You had the Pennsylvania result you just mentioned. You obviously had the Ohio result you just mentioned. But then, when you start to look at places like Allegheny County in Pennsylvania, where Sara Innamorato was elected as county executive to one of the largest counties in the United States, as a progressive, you just start seeing result after result after result.\n\nAnd I think the message here comes off something that Amy said. You saw folks compromising on some issues or making concessions on some issues, because they were afraid that if they didn't, they couldn't prevail. In reality, the evidence from Tuesday night is that candidates who took some chances, who pushed the limits, who actually went further than expected, did very, very well.\n\nAnd if I can add one final note, at a point where we are seeing so much evidence of Islamophobia in this country, in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, suburban Minneapolis, Nadia Mohamed was elected as the first Muslim mayor, Somali immigrant elected to the mayoralty there. And this is a real breakthrough victory, one of many for immigrants around the country and for Muslim candidates around the country. And so, I think it's important to recognize that when you go into these results, you see this as a much more progressive country than I think a lot of the pundits would tell you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, John Nichols, this whole issue of Youngkin, who was putting forth a - what was being called a moderate 15-week ban on abortion, and being seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate, now being thwarted by the legislative victory for Democrats in both houses, this all coming at a time when Biden - and we don't really talk about polls on Democracy Now! As you say, we consider the poll Election Day. But the polls are showing him at an all-time low. The overturning of Roe v. Wade , it's horrifying to think, might have been quite a gift to Biden, considering how abortion was a theme throughout the country, even when it didn't even seem to be. I mean, in Mississippi, you have Reeves winning again, the governor, but he was up against a Democratic challenger, Elvis Presley's second-cousin, Brendan Presley, who was anti-choice.\n\nJOHN NICHOLS : That's right. No, look, you're exactly right here. And let's start with that Youngkin result. Glenn Youngkin went all in on this election. He was the face of the Republicans in this race. And he was also someone that, if we follow presidential politics closely, you realize that a lot of very, very wealthy Republicans were kind of looking at him as a possible last-minute entry into the 2024 presidential race, somebody with backing from, really, the billionaire class. Youngkin was dealt a horrible setback. He is now in a position where the talk of bringing him into the presidential race, I think, is going to die very, very quickly.\n\nAnd so, what you see is that, yes, the abortion rights issue is resonant. So, too, are a number of other issues, including labor rights. And it's notable that a lot of these candidates who won in races around the country were candidates who had stood up for the UAW in its strike, who had stood up for working people in a lot of situations. And again and again and again, what you see is there's evidence that Democrats, when they compromise, when they make concessions, they do worse than they might have done if they had run boldly.\n\nAnd as regards the polling on Joe Biden, I'll offer you just one thought here. A year out from an election when you have an incumbent president, you're often going to see polls that show them running poorly. And then, of course, the pundit class is going to get obsessed with that. They're going to talk about nothing else. But we just had a remarkable intervention here. And that is an election, a relatively nationalized election, where you could ask the question, OK, given the choice, a clear choice on abortion rights, a clear choice on progressive issues versus going to the right, a clear choice on labor rights, a clear choice on a whole host of other issues - given that choice across country, in election after election after election, people voted for abortion rights. They voted for labor rights. They voted for progressive values and for Democrats, who often don't get this right. This is a very, very powerful reminder that there's a route forward. But it isn't a route of concession. It's a route of activism and engagement with communities that are rising up and saying they want a different direction, more progressive direction, for this country.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Amy, I'd like to get your sense of how the outcome of Tuesday's elections set the stage for 2024, and especially for the future of abortion rights. What's your sense?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : I mean, Juan, I think, crucially, as John pointed out, we saw the failure of the two signature Republican strategies that they were banking on for 2024. The first was this idea of a 15-week \"limit,\" of a \"compromise\" on abortion, right? And Glenn Youngkin was the face of this. He worked closely with Susan B. Anthony List. We've talked about this on the show before, how in the wake of the Dobbs decision, the anti-abortion movement tried to rebrand itself. Bans were not going to be bans anymore; they were going to be limits and compromises. And 15 weeks was supposed to be this, you know, compromise, as if voters were going to forget it was a 15-week ban in Mississippi that got us to the Dobbs decision in the first place and that Mississippi is now living under a total abortion ban and has been for about a year and a half. So, I think we can, you know, chalk the surprising success of the Democratic gubernatorial candidate there partly up to that reality. They haven't forgotten about Dobbs . But we saw this strategy of the 15-week compromise fall on its face in Virginia, because voters saw right through that. They understood that an abortion ban is a ban. And this was a crucial part of their Republican strategy to rebrand themselves after the Dobbs decision. I think they're going to want to abort that strategy, Juan. I don't see that happening in the next 15 weeks, so, unfortunately, I think they're going to have to carry it to term, or at least until the next election in 2024.\n\nThe other signature Republican strategy we saw fall on its face, as John pointed out, was in Kentucky, where somewhere on the order of $6 million was spent by right-wing groups attacking Andy Beshear for vetoing a bill that would have banned gender-affirming care for minors. This anti-trans fearmongering, again, did not work. Chef's kiss, no notes. I love that that $6 million might as well have been flushed down the toilet for all that it resonated with Kentucky voters in this deep red state, or what is known as a deep red state. And so, I think Republicans are in serious trouble.\n\nAnd on the flip side of that, I want to say, I don't think Democrats can just lay back and count on abortion rights to save their butts in 2024. We know that Joe Biden is tanking among Arab American voters right now. We know that he's struggling in swing states from The New York Times poll. And, you know, this is a position that abortion rights supporters are not necessarily used to. We're used to abortion being a third rail in American politics and Democrats not taking the issue seriously. All of a sudden, it's looking like Democrats need the abortion rights movement more than the movement needs them. And it's not lost on me that while these results were coming in and it was becoming clear that abortion had lifted the boats of Democrats across all of the states, you know, from Virginia to Kentucky to Ohio and beyond, we saw 22 Democrats in Congress siding with Republicans to censure Rashida Tlaib, who, by the way, is one of the staunchest supporters of reproductive justice that we have in Congress, in addition to being the only Palestinian American. And so, I think supporters of abortion rights really need to ask themselves: What are you going to do with this power that you now have? And are you going to compromise, or are you going to push the envelope and go big and push Democrats who now need this issue in order to win?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Amy Littlefield, I want to thank you for being with us, abortion access correspondent for The Nation , John Nichols, The Nation 's national affairs correspondent. A perfect segue into our next segment. We'll be playing the full speech of Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American member of Congress, just before she was censured by the U.S. House of Representatives.

Chris Melody Fields Figueredo of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center says the initiatives like abortion could surprise some people, and says the recent Kansas vote to protect abortion shows reproductive health can transcend party lines. Fields Figueredo also explains how slavery is still enshrined in some state constitutions as a form of punishment, which she says has \"led to mass incarceration of Black and Brown communities.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman. Tune in Tuesday, November 8th, for our three-hour election night special . We'll be broadcasting live starting at 9 p.m. Eastern. Visit democracynow.org for details and to watch.\n\nVoters in five states will be deciding abortion-related ballot initiatives Tuesday. In Kentucky, voters are being asked to amend the state's Constitution to declare that there is no constitutional right to abortion in the state. Reproductive rights activists are urging voters to vote no on Amendment 2. Meanwhile, in Michigan, voters will decide on a proposed amendment to add the right to reproductive freedom to the state's Constitution. Voters in Vermont and California will also be asked to enshrine abortion rights in their state constitutions.\n\nTo talk more about these ballot initiatives and more, we're joined by Chris Melody Fields Figueredo. She is the executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nChris, thanks for joining us. Let's start with abortion. Then we'll move on to voting rights, gun control, etc. What's happening with abortion, and where are these ballot initiatives being voted on?\n\nCHRIS MELODY FIELDS FIGUEREDO : Well, thank you so much for having me on the show, Amy.\n\nYes, abortion is absolutely on the ballot. You already mentioned Michigan. Reproductive Freedom for All, Proposal 3, would enshrine the right to an abortion in the state Constitution. But it also looks at pre- and postnatal care, the right to contraceptives. We also have Vermont, that is affirmatively protecting guaranteeing the right to an abortion in its state Constitution, and California, as well. And then, as you mentioned, in Kentucky, there's a proposal similar to what we saw in Kansas that would ban abortion. And then, in Montana, we have a proposal that would further criminalize and stigmatize abortion, as well. So, abortion is on the ballot.\n\nAnd I think one of the really important things to remember going into tomorrow is what happened in Kansas, right? We can't make assumptions just because a state is more traditionally conservative, right? Kansas really bucked that theory, right? That not only did that ballot measure overwhelmingly reject an abortion ban, it really transcended party lines, and it was a higher vote-getter than the Democratic and Republican gubernatorial candidates.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the recreational marijuana ballots around the country, the ballot initiatives?\n\nCHRIS MELODY FIELDS FIGUEREDO : Well, for years we've been seeing through the ballot initiative process, first with the decriminalizing or making medical marijuana legal, and now we're seeing a number of states. In this election, we have Arkansas, Maryland, the Dakotas, both Dakotas, and Missouri, that are looking at recreational marijuana. More than half the country now, through the initiative process, has approved some form of either medical or recreational marijuana. And that's before voters in five states on Tuesday.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What about ranked-choice voting and other voting-related -\n\nCHRIS MELODY FIELDS FIGUEREDO : Yeah, so, honestly, one of the biggest -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - ballot initiatives?\n\nCHRIS MELODY FIELDS FIGUEREDO : Yeah, one of the biggest trends that we are seeing this year is democracy itself on the ballot. States like Nevada are looking at ranked-choice voting. Several municipalities, cities across the country are looking at ranked-choice voting. Michigan again is looking at Promote the Vote, which would allow for nine days of early voting, ensure that military and overseas voters have - that ballots are counted, guaranteeing audits. And Connecticut is also looking at early voting, as well. And then we also have direct -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let me -\n\nCHRIS MELODY FIELDS FIGUEREDO : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let me just ask something on ranked-choice voting, since I think a number of people do not understand what it is. For example, it's one of the reasons, I think, that Sarah Palin lost in Alaska, because Alaska has ranked-choice voting. Explain how it works.\n\nCHRIS MELODY FIELDS FIGUEREDO : Yeah. So, ranked-choice voting is - you know, goes away from what we traditionally know, right? Fifty plus one percent of the vote. You vote for one person, and that's it. With ranked-choice voting, voters have more choices, right? So, you literally will rank your top candidate, your second candidate, third candidate and so on. After those votes are counted, then it looks at the second candidate - right? - of who got the most votes. So, it's a system that looks a lot more about the majority of the people and who is popular for them, and that person will win the election.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And let me ask you about slavery on the ballot in five states. Explain, Chris.\n\nCHRIS MELODY FIELDS FIGUEREDO : Yeah. Well, it's 2022, and, yes, slavery is still in state constitutions and the U.S. Constitution with the exception of slavery as a form of punishment. That is on the ballot in Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, Oregon and Vermont. And why this issue is so important is this exception, if everyone remembers Ava DuVernay's amazing documentary on 13th - right? - it has led to mass incarceration of Black and Brown communities. It's led to overcriminalization of these communities. And it has also had a huge impact on the prison labor population and whether folks who are working in prison, whether they have the ability to get paid.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And finally, other examples that you think are key that transcend party lines across this country?\n\nCHRIS MELODY FIELDS FIGUEREDO : Yeah, I mean, one of the biggest issues for now, since 2016, that has been really popular, is raising the minimum wage. That has transcended party lines. It's on the ballot in Nevada, raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour, in Nevada raising it to $12 per hour. In D.C., where I live, we have the opportunity again to remove the subminimum wage for tip workers, right? Other issues like in-state tuition for undocumented students is on the ballot in Arizona. Gun safety is on the ballot in Oregon.\n\nSo many of these issues that we know in our communities are incredibly important are on the ballot this year, and they often - they transcend party lines, right? It's something that we've been seeing for the last several years, and why we believe that now there's a direct attack on direct democracy itself to limit the will of the people and our ability to bring these issues before our communities and vote for them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, we want to thank you for being with us, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. And again, tomorrow night on Democracy Now! , we'll be looking at how these ballots have fared all over the country in our election night special starting at 9 p.m. Eastern. You can check out all the information at democracynow.org.\n\nNext up, we look at why civil rights groups are urging advertisers to boycott Twitter, after the world's richest man, Elon Musk, bought Twitter and then, on Friday, fired half the staff, close to 4,000 people.

The election method allows voters to select multiple candidates in descending order of preference. It is used in many other countries, and supporters say it can reduce polarization and give more voice to independent voters. \"The forces for ranked-choice voting are people who really care about our democracy,\" says George Cheung, director of More Equitable Democracy, who says ranked-choice voting \"allows for truer representation of who we are as a community.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe look now at how voters chose to expand the use of the election method known as ranked-choice voting during Tuesday's midterm elections. Ranked-choice voting was on the ballot in the entire state of Nevada and many cities. It also shaped the outcome of races where it's already in place. Supporters say it could reduce polarization in politics, give more voice to independent voters, among other things.\n\nIn Nevada, the \"yes\" vote leads for a ballot measure that would change the state's elections to a system of a nonpartisan primary that allows voters to choose candidates from any party. After the primary, ranked-choice general elections would let voters rank their top five candidates who advanced.\n\nMeanwhile, in Maine's largest city of Portland, and in Evanston, Illinois, voters backed measures to use ranked-choice voting in city elections.\n\nIn Alaska, the state's ranked-choice voting system will decide which candidate will represent the state in Congress, after the Senate race remained undecided when none of the candidates received half the vote. Voters in Alaska approved the new system in 2020. The 2022 August special election was the first time they were used in the state. In that election, Democrat Mary Peltola beat former governor and 2008 Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin to fill an open U.S. congressional seat. Peltola campaigned on reproductive rights and made history as the first Alaska Native in Congress.\n\nFor more, we're joined by George Cheung, director of More Equitable Democracy, who's been following all of this very closely.\n\nWe welcome you to Democracy Now! George, you've said ranked-choice voting is a \"necessary step in the unsexy but critical work of crash-proofing our democracy.\" Can you explain what you mean? Assume people haven't even heard of ranked-choice voting, though it's happening all over the country.\n\nGEORGE CHEUNG : Yes. First, I want to say thank you, Amy, for having me. I'm really excited to be here.\n\nCurrently, we in the United States use a system for our elections called winner take all with a plurality rules, meaning that candidates, whoever has the most votes on Election Day wins that election, which means that a plurality could win, and a majority could, in fact, vote for a different candidate.\n\nSo, ranked-choice voting is a - both a ballot style and a tabulation method in which voters get to rank their choices, let's say, one through five, or potentially as many candidates as there are on the ballot. And then, once you start tallying them, you look at if someone receives a majority of votes, and if someone does, then the election is over. If there isn't, then usually the last-place candidate gets eliminated, and those votes get retabulated or reallocated to those voters' second choices. And that process continues to repeat itself.\n\nAnd so, in terms of, like, the actual reform itself, the best version of ranked-choice voting is when you don't actually have a primary, when you have lots of choices in the general election for voters to choose on, with high turnout, and therefore, you get the most voice for those voters.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Explain what happened in Alaska, so people can really understand how this played out.\n\nGEORGE CHEUNG : So, in Alaska, which recently approved ranked-choice voting, it's a top four system. So, in the primary, you would choose a candidate, and then, based on the results of the primary, four candidates go to the general election. And so, you had three fairly high-profile candidates with lots of name recognition, and candidates - I'm sorry, voters would just rank their choices.\n\nThere was a lot of enthusiasm for Mary Peltola, a Native Alaskan, who ended up getting the most number of votes, but looks like she didn't get the majority. However, voters, because there is ranked-choice voting in Alaska, were allowed to rank their choices. And since it seems like it may play out very similarly to the special election, the bottom vote-getter will get eliminated, and those votes will get reallocated to other candidates. And because - I believe that Representative Peltola, since she is currently in office now, campaigned in a way that really engaged voters deeply, and said, you know, \"If you don't want to vote for me for your first choice, vote for me for your second choice.\" So, that's also a big benefit of ranked-choice voting, because it forces candidates to really continue to engage all voters, as opposed to saying, \"Well, if you're not going to vote for me, I'm just going to move on to the next voter.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about Portland, Maine, and Evanston, Illinois.\n\nGEORGE CHEUNG : So, one really important thing to know is that there are different versions of ranked-choice voting. And at the core, we really need to understand that we use a system called winner take all. This is a really old system that dates back into the 1400s. And so, beginning in about the 1800s, there were movements towards big reforms as the franchise began to expand to people who didn't have wealth, to women, to people of color. And many countries and American cities ended up doing a lot of reforms in the late 1800s, early 1900s. And so, that really stopped by the time of World War II and the Red Scare, because a lot of people of color and progressives started to get elected.\n\nWhat's really exciting in Portland, Oregon, is the story of communities of color, led by the Coalition of Communities of Color in Portland, Oregon. There was a lot of frustration about the city government, because it was elected all at-large, meaning that you had to run, essentially, a congressional race in order to win. And there was a really meaningful charter review process that was run by the city where communities of color had a leadership role in educating themselves about the implications of electoral change, really engaged deeply to deliberate about what reforms they wanted to see, and actually came out with a recommendation. Seventeen out of the 20 commissioners agreed to put a form of ranked-choice voting on the ballot, a form known as proportional representation. That went to the ballot.\n\nAnd on election night, the results show that the charter reform was winning by about 10 points, 55 to 45. The form of the reform would essentially create four multimember districts with ranked-choice voting, meaning that each district, you only need 25% of the vote share to win one of those seats. This really will open doors for communities of color, for low-income people, for renters to be fully represented in that legislative body. And just in terms of historical context, this form of ranked-choice voting hasn't been enacted since New York City did in the mid-1930s.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And talk about what happened in Seattle, Washington.\n\nGEORGE CHEUNG : Seattle, Washington had ranked-choice voting, as well as approval voting, on the ballot. This was being promoted by some -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And again, explain the difference between ranked-choice voting and approval voting.\n\nGEORGE CHEUNG : Oh, right. Ranked-choice voting as I've already explained. Approval voting is a different system in which you essentially get to give like a Facebook like or a thumbs up to candidates, as many candidates as you want.\n\nAnd so, there was an interesting head-to-head. Approval voting supporters gathered enough signatures to put it on the ballot. And the City Council, given that there wasn't a deep deliberative process, that they had, let's say, in Portland, decided that it was important for voters to have a choice, and put ranked-choice voting side by side with approval voting. So there were two questions: Shall there be change in terms of the system of elections? And if there is a change, which should it be? Approval or ranked-choice voting?\n\nThe first question, in terms of should there be a change, is still on the bubble. It's about 50-50. And we won't know for a couple of weeks in terms of the outcome of that election. But in terms of the choice between approval voting, which many, including myself, believe that it is potentially - could dilute the voting rights of communities of color, versus ranked-choice voting, which has shown to really allow for more voice for communities of color, voters supported ranked-choice voting by a margin of three to one. So, we're really excited that ranked-choice voting, particularly proportional ranked-choice voting, is really gaining steam in this country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : George Cheung, if you can talk about - well, you now have ranked-choice voting in two state elections - right? - in Alaska and Maine, and 10 cities. Who are the forces for ranked-choice voting, and who is fighting against it?\n\nGEORGE CHEUNG : I would say the forces for ranked-choice voting are people who really care about democracy. We know that our democracy is really in danger. It's really fragile. And so, people from all walks of life are really coming out of the woodwork to really think deeply about what's at stake, and really starting to have conversations, beginning at the local level, about how we can really strengthen democracy so that we all have choices that really reflect who we are.\n\nWho's really opposed to it are, frankly, the powers that be. The current system of winner take all, with plurality elections, really favors particularly fringe elements on the right, in particular, who have been able to really dominate the redistricting process, to draw districts that really favor incumbents and their own party, and really are really nervous about any change.\n\nI think what's really important to know is that ranked-choice voting and proportional representation doesn't favor any particular party, but essentially is a system that allows for a truer representation of who we are as a community.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Do you see any chance of a presidential election being ranked-choice voting?\n\nGEORGE CHEUNG : Well, I would say that I think about winner-take-all elections as an old car that your grandma gave to you when you were in high school. Sure, you can change the ignition and rotate the tires, but in the end, it's an old car. And ultimately, you have to buy a new car or find another different way to work. We will continue -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, you're comparing ranked-choice voting to an electric car?\n\nGEORGE CHEUNG : I would say that, you know, we have been using a system that has been in place since the 1400s, with very, very little change. And so, as we have become more of a multiracial society, we need to have rules that reflect that. And frankly speaking, winner-take-all elections with plurality rules are just at odds with achieving a multiracial democracy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : George Cheung, I want to thank you for being with us, director of More Equitable Democracy.\n\nNext up, \"Carbon Billionaires.\" Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Then, many tried to use the pandemic as a pretext for banning abortion as a nonessential service. \"Texas, in the early weeks of the pandemic, sort of gave us a dress rehearsal for what it could look like when states try to ban abortion entirely,\" says Littlefield. \"We saw how half a century worth of attempts to whittle away at abortion access really collided with a deadly pandemic in a way that was just devastating.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe end today's show looking at how people have struggled to access abortion during the pandemic and how states have tried to use COVID to ban abortion as a nonessential service. Reporter Amy Littlefield writes in The Nation that many saw the pandemic as a, quote, \"dry run for the overturn of Roe v. Wade , the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized abortion and is now in greater peril than ever after the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett,\" unquote.\n\nMeanwhile, the pandemic has increased the demand for abortion funds and also for telemedicine abortion, which combines medication abortion, which uses pills to end a pregnancy, and telemedicine, which allows health providers to supervise the procedure remotely.\n\nFor more, we are joined by investigative reporter Amy Littlefield, whose new piece in The Nation magazine is headlined \"As the Pandemic Raged, Abortion Access Nearly Flickered Out.\"\n\nAmy, welcome back to Democracy Now! Talk about Texas and what happened there during this pandemic and also just in the last weeks.\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : Texas, in the early weeks of the pandemic, sort of gave us a dress rehearsal for what it could look like when states try to ban abortion entirely, which I think many expect to happen when the Supreme Court, with its new Trump-appointed anti-choice majority, overturns or overhauls Roe v. Wade .\n\nWhat happened in Texas is that when the pandemic struck, state officials used that as a pretext to ban abortion as a nonessential service under the guise of preserving PPE . And this was immediately challenged in the courts. And as the legal battle went back and forth over a period of a month, access to abortion in the state switched on and off eight times. And the abortion provider I spoke with, who was on the frontlines of this at Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas, described a traumatizing situation, where abortion clinic staff became, in her words, \"agents of the state's cruelty,\" repeatedly having to call patients, cancel their abortion appointments and tell them they didn't know when they could reschedule. At times, patients would be sitting in the waiting room about to have their abortion, and the staff would have to come out and say, \"I'm sorry, we just got word that this ban is back in place. We're not going to be able to see you.\"\n\nAnd there was a massive migration of patients, in the midst of this deadly pandemic, who were forced to travel, almost a thousand patients in the month of April alone who sought care in other states. And if you think about that, you know, every time they had to stop at a rest area, every unnecessary encounter with medical staff along the way, that all was a potential infection risk. And so, we saw how half a century worth of attempts to whittle away at abortion access really collided with a deadly pandemic in a way that was just devastating.\n\nAnd, you know, I was really inspired by some of the feats of heroism, frankly, that abortion funds, which are groups that exist to try to raise money for people to pay for abortions they couldn't otherwise afford, they moved mountains in order to get people to care. I mean, we're talking about people driving strangers for hours, flying with them on airplanes. We're talking about, you know, not just in Texas, but nationwide, people getting into cars with strangers and driving them through the South Dakota cornfields and through the Florida Everglades to get to their appointments. That's how hard these funds worked.\n\nAnd yet it still wasn't enough. And advocates in Texas told me they know that there are patients who were not able to get the care that they needed and who stayed pregnant against their will.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Amy, what do you think the new Biden administration should do to improve access to abortion, especially in light of the even more conservative Supreme Court that exists today?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : Yeah, that's a great question. I think there's some low-hanging fruit that Biden has already indicated he's going to move on in terms of repealing the Trump administration's devastating policies undermining abortion access. But there are two ways that President Biden could go further than his Democratic predecessors. And I think, in this moment of crisis, that sort of action is demanded.\n\nAnd reproductive justice groups are watching very closely to see if Biden will, number one, repeal the long-standing restrictions on medication abortion access that are widely interpreted to require patients to go in person to a health center to get a pill, which is the first step in a medication abortion, and then they can take the rest of the medication home with them. Those long-standing federal requirements were put on hold temporarily, and they're now back in place, thanks to the Supreme Court, during the pandemic. Biden and his Food and Drug Administration could suspend those rules and overhaul them so that medication abortion can be picked up at a pharmacy or sent to patients from online pharmacies by mail, just like any other drug with that kind of safety record.\n\nThe other really important policy, and where reproductive justice groups are watching closely to see if Biden will deliver on his promises, is the Hyde Amendment. This is a 45-year-old ban on federal funding for abortion. And when we talk about the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on people of color and Native people in this country, the Hyde Amendment, more than any other policy, has really shifted the burden of abortion access onto communities of color and low-income people. It prevents Medicaid recipients in most states from having their insurance cover their abortion. And it's really served as a de facto ban on abortion access. And so, if Biden starts to put pressure on Congress to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which he indicated he would on the campaign trail, that would have a revolutionary impact on access in this country.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Amy, you also found some examples where the pandemic actually eased access to abortion. Could you talk about that, as well?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : Right. So, when the federal court, in July, put a hold on these restrictions on mifepristone, the first drug used in medication abortion, we saw digital abortion clinics spring up that were offering telehealth visits and sending abortions by mail. We saw the expansion of existing avenues for accessing those options, because there was such a demand for it. We saw online pharmacies start to ship medication abortion kits.\n\nBut these options are only available to patients in states that will allow it. And there are 18 states that have active bans on telemedicine abortion. Ohio, actually, during the pandemic, decided to further restrict abortion access by requiring - by banning telemedicine abortion, you know, in the midst of a time where visiting a medical center could be like a risk to many people. So, we're really going to potentially see a deeper divide in terms of who's able to access abortion, depending on where you live and whether you have the money to get out of the place where you live.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Amy, I wanted to ask you about culture and reproductive rights. Last year, as multiple states moved to further restrict access to abortions during the pandemic, we reported on a powerful new dramatic film called Never Rarely Sometimes Always . It follows a 17-year-old girl as she travels from her small town in Pennsylvania to New York to get an abortion without having to notify her parents. The film is seen as a possible Oscar contender, but at least one Academy Award voter who opposes abortion said he won't be watching the film. Variety magazine reports that filmmaker Kieth Merrill was asked by an awards publicist if he had seen the film. He replied, \"I received the screener but as a Christian, the father of 8 children and 39 grandchildren. AND pro-life advocate, I have ZERO interest in watching a woman cross state lines so someone can murder her unborn child,\" unquote. Well, on Friday, the film's director, Eliza Hittman, posted Merrill's comment on Instagram and condemned the Oscars' voting body, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for being, quote, \"still so painfully monopolized by an old white puritanical male guard.\" She said, \"I wonder how many other voters out there won't watch the film. #oscarssopuritanical.\" Can you end by responding to this?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : You know, what really grabs me about that quote, Amy, is the part where the anti-choice man invokes his children and grandchildren. You know, since we last spoke, I've become a parent myself. And nothing has made me more convinced of how high the stakes are in this debate than becoming a parent. It has been the most joyful experience of my life. I love my kid. And I got to choose when to have him - maybe not the pandemic part, but the rest of it. And I would not wish this experience on anyone who has not fully opted in. It is glorious work, it is wonderful work, but it is hard work. And we have to stop seeing having children and having families as antithetical to having abortions, because we're talking about the same people at different moments in their lives, and nobody should be forced to do this against their will.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Amy, you're giving us all a chance to kvell, because we got to show a picture of little Tully. Congratulations on your baby living through the first year of this pandemic! People can go to our last interview with you, where you talked about what it was like to give birth in the face of what happened last year. And congratulations!

I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nYes, today is Election Day. All eyes are on the battle between President Trump and Joe Biden as people are heading to the polls across the country, but not for the first time. This is the final day of voting. In fact, over 100 million people, three-quarters of the total vote of 2016, have already voted. But down-ballot races and state ballot measures are also having major consequences for racial justice, immigration, ranked-choice voting, reproductive rights.\n\nFor more, we go to Washington, D.C., where we're joined by Ronald Newman, the national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nRonald, welcome to Democracy Now! It's great to have you with us. So many issues are on the ballot across the country, maybe not as much as in the past, because of the pandemic and what it takes to get a ballot initiative on the ballot. But if you can talk about the significance of these and start off with the issue of racial justice, what you're following?\n\nRONALD NEWMAN : Absolutely. And thank you, Amy, thank you, Juan, for having me this morning.\n\nWe say all the time that civil rights and civil liberties are determined up and down the ballot. And while there will inevitably be outsized attention on the presidential race, on Joe Biden, on Donald Trump, the issues and policies that affect people day in and day out are often determined at the bottom of the ballot, sometimes on the back of the ballot. And so, we, as an institution, are very much engaged in those races, in those ballot measures.\n\nFor instance, 805, a ballot measure in Oklahoma, will determine whether thousands of people, including lots of people of color, will be set free. Oklahoma has had among the highest incarceration rates in the nation for years, and this ballot measure will go a long way towards pulling back on extreme sentencing.\n\nIn addition, if you think about Prop 16 out in California, we are trying to restore affirmative action in the contexts of education, hiring and public contracting, and so minority-led businesses and women-led businesses have a real opportunity to make progress and to move forward.\n\nAnd so, those issues come up all the time, not only in ballot measures, but also in down-ballot candidate races, the district attorney races, the sheriff races. These are the elections that have a real tangible effect on the lived experiences of people across the country.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ron, could you talk about Nebraska and \"Vote for 428,\" why that is an issue of racial justice, as well?\n\nRONALD NEWMAN : Absolutely. So, in Nebraska, we will hopefully be able to celebrate a victory this evening and put an end to predatory payday lending. Sadly, payday loans have been issued in Nebraska for years. And the interest rates on these loans average upwards of 400%. And so, our ballot measure would end that and would put a cap on the APR associated with loans at 36%.\n\nAnd why does this matter? It matters because when you look at the numbers, you find that these types of predatory, abusive loans are disproportionately issued to people of color. And so, every year, as Pew Research has reported, $28 million in fines and fees are pulled out of the pockets of Nebraskans - and not Nebraskans overall, because most Nebraskans don't use payday loans, but we're talking about the most vulnerable Nebraskans, including, disproportionately, people of color. And these payday lending shops set themselves up in communities of color at outsized rates, even when you adjust for income. And so, as a matter of racial justice, we are fighting hard to end these abusive, predatory loans.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And you've also put the spotlight on several county sheriff races in the South as, again, helping to end policies that especially target undocumented or immigrant workers, in places like Charleston and in several counties in Georgia. Could you talk about those?\n\nRONALD NEWMAN : Yeah. So, this work started a few years back. You know, one of the elements of the Trump administration's anti-immigrant agenda has been pulling local police and local sheriff's deputies into their work. They've effectively been deputizing local police officers, who are supposed to be protecting and serving their communities. They've deputized those police officers to be immigration agents, often in cases where the populations in these towns, in these cities, in these counties don't know about it and would not approve of it.\n\nAnd so, back in 2018, we engaged in a handful of sheriff's races in North Carolina, and the voters resoundingly chose challengers to the incumbents who ended those agreements with the federal government, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And we are again engaged in those battles this year.\n\nAnd so, three to watch, in particular, are Cobb County, Georgia; Gwinnett County, Georgia; and Charleston, South Carolina. In each and every one of those cases, there is a challenger to the incumbent who has pledged explicitly, who has committed explicitly to end those agreements on day one, so people within those communities can live in peace and security, knowing that the police officers, who are supposed to be protecting and serving them, are not, in effect, working as immigration agents trying to tear families apart.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I also wanted to ask you about ranked-choice voting. Massachusetts and Alaska both have ballot initiatives about adopting ranked-choice voting. This would allow voters to rank candidates in order of preference rather than casting a vote for a single candidate. The state of Maine has made history this year by becoming the first state to use ranked-choice voting in a national election, and it could decide who wins the Senate race. The Republican Senator Susan Collins is in a tight race with Democrat Sara Gideon. The Green Party candidate, Lisa Savage, is polling third. Under ranked-choice voting, supporters of the Green candidate could pick the Democrat as their second option, giving the Democrat a potential boost in the second round of vote counting. So, if you could talk about the significance of that, and then these two states, Montana and Alaska, what they're doing?\n\nRONALD NEWMAN : Yeah. So, ranked-choice voting has been an issue that we've tracked for a few years. The voters in Maine passed a ballot measure back in 2016 that established ranked-choice voting within that state. And then we've spent the past few years fighting back and forth over whether those new rules would take effect. The ACLU itself was very engaged in 2018 when Republicans in the state sought to pull back or repeal that new voting regime.\n\nBut ranked-choice voting holds a significant degree of promise for making our democracy work better. At the heart of that reform is trying to ensure that election results reflect the will of the voters. Maine has struggled through several elections in which the winner of key races secured less than 50% of the vote - in many cases, less than 40% of the vote - in circumstances where it was clear that most people preferred not to have that person take elected office. And so, ranked-choice voting helps to protect against that.\n\nIn addition, it helps to protect against what you might call the spoiler effect. I think we've all been part of conversations where people have worried about that third-party candidate, that Green Party candidate, siphoning votes away from another candidate. Through ranked-choice voting, you can protect against that occurrence, because the second-choice votes end up getting reallocated if no candidate gets over 50% of the vote.\n\nThe last and final piece that advocates have talked about quite a bit in the context of ranked-choice voting is the effect it might have on electoral discourse. If you're engaged in an election in which the second-choice votes really matter, you might be less inclined to engage in negative campaigning and to make negative attacks against your competitors, because their voters are also important to you.\n\nSo, that range of benefits is what the state of Maine is after. And as you noted, it could have a significant effect in the Senate race. And other states, like Massachusetts and Alaska, are also considering taking that step and following states like California and Minnesota that have adopted ranked-choice voting in various places over the years.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, we want to thank you, Ron Newman, for joining us. Ronald Newman is the national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union. And we will be following all these ballot initiatives in our show, our special election show tonight beginning at 9:00 Eastern time, and also in the coming days as this information comes out, as well as, of course, just doing our full election special tonight at 9:00 Eastern time.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

We're joined by historian and writer Mike Davis, who says in Jacobin that \"Reopening the Economy Will Send Us to Hell.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : All 50 states will at least be partially reopened this Memorial Day weekend, as the U.S. death toll from the COVID -19 outbreak will top 100,000 and some states prepare for a surge in cases.\n\nWe're joined now by a guest who says, \"Reopening the Economy Will Send Us to Hell.\" Mike Davis is writer, historian, author of a number of books, including Planet of Slums , City of Quartz and The Monster at Our Door: The Global Threat of Avian Flu . His new book is Set the Night on Fire: L.A. in the Sixties . He's joining us from San Diego.\n\nThanks so much for being with us and staying all night up to do this interview, Mike. Why don't you start off with that very provocative headline of your piece , \"Reopening the Economy Will Send Us [All] to Hell.\" Why?\n\nMIKE DAVIS : I didn't choose the headline. But let me put it this way. I think a lot of listeners will remember the novel by William Styron called Sophie's Choice . The movie version, Meryl Streep won the Academy Award for it. But in the story, a young mother, Sophie, arrives at Auschwitz with her two small children, and she begs the sadistic Nazi doctor to spare their lives. And he says, \"Well, I'll spare one life, but you have to choose; otherwise, I'll kill them both.\" Americans, tens of millions of Americans, have had to make that choice or will soon make a choice like that.\n\nThe Washington Post poll of several weeks ago, where they polled people who were essential workers and have worked through the duration of the pandemic, and a third of them report that either they have a dangerous preexisting condition, or someone in their household has. So, it is obscene and criminal that this choice, this impossible choice, between income for people who have to meet their mortgages, people who are desperate to put food on their table, and to choose to work and, on the other hand, bring disease home to the people you love, or to yourself. This is, of course, a totally artificial situation.\n\nTrump, of course, refused to use the Defense Production Act to compel the manufacture of protective masks and other gear, which other countries did with great success. Taiwan, for instance, turned over to the military the production of the masks. And in three weeks, they had increased production tenfold. But here, of course, we had to leave it to a mad scramble to try and find private-sector suppliers. Every hospital, every state, every city is competing with each other. But now he's used the Defense Production Act to force food processing workers back into plants, where they work in the cold, long hours, literally shoulder to shoulder, and where the infection rates are almost as high as nursing homes and prisons.\n\nAnd why haven't the Democrats, why haven't we progressives, starting in March, have launched a national campaign about workplace safety and the rejection of this idea that ordinary people have to do a kind of self-triage, them and their families?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And yet, at the same time, you have massive corporations, like Amazon, billionaires in this country, who are making a massive killing now, a massive profit, increasing their wealth by some 15%, the latest report from Institute for Policy Studies, Mike.\n\nMIKE DAVIS : Well, I mean, we thought we lived in one of the most unequal countries in history. But, of course, inequality will be far greater by the beginning of next year and next winter. Ordinary Americans went to bed one night, and they woke up, looked out the door, and it was 1933. And the policies that are being pursued right now, of forcing people back to work, of using the threat of removing unemployment insurance, or of even prosecuting people who don't go back to work because it's unsafe, for unemployment fraud - the fact that in Texas, Iowa, Ohio, in states that put on these sites where employers can anonymously report workers who haven't appeared for work, so that they'll know that their unemployment should be cut off. Public sector, local, state, county governments, who, like the rest of us, actually live in the moment, the -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Mike?\n\nMIKE DAVIS : - evidence - yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We just have a minute in this part of the interview, and then we're continuing with Part 2 . But you have said that global capitalism can no longer guarantee the survival of the human race. Elaborate on that in this last minute.\n\nMIKE DAVIS : OK. In four ways, it's become a threat to human survival. It can't guarantee food security or increase the output of food by the 50% the United Nations says is necessary to feed humanity 20 years from now. It no longer creates jobs or guarantees people income or a meaningful social role. It cannot decarbonize the economy or, at the same time, allow the poor countries, which didn't create the greenhouse gases, to make the great adaptations that are necessary for their survival. And finally, we're the midst of a revolution in biological design: genomics. It cannot translate this biological revolution, the enormous potential that exists now, into public health, either in this country and, of course, even less around the world.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you for being with us. Again, we're going to post immediately today Part 2 of our interview with author and historian Mike Davis. His new book, Set the Night on Fire: L.A. in the Sixties . We will continue with Part 2 of our conversation, talking about socially distanced protests around the country.\n\nA very special Happy Birthday to Mike DiFilippo! That does it for our show. And a deep appreciation for all the team that works around the country, working on this show. I'm Amy Goodman. Thanks so much for joining us.

Student loan debt in the U.S. stands at $1.7 trillion, with some 45 million people owing money.

I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nWe turn now to the student debt crisis, which tops $1.7 trillion in the United States, with some 45 million people owing money. Students, campaigners, as well as top Democrats, have been pushing President Biden to use executive authority to cancel at least $50,000 in student loan debt. Biden was asked Tuesday about his plans to do so at a CNN town hall in Milwaukee.\n\nJOYCELYN FISH : We need student loan forgiveness beyond the potential $10,000 your administration has proposed. We need at least a $50,000 minimum. What will you do to make that happen?\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : I will not make that happen. It depends on whether or not you go to a private university or public university. It depends on the idea that I say to a community, \"I'm going to forgive the debt,\" the billions of dollars in debt, for people who have gone to Harvard and Yale and Penn and schools my children - I went to a great school. I went to a state school. But is that going to be forgiven, rather than use that money to provide for early education for young children who are - come from disadvantaged circumstances?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Democrats hit back, with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer vowing to keep pressing Biden, noting that both Presidents Obama and Trump used executive authority to cancel student debt.\n\nFreshman New York Congressmember Mondaire Jones wrote a piece recently in the New York Daily News detailing his own experience being saddled with student debt after leaving [Harvard Law]. He wrote, quote, \"Canceling $50,000 in student debt is an issue of economic, racial and LGBTQ justice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday Biden would not take any executive action until his Justice Department is installed and reviews the matter, and suggested Congress send Biden a bill to cancel $10,000 in student debt.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Astra Taylor, organizer with the Debt Collective, who wrote the foreword to their new book, Can't Pay, Won't Pay: The Case for Economic Disobedience and Debt Abolition . Astra is also the director of the documentary You Are Not a Loan . That's L-O-A-N. And Braxton Brewington, digital strategist with the Debt Collective, working to end the student loan crisis.\n\nAstra, so this is becoming a major issue right now. Of course, it has been for students who have debt, but right now to the top. Biden is asked about this, and he puts his foot down. Your response?\n\nASTRA TAYLOR : He put his foot down, and he put his foot in his mouth, in the sense that it was a very meandering response. And it was very misleading. In fact, he seemed to be conflating two of his policies.\n\nSo, let's be very clear: Joe Biden ran on two promises: one, to cancel $10,000 of student debt across the board, for everyone, as part of a COVID relief package, acknowledging that we're in a deadly pandemic; in addition, he ran promising undergraduate debt cancellation for people who earn up to $125,000 a year, who attend specific schools, public colleges, HBCUs, historically Black colleges and universities. So, we need to at least hold him to his basic promises.\n\nBut what he did in that rambling response, he invoked straw figures. He invoked false scarcity and nonsolutions. So, for example, you know, saying that we have to choose between investing in early childhood education and justice for student debtors, that's a false choice. These things are not opposed.\n\nWhat I take some encouragement from, and I think your listeners should, as well, is that, you know, his press secretary clarified some of his remarks and said, as you just shared with us, that they are actually looking into the legal possibilities of executive action. So, what I see in this is, actually, in their mixed messaging, that this is very much in play. This is still a fight.\n\nAnd we have to be absolutely clear: President Biden has the authority to cancel all student debt. He was not being forthright when he questioned that in his remarks. He has the authority. It was granted by Congress decades ago. And he can erase all federal student loans. And he should.\n\nDebtors are not asking for debt forgiveness. We're asking for justice, because Joe Biden, let's be clear, he didn't have to graduate with student debt. He talked about his kids and how they had student debt. But his generation was able to go to college and graduate without this enormous burden. So, all people are asking for is parity, to replace this broken system that he played such a crucial role in building.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Astra, your response to those who've suggested that canceling student debt through executive action could lead to legal challenges from student loan companies and other firms involved in debt collection? Is that correct? And these would not be risks if student debt cancellation occurred through Congress.\n\nASTRA TAYLOR : So, the legal experts - and here, I'm relying on Eileen Connor from Harvard Law - are very clear that this authority exists. So, if you are able to lend money, then you're able to not collect it, right? So, if I lend you $10, I don't have to collect it. So, the vast majority of student loans are held by the federal government. This is the government lending. The government has the right to decide not to collect.\n\nNow, sure, there would be some legal challenges. I'm sure there'd be some lawsuits. But what I'm hearing from the real experts in this space is that these are not major concerns. It's like, \"Bring it. Bring it on. Let's fight it out.\" But this is not a reason to be cowardly. And it's certainly not a reason to just rely on Congress, because we all know how broken our political system is.\n\nAnd so, if Biden and his administration have this authority, they have this power - again, it was granted by Congress in the Higher Education Act of 1965; this is not an overreach - then use the power in your possession. And I think we have to be clear that not doing so is a choice.\n\nThere's no limit. Doesn't have to be $10K. Doesn't have to be $50,000, which is actually - the researchers who proposed $50,000, based on thinking about racial justice and other factors, have actually updated their figures in three years from now. The people behind $50,000 are saying $75,000. But he can cancel all federal student loan debt. And we have to be clear: Not doing this is a choice.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : I'd like to bring Braxton Brewington into the conversation. Braxton, can you respond to what Biden said and talk about your own experience as a student and with debt?\n\nBRAXTON BREWINGTON : Absolutely. What [Biden] said is - couldn't be further from the truth. Not only is it a choice, it's a policy assault. The individuals that would benefit the most from student loan debt [cancellation] are individuals like me, Black and Brown borrowers, mostly Black women borrowers, who, frankly, have upwards of $35,000, $50,000, hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of debt, that could benefit from this policy.\n\nAnd President Biden has a unique opportunity to bring together a broad coalition of individuals, who, in otherwise, would be unlikely to come together around a policy. We know that one in five Trump supporters said they would consider supporting Joe Biden in the election if Joe Biden were to cancel student debt. And we just saw an NBC survey the other day saying 40% of Black voters would consider sitting out the next election if Joe Biden did not consider supporting student loan debt [cancellation]. And we also know that nonvoters - a great way to bring nonvoters into the democratic process is to cancel student loan debt.\n\nSo, this is a tool that is widely available to President Biden. And him not using executive action to cancel full student loan debt is a policy assault on people, individuals like me, who, frankly, voted for Joe Biden in hopes of this policy becoming a reality, because we know that not only is this a student loan debt crisis, but there's a pandemic, where people are in perpetual fear of losing their lives. And the last thing folks like me need is to be worried about a debt that the federal government has, frankly, proved, since March and into September, that they don't need our payments in order to create revenue for the government to function.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Braxton, talk about your own experience. Where did you go to college? What kind of debt did you accrue? And what would it mean for it to be forgiven?\n\nBRAXTON BREWINGTON : Yeah, I went to North Carolina A&T State University, which is the largest public HBCU in the country. I graduated with two bachelors, actually, in journalism and political science, like many of my partners. And I accrued, in my name, tens of thousands of dollars' worth of debt. I haven't checked recently, but it's upwards of $35,000, $37,000. And that's just the debt that's taken out in my name. My parents were fortunate enough to be able to take out a loan in their name on my behalf. And so, when we accumulate all of that debt, it's even more than the debt that I have.\n\nAnd how has that affected me? Luckily, I'm only out of college for the past couple of years, and so I've been in deferment. I haven't had to make any payments on my student loan debt. But I was gearing up to, a couple of months into the pandemic - if the pandemic didn't happen, I would have had to start making hundreds of dollars' worth of payments.\n\nAnd I think one thing important to - important thing to realize is that 40% of people who have student debt don't even have that diploma. So, we are expecting people who went to college and, for whatever reason, did not get their diploma - and we're expecting them to pay that debt, when they're getting paid what a high school graduate earns.\n\nAnd so, you know, there's lots of aspects to this, as well, not forgetting seniors - this is an intergenerational issue - seniors who can get 15% of their student loan checks - their Social Security checks garnished for student loan debt, which is insane. And so, this is an intergenerational issue that affects not only myself and my peers, but seniors and the people that I'm in community with.\n\nAnd so, I can't stress enough that, you know, again, to not - for Joe Biden to - we're 30 days into this administration. That is 30 days of a policy failure that President Biden has allowed, in terms of not canceling student loan debt.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Astra Taylor, I wanted you to respond to this tweet of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. As soon as Biden talked about not going to $50,000, she struck back. And among the things she has said is: \"Very wealthy people already have a student loan forgiveness program. It's called their parents. The idea that millionaires and billionaires are willingly letting their kids drown in federal student loans & that's why we can't go big on forgiveness is about as silly as it sounds.\" Explain what she's saying and what you see at this point needs to be done. Fit in Jubilee 100 with this.\n\nASTRA TAYLOR : Brilliant. I was going to quote that tweet, because it's so spot-on. So, one of the common responses - and when I said Joe Biden invoked these straw figures, this is what I was pointing to. He painted this portrait that student debt cancellation would lead to cancellation for people who went to Harvard and Penn. And the argument is essentially that student debt cancellation is regressive, because this stereotype of affluent, Ivy League-educated people would get relief.\n\nYou know, as Braxton brilliantly just laid out, that's not the case. That's not the real demographics of student debt. The children of millionaires and billionaires do not take out debt to go to school. Their parents pay the price. They pay the price of tuition up front. What that means, actually, is they pay less over time, because people like Braxton have to borrow, and their parents, they borrow money, and they pay interest. So people who are poor pay much more for the same degree over years and decades, because that's the way that debt works. So student debt itself is regressive. It's means-tested. It hits the people who have the least income, the least intergenerational wealth, who are the most vulnerable, the most likely to face wage discrimination at the workplace - it hits them the hardest.\n\nAnd so, this is why Joe Biden's framework is deeply flawed. We need to push back on this and say it's an economic justice issue, it's a racial justice issue, and canceling student debt is also a democracy issue, because we all are entitled to live in a society where our fellow people can pursue education.\n\nWe're not going to get to full debt cancellation without organizing and pushing Joe Biden. He is, famously, the senator from Delaware, the credit card capital of the world. He has helped create this crisis. He's made it harder for student debtors to get relief over the years. It's organizing that got us to this point.\n\nWe have organized a student debt strike, the Biden Jubilee 100, 100 strikers - symbolizing his first 100 days - demanding justice. We invite people to go to DebtCollective.org to sign up for phone calls, for events and for upcoming protests to push this administration to use the power they possess to do the right thing and to start to enact this FDR -size presidency that we've been promised and that we do not seem to be getting.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Astra Taylor, we want to thank you so much for being with us, organizer with the Debt Collective and author of the foreword to the new book, Can't Pay, Won't Pay: The Case for Economic Disobedience and Debt Abolition , and Braxton Brewington, digital strategist with the Debt Collective.

Wade , the landmark ruling that recognizes the constitutional right to an abortion, is in danger. He wrote the comments in a dissent for an unrelated case in which the court voted to overturn a 40-year-old precedent. Breyer wrote, quote, \"Today's decision can only cause one to wonder which cases the Court will overrule next,\" unquote.\n\nI want to turn now to a quote from an unknown author that's gone viral on the internet after it was shared on social media by feminist icon Gloria Steinem. It reads, quote, \"I want any young men who buy a gun to be treated like young women who seek an abortion. Think about it: a mandatory 48-hours waiting period, written permission from a parent or a judge, a note from a doctor proving that he understands what he is about to do, time spent watching a video on individual and mass murders, traveling hundreds of miles at his own expense to the nearest gun shop, and walking through protestors holding photos of loved ones killed by guns, protestor who call him a murderer. After all, it makes more sense to do this for young men seeking guns than for young women seeking an abortion. No young woman needing reproductive freedom has ever murdered a roomful of strangers,\" the quote goes.\n\nWell, we turn now to look at what a post- Roe America would look like and how many people are already cut off from abortion access across the country. In Minneapolis, we're joined by freelance journalist, author Robin Marty. Her most recent book, Handbook for a Post-Roe America , also co-author of the forthcoming book, The End of Roe v. Wade: Inside the Right's Plan to Destroy Legal Abortion .\n\nIt's great to have you with us, Robin. This idea of continually saying, \"What would a post- Roe America look like?\"-you have pointed out it looks like many jurisdictions in America today.\n\nROBIN MARTY : Thanks so much for having me on, Amy. And as Dr. Robinson had just mentioned in her own segment, what she's seeing in Alabama is the fact that there are already people who are traveling six to eight hours just to come to her clinic in order to access care. That is what America looks like right now. And for many people, you can say that abortion is legal, but it is so inaccessible for them that they might as well be living in a place where they just are not having legal abortions.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, can you take us through-you know, right now people seem to be shocked by what has now just happened, this onslaught of fierce anti-choice bans, abortion bans, around the country. But you have shown, in Handbook for a Post-Roe America and all your work at Rewire and other places, that the groundwork has been laid for years.\n\nROBIN MARTY : Yes. Obviously, ever since the beginning of Roe being decided, the anti-abortion movement has always been trying to overturn it. But it got very enthusiastic about it just after the 2010 election, when they were able to sweep a number of states and make them Republican strongholds. And through that, they were able to pass a number of model legislations that came through places like Americans United for Life, National Right to Life Committee.\n\nAnd these bills were all very small, incremental steps that were meant to try and take a challenge up to the Supreme Court to let them review Roe v. Wade . Back in 2011, we were seeing more things that were like 20-week abortion bans or extending waiting periods to 48 or 72 hours-very incremental changes-because at that point the anti-abortion movement wasn't sure whether or not the court would actually overturn Roe , and so they just wanted to make small changes so that they didn't accidentally set off a case that would make a precedent that would make Roe stronger.\n\nThat all changed after 2016. Once there were more appointments to the Supreme Court, and especially once Kavanaugh, Justice Kavanaugh, replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was considered the swing vote, then it was all systems go. No longer were people worried that they might accidentally uphold Roe . And that's why we have this new onslaught of heartbeat bans, of total abortion bans and things that are very obviously unconstitutional.\n\nThese bills were all being introduced back in 2011, 2012, 2013. It's just that they were not passing because, at that time, they were being opposed by anti-abortion activists themselves, as well. Now anti-abortion activists are the ones who are enthusiastically supporting heartbeat bans or supporting total abortion bans. And that's how things have switched over the last 10 years.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about states where abortion is effectively banned or will be soon, like-talk about the legislation Missouri just passed.\n\nROBIN MARTY : Yes. So, Missouri is in the process of passing their own heartbeat ban. It's very slightly different from the other ones that we've seen, in that it has an extra two-week window on it. So, the idea is that abortion may not be banned until about eight weeks after last menstrual period, so that would be about four weeks after a person would realize that they were pregnant.\n\nHowever, in Missouri, that's really not an additional window, because Missouri only has one abortion clinic in the entire state, and that is in St. Louis. In Missouri, it's also a 72-hour wait in between visiting the clinic the first time and then visiting the clinic the second time. You have to wait 72 hours in between, and often, because the way abortions are scheduled, you will end up waiting a week in between your first appointment and your second appointment.\n\nOn top of that, you have the wait that you would need to actually be able to access an abortion appointment in the first place. When you add these layers upon layers of roadblocks, then you've made abortion significantly impossible to obtain. And so you've effectively outlawed it within that state, even though technically Roe is still intact and abortion is still legal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How many states have only one women's health clinic that provides abortion, Robin?\n\nROBIN MARTY : I believe at this point we are at seven states that have just one clinic. We have North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Wyoming, West Virginia, Mississippi-and I probably just missed one, but I'm pretty sure there are seven at this point. Arkansas sometimes, but there is one clinic that does provide medication abortion, but they only have one place that offers both medication and non-medication.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And yet abortion is still legal in all 50 states.\n\nROBIN MARTY : Technically, abortion is legal in all 50 states. It's just very, very difficult for any person to access it, but especially any person who lives outside of these large cities where the abortion clinics are there. And one of the things that people aren't very clear about is that even in states where access is considered slightly better-maybe there are two, three, four abortion clinics in that state-often they are all located in the same city or in the same two cities. So, in essence, it's just as hard for a person to get in, because they will still have to travel. They'll still have to do their waiting periods. They still have all of these roadblocks that they have to get through. And so they might as well just have one clinic.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Robin Marty, we want to thank you so much for being with us. We are going to get back to you soon, freelance journalist, author of Handbook for a Post-Roe America , co-author of the forthcoming book, The End of Roe v. Wade: Inside the Right's Plan to Destroy Legal Abortion .\n\nThis is Democracy Now! When we come back, we're talking immigration and the threats to activists around deportation.

      "text": "Why too much choice is stressing us out\n\nFrom jeans to dating partners and TV subscriptions to schools, we think the more choices we have the better. But too many options create anxiety and leave us less satisfied. Could one answer lie in a return to the state monopolies of old?\n\nO nce upon a time in Springfield, the Simpson family visited a new supermarket. Monstromart 's slogan was \"where shopping is a baffling ordeal\". Product choice was unlimited, shelving reached the ceiling, nutmeg came in 12lb boxes and the express checkout had a sign reading, \"1,000 items or less\". In the end the Simpsons returned to Apu's Kwik-E-Mart.\n\nIn doing so, the Simpsons were making a choice to reduce their choice. It wasn't quite a rational choice, but it made sense. In the parlance of economic theory, they were not rational utility maximisers but, in Herbert Simon 's term, \" satisficers \" - opting for what was good enough, rather than becoming confused to the point of inertia in front of Monstromart's ranges of products.\n\nThis comes to mind because Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis seems bent on making shopping in his stores less baffling than it used to be. Earlier this year, he decided to scrap 30,000 of the 90,000 products from Tesco's shelves . This was, in part, a response to the growing market shares of Aldi and Lidl, which only offer between 2,000 and 3,000 lines. For instance, Tesco used to offer 28 tomato ketchups while in Aldi there is just one in one size; Tesco offered 224 kinds of air freshener, Aldi only 12 - which, to my mind, is still at least 11 too many.\n\nNow Lewis is doing something else to make shopping less of an ordeal and thereby, he hopes, reducing Tesco's calamitous losses . He has introduced a trial in 50 stores to make it easier and quicker to shop for the ingredients for meals . Basmati rice next to Indian sauces, tinned tomatoes next to pasta.\n\nWhat Lewis is doing to Tesco is revolutionary. Not just because he recognises that customers are time constrained, but because he realises that increased choice can be bad for you and, worse, result in losses that upset his shareholders.\n\nBut the idea that choice is bad for us flies in the face of what we've been told for decades. The standard line is that choice is good for us, that it confers on us freedom, personal responsibility, self-determination, autonomy and lots of other things that don't help when you're standing before a towering aisle of water bottles, paralysed and increasingly dehydrated, unable to choose. That wasn't how endless choice was supposed to work, argues American psychologist and professor of social theory Barry Schwartz in his book The Paradox of Choice . \"If we're rational, [social scientists] tell us, added options can only make us better off as a society. This view is logically compelling, but empirically it isn't true.\"\n\nConsider posh jams. In one study cited by Schwartz, researchers set up two displays of jams at a gourmet food store for customers to try samples, who were given a coupon for a dollar off if they bought a jar. In one display there were six jams, in the other 24: 30% of people exposed to the smaller selection bought a jam, but only 3% of those exposed to the larger selection did.\n\nNow consider - and there's no easy way to say this - your pension options. Schwartz found that a friend's accounting firm was offering 156 different retirement plans. Schwartz noted that there was a shift of responsibilities from employer to employee in this seemingly benign transfer of choice: \"When the employer is providing only a few routes to retirement security, it seems important to take responsibility for the quality of those routes. But when the employer takes the trouble to provide many routes, then it seems reasonable to think that the employer has done his or her part. Choosing wisely among those options becomes the employees's responsibility.\"\n\nBut that's the problem. Which of us, really, feels competent to choose between 156 varieties of pension plan? Who wouldn't rather choose to lie in a bath of biscuits playing Minecraft? And yet, at the same time, we are certain that making a decision about our workplace pensions is an important one to get right. But instead of making that choice, Schwartz says, many defer it endlessly. One of his colleagues got access to the records of Vanguard, a gigantic mutual-fund company, and found that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered, rate of participation went down 2% - even though by not participating, employees were passing up as much as $5,000 a year from the employer who would happily match their contribution .\n\nBut even if we do make a choice, Schwartz argues, \"we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from\". When there are lots of alternatives to consider, it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen.\n\nIncreased choice, then, can make us miserable because of regret, self-blame and opportunity costs. Worse, increased choice has created a new problem: the escalation in expectations. Consider jeans. Once there was only one kind, says Schwartz - the ill-fitting sort that, fingers-crossed, would get less ill-fitting once he wore and washed them repeatedly. Now, what with all the options (stone-washed, straight-leg, boot-fit, distressed, zip fly, button fly, slightly distressed, very distressed, knee-holed, thigh-holed, knee and thigh-holed, pretty much all holes and negligible denim), Schwartz feels entitled to expect that there is a perfect pair of jeans for him. Inevitably, though, when he leaves the store, he is likely to be less satisfied now than when there were hardly any options.\n\nSchwartz's suggestion is that, at a certain point, choice shifts from having a positive relationship with happiness to an inverse one. So, what's the answer? \"The secret to happiness is low expectations,\" he says, sensibly.\n\nNo wonder, then, we aren't happy. In the 10 years since Schwartz wrote his book, the ideology of unlimited choice has expanded into unlikely areas - schools, sex, parenting, TV - and expectations have risen as a result. Equally importantly, new tactics have developed to help consumers deal with the downsides of choice. For instance, Schwartz notes, there is an increasing reliance on recommendation engines to help people cope with choice. \"The internet hath created a problem that it is now trying to solve,\" he says.\n\nOne of the areas affected is dating. Relationships are being treated like any other product - online we can browse and compare prospective sexual partners.\n\n\"I think dating sites are now the most common path for meeting romantic partners, and the overwhelming amount of choice that dating sites have created is a real problem,\" says Schwartz. One of those problems was noted by the comedian Aziz Ansari in his book Modern Romance . In it, a woman recounts meeting a man on the dating app Tinder, then spending the journey to their first date swiping through the service to see if anyone better was available. Failure to commit to a date or a relationship can itself be a choice - indeed, the sociology professor who helped Ansari with his book, Eric Klinenberg , wrote Going Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living Alone to account for those who have stepped off the treadmill of dating, the nightmare of having more choice but less reason to choose. Hence, too, Japan's soshoku danshi or herbivore men who, so corrupted by the endless choices offered by online pornography, are no longer interested in real sex or romantic relationships. Psychologist Philip Zimbardo fears that, thanks to how online pornography is offering more choices for masturbatory satisfactions, becoming more interactive and immersive, choosing real-life romantic relationships will become even less appealing.\n\nThere's another problem with choice: it can be more apparent than real - that is, a seeming increase in choice masks the fact that you're paying more for the same stuff you had before. My Guardian colleague Barney Ronay identified this when he considered football on TV recently . The ostensibly good news is that BT Sport is competing with Sky for football rights. It now exclusively shows European Champions League football, which should mean more choice, lower customer outlay and more joy, shouldn't it? But if you are already a Sky Sports subscriber (or, perhaps more pertiniently, watched the free-to-air games on ITV), it means the opposite. If Barney wants to watch the same amount of football as last year, he will now have to pay more.\n\nThat sort of phenomenon repeats itself across TV more generally. To watch all the good stuff on TV now involves paying money in the form of monthly subscriptions to Amazon Prime, Netflix, Sky, BT and Blinkbox, as well as having a Freeview box. But who can afford that kind of outlay? A decade ago everything you could ever wish to watch was on Sky (if you were prepared, admittedly, to pay a monthly subscription to Murdoch). A decade before that, all good TV was on terrestrial, so once you had paid for the telly and the licence you were set. What is sold to us as increased choice has thus made us poorer and, if Ronay's experience is anything to go by, more disappointed. As Ronay says: \"for the captive consumer this isn't really a proper choice at all, but an opportunity to spend the same and get less, or alternatively spend more and get the same.\"\n\nAnger at this state of affairs is comprehensible to anyone who lives in an advanced western society in 2015 and has to choose between mobile phone plans, schools, and water, gas and electricity suppliers - not to mention minimally distinguishable prospective dates. Admittedly these are the choices typical of decadent westerners in the era of late capitalism, but that thought doesn't make the burden of choice any easier to bear.\n\nConsider electricity, says Professor Renata Salecl , author of The Tyranny of Choice . \"Privatisation of electricity did not bring the desired outcome - lesser prices, better service - however, it did contribute to the anxiety and feeling of guilt on the side of the consumers. We feel that it is our fault we are paying too much and we are anxious that a better deal is just around the corner. However, while we are losing valuable time doing research on which provider to choose, we then stop short of actually making the choice.\"\n\nSo we do nothing, and corporations profit from this inertia.\n\nAll of this confounds the idea that human beings act in such a way that they maximise their wellbeing and minimise their pain. \"People often act against their wellbeing. They also rarely make choices in a rational way.\"\n\nThe political idea of allowing parents to choose between schools was to apply the presumed rigour of the market to education so that underperforming schools would improve or close. Standards would rise and formerly illiterate brats in key stage II would relax after double quantum physics by dancing around the maypole singing settings of Horace's verse in Latin, just like in Michael Gove's dreams.\n\nSo education has become a consumer good, and my daughter's is something I'm encouraged to think about as though it were a trip to the shops to buy shoes. Can I buy the best education for my daughter, possibly by moving house, lying about my real address or selling a kidney for private schooling? I'm not sure, but one thing I am becoming increasingly convinced of is what Salecl says: \"Ideology that convinces us that everyone can make it if only he or she makes the right choice relies on blindness - we do not see that social constraints stop us making out of our lives what we wish for. And when we think about choice as a primarily individual matter, we also become blind about broader social, political choices.\"\n\nWhat she means, I think, is that the ideology of choice makes us forget that some things shouldn't be bought and sold, and they are the most important things of all. What's more, having made a decision, we don't want to hear we have got our choices wrong. \"We are constantly under the impression that life choices we made after careful planning should bring us expected results - happiness, security, contentment - and that with better choices, traumatic feelings that we have when dealing with loss, risk and uncertainty can be avoided.\" No wonder, then, that Slacel's most recent work is on the power of denial and ignorance. \"When people are overwhelmed by choice and when they are anxious about it, they often turn to denial, ignorance and wilful blindness.\"\n\nSchwartz demurs, arguing that some extensions of choice can be a good thing. When I tell him about the preponderance of academies and free schools that, seemingly, increase choice for British parents, he says a similar phenomenon, charter schools, has arisen in the US. \"There is something good about this, since public education in much of the US is dreadful, and competition might make it better. But there is no doubt it is stressing parents out big time.\"\n\nAs with choosing a pension, choosing a school leaves scope for regret, shame and fear of missing out. And, in extremis, the terrifying sense that I might inadvertently choose an option that will mess up my daughter's future.\n\nIn 2015, though, there are counter-tendencies to the stress-inducing extension of choice. Not only is Tesco reducing its number of products, but the new leader of the Labour party has just been elected on a political platform that, in part, challenges the rhetoric of choice. Jeremy Corbyn proposes to renationalise not just the rail network but public utilities (gas, electricity and water), partly in the hope that the reduction of choice will provide a fairer, less anxiety-inducing experience for their users.\n\nPerhaps, Corbyn's political philosophy suggests, what we need is not more choice, but less; not more competition but more monopolies. But before you counter with something along the lines of \"Why don't you go and live in North Korea, pinko?\" consider this: Paypal founder Peter Thiel argues that monopolies are good things and that competition, often, doesn't help either businesses or customers . \"In the real world outside economic theory, every business is successful exactly to the extent that it does something others cannot. Monopoly is therefore not a pathology or an exception. Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.\" Competition, in short, is for losers.\n\nThat, of course, doesn't mean that successful capitalists like Thiel would be supporting Corbyn in his plan to recreate the state monopolies of yore or submit schools once more to local education control, but it does mean the rhetoric of choice and competition is at least being challenged and not only from the political left.\n\n\"At least we are talking about a political and economic choice,\" says Salecl, \"and are not simply following the 'desires' of the market.\" Perhaps: if she's right about that, then we are opting for something we haven't done for a long time."

      "text": "Choice by Neel Mukherjee review - twisty tales of morals\n\nA publisher and his authors debate the balance of power between reader and writer in a novel comprising three long, loosely linked tales\n\nE arly in the UK-based Indian writer Neel Mukherjee's new novel, Ayush, an editor at a \"self-styled literary imprint\" in London, is exchanging emails with one of his authors, MN Opie, while working on the latter's short story collection. Opie wonders if the common reader really cares about the order of the stories in the manuscript: \"Can one leave the different strands that constitute a story or a novel seemingly unknit and hope - trust- readers to bring them together into meaning?\" Ayush would rather the subtext was clearly spelt out. \"Why not knit them for the reader?\" He types, but then deletes the question.\n\nThe two questions are at the heart of Choice , which consists of three long, loosely linked tales, a book that Ayush might have pitched to his colleagues as \"a novel-in-stories\". Ayush lives with his partner, Luke, an economist, and their two \"white-ish\" children in a lavish Victorian terrace on the perimeter of Dulwich and Herne Hill. Luke grew up in one of those loaded families with a trust fund and a villa in Gloucestershire; about Ayush, we're only told he spent his early years in Kolkata (like Mukherjee), and that for his generation, the idea of gay parenting was \"literally, unthinkable\". Now their kids go to a school in Brixton Hill and on weekends they go hiking with their dog, Spencer. Their daily schedules could have been grist for bourgeois bonhomie on TikTok, except that Ayush insists, and feels, that he is \"at war with his own world\". He shows the children a documentary about pigs being slain in cages to wean them off meat. When Luke isn't around, he installs cutoffs for the water supply to their three-storey house, with timers for all the lights. If that isn't enough, he slices up his debit and credit cards and donates thousands of pounds stashed away for the children to organisations combating the climate crisis. Ayush isn't the first fictional character to obsess about irreversible environmental damage; where Mukherjee succeeds is in rendering his agony, his insomnia, as absorbingly believable.\n\nThe other two stories in Choice were apparently written by Ayush's authors, one way in which Mukherjee knits the different strands of this novel together for the reader. Emily is also grappling with insomnia. Late one night, her rideshare cab had been involved in a hit-and-run. She remembers the car hitting a boy and a dog somewhere around Cassland Road in east London, but a couple of days later, when she retraces the night's route with a friend, she can't find signs of any collision. The man driving the cab that night, Salim, turns out to be an undocumented Eritrean migrant, moonlighting for his brother, Karim, who needs to visit the hospital for dialysis twice a week. Emily spends nights at war with herself, ignoring her duties as a university professor, agonising about whether she should report the hit-and-run. Her increasing proximity to Salim has one foreseeable outcome: she starts writing a novel tracking his passage from Eritrea to England. But then she donates a kidney to Karim.\n\nWhy the radical empathy? Emily's maternal grandparents, it turns out, once owned a tea estate in colonial India, and we witness her go back and forth with her mother on whether the empire might not have been all that bad: \"We gave them the railways,\" her mother says. Is the organ donation an attempt to exorcise the putative sins of her ancestors? Or did the crash catalyse an incipient, Rilkean desire to change her life? Mukherjee doesn't provide any artless answers. At times, Emily's predicament reminded me of the German writer Jenny Erpenbeck's 2017 novel, Go, Went, Gone , which is also about an academic growing subtly attuned to the precarious lives around him.\n\nChoice is undone by its third section - about an indigent family in a border hamlet in West Bengal, whose lives are transformed when a group of economists give them a cow as part of a social experiment. The story is set sometime in the past decade, but Mukherjee reproduces stereotypes of rural poverty - children filling up their bellies with starch water, and learning the alphabet by scrawling letters on the ground with a stick - dating back to colonial-era Bengal. Sabita and her two children are constantly fretting about making ends meet. They never seem to have any idle thoughts; even their laughter is a means to dispel \"the cloud of anxiety that is the future\". Sabita keeps losing her temper - at her children, her neighbours, the cow. The kids, too, are no more than their timid, compliant selves. For the first time in the novel, nuance is eschewed for a preachy, threadbare morality. When read after the two stories set in London, Sabita's saga of unmitigated woe leaves you with a distressing question. Does Mukherjee really think the poor, and those living in the global south, have no inner lives to speak of?\n\nChoice by Neel Mukherjee is published by Atlantic (£18.99).

      "text": "Choice by Neel Mukherjee review - parables for our times\n\nA bleak, brilliant moral maze of a novel about ethical dilemmas, from global poverty to the climate crisis\n\nI n the middle ages, morality would be transmitted in images. Churchgoers would commonly find above the altar a panel of three paintings relating a biblical parable or commandment. Such altarpieces could be found in Buddhist shrines, too, which might be adorned with three scenes from the path of enlightenment. A knack for envisioning moral precepts has seen the triptych translated across many cultures and now, with the UK-based Indian writer Neel Mukherjee's formally daring new novel, even from image to text.\n\nComposed of three narratives about 21st-century ethical and political dilemmas, Choice has been termed a triptych by its author and, like its visual forebears, the novel needles our moral impulses. The issues in question, from climate change to global poverty, are modern, but the novel's interest in sin and virtue is redolent of the triptych's medieval preoccupations. Where Choice differs is that, in its world, there are no unambiguous rights or wrongs. As one character observes of another: \"No escape was offered by making what one thought was the correct moral choice.\" This is a triptych for a secular age - without hope of salvation, however hard humans try.\n\nAyush, protagonist of the first narrative, certainly tries. An academic turned editor at a London publisher, he lives with Luke, his economist husband, and their children. So haunted is he by their human footprint that he has a plumber cut off the water supply beyond the meagre amount he considers acceptable, and installs timers on all the lights - measures taken unilaterally, and causing rows. Luke's worldview is different. His motto, referenced repeatedly, is: \"Economics is life, life is economics.\"\n\nThis is the principle under scrutiny in Choice. At home with neoliberal Luke and at the offices of his multinational, Ayush encounters an outlook defined by \"the centrality of money, its foundationalness\", which crushes the humane values he reveres as a scholar and publisher. Ayush's interior monologue is compelling, especially the satirical vignettes from a publishing industry mired in \"white mediocrity\".\n\nBut there's no straightforward side-taking in Choice. For one thing, long-suffering Luke, his supposedly inhumane worldview denounced by Ayush, seems the more humane character, and it's Ayush's treatment of his fellow humans that is most dubious. In the novel's astonishing opening, Ayush is depicted showing his children what seems to be a cute animal video before bed. It turns out to be a graphic vegan propaganda film of pigs being butchered.\n\nWhile judging Luke for reducing the world to a numbers game, Ayush is the one who spends his life obsessively quantifying it. He is constantly doing equations to reduce, say, the profligacy of his showers. His moral compass, consulted daily, appears to be a virtual \"kill counter\" tallying animals slaughtered worldwide. Ayush loses the children's education fund, giving it all away to environmental causes. Ultimately, he is himself guilty of a crudely utilitarian moral calculus. Mukherjee shows capitalism to be so pervasive that even its opponents cannot escape its modes of thought.\n\nTwo details link this narrative with the other two. In a short fiction collection that Ayush publishes is a story about an academic who, wasted in the back of an Uber, witnesses the taxi hit a boy, before driving off. Choice's second section, it transpires, is this very story, recounting how the woman unburdens her guilt about the incident by getting uncomfortably close to the driver, an Eritrean migrant, and his family. At another moment, Ayush learns from an economist (one of many in this book) about a scheme that donates cows to poor Indian women. Most make a success of monetising the cow, but Ayush ponders the failures. The third section is the tale of one such family - imagined by Ayush - falling apart after receiving this well-meant gift.\n\nBoth narratives recall somewhat those thought experiments invoked by philosophy lecturers to tease out who bears responsibility for actions and their unforeseen consequences. We come to consider in a similarly abstract way the ethical dilemmas encapsulated by these stories-within-stories, since Mukherjee has drawn attention to their fictionality, and even to his own authorial intentions. A rich editorial exchange between Ayush and the author he publishes commends the \"philosophical fiction\" of late Coetzee and poses the revealing question: \"Can ideas be discussed openly as ideas, or do they always need to be disguised under drama and action and emotional development and all that rubbish, like vegetables smuggled into food for children?\"\n\nMukherjee's award-winning debut, A Life Apart, contained a novel within a novel, but Choice represents another order of self-referential metafiction. It succeeds, though, because it's never without fiction's traditional pleasures, from the close social observation of rural Bengal to delicate evocations of London. Here he is on the way flowers on Herne Hill look more vibrant in the dark: \"more intense, more liberated, more obscene, somehow, than their polite, corseted daytime selves\".\n\nSign up to Inside Saturday\n\nThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But in this brilliant, bleak moral maze of a novel, where every right turn is a wrong one, we will find no lessons about what is to be done - even if Lenin lurks in the epigraphs. Choice is more like the tale of the enlightenment of Buddha, the awakened one (the woke one, we'd say today), which Ayush fixates on: it rouses our moral intuitions from privileged slumber and spurs us not to action, but to intricate contemplation of what actions mean.\n\nChoice by Neel Mukherjee is published by Atlantic (£18.99).

      "text": "The Choice by Michael Arditti review - what the rector saw\n\nThe timeless difficulty of doing the right thing is explored in this questioning novel of faith, desire, art and morality\n\nL ate one night, Clarissa Phipps, the new rector of St Peter's church in the village of Tapley, stumbles upon something she shouldn't have seen. She finds one of her parishioners, Brian Salmon, in a state of undress with a 15-year-old local boy, David Leaves. She knows them and their families well; she knows the damage the revelations will cause. Still she must report them. \"Never had doing the right thing felt so wrong.\"\n\nMichael Arditti 's latest novel explores the timeless difficulty of doing the right thing. It also, in a clever, questioning narrative that covers love, art, sex and spirituality, explores why doing the wrong thing often feels so right. And, as in much of Arditti's fiction - in novels such as The Anointed and The Enemy of the Good - Christianity is the guiding force.\n\nThe story is set primarily in 2019, except for one part that takes us back to 1987. Clarissa and her husband, Marcus, a curator at the Tate, have an arrangement: since his affair, he spends part of his time in London with his mistress, and part of his time in Tapley with Clarissa and their son, Xan. Their relationship remains loving, supportive and amicable, if wanting. They are kept together by love for their son and a shared interest in, and history with, the local artist Seward Wemlock.\n\nWemlock is the rotten core of the novel. He is \"a deeply religious man\" and a great artist: comparable to \"Sutherland, Piper, Eric Gill and, of course, Stanley Spencer\". As with these last two artists, there are distasteful rumours about his private life, which his sexualised paintings do nothing to dispel. In 1987, he is commissioned to produce a set of panels for St Peter's church. Clarissa and Marcus are overjoyed, for both personal and professional reasons. The paintings are hailed as masterpieces by most, but spread disquiet for the use of two 15-year-old models for Adam and Eve: \"Their pose was imbued with a sensuousness that made even sophisticated viewers uneasy.\"\n\nBack in 2019, the fallout from her decision to report what she saw has caused Clarissa to reconsider the value of Wemlock's artwork, and to wonder at her own complicity, in this and other matters. Knowing what she does, should the paintings stay up? Arditti nicely dramatises the difficulty in separating the art from the artist. Wemlock is charming and convincing, his aesthetic and moral philosophy carrying Clarissa and Marcus along as they hear only what they want to hear. Clarissa, a progressive who has fought hard for the right of female ordination, still has her blind spots: \"It was inconceivable that Seward, blessed not only with a God-given talent but a devout faith, would have been capable of such depravity.\"\n\nThere are a number of gently handled scenes: Clarissa tending to her dying brother; discussing with her mother their abusive but beloved father. The tone does occasionally falter. The young folk are somewhat poorly rendered, with 14-year-old Xan limited to grunts of \"Sup\", \"Dur!\", or \"Zzz!\" And, as in his other works, Arditti is prone to an unhelpful facetiousness (when underage David is discovered with Brian he says: \"I'm practically an adult. So my mum says\"), which often undermines the seriousness of the scene at hand.\n\nThese quibbles aside, The Choice is an intelligent and entertaining novel that handles lightly problems of great moral weight. Clarissa faces many hard choices and unearths many horrors, but in the end, for her and for the reader, it is all worth it.\n\nSign up to Bookmarks\n\nDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

      "text": "Choice, choice everywhere. How do I opt out?\n\nI'm with Mark Zuckerberg and Barack Obama on this - the more options I'm given in life, the less I want them\n\nT hat Mark Zuckerberg's a card, isn't he? Earlier this week, as Facebook's boss returned to work after paternity leave, he shared a photograph of his wardrobe with the caption, \"What should I wear?\" The photo showed nine identical grey T-shirts, alongside seven grey hoodies.\n\nAs Zuckerberg had previously explained, he doesn't like to waste energy thinking about clothes when he could be devising new ways to undermine privacy. (I'm paraphrasing, of course.) In this, he's a lot like Barack Obama. \"I don't want to make decisions about what I'm eating or wearing,\" the president says about his uniform of grey or blue suits. \"I have too many other decisions to make.\"\n\nThis can seem like bragging - \"Look at me! Busy, busy, busy!\" - but Zuckerberg and co are on to something. At every turn, even those of us who don't run multibillion-dollar businesses are expected to decide about things that barely matter, or between options of equal attractiveness. Why wouldn't you simplify your life if you could? Isn't it better, as psychologist Barry Schwartz put it , to \"take all of the time you would have spent choosing breakfast cereal, jeans, toothpaste and dental floss and nurture the things that really make you happy\"?\n\nSticking with clothes for a moment, why would any man wear anything but jeans day in day out, unless their lifestyle demanded something more formal or forgiving - if they were an undertaker or a sportsman, say? Why spend five minutes every morning wavering over chinos, combat trousers, cords, jeggings or whatever the fashion industry says is \"in\"? Jeans are tough, timeless and classless. They truly are the people's trousers.\n\nAs an adult, I have rarely worn anything else, and once I found a make that suited me - stone-washed, generously cut, not too expensive - I'd save time by buying several pairs at once, with nothing changing from year to year but the waist measurement. I stuck with that first brand - let's call it Retailer A - for well over a decade, and would have remained faithful if the crotches hadn't begun to self-destruct, usually at the worst possible moment (broken down in a snowdrift, on a beach in Dorset, in a classroom full of six-year-olds) . After a while you get tired of worrying you might end up in a cell, charged with indecent exposure.\n\nHaving switched to Retailer B, only another Crotchlesstrousergate would induce me to waste a single minute trying on functionally identical alternatives from Levi's, Wrangler or Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nIn scifi movies about dystopias, you'll often find that everyone is dressed the same, with no chance to express their individuality. It looks like heaven to me.\n\nTo see the tyranny of choice at its worst, consider the food industry, starting with supermarkets with their tens of thousands of product lines and ending with Chinese or Indian restaurants and their novel-length menus. You can't even get a bite in a pub without weighing up a dozen starters and mains. What's the perfect menu, if you're not a fussy eater or coping with allergies? One starter, one main, one dessert (OK, let's double that for the vegetarians).\n\nEveryone knows that kitchens get better results when they focus on a handful of dishes, so why eat somewhere with a wider but worse repertoire? One of the most enjoyable meals I ever had was in a no-frills dining room attached to a French farm. Everyone got the same pork and mash, in a gorgeous parsley sauce. Dessert was some tart or other. The only decision came at the end: \"Du café?\"\n\nAs a bonus, the removal of choice forces you out of your comfort zone. With a lengthy menu, the temptation is to stick with dishes you know. If the only choice is jellied moose nose ... well, you just might try it.\n\nWishing for less choice can make you look like a Cnut . Politicians, in particular, are constantly telling us that more is better - in schools, in hospitals, in membership of the UK, or the EU - but even where such fundamental matters are concerned, choice is not the be-all and end-all. Most of us would rather be stuck with one good school or doctor than have the right to decide between a dozen rubbish ones.\n\nSpeaking of rubbish, I've stopped going to Subway because I can't face the endless bloody decisions you have to make before walking out with a sandwich. If you've never experienced it first-hand, the company's website will give you a taste. \"Creating your perfect Sub couldn't be easier,\" it claims - and then the pestering starts.\n\n\"What size of Sub would you like? Six-inch or foot-long?\"; \"Which bread? Italian, hearty Italian, honey oat, Italian herbs and cheese, wheat?\" \"Which filling? Beef, chicken breast, ham, sweet onion chicken teriyaki, turkey breast, turkey breast and ham, Veggie DeliteTM, chicken tikka ...\" and on and on and sodding on. And we haven't even got to the cheese yet, or the salad or the sauce. Do I want that toasted? No, I'd rather stick my nuts in the oven.\n\nWhat do you mean, that's not one of the options?"

      "text": "The Choice review - let's twist again, Nicholas Sparks-style\n\nComically perfect neighbours court over the Cape Fear inlets in another adaptation of the North Carolina slushmaster. It's almost watchable - until a phony last twist\n\nA t around the 90-minute mark, The Choice makes a choice. It could, if it wanted to, just call it quits. By this point we've essentially witnessed a full three-act story, albeit a fairly slight one. It's a courtship film with a few hurdles, reversals and, eventually, a happy ending. Ninety minutes is, as any film exhibitor will tell you, a suitable length for a feature. But The Choice is based on a Nicholas Sparks book, and produced by the same North Carolina-based author of vaguely Christian sentimental pap. And as is his trademark, the story can't just be simple: it needs some sort of ludicrous last-minute conflict and ridiculous twist. The Choice chooses this well-worn path, give us about another 30 minutes, and we're all the worse off for it.\n\nIt's disappointing because - and maybe this is the true surprise - so much of the picture's first two-thirds are actually decent. I wouldn't call them good, but I'd call them watchable. Very beautiful Gabby (Teresa Palmer) and very handsome Travis (Benjamin Walker) are new neighbours. She's just moved in to a rented house near the bay, and bachelor Travis likes to sit out back with his dog, grill steaks, play southern rock, look at his boat and have his (married with kids) pals over. Meanwhile, she's trying to study for her medical exams!\n\nWhat's worse is Gabby's adorable pooch appears to be pregnant - it's gotta be that no good neighbour's dog that put her in a family way. She finally heads over to give him a piece of her mind, which naturally kicks off a very slow flirtation. The next morning she takes her pet to get looked at and - oh, no! - that obnoxious man who thinks he's so irresistible is actually the town veterinarian??!!\n\nTurns out Travis really is irresistible. His abs are made from concrete, but he also melts at a basket of puppies. He's got a boat and a motorcycle and is tight with his sister (Maggie Grace) and works with his dad (Tom Wilkinson). Gabby's no slouch either. She's a good cook, likes to twirl when she thinks no one is looking and is pretty easy on the eyes in a bathing suit or white tank top. There is, however, a key problem. Travis still keeps company with his \"boomerang\" gal of many years (Alexandra Daddario, in some cutoff jeans), and Gabby is engaged to a nice guy doctor Ryan (Tom Welling), whose country-club parents just adore her.\n\nBut Travis and Gabby are clearly meant for one another, so how will this work itself out? Well, they're going to have to make a choice, and that path includes a lot of sunsets over those Cape Fear inlets. I've vacationed near Wilmington once and can confirm it is, indeed, lovely. I don't quite recall every single person looking like they stepped out of a Ralph Lauren catalogue, but my memory can get hazy around so much beauty.\n\nLegend has it that Dario Argento and Daria Nicolodi originally wrote the script to Suspiria for pre-teens, but when they recast with adults they just left it as is. The Choice has a similar vibe. No one really speaks or behaves like any adult I've ever met, and the structure leads to a lot of people bumping into one another (like at the carnival!) as if life in Wilmington is one big summer camp. There's also an unexpected jump forward in years, but everyone still looks exactly the same.\n\nI'd rather not get into what that third-act twist is, but I will say that it is a cheap, gratuitous and manipulative way to con people into leaving the theater thinking they've had a thorough emotional workout. Who knows, some might tear up, but I suspect just as many would chortle. Moreover, the preposterous conclusion is a dog-whistle issue for religious conservatives. (Rather than include a spoiler I will include this relevant hyperlink .)\n\nNot only is this sharp turn in the plot gross, it's a slap in the face to the good work that Walker and especially Palmer do elsewhere in their sweet, simple romantic tale. It's a shame director Ross Katz wasn't able to expunge the phony ending from Sparks's benign love story. In the end, it might not have been his choice."

      "text": "Why I choose to have less choice\n\nO nce, when I was suffering a fit of depression, I walked into a supermarket to buy a packet of washing powder. Confronted by a shelf full of different possibilities, I stood there for 15 minutes staring at them, then walked out without buying any washing powder at all.\n\nI still feel echoes of that sensation of helplessness. If I just want to buy one item but discover that if I buy three of the items I will save myself half the item price, I find myself assailed by choice paralysis.\n\nI hate making consumer choices at the best of times, because I have this uncomfortable suspicion that big companies are trying to gull me out of as much money as possible, using sophisticated techniques designed by people who are smarter than I am.\n\nFor instance, when I buy an insurance product, how can I decide whether I should just buy the cheapest, or the best? The best is the one most likely to pay out without penalty or fuss, but that information is much harder to find out than factors such as cost, extent of cover, etc. It's complicated. So I often try not to make choices - by just putting my payments for insurance with my usual insurers on direct debit, for example, which means I don't have to think about shopping around.\n\nThis issue of choice and complexity lies at the heart of the experience of being modern. It penetrates commerce, politics and our personal lives. It may even be connected to the fact that there are higher levels of depression in society than ever before.\n\nThis idea was suggested by Barry Schwartz in his book The Paradox of Choice . Choice oppresses us. Why? Because there are too many choices and they are often too complex for us to be confident that we are making the right one.\n\nWhen you might have 200 potential choices to make of a particular style of camera, it is difficult to feel sure you have chosen the right one - even if you spend an inordinate amount of time trying to make a rational decision. Or you may see the same model two weeks after you've bought it being sold more cheaply. When there was less choice and fewer types of camera, this kind of experience was rare. Our capacity for hindsight has become a means of punishing ourselves.\n\nComplexity is not entirely accidental. Late capitalism solves the dilemma of competition (for the producer) through complexity. To try to choose a mortgage, or a pension, or a computer, requires a tremendous amount of application, so we become relatively easy to gull. Whether it is a power company or a loan company, we struggle to understand tariffs, terms and the small print. Exhausted, we just take a stab and hope for the best, or we succumb to inertia; choose what we have always chosen. Consumers are thrown back on simple cues that are advantageous to the producers, such as brand recognition.\n\nComplexity also impacts on politics. Once it was pretty clear who to vote for - your class position, on the whole, made it a simple matter of self-interest for most voters. Now we have become closer to what is ironically the democratic ideal - ie choice-making actors - voting is more of a challenge than it once was. Do you really have a good enough grasp of economic theory to judge whether it is best to spend or save in a recession? Do you understand the complexities of private provision in the NHS enough to rule it out? Do you know enough about international affairs to support a reduction in defence spending, or a retreat from the EU? Most people don't - so, again, they make snap judgments based on loyalty and sentiment.\n\nThis problem of choice and complexity is ubiquitous. It applies in medicine. If I am ill and asked to make a choice about treatment, I would often rather leave the choice to the doctor, if only because if the wrong choice is made, I am not going to feel nearly so bad about it. I had a prostate cancer scare recently, and I just wanted to be told what to do - not decide whether, say, I should choose an operation that would guarantee impotency in order to stave off a 5% chance of cancer. The burden of choice was too big.\n\nIn the field of education a similar dilemma applies. Once your child went to the local primary or secondary. Now you have to decide from a bewildering number of types of school. In the personal realm, once, you stayed married for life. Now, if you are in an unhappy marriage you have to decide whether to stay or not. These may be all positive developments, but they come at a cost - the potential for regret.\n\nSo how should one react to complexity? Schwartz suggests we should limit choice, not extend it. If you are shopping for food, go to supermarkets that are priced simply with a limited range, such as Aldi and Lidl. Recognise and accept complexity - which means accepting that you can never be sure that you've made the right choice.\n\nAbove all, don't fall for the old trope of only wanting \"the best\". Schwartz calls such people \"maximisers\" - people who are never happy, because they have expectations that can never be met, since in a world of complexity and unlimited choice there is always a better option. Be a \"satisficer\" instead - people who are happy to say \"that's good enough\", or \"it'll do\".\n\nThis may not work in politics - saying the Conservatives \"will do\" when you wanted the Green party is not very satisfactory - but as a consumer, and in life generally, it's a pretty good formula. It'll do, anyway."

      "text": "The Choice by Michael Arditti review - sins of the fathers\n\nThe novelist known for his focus on religion tackles child abuse within the church in this subtle and compelling modern morality tale\n\nT here are many questions about the clerical abuse scandal that will continue to await answers as long as those in leadership positions in the major Christian churches have to be dragged reluctantly into acknowledging the extent of their institutions' culpability. And for the laity in these churches, there is a different but related dilemma: how could this have been going on under our noses without us realising? Or did we, but choose to look away?\n\nMichael Arditti has a reputation for not looking away as a novelist whose focus often falls on religion . His prize-winning Easter in 2000 was unflinching in addressing the many levels of hypocrisy in organised religion around sexuality. And The Choice , his 13th novel, is similarly uncompromising.\n\nIn an ordinary Church of England parish in Cheshire, the vicar Clarissa Phipps stumbles upon her chief bellringer - also the husband of her best friend - fondling a 15-year-old boy. She knows that she has to report it - in that sense, at least, the church has moved on - but almost immediately she is put under a barrage of conflicting pressures to compromise that clarity of purpose: by her cynical husband, her taciturn adolescent son (a close friend of the abuse victim), her pious old-school mother, widow of an Anglican bishop and her own sense of guilt.\n\nAs a young woman in the 1980s, before ordination, Phipps had made a radio documentary about celebrated artist Seward Wemlock, decorating the inside of the very same Cheshire church where she is now vicar with a recreation of the Garden of Eden. His work was hailed as a masterpiece but she had suspected, indeed been told by one of the two local youngsters that Wemlock had used as his models for the naked figures of Adam and Eve, that he had abused them.\n\nYet she had looked away, in part because she gave a higher value to his work than the testimony of his victims. Here, Arditti enters the ongoing debate of whether the artistic merit of a work exonerates the artist, as with Eric Gill , who sexually abused his daughters, and whose 1931 sculpture of Prospero and Ariel stands over the entrance of BBC Broadcasting House .\n\nPast sins, present values, forgiveness and redemption all inform this subtle modern morality tale. But it is the sheer human misery and lifelong damage done by abuse - so often belittled when churches speak only of \"historic cases\" - that are most harrowing and make The Choice such a compelling read.\n\nThe Choice by Michael Arditti is published by Arcadia (£18.99).

Of course not - but it does mean recognising the power of cultural persuasion\n\n\"Your body, my choice,\" wrote the troll on a post about my mother dying. It was meant to intimidate me. Instead, it's launched me into strategy mode, thinking through how women and their friends may build the cultural resilience to survive this neo-Trumpian era.\n\nThe slogan was coined by the white supremacist, antisemitic, misogynist Nick Fuentes. It's everywhere online. Hateful extremists of his calibre once struggled to find an audience among leprous worms. Fuentes dined with the new president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump , as recently as November 2022. This is the reality we live in now - US women directly, the rest of us by association.\n\nThey're hunting us on the internet, these men. They always did but Trump's victory has encouraged more flagrant woman-hating behaviours. I presume they're merely searching the word \"feminist\" or \"feminists\" to find targets in their angry - conspicuously vast - spare time.\n\nThey're certainly not doing the research, because I live in Australia, where my body remains my choice, protected by suites of laws passionately defended by the people even when threatened by anti-abortion politicians . Seventy-six per cent of Australians support abortion rights , with high rates of support among men. Why the difference? Australians have no inherited Puritan fetish for suffering. Being bound forever to someone you don't love, and paying for kids you don't want, doesn't much set you up for a happy and satisfying life.\n\nOur American cousins who have had the same realisation, alas, are now at the legal mercy of those who haven't, won't, and tend to ban any books that suggest they ever will. But even as an Australian, it's hard not to feel an encroaching global darkness when Trump's proposed defence secretary is the latest man to freak out about catching girl germs from female combat soldiers , while in Russia, Trump's pal Vladimir Putin is banning \" child-free propaganda \" supposedly to arrest declining birthrate. The Russian parliamentary lower house voted unanimously this week to punish individuals or entities who promote the terrifying feminist ideology of maybe not wanting kids. One suspects Vlad's lads would get more of a demographic bounce by not feeding soldiers into the meat grinder of invading Ukraine - an estimated 700,000 casualties to date - but, if there's one thing we've learned about population policy anywhere, it's always easier to blame women than for one second take a hard look at yourself.\n\nSo I absolutely get why there's sudden TikTok interest in the radical Korean feminist \"4B\" doctrine , where - to avoid the \"your body, my choice\" gender hatred and the inevitable cruelty that such hatred mobilises - women reject dating, sex, marriage and children and remove themselves as much as possible from mixed-gender social view. In an America where women are bleeding out in car parks due to anti-abortion restrictions on medical care, politicians are agitating to end no-fault divorce , alleged sex offenders are seen as dating gurus and, you know, Trump has just been elected president, let's be fair - going near anything that could get you pregnant now suggests not the fun possibility of thrills but clear and present danger. Sure, sex is great ... but have you ever considered spending 5.4 minutes of your day on something that doesn't carry lethal risk?\n\nThose 5.4 minutes are perhaps better temporarily invested in how they may navigate away from the place where immediate choice over their body is most likely to be taken away - and that's intimate, domestic environments. Yes, even in sunny Australia, almost 70% of sexual assaults by men of women occur in a residential location . And while Australians don't have the same political limits to our freedom as women do in Russia or the US, we have an intimate-partner violence problem informed by the gendered hatreds that manifest in other cultures, in other ways. November has been a brutal month here; 11 women were killed in a period of 16 days.\n\nDoes maximising self-protection have to mean eschewing men and sex completely and joining 4B? No, of course not ... but it does mean, perversely, heeding the Putinist recognition of the power of cultural persuasion - blocking the messages, fighting attempts at social coercion and building safer relationships. As individuals, in friendship groups, in families, in communities, we must resist the thousands of years of aggressive romance narratives that overwhelm stories for and about women, encouraging us to pursue \"true love\" and the attainment of partnered relationships (and, crucially, social witness to them) as the apogee of female social triumph.\n\nWhat keeps girls most safe from the abuser with the \"your body, my choice\" worldview is a strong group of female friends , independent living and a driver's licence . These are the attainments we should encourage everywhere, with the message that when you've got them, you're ready for a relationship, and men who don't respect them paste a red flag on themselves.\n\nThe discourse around intimate partner violence in this country and elsewhere has ever been \"why didn't she leave?\". In this tense and fragile time for women, it's on those who still see women and girls as human beings to consider just what we all did to push her into danger in the first place.\n\nVan Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist"

      "text": "Skip to main content\n\nIan Whitehouse, Surbiton UK Allegedly, this arises from a \"hostler\" (one who rents horses) named \"Hobson\" who forbad renters from reserving a particular horse. Instead, renters take to accept the next horse available. Hence \"Hobson's choice\" means no choice at all. Dave Null, Claremont, California USA Hobbson's choice: something or nothing:  a choice between what is offered and nothing at all\r\n\r\nMid-17th century. Named after the English liveryman Thomas Hobson (1554-1631), who would let his customers take only the horse nearest the door. Lambert Heenan, New York City USA Thomas Hobson was the owner of a livery stable in London in the late nineteenth century. He had a firm rule that customers had to take the horse nearest the stable door or do with no horse at all. The phrase has come to mean a free choice that is actually no choice at all - a delicious sort of verbal paradox. David Lean made a marvelous movie called Hobson's Choice with Charles Laughton, but I don't believe it had anything to do with the actual person who lent his name to the phrase. Robert del Valle, Detroit USA Hobson was Thomas Hobson (1544?-1631) a Cambridge carrier well-known in his day (he appears in Fuller's \"Worthies\"and in two epitaphs by Milton), who refused to let out any horse except in its proper turn. Hobson's Choice therefore means no choice at all.\r\nSee Brewer's \"Dict of Phrase & Fable\". Brian Robinson, Brentwood Essex Hobson was a livery stable keeper in Cambridge. Anyone hiring a horse had to take the one at the end of the line. Hence \"Hobson's choice' meant no choice at all. Denis Moorhouse, Misterton Doncaster UK I have always been led to believe that Hobson was the name of an innkeeper who used an egalitarian system when hiring his horses to travellers. In the stableyard, the customer was permitted to have which ever horse they desired, as long as it was the one nearest to the inn, hence the coining of the phrase 'Hobson's choice' to mean no choice at all. Presumably this system ensured a fair rotation of the horses, allowing equal 'wear and tear' on each animal. Jo Adlam, Chichester UK Hobson's Choice is a play in which Horatio Hobson is a cobbler with his own shoe shop, but spends most of his time in the pub. His shop's success is due to the boot making ability of his eldest daughter, Maggie. When Hobson refuses to allow his younger daughters to marry, Maggie sets about courting a fellow shop worker with the intention of making him both her husband and her father's rival. Horatio is left with \"Hobson's Choice\" as he has no real choice at all. Aaron Pouncy, London UK In (I think) the late 16th/early 17th century, Tobias Hobson of Cambridge hired out horses mainly to the local university students, who were known to be fairly hard on their rides Consequently, Hobson initiated a scheme of strict rotation whereby only the rested horses were available for hire while the knackered nags where given a rest & a cup of tea out the back.  If a renter didn't like the steed he was offered, he had one choice -- Hobson's Choice. Alasdair Patrick, Lake Forest, California USA Hobson was a Coaching inn owner in Cambridge. He operated replenishment stable. So when you arrived at his inn having come up from London and your horse in need of rest. you'd be given a horse that had been handed in the day before in exchange for your horse. Thus you could hand in your prize stallion and be given a old nag in return. Dave B, London Thomas Hobson was a 16th-17th century Cambridge liveryman whose business was carrying the mail to London and back.  He also hired out the horses, when not required, to the university students.  They quickly cottoned on to the fact that some horses were better (faster!) than others and would request particular animals.  Hobson realized that some horses would be overworked, so he instituted a system whereby the horse tied up at the stable entrance would be the next horse to be hired out, irrespective of the hirer's wishes.  Thus \"Hobson's Choice\" is the equivalent to \"take it or leave it\".  A water course along Trumpington Street, Hobson's Conduit, takes its name from this same man who was involved in its construction.

      "text": "Be Aware of Your Choices -- They Make Your Life\n\nContributor\n\nOne of the things I love and marvel at is our natural ability to make choices. In a split second we make choices about how we're going to live, where we want to go, the people we want to be with, what we want to eat, how we want to look. Millions of choices that are both conscious and unconscious. It's an incredible and powerful gift we have.\n\nIn his book Choose the Life You Want: The Mindful Way to Happiness , Harvard Professor and Positive Psychologist Tal Ben-Shahar talks about choice this way:\n\nChoice is creation. To choose is to create. Through my choices I create my reality. At every moment in my life I have a choice. Moments add up to a lifetime; choices add up to a life. What kind of life do I want for myself? What choices will create this kind of life?\n\nGreat words don't you agree?\n\nNOW -- Let's really utilize this gift by focusing right in on your thoughts and feelings - target them - look directly at them -- be sharply aware. Awareness is the key. •What are your thoughts? •What are the quality of your thoughts? •How do you speak to yourself? •How do you think about other people?\n\nDo Your Choices Make You Feel Good?\n\n\"I'm so tired... what are they doing to me... I don't want to see emails... I hate Mondays and my boss.\" Or\n\n\"I'm happy I'm alive... that sunrise is magnificent... MMMM hot coffee... I'm excited about my project.\"\n\nDo your thoughts have complaint in them or gratitude - irritation or wonder - peace or resentment - negativity or positivity - goodness or evil -- pleasure or pain ?\n\nIf you focus on the negative; the burdens of your life, rehashing past injuries and old grudges that's how you'll live. You're filling yourself up with poison. You may have good reason to feel the way you do but... Do your choices and thoughts make you feel good about your life?\n\nYou always have an option. You always can make another choice and head right to the positive. You can hope for, work at and '...choose to create' new results and changes that make the quality of your life good; focusing on the gratitude of your life and the people you love and who support you.\n\nI Have a Morning Ritual\n\nEvery single morning when I wake up I immediately choose to be grateful for something. I consciously think about it in my thoughts and choose one specific thing I appreciate or like or that makes me happy and often I say it right out loud -- \"I'm grateful for a good sleep.... Grateful for cool, running water... Grateful for eye glasses and sight... Grateful for the internet... the sound of birds singing... electricity... friends and their help... sudden heavy rain... a playful dog... Grateful to have love in my life.\"\n\nIt has a wonderful effect on me and the constancy of it makes me strong and happy. The changes and choice for this didn't just happen easily. As I practiced being aware of my thoughts I saw clearly my big tendency to complain and worry. I used to start my day fighting in my mind with people and the world. Worrying about nearly everything around me. So I tried something different and began to turn my thoughts around. Where I had negative thoughts of people I thought about where I respected them, I thought about what they felt to themselves and I wanted to understand them and their choices. It didn't mean I had to agree with them or be friends but it helped to release the negativity I felt.\n\nI Chose Gratitude to Counter Worry and Fear and Irritation\n\nMaking the conscious choice to be positive and to appreciate things made a real difference in how I was at work and the way I thought about myself. I was calmer, worked more efficiently and had a better attitude with people. I felt centered in myself and peaceful; life flowed more easily; I lived with natural, positive energy and personal satisfaction. I learned that I'm in charge of how I respond to things and my good choices helped me to like myself much more and to be kinder to others.\n\nThe specific choices and awareness I made for change eventually started to happen all by itself.\n\nChange is difficult and it takes work. That's why so many people don't do it. They stay stuck. They don't want to do the work to change and even believe it is impossible to change. That's an excuse.\n\nEvery day we have a whole new round of choices to make and every one of them matters.\n\nYour life is your life. You can choose who you want to be. Why not makes choices to have your life be as good as possible, no matter what your circumstances? Things don't always happen for the best but you can sure chose to make the best out of whatever happens to you.\n\nCherish the power of choice you have. Wake up each day and be thankful for life.\n\nMoments add up to a lifetime; choices add up to a life. What kind of life do I want for myself? What choices will create this kind of life? -- Tal Ben-Shahar\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Your First Choice Is Rarely the Optimal Choice: 5 Lessons on Being Wrong\n\nI write about behavioral psychology, habit formation, and performance improvement.\n\nAs a rule, we are incredibly hard on ourselves when it comes to making big decisions in life.\n\nIn cases like these, when we are attempting to do something that is complex and multi-faceted, I believe that being wrong is actually a sign that you're doing something right.\n\nHere's why...\n\nFirst Choice vs. Optimal Choice\n\nFor some reason, we often expect our first choice to be the optimal choice. However, it's actually quite normal for your first attempt to be incorrect or wrong. This is especially true of the major decisions that we make in life.\n\nFor example...\n\nChoosing your career. What is the likelihood that your 22-year-old self could optimally choose the career that is best for you at 40 years old? Or 30 years old? Or even 25 years old? Consider how much you have learned about yourself since that time. There is a lot of change and growth that happens during life. There is no reason to believe that your life's work should be easily determined when you graduate.\n\nWhen it comes to complex issues like determining the values you want in a partner or selecting the path of your career, your first attempt will rarely lead to the optimal solution. 5 Lessons On Being Wrong\n\nBeing wrong isn't as bad as we make it out to be. I have made many mistakes and I have discovered five major lessons from my experiences.\n\n1. Choices that seem poor in hindsight are an indication of growth, not self-worth or intelligence. When you look back on your choices from a year ago, you should always hope to find a few decisions that seem stupid now because that means you are growing. If you only live in the safety zone where you know you can't mess up, then you'll never unleash your true potential. If you know enough about something to make the optimal decision on the first try, then you're not challenging yourself.\n\n2. Given that your first choice is likely to be wrong, the best thing you can do is get started. The faster you learn from being wrong, the sooner you can discover what is right. For complex situations like relationships or entrepreneurship, you literally have to start before you feel ready because it's not possible for anyone to be truly ready. The best way to learn is to start practicing . (1: I believe that this is also one of the reasons why history repeats itself. There are many situations that simply have to be experienced to be understood. Even if you read the opinion of every expert in a field, the only way to make progress in your own life is to experiment. Of course, not all experiments go to plan and, as a result, the same mistakes are made over and over again as each person goes through the process of finding their own way. )\n\n3. Break down topics that are too big to master into smaller tasks that can be mastered. I can't look at any business and tell you what to do. Entrepreneurship is too big of a topic. But, I can look at any website and tell you how to optimize it for building an email list because that topic is small enough for me to develop some level of expertise. If you want to get better at making accurate first choices, then play in a smaller arena. As Neils Bohr, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, famously said, \"An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field.\"\n\n4. The time to trust your gut is when you have the knowledge or experience to back it up. You can trust yourself to make sharp decisions in areas where you already have proven expertise. For everything else, the only way to discover what works is to adopt a philosophy of experimentation.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

There is no reason to be depressed or give up simply because you will make a few wrong choices. Even more crucial, you must try your best every time because it is the effort and the practice that drives the learning process. They are essential, even if you fail. Realize that no single choice is destined to fail, but that occasional failure is the cost you have to pay if you want to be right . Expect to win and play like it from the outset.\n\nYour first choice is rarely the optimal choice. Make it now, stop judging yourself, and start growing.\n\nJames Clear writes at JamesClear.com , where he shares science-based ideas for living a better life and building habits that stick.

      "text": "Choices in Life\n\nBest-Selling Author, Spiritual Medium\n\nEvery day people all over the world share a several universal experiences, and the most common one of these is choices . Life is made up of choices. I believe life is just a series of decisions we make, and depending on our choice, must live with the result of that decision. The choices usually consist of a multitude of possibilities and, whether real or imagined, we must recognize that in some way the decision will change our life forever. Therein lies the rub. Because there are so many factors involved with our decision-making and with its unknown result, many of us hesitate to even make a choice, thinking it would be safer and that we'd be better off where we are instead of delving into the unknown. Just think of how many events in history would never have occurred if someone did not make the choice to do something different, unknown, unproved or un-experienced? How many relationships would never have been realized without making a particular choice? Many would say that we have no control over our world or what happens to us. I say perhaps you cannot control the world, but you can certainly control how you choose to react to various situations and how you will handle them. Depending upon the type of choice it is (such as a lifestyle decision), if we don't have a multitude of possible options, we seem to become anxious and confused. So how can you be reassured that you have made the right choice, especially when it affects a major aspect of your life? Well, I am a firm believer that we as souls have various destiny points we must live through in this lifetime, which we have designed prior to our incarnation before we ventured back into this three-dimensional world. But with these destiny points firmly implanted in our soul makeup, we also have \"free will\" and can choose how we will live through the situation at hand. For instance, before making a knee-jerk reaction and judging someone, instead, you can take a moment and attempt to understand why this person is behaving a certain way, and you then may choose to react to the situation in a healthier, constructive way and demonstrate some compassionate.\n\nWhen making a choice, one must be aware of how their choice will affect the future ramifications of their lives. Of course there are different types of choices; some are easy to make, while others are more difficult. For instance, an inconsequential choice is easy, such as if I should buy that new piece of clothing. But other choices that will affect other people's lives are more difficult. Still, as I mentioned earlier, the choices regarding life decisions such as career, moving, etc. are very difficult because in many of those cases, the response to that choice will be longstanding.\n\nTo assist you in making these decisions, I have put together a list of criteria that you can use while making a choice:\n\nDon't lose focus on your future. Many people tend to make choices based on life as it appears right now instead of looking to the future. Does your choice and its ramifications stay within the goals that you have set for yourself for the future?\n\nHave you looked at all the alternatives and considered different scenarios? Sometimes you just might consider a different outcome.\n\nHow important is this decision, and are you willing to work on it? Don't get caught up with how important a choice is, but -- better yet -- what a positive impact this has on your life.\n\nI always find that the more one knows about themselves and their place in the world, the easier the choice. One must always make a choice that is the best for their \"highest good.\" In saying that, the only right answer would be the one your \"highest good\" will tell you. Before making any major choice in life, I gift myself with time to sit and contemplate. I bring myself into a meditative state and bring myself into the stillness of the silence. It is in that silence that one communicates with their soul's needs and understandings. Just by putting forth the question to our higher self while in mediation, you will receive a clear indication what is right for you and in alignment to your highest good.\n\nAlways remember and bear in mind that life is a series of choices, and most choices are based on two things: love or fear. Both can masquerade in different ways along your path, but love what you do and do what you love. Make the choices in your life that will make your soul sing, and sustain a happy life during your earthly mission. Just think: The choice you make today could make not only your life happier, but make a better world in which we live.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "The Privilege of Choice\n\nChief Program and Strategy Officer, the de Beaumont Foundation\n\nAt the age of 41 years, I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes, hypertension, and elevated blood cholesterol. Not exactly the hat-trick to which one aspires.\n\nFor years, I was the poster child for the excuses we all have for neglecting our health -- I was too busy, too tired, and had too many demands on my time. When I finally heard the diagnoses after ignoring years of warnings, I knew these excuses couldn't continue.\n\nToday, about six months later, I am fortunate to say that I've lost 30 pounds. I visit the gym at least five days a week, I make different choices about the food I eat, and I take medication daily. Not surprisingly, this combination has all of my numbers well within the normal range, if not below.\n\nBut, this isn't a blog about inspirational weight loss or personal conviction. No, this blog is about individual choice and, more importantly, how the individual choices I was able to make are a privilege afforded to me because of my income, education, employment, and neighborhood.\n\nTo Make a Choice, You Must Have a Choice\n\nHow are the choices I made a privilege? My work hours are flexible enough to allow me to plan my week around my gym time. My employer provides gym membership as an employee benefit, and I can afford the extra monthly charge for childcare while I work out. I have a partner who helps me prepare nutritious meals and manage the daily tasks of family life. The neighborhood where I live has many options where I can purchase healthy food including large grocery stores, farmers markets, and niche markets specializing in organically grown produce. When I can't cook, I'm not stuck with fast food as my only option. I also have the ability to run safely in a park, take a leisurely stroll with my family, or workout using outdoor gyms in addition to the commercial gyms that dot my neighborhood.\n\nThese are the perfect conditions in which to turn over a new leaf and get healthy-but they're not available to everyone.\n\nConsider an hourly employee at a call center. Her work hours are set and squeezing in a gym visit during the workday would impact her take-home pay. Let's say she lives in a neighborhood where liquor stores and fast food restaurants clutter the streets. There are no grocery stores, no restaurants serving affordable, quick, healthy meals. Maybe she is a single mother, juggling meal planning and daily chores without the help of a partner at home.\n\nWith each new fact about this person's life, you understand the degree to which her choices are limited.\n\nIf I didn't have the privileges that I do, my choice could have been limited to medication. And if that didn't work, then my choice after that would be to continue to medicate at higher doses. And if that still didn't work? Then my next choice would be to move on to more aggressive and expensive treatments.\n\nOf course, this assumes that I have access to care and can afford my medications. Far too many Americans are forced to choose between health care, including medication, and things like food, electricity, or housing.\n\nWelcome to Haddon Avenue\n\nIf you need a real life example, take Haddon Avenue. I remember driving this road often when I lived in New Jersey. It starts in Camden and ends in Haddonfield. As you make the drive along Haddon Avenue, the boarded up, burnt out homes are replaced by playgrounds and bustling town squares. The ubiquitous corner stores lined with cigarette ads are replaced by niche grocery stores offering locally grown, organic fruit. Those living at the start of this journey have much different choices about how to improve their health than those at the end.\n\nHaddon Avenue is not unique. Public health researchers have quantified what I observed driving along Haddon Avenue -- how differences in wealth, education, and environment can impact health.\n\nFor example, in 2013, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation released maps of health disparities between subway stops in Washington, DC, New Orleans, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and the San Joaquin Valley. In New Orleans, just one mile could mean a difference of 20 years in expected lifespan. Whether its Haddon Avenue or New Orleans or Washington, DC or in your own backyard, these neighborhood-based disparities can be found in nearly every community in every state throughout our country.\n\nGrowing Support for Government Action\n\nWe need to work collectively to achieve what we as individuals cannot accomplish alone, and actions of this magnitude are usually beyond the scope of any institution except government.\n\nDid they fail to make healthy choices? Or did the environments and communities in which they live make most of the choices for them?\n\nIn each of these examples, governments can implement programs to ensure the safety of our parks and safety of our water and put policies in place using tools like tax credits, effective regulatory actions, and legislation to directly address the community and environmental circumstances that limit our choices.\n\nWe know that living closer to a park increases the likelihood of physical activity. We know that improving the quality of affordable housing can lead to better health and lower health care costs. We know that having options for healthier foods increases the likelihood that people will eat a healthy diet.\n\nIt takes collective action-government action-to change the environment and begin to limit the factors that contribute to the prevalence of chronic disease. This action can be more impactful and cost-effective than pills and can improve the health of everyone in the community. Increasingly, bipartisan political and community leaders are realizing that a healthy and economically viable city depends on a healthy population.\n\nOver the past decade, both sides of the political divide have recognized the need for government intervention to promote health. Democrats , like former Senator Tom Harkin, have championed prevention and wellness initiatives. Former Arkansas Governor and Republican Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee has advocated for incentivized employee wellness programs and improvements to the food environment for communities in need. Current Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett, also a Republican in a red state, helped the people of Oklahoma City lose one million pounds with a strategy that included expanded parks, better public transportation, and the addition of biking trails (see Mayor Cornett's TED Talk ).\n\nThe private sector is also recognizing the need to improve communities with health in mind. For example, the Detroit BUILD Health Challenge team includes one of the nation's largest architectural firms, Gensler & Associates. In addition to their involvement in the BUILD Health Challenge, a quick review of Gensler's blog posts finds discussion of changing corporate dining options to promote health , inclusive community design principles , and the burgeoning trend of micro-gyms and collaborative medicine .\n\nCreating Choice and Opportunity\n\nThere are those who suggest that Americans are smart enough to make their own decisions and there is no need for government to decide for them. But we have already seen our inaction result in communities where ads for and access to fast food, cigarettes, and alcohol completely eclipse healthier options.\n\nWith 1 in 2 children of color likely to develop diabetes in their lifetime , it is clear that government must address pressing issues like access to affordable healthy food; hyper-marketing of high-sugar foods, alcohol and tobacco products; and the lack of safe streets, parks, and playgrounds that plague so many of our communities in the United States.\n\nHealth is not and should not be a luxury item available to a privileged few.\n\nWhile we are addressing broader social determinants like income and education, we need to empower basic choice. Unless we are healthy, we can't be productive in our jobs; we can't be ready to learn at school; we can't have a thriving economy; we can't be engaged and active parents; and we can't participate fully in our communities.\n\nI believe in personal choice. But many Americans do not have options that allow for choice, and that's a problem we need fix.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "The 11 Most Important Choices You Can Make in Life\n\nRichard has authored or co-authored around 20 books dealing with business, ideas, and personal success; and is also an investor.\n\nWhen I was growing up there was a truly awful television program which I watched religiously. I think it was called Take Your Pick and it involved the oily host, Hughie Green, alternatively buttering up and intimidating poor members of the audience, who were invited to \"take the money\" -- a certain amount of cash he offered them, with readies in his hand -- or \"open the box\". Inside the box might be far more money, a wonderful prize ... or, for example, a box of paperclips. The suspense was -- would the guest make the right choice? Whatever they decided, they then had to open the box, with Hughie goading them, \"You took this much money\" or \"You turned down this much\". Their reaction -- rueful, joyous or downright angry -- was then plain for all to see. As I say, a really nasty game.\n\nLife is a bit like that. We can view it as a succession of choices. Indeed, modern life in rich countries is a series of choices which would utterly have bewildered our forebears, who usually had precious little choice of the work they did, where they lived, or even what they thought. And like a game, but played out over a lifetime, the choices we make will be fateful and determine, in good measure, how we end up and how we feel about it.\n\nNothing is more important than making the right choices.\n\nNobody else can make the choices for us, but I'd like to use the 80/20 principle -- together with some observations and prejudices I have accumulated over the years -- to help us frame the choices a little better.\n\nThe 80/20 principle will never tell us what to do, but it gives us a better map of reality, judging by causes and results. And the principle will tell us about choices, as about everything else, that most of reality doesn't matter, but a few things -- in this case choices -- matter a huge amount. In other words, there is a very small number of choices that will determine the great majority of results.\n\nRather arbitrarily, here is my \"top eleven\" -- I tried to cull it to ten, but couldn't -- of the most important choices we can make in our lifetimes, in ascending order of importance. But bear in mind that these choices, though only a tiny fraction of the choices we will make in our lives, are the ones most likely to determine how happy and useful we are:\n\n11.Choose to Get a Dog\n\nI wanted to start with something you wouldn't expect. But I am not being frivolous. Six years ago my partner and I did what it turned out we had each wanted to do for a long time, but never had -- we welcomed a tiny little canine friend to our family. Since then we have fallen in love again - with the dog, I hasten to add -- and she makes it clear she's in love with us too. Tocker is a beautiful brown Labrador, and I recommend that you choose one of the friendly and good-natured breeds, as no doubt at least 80 percent of dog affection comes from 20 percent of breeds. If we are a bit down, Tocker comes and says hello and stares with her liquid green-brown eyes straight into our eyes, and it cheers us up no end. We also do a lot more walking.\n\n10.Choose to Save Money - Automatically\n\nSpecifically, get into the habit of saving a tenth of everything you earn. Do it by direct debit, straight from your income, so you never see the money. This habit alone is likely to ensure that you will never be hard up, and it may help you get rich. It will certainly diminish your money worries -- and that is important for happiness and effectiveness.\n\n9.Choose to Give Money\n\nGive it personally -- to a real, specific individual, or to a small charity that you are personally involved with. There is a theory that the more money you give, the more you get; and though this is not a great reason to give money away, it does seem to work eerily often. The real reason is that giving money helps other people, and it helps you too by making you feel good. Very good value.\n\n8.Choose to Eat Healthily\n\nAll food is habit forming. You eat bad food -- you'll want to eat more. You eat good food -- even if you don't like so much to start with, you soon will -- at least for some of it. So eat more of that. I adore garlic -- you have been warned -- onions, berries and cherries, certain fish, and most green vegetables. Experiment with food that is good for you -- it is well worth having a blood test and seeing a nutritionist -- until you find food you love and that loves you.\n\n7.Choose to Exercise every day\n\nIt is easier to exercise each day for half an hour or more, than to try to do it three times a week. Do it at a fixed time so it becomes a habit. Don't let work interfere with it. If work might, do it first thing. Find some exercise you enjoy and stick to it -- walking, running (but not on hard surfaces, especially if you are over 40), cycling, and swimming are all excellent. Exercise not only improves health immeasurably, but also clears the mind and makes you feel good.\n\n6.Read a Book every day\n\nNot a whole book! But for at least half an hour be alone with a book. Reading is an incredibly 80/20 activity -- you experience life and ideas through books almost more efficiently than any other way; reading takes you into new worlds you wouldn't easily experience otherwise; reading requires you to think and imagine; and reading is highly enjoyable. There are so many books of so many different types that if you can't find a book you really want to read, you are not being serious. Make sure you have a small pile of real books or a few on your Kindle that you want to read. Take a book or Kindle everywhere you might be able to read for a few minutes.\n\n5.Choose to Get Excited Every Day\n\nWithout excitement, we are not fully alive. Some people are fortunate: they get excitement every day from their job. But if you don't (or even if you do), find excitement, again for at least half an hour, in some activity that really turns you on -- sport, sex, dancing, games, gambling, playing cards, anything at all that doesn't do you or someone else harm. Modern life is often far too tame. We are designed to get our thrills (and if we don't, we may turn to destructive drugs to do that for us). Shout, scream, holler, or just enjoy -- but do it intensely. Before you start each day, work out what is going to give you half an hour of excitement. If it has a strong physical element, so much the better.\n\n4.Choose a Career You Love\n\nTotally obvious. We spend half our waking hours working. Utterly mad not to enjoy it too -- even if it requires years of learning or experimentation to find out what that is.\n\n3.Choose the Right Partner\n\nThis week I met a friend I hadn't seen for six months. He'd just split up from his wife and he was extremely happy about it. His children are grown up, so I'm sure he made the right choice. Better of course to make the right decision first time. Fine, it's hard to do, and I didn't, so who am I to talk? Actually a very good person to talk, because I didn't think about my first relationship as seriously as I should, nor try it out gradually until I knew whether it would work. It may be that no single decision is as important this one in terms of happiness, for you and other people too. So give it the thought that it deserves, and beware of your first answer.\n\n2.Choose the Right Friends\n\nYou may find the order here a bit odd, but friends in aggregate are probably an even more important cause of our happiness and value than our partner. Over time, we become more like our friends, and they become more like us. We influence each other enormously -- or else we are not true friends. So if you want to know what somebody is really like -- a prospective partner, for example -- get to know their close friends. You may well be surprised. Make time for friends, help them in adversity, and see them as much as you can, even if they live a long way away. Review your friendships honestly, even brutally. A few real friends are worth more than dozens of others. Make room for new close friends -- by gradually dropping old friends, if you find that they are not adding a lot to your life and you are not adding a lot to theirs.\n\n1.Choose to Love Yourself\n\nI've blogged about this recently, so I won't go on. If you love yourself, you will be more demanding of yourself also, because everyone wants to love someone they admire. If you are not the most important thing in your life, you won't be doing anybody else a favour either. Take your life seriously. It's the only one, or the only one of its kind, that you will ever get. It could be so-so, it could be fulfilling, or it could be truly great. Which would you prefer? Choice is a serious business. Choose to take your life choices seriously.\n\nIf you find my blogs interesting or useful, please share them with a friend, leave a comment, or follow me on Twitter @RichardKoch8020\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "The Power of Choice\n\nPR, Government Relations, Business Admin Professional\n\nThe average working adult makes about 12 decisions before the 9:00 am hour. Obviously, this number varies on an individual basis, but a study by one of my Alma Maters, Cornell University, states that an adult makes about 70+- decisions a day. Once one opens his/her eyes, the 1st decisions made are; to snooze or not to snooze, what side of the bed to roll off of, what will I wear today, and maybe, will I go to work? It's part of our natural human behavior to make conscious and subconscious decisions on a daily basis. Some of which have short term effects and others with long term outcomes; should I stay in this job, this relationship, this geography? Well what if I told you there was a better way to make decisions in your daily life with a simple formula? Not necessarily preventing you from making mistakes but mostly, to not regret the mistakes you make. Interested?\n\nOften times, we wish that someone would make life choices for us but they are just 'too hard' or 'too heavy' and we fear the future sentiment of regret. And so, we choose not to choose sometimes. When we have less choices, we are compelled to make a decision a bit quicker than having too many to handle. And when we have no choice at all, we either feel punished or relieved depending on the circumstance. This is real, it's everyday and everyone.\n\nA nominal choice example : you walk into the grocery store to pick up some cheese and crackers. Aisle 7 on the left, 14 choices of gluten free, fat free, low sodium, wheat, whole grain etc. etc. of little carb filled bites they call crackers. How are you supposed to make your 1 decisions of what types to buy? With so many choices, your mind starts to wander and be a bit distracted by nutritional contents, quantity of serving, price, potential flavor, etc. Wouldn't the decision be much easier if there were only 3-4 choices? Or if mentally, you walked in already craving low sodium? This allows you to prepare your pre-set filters for yourself. Same with clothing shopping, you need a new top for an event but you have no idea what you want to wear. The choices are overwhelming but if you think a bit about fits, colors and dressing for the occasion, the decision becomes a bit easier.\n\n(photo by The Howard Brand, location GLAM356 Columbus, Ohio)\n\nI know this seems simple and self-guiding, but you would be surprised how many people just wait until a choice must be made to actually think about it. Thus, first part of the formula is; Prepare .\n\n1. Prepare yourself for a decision you must make. Filter your preferences beforehand so that a self-driven, educated choice can be made based on your pre-chosen subconscious desires.\n\nI know that was a somewhat benign example but this logic is applied to all other choices as well. Such as, your family member is ill and they live alone and far away from the rest of the family. You have a bit of guilt because you are well and completely content in your life but you feel that you need to be there for the loved one in need and so, you start to think about small and extensive decisions you need to make to be there for this person in the last years of their life. Thought process: Can I afford to leave my job, my home, my family right now? How long would I go for? What is my financial situation and what will it be if I were to come home in about a year or two? Will my significant other be supportive and am I willing to put my personal life on hold? This leads to step two of the choice formula: Evaluate .\n\n2. Evaluate the outcome, benefits and ramifications. What does it mean to make this decision in the time frame that I need to make it?\n\nThe power of choice is important to reflect upon because counting choices one is proud of and those one may learn from is the best way to grow, learn and take on tomorrow with educated choices for short term and long term decisions. So the last piece of the puzzle is to: Follow Through .\n\n3. Follow Through with the decision. Sometimes the best way to choose, is to consult and hear feedback from those you trust, while other times it's best to hear the internal voice. Once that decision is made, don't be afraid of it. We can only make the most educated choices based on personal knowledge and experience so try not to renege on that decision once made.\n\nPrepare, Evaluate and Follow Through. Have an idea of what you want beforehand and/or try to anticipate a future decision that must be made. Evaluate the cause and effect and see if it'll fit with your subjective plan and follow through with your choice as it may not be irreversible but it will effect you and most of the time, those around you. The power of choice is yours to keep and if you can prevent regret or make a more conscious decision, why wouldn't you?

      "text": "Real Love Is a Choice\n\nAuthor and Blogger at www.SethAdamSmith.com\n\nMy wife and I have known each other since high school, but didn't date until much later. We had only dated a couple of weeks before we realized that we were madly in love and wanted to get married.\n\nI was all for it! I even suggested a spontaneous, immediate wedding in Vegas. (Seriously.) Kim, however, was a bit more practical about the whole thing. She wanted to take time to plan it all out.\n\nI felt deflated. \"We're so different,\" I said. \"You like to plan, while I like to be spontaneous.\"\n\nKim's eyes widened. \"I can be spontaneous!\" she said, hurriedly. \"I can totally be spontaneous. You just have to tell me in advance when you want to be spontaneous, and I will write it down in my planner...\"\n\nI gave her a strange look. She was totally serious! Clearly, Kim did not understand the meaning of spontaneity.\n\nFunny as it may seem, the more I think about this conversation the more I've come to realize that planning to love someone--or choosing to love someone--is actually one of the most beautiful things about love.\n\nI've heard it said that real love is an unconditional commitment to an imperfect person.\n\nIt's true.\n\nWhen all the butterflies have fluttered away and your wedding day becomes a distant memory, you will discover that you've married someone who is just as imperfect as you. And they, in turn, will come to learn that you have problems, insecurities, struggles, quirks--and body odor--just as real as theirs!\n\nThen you will realize that real love isn't just a euphoric, spontaneous feeling--it's a deliberate choice--a plan to love each other for better and worse, for richer and poorer, in sickness and in health. Of course, you don't choose who you're attracted to, but you definitely choose who you fall in love with and (more importantly) who you stay in love with.\n\nOur society places a lot of emphasis on feelings. We are taught that we should always follow our feelings and do whatever makes us happy. But feelings are very fickle and fleeting. Real love, on the other hand, is like the north star in the storms of life; it is constant, sure, and true. Whenever we're lost and confused we can find strength in the love that we have chosen.\n\nBesides, life already offers us plenty of spontaneity: rejection, job loss, heartache, disappointment, despair, illness, and a host of other problems. We simply can't abandon ship every time we encounter a storm in our marriage. Real love is about weathering the storms of life together.\n\nWhen my grandma was in her fifties, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a degenerative disease that disrupts the body's ability to communicate with its nervous system. Within a few short years, Grandma had lost the ability to walk and was confined to a wheelchair. Grandpa, who was then the chief of police, retired two years earlier than planned in order to take care of Grandma. He helped her do everything--from getting around the house and visiting the doctor, to helping her take her medicine and bathe.\n\nIn speaking about my grandma, Grandpa once told my mom, \"It hurts me to see her like this. You know, when I got married I thought that everything would be smooth sailing. I never imagined that I would have to help her change her catheter every day. But I do it and I don't mind it--because I love her.\"\n\nLove is so much more than some random, euphoric feeling. And real love isn't always fluffy, cute, and cuddly. More often than not, real love has its sleeves rolled up, dirt and grime smeared on its arms, and sweat dripping down its forehead. Real love asks us to do hard things--to forgive one another, to support each other's dreams, to comfort in times of grief, or to care for family. Real love isn't easy--and it's nothing like the wedding day--but it's far more meaningful and wonderful.\n\nI recently came across this wonderful quote: \"No one falls in love by choice, it is by chance. No one stays in love by chance, it is by work. And no one falls out of love by chance, it is by choice.\"\n\nWhenever my wife and I run into a problem in our marriage we do our best to choose love. While we're certainly not perfect, the love we share today is more real and more wonderful than anything we had ever anticipated.\n\nSo, whatever spontaneous storm may come our way I plan on loving my wife.\n\nIf you truly love someone (and they truly love you), commit to that love and plan on it being hard work.\n\nBut also plan on it being the most rewarding work of your life.\n\nThis article was originally published on SethAdamSmith.com\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Why Does Choice Make Us Unhappy?\n\nManaging Director, Silver Ridge Advisors\n\nI am the founder of Collective Intelligence, a strategic communications firm.\n\nSVP, Strategy & Analytics at Eastern Bank / Labs\n\nIsn't life great? So many choices. I can pick almost any product I want, consume it how and when I want, wherever I want. Different pricing, different everything, just for me.\n\nMarket capitalism is all about choice, and choice is all about me. That has to feel really great. Right?\n\nFrom its infancy 20 years ago as a consumer technology the Internet promised \"disintermediation\" of everything from shampoo to ideas. That promise is extended every day. Choice as a commercial expectation is steadily becoming a cultural one as well.\n\nIn the pre-digital world access was the limiting dimension of choice. Now access feels infinite. Want to watch a movie? You've got Apple TV, Netflix , cable on demand, Hulu, network OTT apps. Not sure? OK, maybe music instead. How about iTunes, Pandora, Spotify, Amazon Prime, even, God help us, radio? Or what about meeting that special someone? There's Tinder, OKCupid, Hinge, Tastebuds, Bumble, Match.com, Coffee Meets Bagel and a dozen more.\n\nNot sure where to begin? You're not alone. How often do we end up choosing no movie, no music, no mate?\n\n\"Choice paralysis\" is a familiar concept to psychologists. There's a body of evidence suggesting an overabundance of choice makes us anxious and mistrustful.\n\nSome years ago, for instance, Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper ran a fascinating supermarket study in which shoppers were offered 24 jams to try one day and six jams on another day. The larger display drew more traffic but the smaller display was more likely to turn browsers into buyers. Apparently, what we value becomes harder to know in proportion to the number of choices we have.\n\nIf this sounds like a first-world problem, it is. But it's becoming a familiar phenomenon in an age when worlds encounter each other so easily.\n\nRadical autonomy. Today we have more freedom to make our own choices than any civilization has ever known. So why aren't we happier?\n\nWe're asked to make complex choices about a multitude of subjects we can't possibly know all about. We're expected to plan our own retirements but reminded all the time that anyone selling us advice more often than not has some back-end incentive we don't always understand. Every year we're asked to pick different health plan options but good luck trying to compare them. Or we sensibly choose a no-fee credit card and then discover it has a tight payment window with high interest and late fees.\n\nWe don't know what, can't distinguish which, don't know whose opinion to trust. Mis trust begins to feel like wisdom.\n\nIt is surprising to observe how much the choices we make are weighted toward emotion over information. A point of view becomes a fact because we believe it. That's a dangerous thing around anyone with a willingness to fabricate the truth.\n\nIt isn't just that making everything a personal choice is exhausting. A world that celebrates individual choice also makes us lonely. It goes against our nature as social creatures because part of how we choose is with reference to what everyone else is choosing.\n\nRadical autonomy has been put literally in the palm of our hand. It is having the unintended consequence of making us leery of anyone and anything asking for something.\n\nA transitional moment. This is a transitional moment, one of those times when basic presumptions change radically. Like the lag in cultural norms that trailed the industrial revolution or second-wave feminism the conventions of living have not caught up with a changed world. The stress is enormous in the near term.\n\nOur brains have heuristics for making choices, many of them probably genetically coded. A world where there's always another possible choice trains us to mistrust that basic process. We compulsively ask ourselves, Do I really have enough knowledge?\n\nPeople will accept guidance without knowing all the information when they trust. Behavioral psychologists, for instance, have established that employee participation in defined contribution plans is higher, returns are better and satisfaction is greater when plans are designed as opt out rather than opt in --when the choice, in other words, is made for us and we trust its value.\n\nThere is a market opportunity for intermediaries who take the pain out of choosing. Think Kayak and Trivago , which have made a business out of scraping options from the many travel and hotel sites that were once supposed to make life easier. Or Amazon, which succeeds not just because it offers price and convenience but because we trust it to stand behind its sellers and because we can compare our choices against what a community of other buyers have chosen.\n\nFinally, consider the work being done with bots to help us filter choices, not to expand them. These text-based interfaces reduce complexity and make recommendations. Bots are patently algorithmic and yet our interactions with them can feel weirdly human.\n\nIt's kind of creepy, but there you are. The choice is yours.\n\nPhoto credit .\n\nOther featured articles by the authors:\n\n\"The End of Diversity\" Companies regularly measure diversity in terms of gender, race or age, implying that demographic mix translates into high performance. But at the same time, companies make deliberate efforts to iron out differences, hiring candidates for \"fit\" and evaluating employee performance against an ideal type. This isn't diversity. This is confirmation bias.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Within the first month of unveiling the Model 3 concept, nearly 400,000 people have placed orders. The launch, if one may call it that, was a gigantic concept test for a car that is yet to be built. This was Kickstarter on a grand scale. But Tesla is not testing a version of a car. Tesla is capturing market share even as its car is being designed.\n\n\"A Picture's Worth a Thousand ... What?\" Notice how many ads have an image, but no text? They're more clever than you might think. Advertising increasingly depends more on images and less on words. How ironic that this is happening when it's harder than ever to control the message embedded in an image. Images now destabilize the moment they are released into the digital wild ... but maybe that's a good thing."

      "text": "YES! Happiness Is a Choice\n\nContributor\n\nWhat kind of life do you want?\n\nI say a happy one. Why not!\n\nMany people believe that you're either born happy or you're not. I believe happiness is a choice -- that you have the ability to create real and lasting happiness for yourself.\n\nWe're always making choices and doing things to be happy - choosing what to eat, what clothes to wear, who to love, where to work. Some of our choices are good and others not but they're all based on our deep and impelling desire to be happy.\n\nCertainly genetics, your personality and nature, plays an important part in your happiness. Then life circumstances also affect your happiness such as upbringing, health and finances.\n\nBut the most vital element to being happy is choice. You can choose to be happy. I worked at happiness\n\nYour personal happiness has everything to do with the conscious choices and the sincere amount of work you put into living a good life; to flourish, thrive and to be joyful even while you may be living in painful and seemingly hopeless circumstances.\n\nGrowing up was not a happy time for me. My dad was alcoholic and my parents had an unhappy marriage. Most of the time I hated being at home so I found ways to counter my suffering. Studying acting and singing brought me tremendous joy and freedom. I was out rehearsing, working and learning with positive people; expressing myself and giving form to my feelings. My life had meaning and purpose and real rapture.\n\nLooking back I clearly see that I chose to go after happiness and I had happiness options. Meaning -- there were things I liked to do; was passionate about -- drawing, gardening, teaching, singing, performing - and choosing to do them helped me to like my life and to feel balanced. My ability to make decisions, my choices to do specific things, made me feel good, glad, grateful, jubilant, optimistic, hopeful, inspired. Even while I felt stuck and sad at times I always liked setting goals and making plans to get away from negativity, to improve my life and to make my own happiness. Gandhi perfectly describes the solid feeling of happiness I was building:\n\n\"Happiness is when what you think, what you say and what you do are in harmony.\"\n\nThat's exactly what acting made me feel...that there was harmony in my life because what I was thinking, saying and doing all worked together and the hardships at home hardly hurt at all. I wasn't escaping from my family life I was simply doing what I could to be happy for myself. I was building new habits, patterns and routines of happiness. I was taking action to be happy and it seemed natural, organic and rewarding to do. Sure we might be happy if we win the lottery and have an abundance of money or are very successful at doing something or find someone who understands and loves us but if those elements are not there, we only have ourselves to count on and to create our own happiness.\n\n- If you're in an unhappy relationship you can choose to change it and that could mean getting out.\n\n- If you hate your job you can make a choice to change it.\n\n- If you want to be healthier that's another choice for personal happiness.\n\nHappiness is up to you. Your choice. Your way.\n\nHere's how to regain and build happiness\n\n1. Think about a time in your life when you were really happy. 2. Why were you so happy? State the facts. Write them all down.\n\n3. What were you doing that made for such confidence, personal excitement, peace and pleasure? Be very specific about this time in your life because once you target that time and the exact reason or reasons why you were happy you can then recreate it... and be in harmony with what you thought... and said... and did.\n\nAs a Life and Career Coach I thrive at assisting people to figure out what they want to do with their lives and then to do it so they can be happy! Knowing your purpose, setting goals and intentions enables you to be blazingly free to live your life the way you want to. That will always make you happy.\n\n* A coaching client recently told me, \"... getting my masters in sociology made me so happy because I was committed to achieving it and caring for people and that's what I most want to do with my life...care for people.\" * Another said, \"... connecting people with each other and solving problems. I'm really good at it. That's when I'm happiest and 100 percent myself.\"\n\n* And one more - \"My happiest time was in college. I was dedicated to learning. I met my wife there and built friendships that have lasted for many years.\" When you know the facts of what makes you happy you can choose to do the same things you love, choose to use your gifts and talents to be fully expressed and entirely yourself. Isn't that what happiness is about?\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Happiness is not something you can turn on in the midst of heart ache, profound worry or fear but at least you have the knowledge, the facts and the life experience to know what makes you happy and then you can create it, work at it and have it in your life always. I'm not saying ignore the real problems we all face in life but, think about what works well for you -- know what satisfies you -- do what gives you ultimate pleasure and practice it.\n\nWe all want to be happy. Why not make happiness a daily ritual? Choose happiness. Live it!\n\nRemember - \"Happiness is when what you think, what you say and what you do are in harmony.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Happiness Is a Choice, and So Is Love\n\nAuthor of Crime Rave and American Monsters; contributing writer for Wear Your Voice Magazine\n\nImage courtesy of Mayur Gala , via Unsplash.\n\nIt was the summer of 2012 and I had just moved to a sleepy little Florida beachtown -- a forced repatriation back to the U.S. through a prolonged series of unfortunate events after almost a decade of life in Europe. A most worst of times, indeed, with no best of times in sight.\n\nI was also unknowingly suffering from an undiagnosed genetic thyroid ailment, so to add insult to injury, I watched myself gain first 10 pounds, then 20, then 30, over a course of that first year repatriated, on top of the 40 pounds I'd already gained, perfectly helpless to stop it.\n\nLet's not forget the PTSD that's been my shadow since October 28, 2000 after I witnessed the murder of my dear friend in Los Angeles -- PTSD that woke up big time when I was forced to move back to the country of its root, a place that still boasts lackadaisical gun laws and weekly mass shootings.\n\nThe sense of helplessness at my lot was as pervasive as the hopelessness, with me sinking into one of the worst depressions of my life. In spite of the perpetual sunshine and warmth I'd craved for most of my stay in Europe, my days were dark and bleak and there was nothing around to pull me from that oubliette of sadness.\n\nThen, a friend helped me get a job as a private investigator that allowed me to work from home. Suddenly, my days had structure and I had a reason to get out of bed in the morning. Next, a perfect stranger suggested I should take kelp for my thyroid as well as start a regime of green juice. The kelp worked and I began to lose weight, and the nutrition provided by the green juices and smoothies actually began helping put my depression at bay. I started blogging on the Huffington Post, and my years-long dream for a larger writing platform was at long last granted. The final clincher was learning first through the incredible art show Hannibal and through the writings of Dr. Elaine Aron that roughly 20 percent of the population also have my highly sensitive personality, and even though for most of my life I'd been gaslighted and pathologized for my sensitivity it turned out that I'm not crazy like so many ex-people in my life had claimed.\n\nA light at the end of my tunnel was finally visible, and I suddenly cared about living in that light instead of shadows. I began painting, collaging, and making strange little pieces of multimedia art as well as picking up my long-abandoned second novel and rewriting and rewriting some more until it was ready for publication in November 2015. I also started to get into a groove writing essays, and this blog marks my 26th post on HuffPost since September 2014, with many more to come.\n\nI had an epiphany: I realized that for so many years I'd been looking outward for my own happiness. Like I expected my environment to provide me with the necessary tools for happiness, and when I'd never find them I'd go right back to being miserable. It's as if we're taught to look to others, to new places, to relationships, to things, in order to satisfy ourselves and feel happy. And maybe these things will temporarily provide a sense of elation and accomplishment at their acquisition. But it never lasts.\n\nI suddenly understood that happiness is not something that happens to us , it happens from us . Happiness is a daily and active choice we make.\n\nAnd if happiness is a choice, then so is unhappiness.\n\nSo, I decided to get up each day and choose to be happy. Choose to focus on the positive things, the things for which I'm grateful, the things that I might not have if my circumstances changed. Even if there are only a few of these bright lights, just one is enough to get through the day and not be miserable.\n\nIt's been almost three years since I chose to be happy. Even though to date I still don't like where I live, I miss having an in-person community, I wish our condo allowed pets, I'd love a job outside the home, why is there no public transportation?, and so many other annoyances not just of life in America, but life specific to my strange corner of Southeast Florida. And even though in the meantime my thyroid began malfunctioning again and I had to start daily medicine, the fact that I'll be on these meds for the rest of my life -- or that I have to be on a pharmaceutical at all -- doesn't anguish me in a way it would have before.\n\nI find that it's actually not as hard as I thought it would be to be happy. To choose daily gratitude. I can accept that my environment might be a crappy reality, but I don't need to dwell on the crappiness.\n\nAnd then I started to understand that love is just like happiness: eventually love also becomes a choice. When the romance fades, or when a friendship begins to sour, we make a choice as to whether we will continue loving that person in spite of the fact that the love isn't the same as it was in the beginning. We have the potential to wake up each day and decide who we want to love, and how much work we're willing to do to maintain that love (unless violence or abuse is part of the picture, in which case pack your bags and don't look back).\n\nRight around the time I was hypothesizing about love and happiness a story called The 36 Questions That Lead to Love by Arthur Aron was making the rounds and seemed to support my conclusions. And how funny that the spearheader of this revolution in love theory was in fact the husband of Dr. Elaine Aron, whose work on the highly sensitive personality I've already mentioned and which had made a huge impact on my life and mental health.\n\nIt was incredibly empowering to take control over these concepts of happiness and love I'd always assumed relied solely on external forces. In a lifetime of being unhappy, being constantly buffeted by negative experiences and pain, it's a relief to find myself bubbling with joy even when my situations aren't ideal.\n\nThis isn't to say that I've gone from being maudlin to Pollyanna in one huge bound. Not at all. I still live with PTSD, and depression. It was also remarkable to learn that you can still suffer from depression even while actively making a choice to be happy and grateful. That said, there are still some days -- especially after I've been triggered or during certain difficult times of the year -- no matter how hard I try or how much I want it the option to choose happiness is too far out of reach. The difference now is that when those dark times envelop me, I no longer get lost in the despair. I know the way out: the way out will be me and my force of will, and my continual daily dose of gratitude, until the necessary tide turns.\n\nUltimately, we're not passive recipients of love or happiness. In so many ways we're taught to sit back and wait for love, wait for happiness, wait for satisfaction to find us when that's not how it works at all. We ourselves are the active participants in the promotion or prevention of our own lives.\n\nWhile I was percolating and integrating this marvelous series of realizations into my own life and relationships, synchronicitously the film Trainspotting was on repeat on cable. I hadn't seen it since it first came out a decade before and saw that the answer had been with me all along, but I'd been ignoring it because it can be so much easier, take so much less effort, to actively wallow in pain.\n\nThe answer is and always was: Choose life.\n\nAnd while we're at it, let's choose to make it a happy one. Let's choose to fill it with love.\n\n___________________\n\nIf you -- or someone you know -- need help, please call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline .

      "text": "\"Every Choice Is Loss\": Voters on Their Decision Amid Genocide in Gaza\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nProgressive Americans opposed to Israel's U.S.-funded war in Gaza face a difficult choice: whether or not to vote for Harris.\n\nAfter months of protests on the streets and organizing within the Democratic party, Kamala Harris's campaign has not shown signs it will stray from the Biden administration's steadfast support for Israel amid its genocidal war in Gaza and invasion into Lebanon. Donald Trump has shown no indication that he would change U.S. backing of the Israeli war machine, and is the personal favorite of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . One of these two candidates will become president. The Intercept interviewed voters who are horrified by the ongoing U.S. support for Israel's war, and in many cases have dedicated the past year of their lives to organizing against it in key swing states such as Georgia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Arizona.\n\nThe race remains extremely tight, with the majority of polls showing Harris and Trump at a virtual tie . In the swing states that will decide the election, the candidates are either tied or hold narrow leads. Four years ago, Joe Biden won some key states by as few as 10,000 ballots. Every vote, including those voting with Gaza and Israel's expanding wars top of mind, matters.\n\nEach voter interviewed for this article has demanded of Biden, and now Harris, an immediate, permanent ceasefire, and an end to the U.S. policy of unconditional military aid to Israel - both of which have been found to be popular among Democrats in swing states and across the U.S. The rejection of such demands have left voters uneasy about their choices.\n\nThese voters have their own reasons for deciding how, why, and whether to vote, but they fell into three distinct categories: the anguished undecided, the strategic anti-Trump Harris voters, and the protest voters either going third-party or opting out entirely.\n\nResponses have been condensed and edited for clarity .\n\nHalah Ahmad, Wisconsin, political strategist and organizer with Listen to Wisconsin\n\nI actually have not decided. I tried filling out my early ballot today, and to be honest with you, I started crying and I couldn't finish filling it out, because I feel so upset about the options and also I'm holding out for as long as I can.\n\n\"It is so deeply dehumanizing to have to ignore a genocide and complicity in it.\"\n\nIt's a really heavy choice - every choice is loss. It is so deeply dehumanizing to have to ignore a genocide and complicity in it, and a promise to continue the same policy, which is what Vice President Harris has said. At the end of the day, we're being presented with a little bit of a false choice: If people can be protesting on this scale, and we don't have an option that can align with that, and you can suppress anti-genocide voters in that calculus, I don't know what kind of democracy you're protecting. And that's really heavy. My sister is trying to fill in her ballot, and she's like, \"I feel physically nauseous.\" That's real. If I see a shredded child on my timeline again, I don't know what I'm expected to do, like, vote for that?\n\nI'm Palestinian and my husband is Lebanese, and our family is not from Gaza, but I have very close friends who've lost their family and their childhood homes and their neighborhoods. And my husband's neighborhood in Lebanon has also been virtually, completely leveled.\n\nFolks are committed, as far as I can tell, to voting third-party, or leaving it blank, or writing something in. And then there are other folks that, on a day-to-day basis, they're reluctant Harris voters or they flip-flop between that and deciding they're not going to do it - they're going to vote third-party or something of that sort. The picture that I'm getting is that voters are pretty committed to this idea that they want to vote against genocide.\n\nMeghan Watts, North Carolina, graduate student\n\nI'm not very sure. I am probably between Harris and maybe [Jill] Stein at this point. Waiting on Harris to take a firmer stand on the genocide in Gaza and the expansion of that into Lebanon and parts of the West Bank as well. I've seen a recent report saying that our tax dollars have funded about 70 percent of this current genocide, so that's an alarming number. I'm not sure what the odds are, maybe they're slim, but I'm holding out hope that she might call for an arms embargo and that it happens as immediately as possible.\n\nEven aside from this genocide, it's been difficult to get Harris to take a firm stand on other things I'm concerned about like trans rights; having some sort of meaningful, humane immigration reform; and taking a stand on climate change. I'm a parent of trans kids in a state where right now they're able to get gender-affirming care, and in a recent interview where Harris was asked whether she supported the rights of trans individuals, her response was \"I believe we should follow the law,\" which is concerning. In many states, they're actively antagonistic to trans people.\n\nWe absolutely do not want a second Trump presidency. However the lines have been a bit blurred between what exactly is the difference between Harris and Trump on particular issues, such as the border - probably the difference is in degrees of what they'll do, not necessarily that they'll do it.\n\nMaryam Hassanein, Arizona, the first Muslim American appointee to resign from the Biden administration over the war in Gaza\n\nAs of right now, I'm still debating what I'm going to do come Tuesday. For me, it's between Harris and then third-party, probably Stein. I've voted Democrat for as long as I've been eligible to vote. The reason that I'm still debating whether to vote for Harris is really because of that history of mine, also conversations about the likelihood of a third party's chance to win. But at the same time, I've been hesitant to put my support behind Harris-Walz because of their unwillingness to denounce genocide, unwillingness to indicate that they would do anything differently than what the Biden-Harris administration has done in regard to Israel-Palestine policy.\n\n\"I'm seeing they are kind of shifting right on certain policies.\"\n\nSomething I've seen from the Harris-Walz campaign is that in an attempt to make up for [lost] progressive voters, for voters on the left, I'm seeing they are kind of shifting right on certain policies, like a bit of a harsher immigration policy than is normal for a Democrat. Also not necessarily an amazing climate policy given the accelerating climate crisis. The Gaza issue is affecting other issues. Being Muslim, I was at one point excited to join an administration that had the most Muslim appointees. But then just seeing everything unfold, I recognized it really doesn't matter how many Muslim appointees you have, if you are causing so much harm to Muslims in other parts of the world. It's a face-value, surface-level type of inclusion.\n\nI've seen debates play out in groups I'm in, and I think the main point is \"Hey, we just don't want Trump in office.\" And while I completely understand that, I think that there is also an incredible danger to just support Harris because of that, because then it kind of sets the precedent that, \"Hey, it's OK that you can do all these bad things. We're gonna still vote for you because we just don't want the other person at all.\"\n\nReem Abuelhaj, Pennsylvania, organizer with No Ceasefire No Vote PA\n\nI'm a Palestinian American. I've lived in Philadelphia my whole life. I voted Democrat in every Penn election since I turned 18, but for the first time, I'm finding myself in the position of being unable to cast a ballot for the Democratic nominee for her ongoing support of Israel as it continues its genocide in Gaza. I'm in community with a lot of people who feel similarly to me, who feel backed into a corner. We're terrified of another Trump presidency. We know that another Trump president, he would be disastrous for our communities, but we're people of conscience when it comes to the ballot. This is a time of incredible grief and fear and desperation. In my case, people I love fear for the lives of their family members in Gaza, and we feel we have to continue to put pressure in every way we can while we have this moment of leverage with swing-state voters to push the Biden-Harris administration to take action.\n\nThe thing I don't want to lose here is how many more people will be killed between November and January if the Biden-Harris administration continues this policy of unconditional support to Israel. If they don't take action before Election Day, then the next question is, how do we continue to mobilize while the Biden-Harris administration is still in office? That's a critical period of time, when we're going to see thousands of more people in Gaza and the West Bank and Lebanon be killed if the administration does not take action.\n\n\"This is about this election, and this is also about the future of elections and of democracy in the U.S.\"\n\nIt's our assessment that with efforts like this in key swing states, it will no longer be possible for the Democratic Party to put forth a presidential candidate who is promoting a policy of unconditional support to Israel to carry out genocidal violence.\n\nThis is about this election, and this is also about the future of elections and of democracy in the U.S. We're representing a movement of voters who are concerned, not only about Vice President Harris and the Democratic Party and the Biden-Harris administration's continued support of a policy that is extremely unpopular among their electorate, but also concerned about what other issues we might see on the ballot in the future that 80 percent of Democratic voters strongly oppose, that are in violation of U.S. and international human rights law, but that the Democratic Party feel that they can continue to promote despite the mass dissent of their base.\n\nUsama Shami, president of the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix, Arizona\n\nThis has been very difficult. I'm going to hold my nose and vote for Harris, knowing that a third-party vote, at the end of the day is basically: If you vote for a third-party candidate, then Harris loses and Trump is gonna win. That's something that I don't want to happen.\n\n\"If you vote for a third-party candidate, then Harris loses and Trump is gonna win. That's something that I don't want to happen.\"\n\nLooking at the community as a whole, they're conflicted, and some of them are voting for a third-party candidate because they're sick of the two-party system and they're thinking about maybe doing this for the future, having a viable third-party option in the future.\n\nLook, if I were living in California or New York, I wouldn't have a hesitation to cast a vote for a third party, or if I were in Texas for example, because you know it's not gonna make a difference. Five percent in California is not going to split the election. But we live in a swing state and every vote counts, and at least I want to have a clear conscience that, even if Trump wins, I was not part of the reason that he won.\n\nIn 2016, when Trump made the announcement that he was going to institute a Muslim travel ban , our mosque was vandalized. He made the announcement during the day; in the evening, somebody came and took a huge rock and broke the office window at the mosque. We had people shooting [at the mosque]. So for me, I can see the impact of his words - a lot of people don't see that. The day after he was elected, we got people calling the mosque and leaving messages that our time is limited here in the U.S., and there is a new sheriff in town. So we don't need more of this crap.\n\nI don't blame people for voting third-party, although in my mind they're misguided, but I don't blame them, because you have people that either know people that died, or have family that they lost in Gaza, or people that are enraged by what they're seeing daily on TV. I can see how it makes people despair that things will change, so I don't blame people for looking for a third-party candidate, looking for a different alternative.\n\nJesse Myerson, New York, community organizer\n\nI live in New York, so it doesn't matter who I vote for because of this ridiculous antidemocratic Electoral College system we have. But I have been offering to coach people who live in [swing] states who are struggling with their vote, and the coaching that I would give people who live in those states is to hold their nose and vote for Harris in order to defeat Trump.\n\nThe side that I'm on in this election is against Trump, and I wish there were a better way of defeating him than electing Harris, but given that that's the only viable pathway to defeating Trump, that's the least horrific option I think we have. And I stipulate that I would never presume to counsel a Palestinian American voter to vote that way, because I fully understand why that sort of tactical calculation is not necessarily available to people who are losing dozens of family members or are at risk of doing that any day.\n\nKnowing that the Biden administration, with no note of dissension from Harris, has been financing and materially supporting this genocide in Gaza is just a bridge too far for so many people, and I can fully understand that. That makes perfect sense to me. If people want to write in \" Hind Rajab ,\" or vote third-party, or abstain from voting for president on grounds that it's unconscionable to vote for génocidaires, I might not share their theory of change or their power analysis, but I don't feel like I'm in any position to tell them that's a wrong way of going about things. It's good to have principles and political convictions and to have lines that beyond which you will not go.\n\nI don't feel it's necessarily my role to tell people how to vote. I think it's my role to tell people how I am thinking about the election and hope that that's persuasive to people.\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nI think there are several conceivable things to say. One is that the people who are most directly carrying out that genocide and who are seeking to extend that genocide to the West Bank and to expand the borders of Israel, sometimes to parts of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Egypt, and beyond, which is to say [Israeli Finance Minister] Bezalel Smotrich, [Israeli National Security Minister Itamar] Ben-Gvir, the ultra-right, which are the ruling coalition in Israel - they all want Trump to win. And so do, you know, Nazis and neo-Nazi adjacent billionaire figures like Elon Musk. They all want Trump to win, and for me, it's sufficient to want to deny them that victory.\n\nWhoever wins, Trump or Harris, we're going to have to continue to be courageous and inventive and organized to figure out new ways of trying to end this genocide. But if it's Trump, the onslaught of attacks that his administration is going to unleash against queer and trans Americans, immigrants, Muslims, people of color, Jews, anyone whose reproductive rights are under attack, anyone who's on the front line of climate catastrophes - those are going to require that we play defense on a whole host of issues, and that is going to reduce the capacity that we have for fighting against this genocide. And honestly, given the Project Esther plans , there's going to be even more direct attacks on the movement for Palestinian human rights than there are right now.\n\nThe possibilities for forward motion, slim as they would be under Harris, would be completely obliterated under Trump, and force such a defensive posture that I think we would just lose ground in huge incomprehensible ways.\n\n\"The possibilities for forward motion, slim as they would be under Harris, would be completely obliterated under Trump.\"\n\nThen generally, there are a small number of elected officials in Washington, D.C., who support an arms embargo , and all of them are Democrats and none of them are Republicans. And so would we want them to be junior partners in the leading coalition, or would we want them to be the opposition within the opposition, which is to say, relegated to the most marginal position in Washington, D.C.?\n\nI only offer these thoughts from a place of profound sorrow and powerlessness and desperation. I'm terrified of the fallout of Trump and Project 2025 and Project Esther, and as somebody who is visibly Jewish at a glance in public because of my garb, I think that every neo-Nazi's favorite president coming to power personally endangers me. I am desperate to defeat him, and poll after poll in crucial swing states has shown that the best way that Harris can ensure that happens is by supporting an arms embargo- a measure supported by the vast majority of Democrats, a majority of Jews in America, a majority of voters overall. And the fact that she has refused to do that - and Biden, of course, as well - I experience as a profound betrayal, a searing, searing betrayal and clear statement of a willingness to sacrifice my safety, the safety of all those other groups targeted for violence and repression by Trump's coalition, in the interest of continuing to support the Israeli Trump - which is Netanyahu - and his fascistic genocidal regime.\n\nBut there's simply not a good option. This coaching that I offer is, like, really scraping the bottom of the barrel of the lesser of two evils. But that's the predicament we find ourselves in.\n\nJohn Harris, Georgia, graduate student and organizer with No Peace, No Peach\n\nI will not be voting for Kamala Harris, even though I'm typically a Democratic voter. At this late hour, we have not seen policy change. We don't expect to see policy change. And so I am acting in accordance with that pledge that we outlined. I haven't yet decided if I'm going to vote for the third party or simply leave the top of the ticket blank and just vote down-ballot.\n\nI have no illusions that I am in the majority of people in my community. I would say a lot of folks out of fear of another Trump presidency are voting for Kamala Harris. Based on everything Trump has said and his explicitly fascist rhetoric, I can't fully blame them. The reason that I and the organizers of No Peace, No Peach went the way we did was to hopefully provide some sort of alternative between the approaches - either eschewing the Democrats altogether immediately, or saying that we should just try to work under the nicer genocidal regime.\n\nI can't blame people personally for wanting to try and mitigate harm. Trump's rhetoric around immigrants and trans rights are abhorrent. His actions to affect abortion rights have been catastrophic and lethal for many women and children across the country. But I just don't see anything from the presidency of Joe Biden or even Barack Obama that gives me any confidence that the Democrats, even in power, would do anything to mitigate harm, other than just not press the gas pedal to the floor. I will likely be responding to the outcome the same way regardless of who is elected. And that's with continued organizing.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nNerdeen Kiswani, New York, organizer and founder of Within Our Lifetime\n\nI'm not voting for either of the major presidential candidates for both the Republican and Democratic Party, not voting for Kamala or Trump. I might abstain or do a write-in, but I think abstaining, doing a write-in, or voting third-party is all pretty much a protest vote at this point, which is something that we're seeing trending a lot in the Arab, Muslim community and among people who support Palestine.\n\nI don't believe either choice represents what the people want, which is an end to the genocide, and I think that the Democratic Party has made it clear that they will continue to arm and fund the genocide of the Palestinian people. And so I can't in good conscience give them my vote.\n\n\"Constantly voting for the so-called lesser of two evils just paves the way for the greater evil.\"\n\nI think for the Republican Party and Donald Trump, it goes without saying: He's also been racist toward the Palestinian, Arab, Muslim community, even using \"Palestinian\" as a slur a couple of months ago. But Kamala is also running to the right of Trump on many things, saying that she wants to be tougher on the border than he was, saying that she wants a more \" lethal \" U.S. military. Constantly voting for the so-called lesser of two evils just paves the way for the greater evil.\n\nEither way I feel like a lot of people after the election are just going to disappear when it comes to Palestine, especially if the Democratic Party wins.\n\nWe can't rely on the supporters of either party to be long-term advocates for the Palestinian struggle. So I think it's on those of us who come from oppressed communities to band together to support each other to organize face to face. Imagine if all of the millions and billions of dollars that are pumped into electoralism are actually put back into our communities. The effort and resources and canvassing that even with people who don't have money, you know, all the time and energy they give to the Democratic Party - imagine we gave that time and energy to people who are directly suffering from American imperialism and war.\n\nKafia Haile, Georgia, a former university professor and Spelman graduate who voted for a Democrat every year since 1998\n\nI'm voting for Jill Stein. It's because my red line, the thing I care about most is Palestine. And that the U.S. should not be arming Israel when we know very clearly that Israel is committing a genocide in Palestine and with U.S. support is going after people in Lebanon and Iran and Syria. I hoped for more from Harris - I was hopeful because she's a Black woman. I recognize that as a Black woman, we have experienced so much oppression in this country that it should make us all more empathetic to what Palestinians are going through. But there's a quote from Ruha Benjamin, a college professor who attended my alma mater, Spelman College, and she said, \" Black Faces in high places are not gonna save us .\" It doesn't matter what their race is; we should be paying attention to their actions and policies.\n\nInitially what I saw were Black women in my community quietly telling each other that we weren't going to vote for Harris. I think it's because we wanted to be supportive of a Black woman, but also we were concerned that if we said something negative publicly about her, then that would draw racists out who would decide that they could start saying something racist because she's already being attacked by her community. But then the voices started to get louder, and there were more. I'm in my 40s, and I'm calling for an arms embargo. And I think that within my age group - as a college-educated, middle-class, Black woman in our 40s - this is who the Democratic Party expects to vote for them without question. But I had a conversation with another friend of my age, another Black woman, and she said, \"If you vote for Harris, can you look a Palestinian in the eye?\" And I said, \"No.\"\n\nDan Sheehan, Wyoming, author and editor at Literary Hub, immigrated from Ireland\n\nI am not voting for Kamala Harris. Personally I think the idea of voting for somebody who was a part of an administration that presided over a genocide and fully endorsed those policies and has made it clear that she's not going to break from those policies is abhorrent. I think I consider what's happened in the last 13 months to be the greatest atrocity of my lifetime. And from a moral standpoint, it feels impossible to cast a vote for her.\n\nHaving said that, I live in Wyoming. I'm conscious of the fact that I have the luxury of taking a moral stand in a state which is deep red. A large part of me thinks that if I was in a swing state, I still wouldn't be able to do it. I think I have waited and waited and waited for some small indication from the Harris camp that there would be a change in policy coming, or that they even have enough respect for the Arab American community to take their grief seriously, and I haven't seen that. But if I was in Pennsylvania, Michigan, or Wisconsin, I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you for sure, whether or not on the day I would pull the lever for Harris. It's a very dark and depressing situation that the person who has been part of an administration that has presided over a holocaust of children is the morally superior candidate of the two, and I think that's probably the case.\n\nI think there's no doubt that Trump will make things worse for vulnerable Americans, and I don't want to see those people, most of whom object strongly to what's happening in Gaza, punished. So if I was in a swing state, it's certainly possible that I would end up voting for Harris.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "Biden's Choice on Julian Assange and the First Amendment\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAssange's liberty represents that of all journalists and publishers whose job is to expose government and corporate criminality without fear of prosecution.\n\nA man holds a sign calling for the release of Julian Assange as people march and rally on May 1, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nWhen Joe Biden becomes president of the United States on January 20, a historic opportunity awaits him to demonstrate America's commitment to the First Amendment. He can, in a stroke, reverse four years of White House persecution of journalism by withdrawing the application to extradite Julian Assange from Britain to the U.S. This would be in line with the departures from Trump policies Biden is proposing on health care, environmental protection, and tax fairness. Assange's liberty represents the liberty of all journalists and publishers whose job is to expose government and corporate criminality without fear of prosecution. We need and deserve to be protected against government control of the press.\n\nRelated The Unprecedented and Illegal Campaign to Eliminate Julian Assange\n\nBy removing the 1917 Espionage Act charges against Assange, Biden would be adhering to the precedent established by the administration in which he served for eight years as vice president. President Barack Obama's Department of Justice investigated Assange and WikiLeaks for three years until 2013 before deciding, in the words of University of Maryland journalism professor Mark Feldstein, \"to follow established precedent and not bring charges against Assange or any of the newspapers that published the documents.\" Equal application of the law would have required the DOJ to prosecute media outlets, including the New York Times, that had as large a hand in publicizing war crimes as did Assange himself. If prosecutors put all the editors, publishers, and scholars who disseminated WikiLeaks materials in the dock, there would not be a courtroom anywhere in America big enough to hold the trial. Obama decided against it, knowing it would represent an unprecedented assault on freedoms Americans hold dear.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's January 2017 decision to commute the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the source for WikiLeaks's revelation that American forces in Iraq were involved in murder and torture, is another indication that the Trump Justice Department's prosecution of Assange was an aberration and not an irreversible policy to threaten journalists and whistleblowers everywhere.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAlthough the Obama administration prosecuted more journalists under the Espionage Act than all its predecessors combined, it pulled its punches in cases that would not withstand scrutiny. The DOJ investigated and wiretapped Fox News journalist James Rosen for publishing information on North Korean nuclear policy in 2013 from State Department security adviser Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, but it avoided a contentious and high-profile trial by declining to prosecute him. Kim pleaded guilty and received a 13-month sentence.\n\nBiden has signaled his intention to return the U.S. to international cooperation, revoking Trump's withdrawal from the World Health Organization, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to control Iran's nuclear program. America's return to the community of law-abiding nations would be enhanced further by adhering to judgements from the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights calling for Assange's immediate release. Exonerating Assange would also underscore American dedication to Article 19 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, among whose drafters was American former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\" (Italics mine.) Assange and WikiLeaks received and imparted information vital to the public interest, as hundreds of media outlets, legal experts, and human rights advocates have attested.\n\nIt will take courage for Biden to retract the allegation he made on \"Meet the Press\" in 2010: \"I would argue it [WikiLeaks] is closer to being a high-tech terrorist than the Pentagon Papers.\" Yet voters chose him over Donald Trump this month in the hope that he would show courage. Biden also said in 2010 that the WikiLeaks revelations had endangered the lives of intelligence sources. When WikiLeaks released the Iraq War logs and video of an American helicopter crew gunning down civilians, including two Reuters journalists, Defense Secretary Robert Gates conceded , \"Is this embarrassing? Yes. Is it awkward? Yes. Consequences for U.S. foreign policy? I think fairly modest.\" The source who provided the Pentagon Papers on America's war in Vietnam to the New York Times and Washington Post, Daniel Ellsberg, recently stated that government officials \"have not been able to identify a single person at risk of death, incarceration or physical harm.\"\n\nWhen the Nixon administration prosecuted Ellsberg for espionage in 1973, Judge William Byrne dismissed the case \"with prejudice\" against the government for infringing Ellsberg's right to confidential communication with his psychiatrist. The Trump administration has illegally obtained Assange's privileged discussions with his doctors and lawyers, tainting its case as much as Nixon's against Ellsberg. Whether Trump-appointed justices will defend the law as scrupulously as Byrne need not be put to the test.\n\nIf extradited, Assange risks a 175-year sentence in the \"Alcatraz of the Rockies,\" otherwise known as the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado. Its harsh regime would see him in permanent solitary confinement in a concrete box cell with a window four inches wide, with six bed checks a day and one hour of exercise in an outdoor cage. His fellow inmates would be \"Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, FBI-agent-turned-Russian-spy Robert Hanssen, Oklahoma City co-bomber Terry Nichols, and Mexican drug baron Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán Loera.\n\nTrump may contend that journalists and publishers are no different from terrorists, serial killers, and narcotics traffickers. Biden is free to take another view. Does he want to begin his term of office carrying the burden of that Trump legacy? Assange stands in the tradition of Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward during Watergate, Ellsberg with the Pentagon Papers, Seymour Hersh over the My Lai massacre, Sydney Schanberg on America's massive bombardment of Cambodia, plus hundreds of others who, vilified at the time, have been vindicated by the judgment of history.\n\nDoes Biden want to begin his term of office carrying the burden of that Trump legacy?\n\nThose who insist Assange must pay for his actions can be satisfied that he has already suffered severe punishment. He has spent the past 10 years under confinement: first under house arrest, then as a political refugee in Ecuador's embassy in London, and for the past year and a half in Belmarsh, a high-security prison outside of London, under conditions that U.N. Rapporteur on Torture Nils Melzer called \"psychological torture.\" Assange's health has deteriorated to the point that 117 physicians wrote to British medical journal The Lancet last February that he is suffering \"psychological torture and medical neglect.\" Expert medical witnesses who have examined Assange at Belmarsh testified at his extradition hearing in September that, if extradition proceeds, his suicide is inevitable.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, and other defenders of free expression have repeatedly called for Assange's immediate release. Ellsberg issued a warning to journalists and publishers about Assange: \"If he is extradited to the U.S. and convicted, he will not be the last.\"\n\nBiden's choice on January 20 is between the opposite courses taken by his two immediate predecessors, Obama and Trump. His conscience should tell him which to follow.\n\nCorrection: December 14, 2020\n\nA previous version of this article misstated the length of Stephen Kim's sentence. He was sentenced to 13 months in prison after pleading guilty to disclosing national security information.\n\nCorrection: December 2, 2020\n\nA previous version of this article referred to President Barack Obama's 2017 commutation of Chelsea Manning's sentence as a pardon, and stated that Julian Assange risks a 170-year sentence if extradited to the U.S. and convicted. In fact, he risks a 175-year sentence.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "How a Gay Friendly and \"Very Pro-Choice\" Trump Created the Most Anti-Choice, Anti-LGBT Administration in Generations\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nDonald Trump's Health and Human Services Department has been quietly stocked with a host of anti-choice and anti-LGBT ideologues.\n\nMaggie Wynne's career as a foot-soldier in the anti-abortion movement began in Congress, where throughout much of the 1990s she was a staffer for the so-called Pro-Life Caucus. When George W. Bush took the White House, she moved to the Department of Health and Human Services to work in the office that connected Congress and the agency.\n\nA few years later, in 2005, she became a special assistant within HHS. But as the administration neared its end, Wynne pulled off a bureaucratic move known as \"burrowing,\" in which an appointed official becomes a career government employee, with all the job protections that entails.\n\nSo when Barack Obama's HHS team arrived, Wynne was there waiting for them at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, continuing to wage her bureaucratic battles on behalf of the unborn. Career staff are famously difficult to fire, but they can be marginalized so that they can't stall an agenda. In 2011, HHS got her out of the agency temporarily by \"detailing\" her to the staff of the House Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights Subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., the most zealous right-to-lifer in the House and co-chair of the Pro-Life Caucus. The reassignment was part of an effort to keep her away from the bidding process for federal funding for anti-trafficking work, as Wynne was known to favor the U.S. bishops who fought a new Obama-era requirement to offer victims access to abortion services.\n\nShe managed to involve herself in the process regardless, and, in 2015, Wynne's department was reorganized to strip most of her authority; she was left directing a relatively small trafficking office, helping to determine whether foreign-born victims qualified for public services. Less than a year later, with the punditry convinced Hillary Clinton would become the next president, Wynne finally called it quits. For the next several months, she went to work for the Knights of Columbus and was the pilgrimage director at the St. John Paul II National Shrine in Washington.\n\nBut then Donald Trump won.\n\nWynne quickly came back to public service, becoming an early and influential member of the HHS transition team. A woman who'd just recently been a low-level functionary within the agency now had influence over staffing it at the highest levels, and, until the new director arrived, she was effectively running ORR. She got herself named Counselor for Human Services Policy, one of the most powerful positions within the department.\n\n\"The Counselor is the point person for the secretary and the agency on all major policy and program decisions,\" explained Jeff Hild, who served under Obama as chief of staff for HHS's Administration for Children & Families. \"It's a crucial position, and pretty under-the-radar as it's not public-facing. But the people who have held that job are some of the most experienced and respected in the field of human services. During the Obama administration, the Counselors had decades of experience prior to taking on the role, including as senior staff in Congress and leaders at prominent think tanks.\"\n\nWynne is none of that. But she does have one critical qualification: She is zealously opposed to abortion - and a slew of her allies in the movement soon poured into the building.\n\nWynne, in many ways, is the story of the Trump administration: a fringe operative who fought her battles far from the center of power, suddenly washed into a position of extraordinary authority. Across the administration, officials like her have been leaving their marks, but in the Health and Human Services Department, the lurch toward the evangelical, right-to-life movement has elevated what were once sleepy bureaucratic backwaters into prominent culture war battlefields.\n\nActivists carry boxes of petitions calling for Scott Lloyd, director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Trump administration to reverse their position of interfering in women's access to reproductive health care, before the start of a House Judiciary Committee hearing concerning the oversight of the U.S. refugee admissions program, on Capitol Hill, October 26, 2017 in Washington, DC.

There's Teresa Manning , a former National Right to Life Committee lobbyist who is overseeing federal family planning services, and Tom Price, who led the Department up until October and boasted about as anti-choice a record as a legislator could.\n\nActivists carry boxes of petitions calling for Scott Lloyd, director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Trump administration to reverse their position of interfering in women's access to reproductive health care, before the start of a House Judiciary Committee hearing concerning the oversight of the U.S. refugee admissions program, on Capitol Hill, October 26, 2017 in Washington, DC.\n\nAnd then there's Scott Lloyd , another objectively unqualified appointee leading the Office of Refugee Resettlement. He formerly worked as an attorney for Knights of Columbus, a leading anti-abortion group, and once argued that \"contraceptives are the cause of abortion.\" Wynne, who spent seven years toiling in ORR, overlapped with Lloyd at Knights of Columbus before coming back to join Trump's transition team.\n\nIt was the Office of Refugee Resettlement that made international news by attempting to block a 17-year-old immigrant in its custody from getting an abortion. In late October, after being barred for a month by Lloyd, the unaccompanied minor - known in court filings as Jane Doe - was finally able to end her unwanted pregnancy. She was detained in a privately run shelter funded by ORR - which had implemented a new policy forbidding shelters from \"facilitating\" abortions. Except Jane Doe wasn't relying on the shelter to pay for the procedure, or even to transport her there. She just needed permission to leave temporarily.\n\nIn court filings, the administration wrote that it has \"strong and constitutionally legitimate interests in promoting childbirth, in refusing to facilitate abortion, and in not providing incentives for pregnant minors to illegal cross the border to obtain elective abortions while in federal custody.\" As Jane Doe waited for her abortion, government agencies forced her to obtain counseling from a Christian-affiliated crisis pregnancy center and to look at an ultrasound.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union ultimately prevailed in court for Jane Doe, but the underlying ORR policy remains in place, and in mid-December the ACLU filed suit on behalf of two more undocumented minors - Jane Roe and Jane Poe. A federal judge ruled in their favor last week . In court filings several days later , Lloyd argued that ORR shouldn't let even a minor impregnated through rape end her unwanted pregnancy because perhaps she'd experience \"additional trauma\" as a result.\n\nBrigitte Amiri, an ACLU attorney representing the minors, told The Intercept that ORR started to interfere with abortion access in March by working aggressively to dissuade teenagers, giving them unwanted religious counseling, and even contacting their parents against their express wishes. \"When all that fails, as it did with Jane Doe, then they just say you can't get an abortion,\" she said.\n\n\"They just flout the law and the Constitution. They're utterly, utterly brazen.\" - Brigitte Amiri, ACLU\n\nThese problems, Amiri emphasized, didn't all start with Trump. \"Under Obama, millions of dollars flowed to shelters that had objections to abortion, and if the minor asked for one, they could say well you can't stay here but we'll contact the federal government and they'll transfer you somewhere else,\" Amiri said. \"It was totally stigmatizing, it delayed access to abortion, and it made the procedure more risky. I had meetings with ORR's directors - Eskinder Negash in the early years and Bob Carey towards the end - and I said you need to overhaul these policies. But they would not budge, so we sued them .\"\n\nThis is, in many ways, the defining contrast between the last administration and the current one. The Obama administration, sometimes to its credit, other times to its great discredit, tried to walk a fraught middle ground. In the case of HHS, it meant partnering with faith-based groups in ways that sometimes made accessing reproductive health care more difficult for youth and victims. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has abandoned all pretense of compromise.\n\n\"They just flout the law and the Constitution,\" said Amiri. \"They're utterly, utterly brazen.\"\n\nUnder the Obama administration , former ORR director Robert Carey said, the office had a deliberate process for crafting policy that involved convening stakeholders, drafting revisions, and providing opportunities for feedback. That process had been inherited from the Bush administration, and every administration before it, since the advent of the modern bureaucracy. Under Trump, new ORR policies - including the rule banning grantees from \"facilitating\" abortion - have been issued through hastily drafted emails and memos.\n\nThe new rules are issued with such speed that nobody, apparently, even reviews them for grammar. According to court filings, on March 30, two days after becoming ORR director, Lloyd emailed his team announcing that ORR-funded shelters \"should not be supporting abortion services pre or post-release. Only pregnancy services and life-affirming options counseling.\" Another email dated March 4 and sent by then ORR-Acting Director Kenneth Tota said that if unaccompanied minors \"may be involved in an abortion\" then ORR-funded shelters were \"prohibited from taking any action that facilitates an abortion without direction and approval from the Director of ORR.\"\n\nWhen she first learned the federal government was prohibiting Jane Doe from leaving her shelter to access an abortion, Amiri, the ACLU lawyer, thought, \"No way, they can't do that.\" But then, she told The Intercept, \"I realized, oh, they can do it, and they will do it, until a court stops them.\"\n\nAside from appointments , many advocates have raised concerns with specific actions HHS has taken over the past year - actions signaling that vulnerable populations, including undocumented immigrants, victims of trafficking, and LGBTQ individuals - may be subject to further discrimination. Indeed, \"vulnerable\" is one of the Centers for Disease Control's newly banned words.\n\nWhen the HHS published its draft strategic plan for FY2018-2022 this past fall, it removed all mentions of LGBTQ individuals and ethnic minorities that had appeared in the Obama-era version. The Trump draft plan also rewrote the federal government's definition of life, emphasizing that life begins \"at conception.\"\n\nThen, in early October, the Trump administration issued new rules rolling back the Obama-era mandate that employers include birth control coverage in their health insurance plans. (A judge issued a nationwide injunction against this in mid-December, and second judge issued a preliminary injunction last week.)\n\nThe Trump administration also announced in October it would be soliciting public comment on ways to potentially reduce HHS regulations governing faith-based groups - a bright red flag for those worried about discrimination.\"Agency regulations already contain religious exemptions that are too expansive,\" wrote the Coalition Against Religious Discrimination in a letter sent to HHS dated November 24.\n\nIn response to its solicitation, HHS received nearly 11,000 comments. But it has only made 80 of them public , those that largely reflect support for anti-abortion policies and disapproval for rules requiring groups to serve transgender individuals. \"HHS should not solicit comments for rule-making from thousands of child welfare experts, health experts, and everyday Americans and then hide those comments from public view,\" said Julie Kruse, a federal policy advocate at Family Equality Council.\n\nIn 2015, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and other faith-based groups protested ORR for its new rule designed to prevent, detect, and respond to unaccompanied children who suffered sexual abuse. Rather than worry if the level of protection offered to minors was adequate, the groups charged that ORR had fallen short of \"protecting existing and prospective grantees, contractors, subgrantees and subcontractors with religious or moral objections.\" Specifically, they protested requirements to offer victims access to emergency contraception and abortion, even through referrals.\n\nPut differently, two years ago, some faith-based groups called on the federal government to exempt them from providing victims with comprehensive reproductive services. Today, the government itself is led by officials like Wynne and Lloyd who forbid grantees from providing youth with comprehensive reproductive services, even when those grantees have no religious or moral objection to doing so.\n\nAs the Supreme Court currently reviews a case that could make it easier for states, businesses, and organizations to discriminate based on religious or moral objections, the stakes for LGBTQ individuals are particularly high.\n\nEarlier this year when HHS released its annual national survey on older adults, it announced it would no longer be asking questions about gender identity - effectively preventing transgender adults from identifying as a subgroup on the questionnaire.\n\n\"We know the history of HIV and AIDS, we know what happens when the government is not willing to name a group of people who are most affected by a public health issue,\" said Harper Jean Tobin, the director of policy at the National Center for Transgender Equality. \"For years we have been trying to document and address the serious health disparities transgender people face, and we can't do that when the government refuses to name them as a population.\"\n\nOn December 15, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published an open letter rejecting the legitimacy of transgender identities. \"We come together to join our voices on a more fundamental precept of our shared existence, namely, that human beings are male or female and that the socio-cultural reality of gender cannot be separated from one's sex as male or female,\" the letter reads.\n\nNot to be outdone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is under the authority of HHS, made global news itself that day with reports that it had developed a new list of verboten words . Along with \"vulnerable,\" words such as \"evidence-based,\" \"transgender\" and \"fetus\" no longer exist, as far as the agency is concerned.\n\nWhat the department does or does not do influences others across the country. \"It's really important to us that HHS send a signal to the states that federally funded agencies need to serve all youth,\" said Kruse of the Family Equality Council. According to the group's data, 19 percent of foster youth over the age of 12 identify as LGBTQ, and same-sex couples foster at four times the rate and adopt at six times the rate of opposite-sex couples. Despite 111,000 foster children waiting to be adopted annually, and an opioid epidemic that has exploded that population, seven states have passed bills that allow adoption and foster care agencies to discriminate against LGBTQ youth and prospective parents. Three of those bills passed in 2017.\n\n\"We're very concerned about placement of LGBTQ youth into non-affirming homes or into faith-based group homes where they might be subjected to conversion therapy,\" said Kruse.\n\nAnd it's not just youth. HHS currently requires all medical facilities receiving Medicaid and Medicare to honor the visitation preferences of their patients, regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. HHS may soon decide to allow federally-funded hospitals and health clinics to turn away LGBT patients or their loved ones. \"State and local housing agencies that administer programs, like housing vouchers or loans to assist with purchasing a home, could [also] refuse to offer those services to LGBT older adults and older same-sex couples,\" warned a new report from the Movement Advancement Project.\n\nA Manhattan playboy, who campaigned as friendly to the LGBTQ community and has dubbed himself \"very pro-choice,\" is now leading the most extreme anti-choice, transphobic, and anti-gay administration in modern history. The movement's prayers have been answered.\n\nCorrection: December 29, 2017, 11:30 a.m. A previous version of this article misquoted the letter sent from the Coalition Against Religious Discrimination to HHS. The letter said that agency regulations contain religious exemptions that are too expansive, not expensive.\n\nTop photo:Scott Lloyd, director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is sworn-in during a House Judiciary Committee hearing concerning the oversight of the U.S. refugee admissions program, on Capitol Hill, October 26, 2017 in Washington, DC.\n\nWAIT!

Hate crimes are increasing globally, and federal law enforcement here in the U.S. has come under fire for not taking this threat seriously. For decades, violence committed by ring-wing extremists has been characterized as 'lone wolf' attacks when in reality, the ideology that ties these crimes together points to a very clearly well-thought out ideology and coherent movement.\n\nA new series from The Intercept, called \"The Threat Within\" takes a deep dive look into federal terrorism prosecutions in the United States since 9/11. That review found that anti-terrorism laws were applied to only 34 out of 268 right-wing extremists prosecuted for crimes that fit the Justice Department's definition of terrorism.\n\nJim Axelrod: With no specific penalties on the books for domestic terrorism, mass killers like Timothy McVeigh face charges of using a weapon of mass destruction or Dylan Roof who faced murder and weapons charges.\n\nJS: It seems clear from this assessment, that the understanding of what terrorism means to federal prosecutors in this country is foreign terrorism. Because since 9/11, those same terrorism laws were applied to more than 500 alleged international terrorists.\n\nThe number of people killed since 9/11 by so-called Muslim extremists is slightly higher than those killed by right-wing extremists, but the amount of violent acts in total committed by right-wing extremists is actually three-times higher. That's according to the U.S. government own statistics.\n\nTrevor Aaronson, the lead reporter on this Intercept project writes, \"By almost exclusively charging international extremists as terrorists, the Justice Department inflates the perceived threat of those actors, compared to those with right-wing domestic ideologies.\" Trevor added, \"This double standard has had powerful consequences for how the FBI and other law enforcement agencies allocate counterterrorism resources, leading invariably to international threats being prioritized over domestic ones.\"\n\nWhile all of the media fear-mongering and debate over who gets labeled a terrorist continues on in our post 9/11 reality, a new fear has seemingly gripped the FBI.\n\nThe massive protests in Ferguson, Missouri following the murder of Michael Brown was the starting point for the FBI to decide that a new player was on the scene. Two men involved in the protests at that time were labelled something entirely new under the FBI's counter-terrorism division. The public learned about what that term was when a secret FBI memo was revealed. That memo warned of a rising, \"black identity extremist\" movement.\n\nSheila Jackson Lee: The report under your jurisdiction - \"black identity extremists.\" It is interesting to me that you are opposing individuals who are opposing lethal force similar to the attack on Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King on COINTELPRO. But there seems to be no report dealing with the tiki torch parade in Charlottesville chanting \"Jews will not replace us.\" Why is there an attack on black activists versus any reports dealing with the alt-right and the white nationalists? Can you answer that question quickly?\n\nJeff Sessions: I'm not aware -\n\nSJL: Are you planning on investigating that?\n\nJS: My colleague at The Intercept, Alice Speri, investigated the six instances where this label, \"black identity extremist\" was applied. That article is called \"The Strange Tale of the FBI's Fictional 'Black Identity Extremism' Movement.\"\n\nHere's Alice Speri to talk about what she found.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nAlice Speri: We know very little about when the FBI started using the \"black identity extremism\" term. We know very little about what it means actually and kind of, what it was based on. The first we, as the public, heard about it was in the fall of 2017 when an internal intelligence assessment was leaked to Foreign Policy.\n\nAmy Goodman: The memo was dated August 3rd, 2017 only days before the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia where white supremacists, Ku Klux Klan members, neo-Nazis killed an anti-racist protester, Heather Heyer, injured dozens more. But the report is not concerned with the violent threat of white supremacists. Instead, the memo reads \"The FBI assesses it's very likely black identity extremist perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence.\"\n\nAS: In the FBI report, the FBI lists six examples of what they call \"black identity extremists\" and the earliest one they referred to is the case of Olajuwon Davis and Brandon Orlando Baldwin who were two Ferguson protesters. And in my story, I really went back to this case because even though it seems the FBI retroactively applied the label to them, that's really where black identity extremism as an ideology was born on the heels of the Ferguson protests. And the reason why I say that is because in Ferguson, we really saw the beginning of this Black Lives Matter movement. That was a movement for police accountability to end police racism. It was a different kind of black activist movement from the ones the FBI had known earlier on. So up to that point, the FBI had actually talked about black separatists and surveilled a different kind of black activists, but they were now looking to expand their surveillance and their targeting to a much broader group of people.\n\nProtesters chant: I said, indict, convict, send that killer cop to jail. The whole damn system is guilty as hell! I said, indict -\n\nAS: So, Olajuwon Ali Davis and Brandon Orlando Baldwin were two young black men, who started going to the protests in Ferguson after Mike Brown was killed. They didn't have a long history of activism. They were just protesters like many others that just took to the streets spontaneously. The FBI had informants on the ground in Ferguson and I actually was in Ferguson covering the protests while they were happening.\n\nAS [in Ferguson]: The first night the National Guard has arrived in Ferguson. I've not actually seen any of them right now. There's still police. We have no curfew tonight, but even so, police are attempting to disperse people -\n\nAS: And there was at the time, a lot of fear and a lot of even, what people thought was paranoia, but now we know it was justified. Like a lot of, a lot of people suspicious that they were being watched and kind of aware that they could be under surveillance. And we know now, that that was absolutely the case.\n\nSo, shortly after the protest started, these two guys befriended essentially two FBI informants that were at the protests and that's what set off a series of events that I, in my story, characterized as basically an entrapment of these two guys that were ultimately convicted of buying what they thought were bombs.\n\nSo, when the FBI report was revealed to the public in 2017, a lot of people had a lot of questions, including members of Congress. And they questioned both the FBI director and Jeff Sessions who at the time was attorney general. And there's this memorable exchange between Congresswoman Karen Bass.\n\nKaren Bass: Do you believe that there is a movement of African Americans that identify themselves as \"black identity extremists?\" And what does that movement do?\n\nJS: Well, it'd be interesting to see the conclusions of that report, but I'm aware that there are groups that do have an extraordinary commitment to their racial identity and some have transformed themselves even into violent activists.\n\nAS: Hearing that from Jeff Sessions, to me, summarize what's so ironic about this whole black identity extremism notion because of course black identity extremism doesn't exist. But on the other hand, we also have a very real white identity extremism that for years and decades, federal officials have you know, underlooked and underplayed.\n\nKB: Is there a term or a report on white identity extremists? You mentioned you are familiar with black people who identify with their racial identity.\n\nJS: Yes, but it's not coming to me at this moment.\n\nKB: Not coming to you?\n\nJS: It's um -\n\nKB: Certainly a group such as the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nJS: Yes, and then the skinhead movement, but there's a racial identity white movements that have been identified.\n\nAS: We absolutely have a white supremacist violence problem in this country, and we're just now starting to talk about it a little bit more openly. So, the big question around the \"black identity extremism\" report is why is the FBI wasting resources going after a movement that doesn't exist while we have all this real violence, these real threats that we're just ignoring for the most part?\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nAS: The FBI's response to questions about the \"black identity extremism\" report has being fairly unsatisfactory, I would say. Director Christopher Wray testified in Congress twice about it and really didn't answer any questions. I mean, the FBI says that they don't police ideology. And of course, they don't police based on race. That's the law. But they didn't really offer a lot of clarification about where this label came from. Wray actually at some point said -\n\nChristopher Wray: I'd have to look at the statistics that you saw. I can tell you that we have our, in our domestic terrorism program, that last time I looked, we have about 50% more white supremacists, what the category that we would call white supremacist investigations, than we do in the black identity extremist category.\n\nAS: And then later he admitted he didn't know of any investigations of black identity extremists at all, which is really telling, I think. The other thing that I find ironic is that the FBI has long said that [it] has learned a lesson after COINTELPRO that that was a shameful chapter of its history. Comey has talked about it before Christopher Wray has talked about it more recently.\n\nCW: I think I and everybody in the bureau recognizes the COINTELPRO problems, and that means different things to different people, as one of the darker moments in the FBI's history. And it's something we're not proud of but it also is something that we've learned from. And during some of the same time period, there's a lot that the FBI did that we can all be proud of.\n\nAS: So, I think the FBI is kind of undersurface admitting to the mistakes of the past while at the same time doing things that are very similar. I don't think they've actually come to terms with that history and learned a lesson here. What we're seeing is really a repetition of their old ways.\n\nActivists who are targeted are very much aware of that history. It's not new which is not to say that it isn't important to uncover as much as we can about it. You know, back in the 70s, the FBI had a racial intelligence office. Today, as far as I know, they don't by that name, but we did some reporting recently that showed that the FBI actually has what they call a \"race paper.\" We have no idea what's in it, but just the fact that they have a \"race paper\" is just extremely problematic. So, I think what's fascinating about the story is that it reminded people, those that didn't remember already, that there is a history to this and it's ongoing and it's very much part of a government push back against people that have questioned government policy for a long time and very legitimately.\n\nThere were only two prosecutions of so-called \"black identity extremist.\" One failed when a judge dismissed all charges against the man in question. And the only successful one was the prosecution of these two Ferguson protesters on what I would say was an entrapment case.\n\nThe Intercept's analysis revealed that the Justice Department only applied anti-terrorism laws against 34 out of 268 right-wing extremists that it could've prosecuted for terrorism crimes and at the same time, which I think is also telling, they also targeted 17 environmental and animal rights activists with anti-terrorism laws. My colleague Alleen Brown wrote a really fascinating piece about this. One of the points here is for the longest time the FBI thought of environmental and animal rights activists as the greatest domestic terror threat, which is so ironic, you know, on the heels of Charlottesville and on the heels of the Pittsburgh massacre and so many other white supremacists violence that we've seen that they actually went after a movement that never killed anyone.\n\nOne of the big problems with the \"black identity extremism\" label, in addition to the fact that the ideology itself doesn't exist, is that this threat assessment was carried out by the FBI's counterterrorism division. So you're immediately equating this notion of this black identity extremist as a domestic terrorist. You've painted these people as terrorists with all of the political implications of the term.\n\nThe second, and I think even most threatening aspect of this is that these assessment reports are created by the FBI and then handed out to police departments across the country with very little follow-up on how police actually use them. And we know a lot of police departments have problems with biased policing and discriminatory policing. We know that black people in particular are extraordinarily vulnerable to police violence. And if on top of that you create the idea that these people were protesting for very very legitimate reason, if you create this notion that they're terrorists, you put their lives at risk. As one of the people I interviewed for the story, I think put it very well, is that when you create this idea that somebody is a terrorist and a threat to law enforcement, you authorized police to shoot first and ask questions later, which police already do with black people often enough. This puts lives at risk.\n\nJS: Alice Speri is my colleague at The Intercept. She's a fantastic reporter.

I'm afraid you're actually a 4.183.\n\nJS: These days it often feels like we're living in the prelude to a not so distant dystopian science fiction future. My next guest Cory Doctorow says science fiction is a barometer for any given moment.\n\nCory Doctorow: Science fiction doesn't predict the world, but the science fiction that's popular in any moment gives you this incredible insight into what's on the world's mind, what it's fears and aspirations are for technology.\n\nJS: A science fiction author, activist, journalist and blogger, Cory has a new book out. It's called \"Radicalized.\" The book is broken up into four novellas taking the social, political, technological, and economic issues of our time and imagining them in a not so far off future, or reality.\n\nFrom copyright right protections to radical privatization, Cory Doctorow offers a provocative analysis of the role that technology plays in our lives and what it means for our future. He also has a lot to say about the newly passed European Copyright Directive and its alarming implications on the internet as we know it.\n\nCory Doctorow, welcome to Intercepted.\n\nCD: It's sincerely a real pleasure. Thank you.\n\nJS: Do you envision the world that you are creating in this book as something that's happening in the near or distant future?\n\nCD: The four novellas are not directly linked. They're not all in the same future but they're all pretty close by. Each one is not meant to be predictive. Like I hate the idea that science fiction writers are fortune tellers. As an activist, I have to believe that the future is contestable, right? If it was predictable, I just like wouldn't bother getting out of bed. So, they're meant to be interventions rather than predictions, things to make people angry or inspired or to take action. So, you know the first story \"Unauthorized Bread,\" it's about a refugee in subsidized housing where all the appliances are designed to extract maximum revenue from her by making sure she only toast authorized bread in the toaster and so on.\n\nLameece Issaq [from audiobook]: The Boulangism cloud had burst and that meant there was no one answering Salima's toaster when it asked if the bread she was about to toast had come from an authorized Boulangism baker which it had. In the absence of a reply, the paranoid little gadget would assume that Salima was in that class of nefarious fraudsters who bought a discounted Boulangism toaster and then tried to renege on her end of the bargain by inserting unauthorized bread with consequences ranging from kitchen fires to suboptimal toast.\n\nCD: And if that wasn't bad enough the hedge funds that own these appliance companies go under because of their financial engineering and then everything stops working.\n\nLI: The toaster wasn't the first appliance to go. That honor went to the dishwasher which stopped being able to validate third-party dishes the week before when Disher went under.\n\nCD: And when they start jailbreaking things that gets good to them and they feel like they're finally mastering their technology.\n\nLI: She tried to search her fridge for \"Boulangism hacks\" and \"Boulangism unlock codes\" but appliances stuck together. Kitchenaid's network filters gobbled up her queries and spat back snarky \"no results\" screens, even though Salima knew perfectly well that there was a whole underground economy devoted to unauthorized bread.\n\nCD: But then that puts them in harm's way because when the companies come back then they can detect them with their telemetry, with their analytics.\n\nLI: \" Do you think we'll get in trouble? With a building, I mean? They own the appliances.\" Salima shrugged. \"They were getting a share of the money we spent before for the special bread and soap and so on. But with both companies bankrupt, they won't be expecting any new money. Now, if the companies do ever come back from bankruptcy and still no one here is using their products,\" Nadifa nodded, \"that would definitely be trouble.\"\n\nCD: Once those companies come back from bankruptcy then these people are in harm's way because the telemetry will detect their tinkering and that's not fictionally, it is literally a felony under Section 12 of the DMCA punishable by a five-year prison sentence to remove copyright protection systems from digital devices.\n\nAnd so, you know, it's meant to make people think harder about the fact that now we have these tamper-resistant, illegal to tamper with systems in our cars, and in our pacemakers and voting machines and so on, and that this is spreading very quietly, but throughout every piece of technology that we use and making it off limits to security auditors as well. And then, there's the story, Masque of the Red Death which takes its title from this famous Edgar Allan Poe story and it's about a rich prepper who's in his bunker with all of his friends.\n\nJS: Wait, first explain the term \"prepper.\"\n\nCD: \"Preppers,\" people who believe that the end of civilization is coming and they build these spider holes, you know, these sometimes they're very luxurious and sometimes it's a cavern in the basement. It's a recurring motif in old science fiction. Heinlein loved to talk about people who had you know, bomb shelters that were lovingly equipped for the future and so on.\n\nStefan Rudnicki [from audiobook]: Before the event, Martin Mars spent a lot of time trying to game it out. Would the collapse be sudden catching him off guard and unprepared having to fight his way to his fortress as he escaped from Paradise Valley and into the Desert Hills? Or would there be some kind of sign, a steady uptick in civil disorder and failures from the official powers that counted down to the day giving him a chance to plan an orderly withdrawal to Fort Doom? This was important. If Martin spooked and ran for Fort Doom too early, he'd have to slink back to the city and his job after however many days he'd spent bunkered up. Not only would it be humiliating but it would cost him credibility with the 30 people he'd invited to survive the apocalypse with him. Once Fort Doom was buttoned up for the duration, he'd need to be a credible leader or he could lose control. Who the fuck knew what would happen next?\n\nJS: What's the ultimate fear that is driving the prepper?\n\nCD: Yeah, I try to make it explicit. It's that he sits down and he kind of reasons it out. He says, look the market is a thing that separates the worthy people from the unworthy people and as we've had better information systems, we've had things like a sort of mating that has made the worthy people even more worthy. No longer does the genetic sport who just has the mutation that makes them into a job creator have to settle for you know, a doe-eyed milkmaid. He can hunt out his equal somewhere in the world by finding them and then, and eventually like everyone else becomes kind of redundant, surplus to needs and we'll use automation to get rid of them. But then he reasons, you know, if I were one of those people who were surplus to needs and I woke up one day and figured that that was what was going on, I'd go out and you know, start building guillotines on the lawns of people like me, right? And so, he's kind of done the game theory here and said if I were surplus to requirements, I wouldn't take it lying down. I won't expect anyone else to do it. And so I'm waiting for them to come for me.\n\nSR [from audiobook]: Martin knew that the event was coming. The fact was the world just didn't need all those people anymore. And the market had revealed that fact, squeezing them into tinier, more uncomfortable places. He wouldn't tolerate it if he was in their shoes. He'd be the first one to build a guillotine. And because he was Martin, it would be an awesome guillotine. So absolutely badass and over-engineered with a turbocharger and a self-sharpening blade because that was Martin all the way. It's why Fort Doom was the incredible place it was.\n\nCD: This guy's got this whole Mad Max theory about how when civilization collapses, he'll wait for the 'poors' to devour each other and then he'll emerge and become a kind of, warlord with his group of excellent heavily-armed uber-mansion. And what he discovers is that we all have this shared microbial destiny and that the real heroes of the revolution of the ones who are getting the sanitation working not the ones hiding in the bunker, but he discovers that by getting cholera.\n\nSR [from audiobook]: Martin felt his own guts clenched his own bowels turn to water. He had Cipro and other broad-spectrum, last-resort antibiotics, but he hadn't replaced them yet this year and a bunch of them were expiring soon. He'd read that their efficacy would start to fall off a cliff when that happened. After a deliberate bioweapon attack, cholera was one of the fears that kept him up at night. He had lots of guns, but you can't shoot germs.\n\nJS: One of the elements that I really loved about Max Brooks, \"World War Z\" the book - the film was a terrible adaptation of that book - and you touch on this too and I find it such a rich point of inquiry that if you strip away all of the things that make unearned wealth the way that it is in our society, who are the most valuable people here? They're the people that know how to work with their hands, with their physical labor.\n\nAnd as you do here as well, it's like, you know, you can be the wealthiest kingpin lawyer in the world but when the fucking apocalypse comes like you're going to be hoping that those contractors that you hired to do stuff on your lawn are around to help you. I mean that is the reality of, we're living in that kind of world now where it's like it could break and a lot of people are going to be in deep shit. They don't even know how to unclog their toilet.\n\nCD: Yeah. I'm a big fan of this Anglo-Canadian science and political writer Leigh Phillips who wrote a great book called \"Austerity, Ecology and the Collapse Porn Addict.\" That's about this kind of bright green communitarian or socialist future as distinct from the degrowth agenda. He's like if your future starts with getting humanity down to 3 billion people, that's a lot of corpses lying around. And you know, we know that any event that reduces the population of humanity to 3 billion will create such scars and trauma and disease and what have you and leave you with a skeleton crew too small to work the systems that it could be a tipping point into you know centuries of barbarism.\n\nThe only way to a green future is up and through, you know. Kim Stanley Robinson writes about this that we should get people into big cities away from natural habitats, into high-density environments where we can share you know, resources and so on. That's the most efficient future we have. It's trying to counter that pastoral kind of Tory-bougie version of the future that like someday we will attain a kind of paradise where we all wear leather aprons and work our small holdings and craft through the days. That's a vacation but it's not a future.\n\nJS: There are those people that take to the extreme, that have their bunkers, that are collecting their medicines, and their Bitcoin and their weapons, etc. But even on just a slow growth level, the radical privatization agenda in this society where you have some communities that are going to have privatized fire fighting forces, private security, private access to water supply. That is the real world now and in a way it is - the preppers take it kind of, to the extreme - but it's already seeping into every aspect of our life, right?\n\nCD: You know, Larry Lessig, he talks about the world being influenced by like code, what's technologically possible? Law, what's legal? Norms, what's lawful? And markets, what's profitable? And if you think of like say The Mont Pelerin Society as having used those four tools to try and change us, one of the changes has been this normative shift, right? Through market and legal mechanisms we've arrived at a normative moment in which it can sound reasonable to say \"What makes you say that you have the right to clean drinking water? If you can't afford it, what entitles you to it?\" It's a kind of tautological thing. The thing that entitles you to it is affording it and if you can afford it, you know, you're entitled to it.\n\nIt's this idea that we don't have a shared destiny. And you know, that's part of the point of the Masque of the Red Death is that giant mountains of corpses are a public health problem‚ like leaving aside all of the ethical questions about giant rounds of corpses - giant mountains of corpses will kill you dead by seeping into the water supply and by, you know, vectorizing all kinds of diseases that emerge in rotting flesh and so on. It is not nice to be surrounded by rotting corpses. And I think that you know, in the like kind of, late 20th century, early 21st century climate debate where we've arrived at, at least among some elites, is this belief that climate change is probably real but given enough mountaintops and harrier jets, you can just sort of build a you know, big fence around your high ground and just cross-breed your children by supersonic jet. All the dying poor people will be so far down the slope that you won't even have to smell them. And this is just clearly wrong, right, just as like a factual matter, that's not going to be a nice existence.\n\nJS: I want to ask you about a couple of companies and get your read on the role they play in our life and our society. But also, like what you think their ultimate end game is. I want to start with Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook.\n\nCD: I think you can draw like a little two by two grid-like venture capitalists like to draw and on one axis, you have how much of a control freak that company is and on the other one, you have how much they want to spy on you. So like, you know, Apple: total control freaks, but they don't want to spy on you. They just want you to only like be trapped in there walled garden. Google: totally want to spy on you. Don't care where you are because they figured out how to spy on you wherever you happen to be. Then you have like free and open-source software Ubuntu, GNU, Linux: don't want to spy on you, don't care how you do it, anywhere you want is fine with them. But then you know, in the worst quadrant is Facebook. Everything has to happen in their walled garden and they're going to watch everything you do. I mean, they figured I watch you when you're not in the walled garden, but Facebook's goal is to consume the web, surround it, and close it and then spy on you even more effectively.\n\nJS: What do you think about where Twitter is right now?\n\nCD: So Twitter's biggest sin is its engagement tools, the way that it does recommendations and engagement. It's the same problem with the YouTube algorithm. There is like one reliable way to engage people and that's to make them angry. Now that said, you know, as an activist tool, there's things I like about Twitter. It is unlike Facebook. It's linkable. So everything on Twitter can be seen even if you're not a Twitter follower, everything public on Twitter. You don't have to have a Twitter account. So you can link in and out of Twitter. Now Twitter has experimented with contracting that over time. The other thing about Twitter is that there are times when your adversaries will be stupid enough to pick fights with you that will allow you to play to their gallery and point out the mistakes in their argument, right? It's not an entirely pleasant way to spend your day, but you know, I've been fighting on this new European copyright directive.\n\nCNN: What you can watch online is likely about to change. That's because of a sweeping overhaul of copyright rules just passed by the European Parliament.\n\nCD: And the controversial clause is Article 13. And it moves online services copyright liability from the current regime, which is that your users get to post stuff and if it infringes copyright and someone tells you about it, you have to take it down to one where you are expected to know a priori what it whether or not something, a user posts is an infringement and block it. So it's filters, right? You're gonna have to put up content ID style filters for everything. These are very expensive. Google's content ID filter which just filters video and just on behalf of a small clutch of rights holders cost a hundred million dollars to build and maintain over the last ten years. Doing this for all the photos, all the videos, all the rights holders, all the texts, all the audio, there's really like five companies in the world that can afford it and they're all American. So this snuffs at the European tech sector at the stroke of a pen.\n\nBut you know, there are lots of other problems with filters. So, there are no penalties built into the regulation for people who falsely claim copyright in order to ensure that some things can never be posted. So, whether that's being a griefer and just going in and posting the collected works of Shakespeare to make sure no one can ever quote Shakespeare until someone at WordPress or at Twitter goes in and plucks all of those entries out one at a time. Or whether that's you know, the king of Thailand who has previously used copyright claims to take down videos of demonstrators being brutalized by the Thai police. You could stop them before they ever started. You could just upload that and it would never show up. The European Union has said you must make sure that copyright violation doesn't happen. You should make sure that you don't accidentally block things that are copyright infringements. The difference between must and should is pretty obvious. And so, you're going to get lots of weird situations like, you know, your kids first steps are video recorded while there's a record playing in the background and the music means that you can't upload the video. Or that demonstration where the police become violent the canonical photograph of it has a bus ad in the background and Corbis owns the stock art and so that photo could never be posted.\n\nJS: How do you think that we're going to be targeted in the future with ads? The reason I'm asking that, you know, one of the things that we discovered a few years ago - I mean, we at The Intercept - when we were looking at Wi-Fi sniffers and IMSI-catchers, New York City now has these kiosks in the subways and you can go and you can look, you know. They're interactive, you know. You can if you can figure out where your train is and what's going to be late and it's you know, a map and all that stuff. But also you have this offer of you know a free Wi-Fi now everywhere. And when your device hops onto that Wi-Fi network, you're giving quite a bit of information to that terminal and the question is where does that data go and what is it, you know, what can it be used for?\n\nAnd the other thing we found when we were playing around with some toys that the smart people here built - engineers - that if you walk around and your phone is not connected to a Wi-Fi network, but it is seeking out a Wi-Fi connection, it is broadcasting the entire list. I mean, you know this but I'm just explaining - the entire list of every network you've ever been on.  So it's searching for a hotel in Tokyo, your grandma's house in Vermont and your work, the cafe you've been at. It tells an enormous amount about you. When you look at the way Minority Report for instance took Philip K. Dick ideas, in the Minority Report film each person is targeted individually with like holographic advertisements catered to them specifically. It greets you by name. How do you see this stuff happening going forward?\n\nCD: I don't know how we're going to get targeted but I have a theory about how we could fix it. You know, if firms were required to internalize even a small amount of the cost of breaches, they would be a lot more cautious about the data they collected and stored.\n\nCBS: What could be one of the biggest data breaches ever to hit a major retailer. This morning, Home Depot is investigating whether its customers credit and debit cards were exposed. It's not clear how many stores or shoppers could be involved but experts say it could be larger than the breach that affected 40 million shoppers at Target last year.\n\nCD: Home Depot breached 80 million credit cards and paid 60 cents per breach in the class action settlement. They should have paid like a half of a percent of the total value of all the real estate holdings of 80 million people. Like there's nothing inevitable about the way that we hoard this data. It's a choice that was taken and it's a choice that could be reversed and it's a choice that exacts a high cost on the wide society and that cost could be reversed, could be pushed back onto the people who are exerting it. But we would need evidence-based policy for that to happen. And so I'm not saying OK, we can't change it until we fix capitalism but I'm saying that part of the project of fixing capitalism is changing this and part of the project to changing this is fixing capitalism. They're things that have to run in parallel and you'll only get so far with other kinds of interventions until you fix the way that markets and inequality are functioning right now.\n\nJS: I mean that that's such a great challenge to all of us to end on. Cory Doctorow, I want to thank you so much for joining us.\n\nCD: Jeremy, it really has been an absolute pleasure. What a treat to meet you and to come up here to The Intercept. Thank you.\n\nJS: Cory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist, journalist and blogger. He is also the co-editor of Boing Boing. You can find that at boingboing.net . His latest book which contains four short stories is called \"Radicalized.\" You can follow Cory on Twitter at @ doctorow .\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nJS: We're gonna end today with some music from the Washington D.C. rock band Priests. They have a new record out this Friday, and it's called \"The Seduction of Kansas.\"\n\nYou're probably thinking, \"Why Kansas? There's nothing seductive about that place at all.\" Sorry for those of you listening in Kansas.\n\nWell, you'd be completely, totally wrong - especially if you said that to Priests front-person, Katie Alice Greer, who loosely based the title on journalist Thomas Frank's 2004 book, \"What's the Matter with Kansas?\" Here's Frank:\n\nThomas Frank: What the book is about is an examination of populist, conservative culture. Conservatism has invented a fake populism, a way of looking at class that instead of talking about class as an economic phenomenon, it discusses class as a cultural phenomenon.\n\nJS: For Greer, so much of our current discourse on labor rights, and social struggle around issues like a woman's right to abortion, are deeply rooted in the history of Kansas itself.\n\nAnd I should mention: Priests are a notably prophetic band, even unintentionally. Their last album \"Nothing Feels Natural\" was released exactly one week after Donald Trump's inauguration, felt like a direct response to the shocking, nascent Trump presidency, despite the fact that many of the songs were written months, even years, in advance.\n\nWith that in mind, here is Katie Alice Greer as she looks back on that work two years now into the Trump presidency, and also how history and mythology influenced Priests' new record, \"The Seduction of Kansas.\"\n\n[\"Jesus' Son\" by Priests plays.]\n\nKatie Alice Greer: My name is Katie Alice Greer and I am the lyricist and front-person of the rock band Priests.\n\n[\"Jesus' Son\" by Priests plays.]\n\nKAG: I have always had a fascination with politics. I've always had a fascination with power and how that is wielded.\n\nI am from a suburb of metro Detroit. I moved to Washington D.C. to go to American University when I was 18 surrounded by so many people who were on a track to go work on the Hill. I thought: oh, maybe that's how I want to be involved in politics. And I actually interned on the Hill both on the finance side and the congressional side. Being up close to how electoral politics works and how change happens with elected officials helped emphasize for me that the social change that I truly believe in is rooted in movements of people and people power. And eventually I graduated and decided well, I think I'd want to focus on making music.\n\n[\"Modern Love / No Weapon\" by Priests plays.]\n\nKAG: We've been a band for about eight years and our original voice in writing songs was very deliberately critical of the liberal establishment in place. A lot of times people were confused. We have a song called \"And Breeding\" and one of the last lines is \"Barack Obama killed something in me. I'm going to get him for it.\"\n\n[\"And Breeding\" by Priests plays.]\n\nKAG: People were like, that's weird. He's the best which people still say nowadays. I get it. He was a much preferred alternative to Trump but a through-line that a lot of people are missing in that is that the liberalism that has been in place for so many decades, whoever is president, has all been a building block to where we are right now. Like these things are all very connected. Sometimes when we do \"And Breeding,\" you know, depending on the day, I'll sing \"Barack Obama killed something in me\" or \"Fuck Donald Trump and his white supremacy.\" I'm still not happy with a lot of what Obama did but there's something that feels really cathartic about yelling \"Fuck Donald Trump\" into a microphone on stage. I recommend everyone try it at some point.\n\nTrump being an office doesn't change the fact that I am deeply critical of a lot of liberal policies and am hoping that we can find ways when Trump is out of office not to go back to liberalism, business as usual but to create something new that seems to be the only way forward is kind of moving into that unknown space.\n\n[\"Pink White House\" by Priests plays.]\n\nKAG: \"Pink White House\" is a song on our last record what was meant to be sort of a fun meditation on this bizarre romanticized mythology we have in this country of the beauty of choice. One of my favorite songs is Devo's \"Freedom of Choice\" sort of about a similar idea, satirizing being able to have anything you want.\n\n[\"Freedom of Choice\" by Devo plays.]\n\nKAG: I've never seen someone in Congress at this point, who I was actually like \"Wow, this is someone who's kind of like me,\" like and watching some of the newer leaders who have been elected especially in this past cycle like Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She's my age. I worked my way through college. I wasn't a bartender. I was a cocktail waitress at a place in D.C. where like, you know, lots of people who had a lot of power were coming into like unwind after work. So, I know what that feels like and feeling like this has nothing to do with what I want to do with my time. But like this is what I have to do, you know, can you or can you not start the change from within the system or do you have to just completely destroy the system and build a new one? Like I saw Ocasio-Cortez is friends with another band that were friends with, Algiers, and it was like that's crazy to me that you know, someone in Congress knows about bands that we're friends with. It seems stupid but it's like, it does make you feel like oh, right, this was ostensibly what our government and representational democracy was supposed to be about having people who understand the world as you understand it, legislating new policies that will be good for the world around you.\n\n[\"The Seduction of Kansas\" by Priests plays.]\n\nKAG: Our new album is called \"The Seduction of Kansas.\" The title track is largely inspired by a Tom Frank book from the early 2000s called \"What's the Matter with Kansas?\"\n\n[\"The Seduction of Kansas\" by Priests plays.]\n\nKAG: And all the fast food chains and different little details I'm throwing out in there are mostly things that were actually born in Kansas. The Koch brothers are also from Kansas. I think one thing that stuck out to me reading that book was how Kansas you know, turn of the last century was really a breeding ground for a lot more leftist socialist movements and then in the 1980s, the Summer of Mercy was a radicalizing stadium event, I think for people who just hated abortion and women's reproductive rights. And it's become very conservative in a lot of ways.\n\nNewscaster: If the scorecard was sheer numbers in attendance, the pro-lifers were the hands-down winners in this weekend's abortion rally Super Bowl in Wichita, Kansas. Those here hope this marks the end of legalized unrestricted abortion in America. The Summer of Mercy campaign could indeed turn the tide in the abortion battle in America, but the real test will come this fall in Washington D.C. at the U.S. Supreme Court. Reporting from Wichita, Kansas, I'm -\n\nKAG: I have always been really fascinated in perceptions of things, so American mythology, let's call it. Even this idea of \"Make America Great\" like that slogan itself has so much meaning imbued in it suggesting that this country was great at some point for people. That's a very specific group of people like white, male Christians when you really get down to it. Why do we gravitate towards these certain narratives? What is convenient to leave out? The songs are just little short stories and character sketches reflecting on that.\n\n[\"The Seduction of Kansas\" by Priests plays.]\n\nKAG: I try to not think too much about being an artist under the Trump presidency versus being an artist before. It all still feels like a continuation of the same work, asking the same questions. Like I think art is about the antithesis of passivity and we need that right now more than ever. I think just trying to keep eyes on the horizon and moving forward and figuring out what is the actual work that needs to be done? And for us, that work is making music that we care about and carving out the world that we want to live in with the people that we want to live with.\n\n[\"Good Time Charlie\" by Priests plays.]\n\nJS: That was Katie Alice Greer of the band, Priests. Their new record, \"The Seduction of Kansas\" is out on Friday. She spoke to our producer Jack D'Isidoro.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nJS: And that does it for this week's show.

But Voters Have One Chance To Save It.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe campaigners who successfully convinced voters to support ranked-choice voting last year submitted an application to trigger a \"people's veto.\"\n\nMaine's voters took an extraordinary step during last year's November election, passing a referendum that would make the state the first in the nation to use ranked-choice voting for statewide elections.\n\nUnder this voting system , voters rank candidates on their ballot instead of just voting for one. If no one gets a majority of votes in the first round, next-preference votes are counted until a candidate gets most of the votes. Several U.S. cities currently use ranked-choice voting, which both eliminates the \"spoiler effect,\" helping minor party candidates, and ensures that no one can be elected without the support of the majority of the voters.\n\nBut the state's Supreme Court earlier this year issued a non-binding opinion that parts of the referendum law violate a provision of Maine's constitution that allows statewide officers to be elected by plurality. The court, notably, did not state that using ranked-choice voting for primary and congressional elections would violate the constitution.\n\nThe issue was kicked to Maine's legislature, which could make the technical fixes needed to make the law constitutional.\n\nLast week, the legislature took the unusual step of delaying the law's execution until 2021. Republicans largely supported the delay while Democrats were split. Independents opposed it.\n\nLawmakers will have until the 2022 elections to amend the law to make it constitutional or else face a full repeal. The vote was widely interpreted in the state as an attempt by the legislature to kill the measure.\n\nThe state's current governor, Republican Paul LePage, first took office in a three-way race in which he got only a plurality of the vote in a contest against Democratic and independent candidates. Last year's ballot initiative was, in part, a response to his election .\n\nThe campaigners who successfully convinced voters to support ranked-choice voting last year are not giving up. Four days after the legislature's vote, the Committee for Ranked Choice Voting Maine, or RCV Maine, submitted an application to the secretary of state to trigger what is called a \"people's veto.\"\n\nThe people's veto is a Maine-specific procedure that allows voters to authorize a referendum to overturn laws recently passed by the legislature. In order to trigger the veto, campaigners must collect 10 percent of the votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election. In this case, that's 61,123 valid signatures. The tricky part is that the law requires that these signatures be collected and submitted within 90 days of the adjournment of the legislature - which gives RCV Maine until about early February to get it done.\n\nKyle Bailey, RCV Maine's campaign manager, told The Intercept that the group is aiming to get enough signatures by the end of this year.\n\nIf they succeed, voters will use ranked-choice voting in Democratic and Republican primaries for congressional races and the governor's race in June 2018. They will also use the people's veto to weigh in on whether to continue using the ranked-choice voting system. Bailey believes being able to try out the new voting system will make it more popular. \"I think voters exercising more voice and more choice by having the power to rank candidates will only intensify their support for this electoral change,\" he said.\n\nDiane Russell, a former Democratic state representative and a 2018 gubernatorial candidate, supports the veto drive. \"We are doing everything we can to have petitions on time for Election Day, but we will not know for some time,\" Russell wrote on Facebook. \"We will keep you posted.\"\n\nMaine voters have used the people's veto 29 times between 1910 and 2010. Most recently, the veto referendum was used to overturn a tax reform law.\n\nTop photo: State representatives recite the Pledge of Allegiance as the Maine Legislature reconvenes Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017, at the State House in Augusta, Maine.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "In Maine, Ranked-Choice Voting Was a Reaction to GOP Wins. Susan Collins Might Be Its First Victim.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIn Maine, ranked choice allows voters to choose their favored candidate, even if they're a third-party and have no shot.\n\nThe Senate career of Susan Collins is hanging by a thread in Maine, yet the lifeline she previously had to cling to won't be there for her.\n\nFor years, Republicans relied on the state's independent streak to syphon votes away from Democrats and toward third-party candidates. But Maine voters approved ranked-choice voting in 2016, making the state the first in the nation to use the procedure for federal elections. Massachusetts and Alaska voters are considering implementing ranked choice in tonight's elections, and a number of municipalities in states around the country already use the system for local races.\n\nRanked-choice voting allows a voter to choose their favored candidate, even if they're a third-party candidate with no shot, without risking accidentally electing somebody they despise. To do so, a voter can rank their candidates, rather than vote for just one.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe system has come under criticism from across the political spectrum, especially in Maine. The system faced legal challenges earlier this year from opponents who sued Gov. Janet Mills over the \"confusing\" nature of the process. As journalist Shawn Griffiths wrote in July, however, that's hardly the case: \"according to FairVote , 75% of all Maine voters -including Democrats AND Republicans-surveyed said they found voting under RCV to be 'easy.'\"\n\nRepublicans in Massachusetts have been opposed to the commonwealth's ballot measure. A committee formed in August against ranked choice voting included state GOP member Anthony Amore, who told Commonwealth Magazine in August that the system \"sounds beautiful in a mathematical equation but practically speaking it's disastrous\" because of the small differences between some candidates.\n\nLisa Savage, an unenrolled independent with ties to the Maine Green Independent Party, ran her Senate campaign explicitly asking voters to rank her first in their preference and Sara Gideon, a Democrat and the speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, second. Under ranked-choice voting, if no candidate wins an outright majority, the lowest vote-getter's votes are redistributed and so on, until there is a winner.\n\n\"Certainly we all would like to see Susan Collins retire,\" Savage explained to The Intercept.\n\nEstablishment politicians in both parties have been hostile to ranked-choice voting and have tried to block it from going into effect, as it allows third-party candidates to compete in elections without being tarred as spoilers.\n\nAn Emerson College poll conducted between October 29 and 31 showed Gideon with a 48 percent to 42 percent lead over Collins, and 61 percent of supporters of both Savage and independent Max Linn, polling at 5 percent and 1 percent, respectively, would back Gideon on their second choice.\n\nCollins entered the Senate in 1997 as one of Maine's two independently minded Republican women senators alongside Olympia Snowe. The junior senator survived in the New England state as a politically savvy member of the GOP in a liberalizing region by touting her independence and reasonableness, but the tension between her party and constituents met its match in her support of President Donald Trump.\n\nGideon's run focused as much on portraying Collins as out of touch with Mainers as it did on health care and a higher minimum wage. The incumbent's vote for Trump Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 and Amy Coney Barrett last week was a decisive moment in her career, allowing Gideon to paint Collins as more beholden to the president than her constituents.\n\n\"Lisa Savage is absolutely right,\" said Kat Calvin, founder and executive director of Spread the Vote. \"Ranked-choice voting is actually something that a lot of us want.\"\n\nCollins recognized the danger the runoff system presented to her candidacy early on, telling the New York Times on Sunday that she was fighting for a clear majority on Election Day to head off any chance of second choices being a factor in the race.\n\n\"My goal is to get 50 percent on Election Day, and ranked-choice voting would not come into play,\" said Collins. \"So that's what I hope.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe Maine system was put in place partly in response to former Republican Gov. Paul LePage winning the governorship twice without a majority. He took advantage of third parties to govern with 37.6 percent and 48.2 percent of the vote in the 2010 and 2014 elections. In 2018, incumbent Sen. Angus King won a clear majority on the first round, and the second choices did not trigger. Savage told The Intercept that she is a fan of the procedure and finds it best for democracy.\n\n\"As a school teacher - I just retired from 25 years of teaching school - I used to use it for things like the all-important day before vacation,\" said Savage. \"What movie shall we watch? Because if you just do a first-past-the-post on a decision like that, you are very likely to pick a movie that does not have majority support, and you don't want that.\"\n\n\"It's a much better structure for expressing the will of the majority of voters,\" she added.\n\nThe race was one of the most expensive in the country and the most expensive in Maine's history. Data from the Center for Responsive Politics shows that Gideon raised a staggering $68,577,474, while Collins took in $26,511,555. The amount of cash in the race was reportedly so high , with a total of $120 million spent when outside groups were included, that both candidates struggled to spend what they raised in the waning weeks of the campaign. As BuzzFeed News reported last week, the media spending has saved a number of local media outlets.\n\nGideon met Savage in the town of Brunswick earlier Tuesday, where the two shared a friendly elbow bump.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LisaForMaine/status/1323690996446711809\n\nSavage said that although she and Gideon have political differences, she shares the desire to see Collins gone.\n\n\"We want to be perceived as being on the let's-retire-Susan Collins team,\" Savage told The Intercept. \"We don't want confused Democrats thinking, Oh she's a spoiler for Sara Gideon. You know, in a ranked-choice voting race, I really can't be a spoiler. But people are still kind of buying into the false dichotomy.\"\n\nNathan Bernard, a journalist at the Mainer News Co-op and longtime statewide political observer, said that in his view, Savage's votes show that the Democratic Party should be looking to Maine for guidance in winning elections going forward.\n\n\"Ranked-choice voting allows you to vote your conscience and brings disaffected people into the electoral process,\" said Bernard. \"The system allowed Savage to run an issue-based campaign focused on Medicare for All and a Green New Deal, while still promoting her cohort to rank the less progressive Gideon second. If Democrats pushed to expand ranked-choice voting, they would grow the Democratic electorate and actually win elections like tonight in Maine.\"\n\nSavage's move to campaign in part on the decision showed strength of character, Spread the Vote's Calvin told The Intercept.\n\n\"I think Lisa Savage here is showing that she is in solidarity with the party, that she really wants the vote of people's voices to be heard, that we don't always have to run in direct opposition and animosity with other candidates,\" said Calvin.\n\n\"I think that what Lisa Savage is doing shows a lot of class,\" Calvin added. \"It shows a lot of integrity.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), flanked at left by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA), speaks during a news conference about  the Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act, on Capitol Hill, May 7, 2014 in Washington, D.C.\nDrew Angerer / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe word \"choice\" is rhetorically powerful in American politics. Who could be opposed to it?\n\nBut choice is a recent entry in the lexicon of language, used to convince working and poor people that our problems are of our own doing, so we - not the government or corporations or any larger force in society - must fix them ourselves.\n\nLike the phrases \"personal responsibility\" and \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps,\" the rhetoric of choice seduces us into turning frustration with our lot in life towards competing for a piece of an ever-shrinking pie. It tells us not to be angry at our boss, elected officials, the wealthy - whoever is holding us down - but to simply demand better choices .\n\nIt's no coincidence that liberals have come to embrace conservative rhetoric and policies - Bill Clinton's welfare reform , 1996's Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, is an early example - while often leading the charge for choice. Obamacare, originally a conservative policy, is meant to expand the number of choices in the insurance marketplace. \"My guiding principle is, and always has been, that consumers do better when there is choice and competition,\" Barack Obama said in his initial pitch to Congress. Charter schools , the centerpiece of the \"school choice\" movement, are most prominent in cities dominated by the Democratic Party, like Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.\n\nLikewise, corporate leaders, the wealthy, and conservatives peddle choice as an end in itself. The word \"choice\" is used thirty-three times in former House Speaker Paul Ryan's most recent proposal to cut and privatize Medicaid and Medicare. It's at the core of Donald Trump's expansion of the Veterans Choice Act, which further privatized veterans' health care. \"We're going to have choice. There's no more waiting on lines for twelve weeks, and you can't get the doctors, you can't get what you need. So, we're going to have choice,\" Trump said upon announcing the act. Billionaire Education Secretary Betsy DeVos once compared choosing a public school to choosing between a restaurant and a food truck for lunch.\n\nObviously, who doesn't want choices? That's what makes the rhetoric of choice so seductive. But the pitch is always tied to forfeiting our ability to join together and make collective demands. Its use is part of a strategy to replace other freedoms - to struggle together for better pay and benefits, to demand that the wealthy pay more in taxes, to feel safe in our neighborhoods, to hold elected school boards accountable - with a handful of limited individual choices, none of which address the roots of our problems.\n\nAll the while, choice is conflated with freedom, concealing the fact that who has money and power matters more than the choices on offer.\n\nFor example, the conservative Cato Institute recently argued that if conservationists really want to protect resources and wildlife, they should demand that the federal government lease more public lands. That way, conservationists could simply choose to lease the land they want to protect. (No matter that ExxonMobil's annual revenue is $269 billion, while the largest US conservation group takes in a mere $171 million.)\n\nCharter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated, reveal an even more dangerous result of the choice obsession. According to proponents, they provide parents with more choice over which school to send their children.\n\nLike traditional, neighborhood schools, some charter schools are effective, while many aren't. Some provide services not otherwise available, like dual-language immersion, while many don't. Yet that's not the real problem: charter schools are a thread that, once pulled, unravels the very concept of public education itself.\n\nEach new charter school siphons funding from public school districts, forcing cuts at already struggling neighborhood schools. Charter schools cost Oakland, California's school district $57.3 million per year, meaning $1,500 less in funding for each student who attends a neighborhood school. Some families with the time and know-how to enroll their kids in a charter school might escape the sinking ship, but only at the expense of other students.\n\n\"Radical self-interest and self-preservation is the rotten, racist core of the whole ideology of school choice. There is no 'we' in this: The entire point is to give individual kids an advantage,\" writes Howard University professor Natalie Hopkinson.\n\nBy peeling us off one by one, the rhetoric of choice erodes otherwise widespread support for universal rights and programs.\n\nThose fighting for abortion rights as part of a reproductive justice framework, particularly women of color, have long argued so. As the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Health Collective put it , the \"conditions necessary for women to make reproductive decisions about their lives [are] opportunities to work at living wages, opportunities for affordable quality education, responsible and accessible public services such as good health care, quality schools, and accessible and affordable child care, freedom from personal and state violence, and environmentally safe communities.\"\n\nWhen the right to abortio n is framed as a choice, enough people are left out of the struggle , particularly poor women and young people, that almost everyone ends up losing what should be a universal freedom.\n\nIn short, the rhetoric of choice disguises our ability to demand justice .\n\nWe should keep this in mind in the growing struggles over public education, health care, affordable housing, and more, whenever anyone - Republicans or Democrats, education reformers or opponents of Medicare for All , CEOs or centrist pundits - makes an argument for corporate-friendly public policies on the basis of \"choice.\" They're trying to make us forget about the kinds of freedom and rights that can only be won together.\n\nJeremy Mohler is a writer, meditation teacher, and member of the National Writers Union.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

(James Glossop / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer has warned the British people that the October budget is going to be \"painful.\" He has once again blamed the Conservative Party for reckless economic mismanagement, which has left a £22 billion black hole in the nation's finances.\n\nIt is undoubtedly true that successive Conservative governments managed the UK economy particularly poorly, with consequences for productivity, output, and equity. But the idea that the UK government is facing some sort of fiscal black hole that will be impossible to fill without drastic cuts to public spending is simply absurd.\n\nAs economists from across the political spectrum have been pointing out for decades, government spending in a wealthy economy like the UK is not constrained over the short term by tax revenues.\n\nFirst, the government is capable of issuing new debt to cover expenditure. As long as that debt is used for productive purposes - like educating the workforce, expanding physical and social infrastructure, and promoting decarbonization - it will be recouped over the medium- to long-term.\n\nThis debt-financed productive investment is precisely how the UK successfully reduced its debts following World War II. Higher taxes on the wealthy and big businesses also meant that the wealth accrued from economic growth was shared much more equally than it is today.\n\nSecond, the British state controls the UK's monetary system. After the banks nearly crashed the economy in 2008, the Bank of England pulled out all the stops to protect the interests of asset owners. Interest rates were slashed and vast sums of money were pumped into the financial system.\n\nNow, higher interest rates mean government borrowing is much more expensive, and taxpayers have to foot the bill. But it doesn't have to be this way. The government could manage inflation in much more targeted and effective ways through, for example, taxing the big corporations that have been profiteering through the cost-of-living crisis, or by more directly controlling how commercial banks issue credit.\n\nInstead, the British state continues to rely on the blunt tool of higher interest rates, which lead to higher bills for working people struggling to make ends meet as well as higher interest payments on government debt.\n\nIn fact, the legacy of quantitative easing (QE) means that taxpayers are sending billions of pounds to commercial banks every year. In 2023, the government had to pay £44 billion to cover the Bank of England's costs, most of which went straight to commercial banks. Over the long term, the bill for QE is likely to top £100 billion.\n\nIn short, and as I recently argued in Tribune , there is a lot the government can do to deal with the economic problems currently facing the nation. Austerity is a choice - not a necessity. So, why do Starmer and Rachel Reeves continue to tell the nation they have to impose it?\n\nFor many decades now, one of the favored tactics of neoliberal policymakers has been to claim that, in the modern globalized economy, the nation-state is too powerless to effect meaningful economic change. If a government tries to raise taxes or impose new regulation, wealthy individuals and corporations will simply leave.\n\nAs former chair of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan once put it, \"Thanks to globalization, policy decisions in the US have been largely replaced by global market forces.\" The state, in other words, is powerless.\n\nThis argument, however, always seems to go out of the window as soon as capital finds itself in crisis.\n\nWhen the banks needed a bailout after 2008, the state was there to provide it. When asset markets failed to recover in the wake of this crisis, the state once again stepped up. When big businesses needed rescuing during the pandemic, the state was there to provide support. In that period, the state was even powerful enough to shut down the entire economy.\n\nWhenever anyone has attempted to resist the exercise of its power, similarly, it has become very clear quite how powerful the state really is. Whether imprisoning peaceful protesters or imposing brutal anti-union legislation, the British state has had no problem exerting extreme force against any groups that pose a threat to the status quo.\n\nThe problem is not that the modern state lacks power in a globalized economy. The problem is that the state's power has been captured by vested interests, and is therefore only ever used to support them.\n\nThe idea that the state is powerless nonetheless allows politicians to publicly justify their failure to address deep-seated economic and social problems, while using every mechanism at their disposal to satisfy the interests of their allies and donors behind the scenes.\n\nLobbyists are deeply embedded within the current Labour government and are using this power to promote their clients' interests. Despite Reeves claiming that her aim would be to significantly reduce the amount the government was spending on private consultants, KPMG recently won a £223 million government contract - the second largest contract the firm has ever won.\n\nStarmer would never admit it, but he has the power to raise public spending and investment, increase taxes on the wealthy and big businesses, and properly regulate big businesses and financial institutions. Instead, he will impose renewed austerity on those least able to bear it. Not because he has to, but because he wants to.\n\nGrace Blakeley is a staff writer at Tribune , and the author of Stolen: How to Save the World from Financialisation .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFeminism is having a moment in American pop culture. Celebrities are clamoring to identify with a word that was more likely to be used as an insult in mainstream conversation just a decade or so ago, and products as wide-ranging as exercise routines and absorbent underwear are marketed to millennial women under the guise of \" empowerment .\"\n\nAmong many feminists, the growing cachet of feminism is touted as evidence that women's rights are expanding in America and that more people are getting on board with a feminist program, with Hillary Clinton's campaign as the first female presidential nominee by the Democratic Party often cited as evidence. On a recent Sunday afternoon walk through Brooklyn, I saw no fewer than three \" The Future is Female \" t-shirts, the thin, sans-serif letters peeking out from beneath denim jackets.\n\nThe implied message is that our future female rulers will be an improvement from the previous ones - more gentle, more benevolent - by virtue of their biology. (It should perhaps be noted that the original t-shirt was designed in tribute to a lesbian separatist slogan rediscovered in photo archives from the 1970s, and that a portion of its proceeds are donated to Planned Parenthood.)\n\nBut this growing strand of feminism - the one that wants to build the foundation of women's rights on the idea that women are more virtuous humans than men, and that wants to buy t-shirts proclaiming it - is seen by many as a move in the wrong direction. Jessa Crispin's new book Why I Am Not a Feminist: A Feminist Manifesto is a searing critique of contemporary feminism's focus on individual choice and \"self-empowerment\" at the expense of systematic radical change and collective action.\n\nCrispin takes aim at feminists who believe power can be located in the decision to watch one television show over another, to consume one product over another, or to use particular words instead of others. She calls this position \"choice feminism,\" and describes it as \"the belief that no matter what a woman chooses, from her lifestyle to her family dynamic to her pop culture consumption, she is making a feminist choice, just from the act of choosing anything. The idea is that under the more rigidly patriarchal past, women's choices were made for them. So simply by choosing anything at all, you are bucking the patriarchy and acting like a feminist.\"\n\nThis idea causes us to imbue mundane actions that provide personal gain with outsized political value. Taking a bath? You are taking the time to care for yourself in a world that is hostile and exhausting for women, so this must be a feminist act. Pursuing a promotion at work? You know that women are still underrepresented in positions of power, so you are doing something to change the world for the better by improving your own station in life. Having a nontraditional wedding ceremony? You are making a statement about which patriarchal traditions you support and which ones you don't, so you are contributing to incremental institutional change.\n\nThese mistaken beliefs lead to an inflated sense of accomplishment while distracting from the collective action needed to produce real change that would have a lasting effect for the majority of women.\n\nCrispin argues that \"the actual obstacles and inequalities that women face are mostly obstacles only for the poor - middle-class women and above can now buy their access to power and equality.\" She takes the mainstream feminist movement to task for focusing primarily on inclusion and adopting the traditionally masculine values of patriarchal capitalist society that prioritize paid labor as a source of freedom and empowerment, rather than mind-numbing work that dominates our time and provides too little compensation, as it is for the majority of people.\n\nSpecifically, Crispin criticizes feminism for being \"a fight to allow women to participate equally in the oppression of the powerless and the poor.\" She cites the \"tendency of contemporary feminism to see women in power as an inherent good,\" using as an example the mainstream feminist support of Clinton as a presidential candidate, a politician who has spent her career dismantling social welfare programs and supporting violent and imperialist American efforts abroad.\n\nWhile many of Crispin's criticisms hit the mark, the book sometimes falls short because it fails to place the blame squarely on the systems of capitalism and patriarchy, frequently aiming its sharpest insults at feminists themselves and failing to acknowledge the ways that corporate retail and media have co-opted a movement in the hopes of profiting off of it - rather than the leaders of the movement itself intentionally selling out or making a conscious decision to compromise their ideals.\n\nAfter rightly criticizing the feminist movement for historically prioritizing the interests of educated, white, middle-class women and focusing on reforming the system rather than rebuilding it, she concludes that \"it's feminism's fault that [oppressive wage labor and the single-earner nuclear family] are the two options we have available to women,\" and \"the problem is that feminism has offered women so few alternatives to give their lives meaning and value.\"\n\nBut that's not quite right - it's capitalism's fault, and it's capitalism that offers us so few alternatives, and blaming anyone or anything else just keeps us from recognizing the source of our oppression and effectively fighting against it.\n\nCrispin also assumes some sort of central brain trust that powers a \"feminist movement\" and holds the reins, retaining the ability to direct the priorities of the movement on one path or another, rather than the much more frustrating reality: that feminism is a slithering mess of sometimes conflicting strands that are often unaware of one another and always powered by individuals whose choices and strategies are shaped and constrained by the very systems they're fighting against.\n\nAlthough the presumed intent of the book is to draw in young women who may feel frustrated with current feminist trends, or to inspire a conversation within the feminist movement that would ultimately result in its reorientation to the left, Crispin risks alienating her intended audience by engaging in the same tactics of shame and criticism that she disparages \"social media feminists\" for taking part in.\n\nAt the beginning of the book, she seems to blame women for all manner of behavior, from removing their body hair to consuming misogynist messaging in music and film and marrying abusive men - without acknowledging that not all women have the same amount of power to opt out of these decisions in a capitalist patriarchal society, and that our decisions are shaped by those relative positions of power.\n\nPerhaps just as dangerously, Crispin employs arguments that risk being used in service of the right-wing goals. Her arguments against empowerment rhetoric and surface-level identity politics are often employed by those who are far less interested in justice as a universally sought goal, and some might mistake her criticisms of mainstream feminism as supporting their positions.\n\nFor example of what that looks like in practice, we can look to a recent article published by the American Conservative called \" Womanhood Redefined \" by Natasha Vargas-Cooper. She doesn't cite Crispin, but in the vein of Crispin's argument, Vargas-Cooper criticized the mainstream feminist movement for being preoccupied with individualist empowerment at the expense of collective gain. But she used that line of critique to make a reactionary attack on trans people.\n\nVargas-Cooper, who self-identifies in the article as \"a union organizer who embraces traditional leftist causes like fighting poverty and income inequality and demanding universal access to medical care and child care,\" does a disservice to her own political interests by employing anti-trans rhetoric, continually referring to trans women as \"men who decide to become women,\" and asking questions that seem almost designed to appeal to conservative fears of shouldering the financial burden of disempowered communities, such as, \"Who is to pay for these procedures and this journey of self-actualization?\"\n\nIt is not wrong to interrogate the goals and strategies of other progressive movements, or to question the implications of trans identity for our beliefs about gender essentialism or how to build a strong feminist movement divorced from biology - or even to criticize the elevation of Caitlin Jenner, a millionaire with the ability to avoid most kinds of suffering and discomfort, to the level of people's champion . But it's not necessary to attack other oppressed groups in order to engage in this dialogue, as though the achievement of self-determination by trans people somehow detracts from the ability of cis women to understand the ways that their bodies figure into gender discrimination.\n\nAlthough Crispin and Vargas-Cooper share many of the same frustrations with contemporary feminism (such as emphasis on language over action, or the trappings of power over collective material gain), their conclusions are very different. Vargas-Cooper wrongly concludes that \"To achieve the realistic goals of feminism and trans assimilation, the two groups do not need to correspond or get along. In many ways, they're better off without each other.\"\n\nThe oppression of women and the oppression of queer and trans people are linked - gender essentialism, the act of defining a group of people by their biology and dictating how they can behave accordingly, lies at the root of both. The fact that trans Americans are four times more likely to live in poverty than the average American means that they are also stakeholders in the \"traditional leftist causes\" that Vargas-Cooper claims to embrace.\n\nCrispin, on the other hand, argues that any sort of meaningful change requires us to understand the ways that patriarchy and capitalism work together to pit us against each other - and it is these entire systems that need to be torn down and built anew.\n\nShe points out the ways that, for example, the mainstream feminist movement has often looked to the criminal justice system to provide solutions to the problems of misogyny, by pushing for harsher mandatory minimum sentencing in punishment for sexual assault - even though we know that the criminal justice system is inherently unjust, disproportionately punishing poor people and people of color, and we should instead be pushing for its abolition.\n\nAchieving structural change on this scale requires coalitions, and it requires an understanding of the fact that the same structures that benefit from maintaining gendered hierarchy benefit from white supremacy. Crispin's book is a necessary contribution to the effort to push contemporary social justice movements further to the left and to weave an understanding of class politics into modern identity-based movements in order to build a radical politics of solidarity.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLast weekend marked the sixtieth anniversary of the Treaty of Rome , the European Union's foundational agreement.\n\nThe party for the occasion was all set, except for one thing: EU elites were confused about which tune to play, caught between celebrating past conquests and focusing on the word of the moment - speed. Which is to say, a Europe going at two or more speeds, depending on who we're asking.\n\nToday Europeans need neither empty exercises in nostalgia nor discussions about who should go down the fast track and who down the slow one. The key question is not how fast we should go, or in what vehicle (be it a more federal one or a more inter-governmental one), but what direction the European project is headed and who it's leaving by the wayside.\n\nThe celebrations in Rome were marked by the publication of a white paper in which European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker established various possible scenarios for the EU's future - keep the current rhythm, step on the accelerator, apply the brakes, or go into reverse. Not a word was offered on the substance, the policies, that would define these routes. Nothing on youth unemployment, the migration crisis, cuts, violence against women, or climate change. In an umpteenth display of ignorance, Europe's elite closed their eyes to the crises affecting the continent and the concerns of those experiencing them.\n\nIgnoring its population's real problems, the EU continues to be the most important mechanism for generating euroscepticism in Europe today. But does this owe to the European elites' disconnect, to their being trapped in an ivory tower? Or is it a strategy for diverting attention, for avoiding having to speak about the problems that impact millions of people every day? Or, still less, having to recognize their failure to resolve them?\n\nWith its aggressive foreign policy, the European Union has intensified conflicts around the world and contributed to fresh waves of forced migration. With its police management of its borders, it has turned the Mediterranean into an enormous mass grave , asylum into an exception and immigration into a danger for whoever is fleeing from bombs and misery. With its institutional xenophobia, the EU has normalized the discourse and proposals of the new radical right formations and the xenophobic populism that are today spreading across Europe, a specter of the past now Le Pen- izing minds across the continent.\n\nHollowing out sovereignty and democracy, and distancing political decision-making from the people subject to its legislation, the European Union has fed a general malaise, the series of Brexits and the rise of exclusive, identitarian nationalisms. With successive treaties, the EU has incorporated neoliberalism into its central normative corpus. Its collaboration with TTIP and CETA trade agreements has driven through lex mercatoria over human rights. Through their management of the financial crisis, European elites have placed sovereign debt and the sustainability of pensions under threat, while increasing inequalities, poverty, and unemployment.\n\nIn under ten years, the EU has progressed from a proclaimed ambition to \"reform capitalism\" to leading the plundering of the resources, the withdrawal of the freedoms, and the dispossession of the rights of millions in Europe and around the world. Today the European Union is world neoliberalism's leading and most advanced political instrument. Yet none of this appeared in Juncker's White Paper, or in the discussions and celebrations in Rome last weekend.\n\nEverything points to the \" Rome declaration \" - so solemnly signed last Saturday - formalizing the 'Europe à la carte' which Merkel's Germany and other central and northern EU countries have dreamed about for years. The issue is not only that some member states will be able to advance more quickly than others along the road to European integration (something that was happening already - as we see from the eurozone and the Schengen area), but that these different rhythms will be applied to a pick-and-mix set of concrete questions.\n\nThere will be more Europe on some matters, in others, the brakes will be applied, and in some regards, there will even be less Europe. And we should be clear, the empty words that usually mark this kind of declaration will not be the only thing that matters. Europe à la carte has a very concrete, restricted menu: one focused on inviting members to join in with \"more Europe\" in the fields of security and defense.\n\nFor EU elites, this is the great (and apparently only) strategic stake for the coming period: while we cannot offer prosperity or democracy, at least we can provide security in the face of growing threats across the world. And to this end, they will drive forward \"strengthened cooperation\" among the member states who want it, creating a European defense fund, a common military and arms industry, or greater police and military coordination. They will do so in order finally - who knows how soon or how late - to see the birth of a European army.\n\nIn a European landscape characterized by an ever greater imbalance in its internal power relations - to the advantage countries with greater competitive potential - and with its institutions democratically delegitimized and lacking the resources and political will necessary to undertake redistributive policies and reverse the austerity agenda, the EU's only real bet is to stake everything on militarization, defense, and security. Although they were not invited to the Rome dinner, certainly on Saturday the arms firms and their Brussels lobbyists will have organized parties around the continent to celebrate the EU's new \"speed.\"\n\nSixty years ago, what is today the European Union was born as a project to create a single market, a customs union, and greater coordination between states in coal mining and steel production. Extractivism, free competition, and commodity circulation are the germ of the European project. Let's not trick ourselves by presenting the policies of the last decade as somehow exceptional. Market logic and monetary and budget questions have always been the priority.\n\nAdvances in democracy, peace, welfare, and rights were welcome accompaniments when the conditions of capitalist accumulation allowed for them, but they never made up the ultimate objective of those who designed, constructed and today lead the EU. When the conditions were not favorable for this \"social pact,\" it became starkly apparent what really held the project together. The well-worn foundational myths dissolved and authoritarian austerity emerged as the only roadmap.\n\nDaniel Bensaïd said that the struggle of the oppressed begins with a negative definition. Such is our rejection of the project of organizing Europe politically under the constraint of a monetary straitjacket, debt-discipline, and a security state. Our alternative project for Europe must now develop.\n\nWe are fighting the EU project not in order to reclaim a threatened national identity and sovereignty, in the mode of the radical right. We do so from a class point of view, in the name of a social solidarity under attack from Euroliberalism. That means taking sides between the European elites' implacable competitive logic - the \"frosty breath of commodity society\" Benjamin wrote about, and the \"warm breath of solidarity and the public good\" defended by Bensaïd.\n\nWe could say that today Europe is in dispute. They want to trap us in a false dichotomy where we have to choose between a neoliberal EU or a xenophobic retreat into the nation. This choice is not only a trick, it is a mutually reinforcing one.\n\nWe need a Plan B for Europe - and its problem is not its speed, but its direction. Let's start to give form to a European project that recovers the roots of democracy in partisan antifascism, solidarity, peace, and social justice. A European project that neither excludes nor expels anyone, for it is a project no one would want to walk away from. That task has today become as urgent as it is indispensable.\n\nMiguel Urbán is a Member of the European Parliament for Podemos.

The disaster proves that poverty in a rich country is a choice its government makes.\n\nJoe Biden's Child Tax Credit program expired at the end of December, and Democrats proved unable to negotiate its extension - in large part due to the spurious demands of West Virginia senator Joe Manchin. (Drew Angerer / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAccording to newly released data, an astonishing number of children have entered poverty in a very short period of time. The research , published by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, finds that America's monthly rate of child poverty spiked from 12.1 percent in December 2021 to 17 percent in January 2022 - the highest rate measured since the end of 2020. All told, the jump means that some 3.7 million more children have become poor all at once, with black and Latino children experiencing the most significant increase.\n\nThough decades of political rhetoric and social policy hokum from various think tanks has tried to muddy the waters around poverty, the cause here is both direct and undeniable. Between last July and last December, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sent out billions in economic relief to families under the Child Tax Credit program passed by Congress in March. The program, which sent payments worth $250 a month for children ages six through seventeen and $300 a month for children younger than six, represented an experiment in direct government cash transfer on a grand scale. (The size of the benefits was reduced and ultimately phased-out for higher income families.) It expired at the end of December, and Democrats proved unable to negotiate its extension - in large part due to the spurious demands of West Virginia senator Joe Manchin , who insisted any renewal come with a Dickensian work requirement and an income cap.\n\nWhile short-lived, the program's outcomes were swift and immediately measurable. According to various monthly briefs published by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy, the Child Tax Credit kept millions of children out of poverty every month that it remained on the books: 3 million in July ; 3.5 million in August ; 3.4 million in September ; 3.6 million in October ; 3.8 million in November ; and 3.7 million in December . As its researchers point out, the increased capacity for families to meet their basic needs also reduced hunger and had no visible impact on parental employment either.\n\nAll told, the initial passage and subsequent expiration of the Child Tax Credit is a case study in the ease and speed with which poverty can be cut through government programs. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, a bipartisan continuum of conservative and liberal policymakers variously insinuated that New Deal- and Great Society-era programs were actually responsible for keeping people in poverty. Their proposed solution - to dismantle much of what was already a very fragile and incomplete American welfare state - was accompanied by a series of demeaning (and often overtly racist) cultural explanations for poverty and a range of market-based remedies to go with them.\n\nAs the recent jump in child poverty makes clear, this way of thinking is both wrong on its face and a blueprint for moral catastrophe. No one should be poor, and no one ultimately needs to be. Poverty is a political choice rather than a personal failing. And, if you want to reduce it, the solution is to give people money. It's as simple as that.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But abortion rights can also also be rooted in achieving economic justice for everyone.\n\nAbortion rights activists attend the Women's March Action Rally for reproductive rights at Mariachi Plaza on October 8, 2022 in Los Angeles, California. (Sarah Morris / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe mainstream pro-choice movement has backed itself into a corner. By focusing on abortion as a personal choice and demanding its protection based on a constitutional right to privacy, it has created a heavily individualized paradigm for pro-choice discourse. The argument may be appealing in a courtroom - though not all courtrooms, as the reversal of Roe v. Wade indicates - but it lacks the collective valence necessary to inspire a united mass movement for reproductive justice. Notably, it leaves little room for a discussion of the tangible economic consequences of limiting the reproductive options for half of the population.\n\nNow that the right to abortion is no longer federally protected, and abortion access is vanishing in red states, it's time to reverse course and position reproductive health care as an economic issue. This shouldn't be too be difficult, as the facts on the ground support the connection. A recent report written by Asha Banerjee from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) provides a new, detailed look into the economic consequences of state level abortion bans. Using five economic security metrics - the minimum wage, unionization rates, unemployment insurance rates, Medicaid expansion, and incarceration rates - the report concludes that abortion bans compound economic inequality.\n\nDenial of abortion care should be understood as one of many intentional state policies that economically hurt workers, not a disconnected issue of privacy or religion. The states that have banned or restricted access to abortion have also engaged in decades of economic disempowerment, policies that have especially disadvantaged poor and working-class people and people of color. According to Banerjee, these states \"have intentionally constructed an economic policy architecture defined by weak labor standards, underfunded and purposefully dysfunctional public services, and high levels of incarceration.\"\n\nThe antiabortion movement claims it cares for women as much as their unborn children. But the EPI's findings definitively show that restricting access to abortion has harmful health effects and measurable economic consequences, especially for working-class women. In the months since Roe was overturned, thirteen states have mostly banned abortion and a dozen more have restricted it. These are also the states where economic inequalities are most stark. States with abortion restrictions or total bans on abortion on average have lower minimum wages, unionization levels half as high as those in abortion-protected states, only three in ten unemployed people receiving unemployment insurance, lower rates of Medicaid expansion, and an incarceration rate 1.5 times that of abortion-protected states.\n\nA 2014 study found that about half of all abortion patients had a family income at or below the federal poverty level. Being denied abortion care further disadvantages an already severely disadvantaged group. As the EPI report emphasizes, there is no such thing as \"race-neutral\" policy, so, though the Dobbs decision made no reference to race, it had been widely documented that abortion patients before Roe was overturned were disproportionately poor women and women of color. It was immediately apparent who would lose out most when abortion was no longer legally protected.\n\nAnother influential study, the Turnaway Study , which concluded in 2016, examined the effects of unwanted pregnancy on women's lives and has been a major reference point for those advocating for abortion access for women's well-being. After regularly interviewing nearly a thousand women for five years, the study found that those who'd been denied abortion care experienced worse economic and mental health outcomes than the cohort that received abortion care.\n\nDenying a person an abortion creates economic hardship and insecurity that lasts for years. The documented effects include an increase in household poverty lasting at least four years relative to those who received an abortion, to not having enough money to cover basic living expenses like food, housing and transportation, to lower credit scores, increased debt, and increased numbers of negative public financial records like bankruptcies and evictions.\n\nAbortion bans also coincide with and contribute to mass incarceration, which likewise disproportionately affects working-class people and people of color, particularly black people. As the EPI report indicates, the incarceration rate for the states that have banned or restricted abortion is more than one and a half times higher than the incarceration rate for states with abortion protections. Abortion is being banned in states that already have a beefed up police and prison infrastructure. Sometimes the two collide head-on: the organization Pregnancy Justice (formerly National Advocates for Pregnant Women) has documented more than seventeen hundred cases in which a woman was charged, arrested, or detained for reasons related to pregnancy since 1973.\n\n\"If the protections of Roe and Casey no longer exist, criminalization will increase across all pregnancy outcomes,\" says Dana Sussman, acting executive director of Pregnancy Justice. In our landscape of mass incarceration, the new abortion bans are likely to be enforced through police and prosecutors, putting people's pregnancies increasingly under the direct purview of law enforcement. \"All you need to show is that a woman exposed their fetus to some perceived risk of harm,\" says Sussman . \"The exposure alone is considered a felony in multiple states already.\"\n\nAnother key finding of the EPI report shows that states with abortion protections are more than twice as likely as states with abortion restrictions to have union representation. The laws suppressing worker power and collective action have helped cause the abysmally low levels of union density we see today, down to 7.2 percent in 2021 in states with abortion restrictions. Unionization and abortion access are both mechanisms for economic freedom and mobility, offering more protections for workers who choose to have or not to have children.\n\nThe EPI report lists a number of proposed pieces of legislation that would help protect abortion access and alleviate economic inequality, including the Women's Health Protection Act, the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Act, the Raise the Wage Act to raise the federal minimum wage, the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act to establish a national paid family and medical leave program, the Healthy Families Act to establish a national paid sick days program, the Paycheck Fairness Act to enforce antidiscrimination in employment, and the Schedules that Work Act to grant employees the right to request schedule changes.\n\nThe report also highlights efforts like expanding state Medicaid coverage, extending postpartum Medicaid, and advocating for private sector companies to extend health care coverage to include abortion travel without loss of privacy and without fear of retaliation. Unions can also include abortion protections in collective bargaining agreements, including health insurance that covers the cost of abortions; sick leave policies that are flexible and generous enough to allow people to travel last minute for out-of-state abortions; and financial assistance for members who must make those trips.\n\nThe NewsGuild has been a leader on this issue, especially seeking to make sure that employees do not face discipline or discrimination for receiving abortion care, and they have pledged to share draft bargaining language that protects abortion rights with other unions to encourage them to take up the fight. Reproductive justice advocates and labor militants should push more unions to follow a similar course.\n\nLinking the need for accessible abortion care to other fights for economic equality broadens the demands of the reproductive freedom movement and the base willing to fight for them. As federal protections fall away, building a mass movement for reproductive justice has never been more necessary or urgent. Linking abortion rights to economic justice is a winning political strategy, and the EPI report proves just how inseparable they are.\n\nAnne Rumberger is an activist with NYC for Abortion Rights and NYC Democratic Socialists of America.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nEven as the Democrats' feeble legislative attempt to codify federal protections for abortion rights goes down in flames , many Washington elites are directing their attention and anger toward the same target: no, not right-wing judges reaching their ideological hands into millions of people's bodies, but instead the protesters peacefully demonstrating outside the homes of Supreme Court justices who are about to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nProminent Republican lawmakers, conservative operatives, and Beltway pundits are demanding the government arrest demonstrators - and to do so, they are citing a McCarthy-era statute passed to stop people from protesting the prosecutions of alleged communists. Ignored in the discourse is a past ruling from the Supreme Court effectively blessing conservative protests at the homes of abortion clinic workers.\n\nThe largely manufactured outrage is the latest distraction designed to shift attention away from the issue at hand: the Supreme Court's conservative supermajority is about to deny basic reproductive rights to tens of millions of people in roughly half the country .\n\nConservative operatives want Washington reporters focused on inane questions like who leaked the court's draft opinion, and they want journalists and Democrats to criticize protesters who are outraged by the court's overriding lack of respect for people's bodily autonomy. It is part of a larger right-wing movement in recent years to cancel , criminalize , and literally crush dissent throughout the country, even as the conservative political noise machine continues to blare Braveheart -esque screams of \"freedom!\" against so-called \"cancel culture.\"\n\nCorporate news outlets are taking the bait, fretting about the leak and calling for arrests over peaceful demonstrations. Like usual, they are focused on narrow flash points of anger and upheaval that will likely prove temporary, rather than the far more sweeping and ominous impact of the court's looming ruling to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and allow states to force people to carry their pregnancies to term.\n\nEven as the nation is poised to enact an injustice of historic proportions, those in power and their chosen mouthpieces only appear to care about one thing: upholding the rights and privileges of the ruling class, and ensuring they remain safely ensconced in the Washington bubble.\n\nTo his credit, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer issued the most rational statement of all, saying, \"My house - there's protests three, four times a week outside my house. The American way to peacefully protest is OK.\"\n\nBut he has been drowned out by the voices demanding a crackdown.\n\nThe hypocrisy is particularly powerful among liberals like Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin of Illinois. He purports to support the pro-choice movement but he has spent his decades atop the Washington power structure failing to secure reproductive rights , and this week he has spent his time using his platform to deride the court protesters, calling them \"reprehensible.\" Durbin's behavior - emblematic of so many liberals and media elites - evokes the warning of Dr Martin Luther King.\n\n\"I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate,\" King wrote in 1963 amid the civil rights struggle of his era. \"The white moderate who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, 'I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action.'\"\n\nJustice Samuel Alito authored the draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that was leaked to Politico last week. In the opinion, Alito writes the Roe decision \"was egregiously wrong from the start\" and finds that the Constitution \"does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion.\"\n\nThe opinion adds that \"we cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public's reaction to our work,\" as if to hammer home the conservatives justices' contempt for the people whose lives they are seeking to upend.\n\nDespite the court's supposed lack of concern about what the public thinks, tall fences were quickly erected around the Supreme Court building. In recent days, protesters have gathered outside the homes of Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and Justice Alito to register their opposition.\n\nThere's no evidence that the protests have been violent, and Congress is already fast-tracking legislation to allow the Supreme Court's police force to provide security for justices' families. Notably, the bipartisan bill includes no additional security protections for people who go to abortion facilities amid credible threats of violence .\n\nBut still, conservatives and elite pundits are calling for a major crackdown against dissent, pitting themselves against a First Amendment that explicitly states the government may not pass any law \"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\"\n\nThe Right's weapon of choice is a law passed during the Red Scare hysteria of the 1950s.\n\nSenator Josh Hawley (R-MO) wrote a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday demanding the Justice Department \"vigorously investigate and prosecute\" those protesting at Supreme Court justices' homes.\n\n\"Federal law makes it a crime for a person, 'with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty,' to 'picket[] or parade[] . . . in or near a building or residence occupied or used by such judge,'\" Hawley wrote, adding: \"The First Amendment is no shield to this illegal conduct.\"\n\nThe Washington Post editorial board agreed with this premise, writing a column on Monday arguing that it is crucial to \"protect robust demonstrations of political dissent while preventing them from turning into harassment or intimidation.\"\n\nTo do so, argued the Post , the nation should look to an old law. \"A federal law - 18 U.S.C. Section 1507 - prohibits 'pickets or parades' at any judge's residence, 'with the intent of influencing' a jurist 'in the discharge of his duty,\" noted the editorial. \"These are limited and justifiable restraints on where and how people exercise the right to assembly. Citizens should voluntarily abide by them, in letter and spirit. If not, the relevant governments should take appropriate action.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Post columnist Marc Thiessen, who worked as the chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush at the time that Roberts and Alito were confirmed to the court, amplified this argument, writing an opinion piece calling on the Biden administration to \"enforce federal law barring harassment of the justices and their families in their homes.\"\n\nThe supposedly \"limited and justifiable\" anti-picketing statute being cited by all these people - 18 U.S.C. § 1507 - was enacted as part of the Internal Security Act of 1950, a law requiring communist organizations to register with the government. This particular statute was specifically written to respond to reports of protests outside federal courts during US prosecutions of alleged communist party leaders.\n\nOne of the statute's proponents, segregationist Senator Allen Ellender (D-LA), explained at the time: \"The practice of picketing courts is of recent origin, and apparently has been employed almost solely in connection with proceedings involving alleged Communist Party members and sympathizers. . . . If we are to keep our national judiciary on the high plane it has enjoyed since the founding of this country, we must restrain these disgraceful practices, adopted by persons and groups who would undermine our country by first undermining our judiciary.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has subsequently struck down portions of the broader Internal Security Act. Furthermore, in 1983, the court limited the government's prohibition on protests outside the Supreme Court, finding that the First Amendment protects picketing on sidewalks surrounding the court.\n\nWhile the Post 's Aaron Blake wrote a story Wednesday headlined, \"Yes, experts say protests at SCOTUS justices' homes appear to be illegal,\" one of conservatives' go-to constitutional law scholars has said that relying on the Internal Security Act statute to quash protests could have troubling Constitutional implications.\n\nGeorge Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who has criticized the protests at justices' houses, wrote a column in the Hill on Tuesday arguing that using the anti-picketing statute \"to arrest protesters would be a serious blow to free speech and would be difficult to defend in the courts.\"\n\nHe similarly told the Wall Street Journal : \"As a free speech advocate, I would be very concerned about the use of that statute. I think that what these protesters are doing is reprehensible. I think it's equally reprehensible for President [Joe] Biden not to denounce this. But when we start to charge protesters with crimes because they're appearing at the homes of figures, including Supreme Court justices, you really do raise some first amendment concerns.\"\n\nTurley added, \"I do think that if you brought a prosecution, it would raise some serious constitutional questions. And I would not bet on that being upheld on appeal.\"\n\nBeyond the troubling historical legacy of the statute they are referencing, there is another problem with conservatives calling for the detention of these protesters: they only seem to worry about such demonstrations when they're being done by the Left.\n\nHawley, for example, didn't call for anyone to \"vigorously investigate and prosecute\" the insurrectionists who violently stormed the US Capitol last year. In fact, he cheered on those protesters shortly before the insurrection and since then, his campaign has been selling merchandise sporting pictures of him raising a fist to those insurrectionists.\n\nSimilarly, while the Post 's editorial board noted that it is important to prevent political dissent \"from turning into harassment or intimidation,\" the antiabortion movement has been known to picket the homes of people who work at abortion clinics - and worse. Violence against abortion clinics has been on the rise , and clinics around the country are worried that attacks will spike after the Supreme Court issues its abortion decision.\n\nWhat's more, the Supreme Court has in the past approved efforts by protesters to picket private residences - and specifically did so in a case involving protests by the antiabortion movement outside the homes of abortion clinic workers.\n\nIn 1994, the Supreme Court found that a Florida court's content-neutral injunction creating a three-hundred-foot protest-free buffer zone around the residences of abortion clinic workers' homes was unconstitutional and overbroad. The court found \"a limitation on the time, duration of picketing, and number of pickets outside a smaller zone could have accomplished the desired result.\"\n\nFinally, by selectively boosting outrage over public protests, corporate media is only making matters worse. After the George Floyd protests in 2020, major outlets appeared far more concerned about the specter of looters and rioters than they were about the actual grave injustice of a police officer murdering an unarmed black man for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill.\n\nNews outlets have also been deeply perturbed by activists' calls to \"defund\" the police in the wake of Floyd's murder. While no cities have actually slashed police budgets, it's become incredibly common for pundits and conservative Democrats to say that the \"defund\" movement is weighing down the party.\n\nThanks to such selective hullabaloo, new legislative attempts to curtail public protests will likely be forthcoming - and unlike Democratic lawmakers' doomed attempt to protect abortion rights on Wednesday, these efforts could be successful.\n\nOn Monday, the US Senate unanimously passed a measure offered by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Chris Coons (D-DE) to extend Supreme Court Police protection to justices' families.\n\nA previous version of the legislation offered by Cornyn would have allowed the Supreme Court Police to arrest anyone who \"knowingly and willfully obstructs, resists, or interferes with a member of the Supreme Court Police\" busy protecting justices or their families. Coons noted in a press release, \"Sections from an earlier draft of this bill were removed prior to introduction, citing free speech concerns.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nAndrew Perez is senior editor and a reporter at the Lever covering money and influence.\n\nDavid Sirota is editor-at-large at Jacobin .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Americans were horrified to witness Donald Trump's right-wing supporters storm the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn the presidential election. Their attempted insurrection against American democracy colossally failed, but the riot served as a reminder to Americans that democracy is fragile - and is a system that must be constantly defended.\n\nI'm currently in Lima, Peru with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) to serve as an election observer for the country's June 6 presidential runoff election. This Sunday, Peruvians will choose between leftist candidate Pedro Castillo , an educator and union leader, and Keiko Fujimori, a career politician and daughter of former dictator Alberto Fujimori.\n\nI've served as a poll watcher in local and national US elections, but the stakes have never been as high as they currently are here in Peru.\n\nIn the past two days, all four groups that DSA's observer delegation has met with have expressed serious concerns about the possibility of a right-wing coup attempt should Pedro Castillo win. Castillo is currently leading in the polls. The four organizations - made up of indigenous leaders, lawyers, human rights experts, and trade union leaders - also expressed fears that Keiko Fujimori and her supporters in the military, courts, legislature, and media would engage in fraud or violence to secure her victory at any cost.\n\nLegal experts with Peru's Mesa de Abogados Por La Democracia (Lawyer's Table for Democracy) shared their fear that this election could result in a return to Fujimorismo , the term used to describe the right-wing authoritarianism and violence of Alberto Fujimori's ten-year dictatorship. Fujimori's government forcibly sterilized 272,028 mostly indigenous, rural, and poor women and murdered thousands of Peruvians in terrible acts of state-sponsored terrorism. Mass graves around the country have still yet to be uncovered.\n\nConcerns over a potential coup or electoral fraud were expressed by Peru's Coordinadora Nacional de Derechos Humanos (National Coordinator for Human Rights), an umbrella organization of eighty-two human rights organizations. The CNDDHH shared with our delegation a sixteen-page report documenting recent right-wing attacks on freedom of speech and freedom of the press during Peru's presidential runoff election.\n\nOne recent right-wing attack on Peruvian freedom of the press was the firing of Clara Elvira Ospina from her job as news director with two of Peru's leading television channels. Both channels are owned by major media conglomerate El Comercio. Clara was fired from her job shortly after a meeting with Keiko Fujimori - a meeting where Clara informed Fujimori that her channels' news coverage would remain impartial and unbiased.\n\nAttacks on freedom of the press. Right-wing violence threatening the democratic rule of law. This may sound all too familiar to Americans after four years of Trump and Trumpism.\n\nIf Pedro Castillo is elected on June 6, he has promised to strengthen democracy in his nation. Central to Castillo's campaign is a pledge to work with social movements to initiate a referendum to write a new constitution - one that would guarantee the rights of indigenous communities, women, and peasants, and replace the constitution imposed during the Fujimori dictatorship.\n\nPeru is at a crossroads between a return to right-wing dictatorship and the deepening of their nation's democratic project. This Sunday, all eyes should turn to Peru to ensure that on June 6, like on January 6, democracy prevails in the Americas.\n\nCarlos Ramirez-Rosa is the alderman for Chicago's 35th Ward.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The Tories are running on a record of weapons sales to oppressive regimes and covert wars. The choice is clear.\n\nProtesters demonstrate against the war in Yemen and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi outside the Saudi Arabian embassy on October 25, 2018 in London, England. Jack Taylor / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nJeremy Corbyn announced on Tuesday that, under a Labour government, schoolchildren would be taught about the injustice and violence of the British Empire. Labour also promised to promote a \"new internationalism\" and a progressive foreign policy, as outlined in its recent manifesto .\n\nIn response, the Conservatives claimed it was \"staggering\" to hear Labour \"lecture people\" about foreign affairs. And yet the Conservatives have not been remotely clear about foreign policy or defense when outlining their own election pledges. Reviewing the conduct of the May-Johnson governments since the last election in June 2017, this should come as no surprise.\n\nThe government's own figures reveal that, over the past two years , \"telecommunications interception equipment\" has been exported to the law enforcement agencies of authoritarian regimes such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and Qatar. These sales are quite possibly unlawful (violating the UK's own export control guidelines banning sales when there is a \"clear risk that the items might be used for internal repression\") given what is known about how these states use such equipment .\n\nFor instance, the UAE has mounted attacks on journalists and activists via spyware sent on Twitter and spear-phishing emails. In July, the UK approved £1.9 million worth of the same equipment for export to Hong Kong , weeks after mass protests. Britain has recently established new military base facilities in Bahrain and Oman, and so sales of telecommunications equipment and arms are a sign of support for the Gulf regimes, aiding the longevity of the ruling families.\n\nWhile the Conservatives have not discussed the issue during election season, in September, the government published a security export strategy , reviewing its intentions for surveillance and cybersecurity. It stressed that the UK is the world's fourth-largest exporter and that the government would \"accelerate the continued year on year growth of security exports,\" benefiting the UK's \"vibrant security ecosystem.\"\n\nPursuing this long-standing aim, Britain has enjoyed a strong relationship with the world's longest surviving dictator, the sultan of Oman. In total, from 2015-18, the UK sold over £1.5 billion in arms to Oman, and even gifted it free spare parts (a \"gift in kind\") for Challenger 2 tanks in 2018. The Times of Oman announced in April 2017 that BAE Systems had agreed to support Oman in developing a national workforce powered by STEM education.\n\nInsights into the UK's foreign policy endeavors don't always come from such explicit, clear declarations as those found in the security export strategy. The Ministry of Defense mistakenly admitted in July the cost of a secret £2 billion program it runs for the Saudi royal family's protection force, the Saudi Arabian National Guard Communications Project (SANGCOM).\n\nPaid for by the Saudi regime, the program employs ten times as many people as Whitehall publicly admits. The £2 billion cost runs over ten years, agreed in February 2010, running right through the past decade of Conservative rule. SANGCOM directly implicates the UK in the defense of the Saudi regime.\n\nThe Conservatives have also conducted secret vote-trading deals with Saudi Arabia to ensure both states were elected to the UN human rights council in the face of Riyadh's human rights abuses. No ministers voiced concerns when Human Rights Watch reported earlier this month that \"authorities had tortured four prominent Saudi women activists while in an unofficial detention centre, including by administering electric shocks, whipping the women on their thighs, forcible hugging and kissing and groping.\" The activists were released upon the condition that they sign a document declaring they had not been tortured.\n\nWhile Labour's manifesto makes no mention of these ties (and also supports the Trident nuclear program, is dedicated to \"at least 2% of GDP\" going to military spending, and supports the UK's \"world-leading\" defense industry), it does nevertheless commit Labour to banning all sales of arms to the Saudis, which would mean clear action against the world's largest humanitarian disaster, in Yemen, where 80 percent of the population (24 million people) need assistance and protection.\n\nMeanwhile, the Conservatives' support for the war in Yemen continues even after it lost a major court case concluding that weapons sales to the Saudis were unlawful . Prime minister Boris Johnson said in 2018 (when he was foreign secretary) that \"it is a folly and an illusion to believe that [the Yemen disaster] is in any way the responsibility of the United Kingdom,\" despite continued UK arms sales to Riyadh. The Conservatives have also promoted strong ties between the arms industry and universities and museums , something that has elicited little comment in the media.\n\nAnother feature of the May-Johnson legacy is the UK's current involvement in (at least) seven covert wars, mostly outside parliamentary oversight in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. Of course, these receive precious little oversight because it is government \" policy not to comment, and to dissuade others from commenting or speculating, about the operational activities of Special Forces because of the security implications.\"\n\nIn February 2018, the UK doubled the size of its Special Air Service (SAS) force in Afghanistan, fighting alongside US troops tasked with killing Taliban commanders. Following President Trump's decision to pull US troops out of the country, in March 2019, the Pentagon asked UK special forces to contribute to counter-terrorism operations, and the UK shows no signs of exiting the country.\n\nIn Iraq, hundreds of British troops are engaged in covert combat operations, including around thirty SAS and Special Boat Service (SBS) troops. UK Reaper drones continue to fly over the country. The Conservative government has also supported the United States' drone campaign in Pakistan, which continues to the present, with the Menwith Hill spy base in Yorkshire facilitating these strikes.\n\nIn Syria, an estimated 120 UK special forces continue to operate. In April 2018, Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle asked the government which armed opposition groups it had trained since 2012. The government replied that it had only trained the opposition from 2015 for combat against the Islamic State, yet reports indicate that training started in 2012 and was mainly for the purposes of operations against Assad's forces.\n\nThe Conservatives have misled the public about UK involvement in Syria in other ways: Lord Tariq Ahmad told Parliament that the decision to conduct joint US-UK airstrikes in Syria on April 14, 2018 \"was only taken because all non-military options had been exhausted.\" Yet on April 10, the UN Security Council discussed a range of draft resolutions aiming to investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria.\n\nThe first draft, presented by the United States, proposed the establishment of a yearlong UN procedure to identify those responsible. Russia vetoed the draft and proposed a new draft that would have established a similar mechanism, but one that would have used evidence collected by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). This was vetoed by the United States and the UK, making Lord Ahmad's comment misleading at best.\n\nIn January of this year , a group of twelve SAS and US Green Berets were flown into Yemen from Djibouti, dressed in Arab clothing and sent to operate near the government-held town of Marib. The UK has recently embedded its special forces inside the armed forces of other nations, so they could participate in (potentially illegal) forms of conflict worldwide, with the Conservatives remaining tight-lipped about the identity of collaborating nations.\n\nThe government has slightly shifted its priorities over recent years, with serious consequences for defense and security. Sir Simon McDonald, permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, said in 2015 that human rights did not maintain the \"profile\" in the Foreign Office that they had \"in the past.\" Instead, the \"prosperity agenda\" was the priority.\n\nAfter the 2016 Brexit vote, senior ministers announced their intentions to increase the value of arms and defense equipment in attempts to remain competitive. Naturally, Britain now aims to cement new relationships with non-European Union states. The difficulties arise over which states, and since the Brexit vote, a large number of authoritarian and often dictatorial regimes have been in the government's sights.\n\nAs David Wearing documents in AngloArabia , alliances with the Gulf states are central to Britain's post-Brexit economic strategy and its aims of maintaining its global status. Bolstering economic and diplomatic relationships through serving the military demands of the Gulf states helps Britain retain a degree of strategic control in the region.\n\nTheresa May's husband's Capital Group is the biggest shareholder in BAE Systems, with the connections between the state and the arms trade being extensive and little known to the public. Arms exports are responsible for 1.6 percent of total UK exports in value, yet they receive 50 percent of export credit via loans or guarantees, assisted by the taxpayer .\n\nThe Royal Navy very openly declares its goals of \"stabilising hotspots\" and controlling resource-rich regions. Without the hindrance of the consultation and review processes associated with the EU Dual-Use Regulation, the EU Torture Regulation, and the EU Firearms Regulation, the UK might seek to push unethical arms sales. Indeed, in September 2016, Theresa May hosted the emir of Qatar, declaring his country a \"natural partner,\" and not long after British firms visited the Gulf state for the Milipol 2016 defense exhibition.\n\nThe government cleared export licenses worth £2.9 billion in the twelve months after June 2016 to thirty-five countries rated \" not free \" by the think tank Freedom House; a 28 percent increase on the previous twelve months. Among these states are Equatorial Guinea, widely considered deeply corrupt and repressive, and Azerbaijan, accused by a number of human rights groups of conducting a campaign against freedom of speech and for which £1 million in arms licenses were granted.\n\nThis is part of a more general push - made explicit by the government - to prioritize arms sales in Britain's post-Brexit future, with former defense secretary Michael Fallon vowing that Britain would \"spread its wings across the world\" at DSEI, a major arms fair in September 2017. Liam Fox made visits to the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, and Kuwait within the first few months into his appointment as international trade secretary in 2016; arms were very likely on the agenda.\n\nOne year later, Fox announced that the UK and the Philippines' far-right president Rodrigo Duterte had \"shared values\" at the same time that human rights groups were condemning Duterte's sanctioning of extra-judicial killings. Duterte has personally threatened to bomb schools preaching communism and regularly supports extrajudicial killings, making the \"shared values\" comment somewhat understandable given the UK's recent history of Middle East and African interventions.\n\nOne of the main objectives of the Philippines in its military procurements is to isolate and defeat the Islamist Abu Sayyaf group in the south, as well as the Maoist New People's Army and the Muslim Moros. Supporting the human-rights-abusing Duterte regime, the UK sold over £13 million in arms from 2015-18, according to figures from the Campaign Against Arms Trade.\n\nThroughout the current election season, the UK media has failed to scrutinize the major party leaders on their foreign policy views. In contrast to Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, Labour has vowed to end the \"bomb first, talk later\" approach to defense, placing human rights, international law, and tackling climate change at the forefront of international policies.\n\nLabour aims to introduce a War Powers Act, ensuring that \"no prime minister can bypass Parliament to commit to conventional military action.\" In addition, it aims to \"[c]onduct an audit of the impact of Britain's colonial legacy to understand our contribution to the dynamics of violence and insecurity across regions previously under British colonial rule.\"\n\nThese measures would redefine notions such as accountability, targeting an \"elective dictatorship\" (as Lord Hailsham termed the UK political system in 1976) in which no minister has so far been held to account for crimes abroad, in spite of wars, coups, covert missions, and support for human rights abuses.\n\nLabour's challenge to the UK's military and defense establishment may transpire as curtailed and subdued, with potentially more emphasis on symbolic signs of solidarity rather than structural reforms - but it is leagues ahead of the Conservatives' legacy of secrecy and support for authoritarianism.\n\nElliot Murphy is an activist and writer.

      "text": "Peter's Choice\n\nMike McQuade\n\nThis past October , I taught a weeklong seminar on the history of conservatism to honors students from around the state of Oklahoma. In five long days, my nine very engaged students and I got to know each other fairly well. Six were African American women. Then there was a middle-aged white single mother, a white kid who looked like any other corn-fed Oklahoma boy and identified himself as \"queer,\" and the one straight white male. I'll call him Peter.\n\nPeter is 21 and comes from a town of about 3,000 souls. It's 85 percent white, according to the 2010 census, and 1.2 percent African American-which would make for about 34 black folks. \"Most people live around the poverty line,\" Peter told the class, and hunting is as much a sport as a way to put food on the table.\n\nPeter was one of the brightest students in the class, and certainly the sweetest. He liked to wear overalls to school-and on the last day, in a gentle tweak of the instructor, a red \"Make America Great Again\" baseball cap. A devout evangelical, he'd preferred former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at the start of the primary season, but was now behind Donald Trump.\n\nOne day the students spent three hours drafting essays about the themes we'd talked about in class. I invited them to continue writing that night so the next morning we could discuss one of their pieces in detail. I picked Peter's because it was extraordinary. In only eight hours he'd churned out eight pages, eloquent and sharp.\n\nWhen I asked him if I could discuss his essay in this article, he replied, \"That sounds fine with me. If any of my work can be used to help the country with its political turmoil, I say go for it!\" Then he sent me a new version with typos corrected and a postelection postscript: \"My wishful hope is that my compatriots will have their tempers settled by Trump's election, and that maybe both sides can learn from the Obama and Trump administrations in order to understand how both sides feel. Then maybe we can start electing more moderate people, like John Kasich and Jim Webb, who can find reasonable commonality on both sides and make government work.\" Did I mention he was sweet?\n\nWhen he read the piece aloud in class that afternoon in October, the class was riveted. Several of the black women said it was the first time they'd heard a Trump supporter clearly set forth what he believed and why. (Though, defying stereotypes, one of these women-an aspiring cop-was also planning to vote for Trump.)\n\nPeter's essay took off from the main class reading, Corey Robin's The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism From Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin . Its central argument is that conservative movements across history are united in their devotion to the maintenance of received social hierarchy. Peter, whose essay was titled \"Plight of the Redneck,\" had a hard time seeing how that applied to the people he knew.\n\n\"We all live out in the wilderness, either in the middle of a forest or on a farm,\" he wrote. \"Some people cannot leave their homes during times of unfortunate weather. Many still dry clothes by hanging them on wires with clothespins outside. These people are nowhere near the top, or even the middle, of any hierarchy. These people are scraping the bottom of the barrel, and they, seemingly, have nothing to benefit from maintaining the system of order that keeps them at the bottom.\" His county ended up going about 70 percent for Trump.\n\nConcerning race, Peter wrote, \"In Oklahoma, besides Native Americans, there have traditionally been very few minorities. Few blacks have ever lived near the town that I am from...Even in my generation, despite there being a little more diversity, there was no racism, nor was there a reason for racism to exist.\" His town's 34 or so black people might beg to differ, of course; white people's blindness to racism in their midst is an American tradition. As one of the African American students in the class-I'll call her Karen-put it, whites in her town see \"racism as nonexistent unless they witness it firsthand. And then it almost has to be over the top-undeniable acts of violence like hate crimes or cross burnings on front lawns-before they would acknowledge it as such.\" But it's relevant to the story I'm telling that I'm certain Peter isn't individually, deliberately racist, and that Karen agrees.\n\nStill, Peter's thinking might help us frame a central debate on the left about what to make of Trump's victory. Is it, in the main, a recrudescence of bigotry on American soil-a reactionary scream against a nation less white by the year? Or is it more properly understood as an economically grounded response to the privations that neoliberalism has wracked upon the heartland?\n\nPeter knows where he stands. He remembers multiple factories and small businesses \"shutting down or laying off. Next thing you know, half of downtown\" in the bigger city eight miles away \"became vacant storefronts.\" Given that experience, he has concluded, \"for those people who have no political voice and come from states that do not matter, the best thing they can do is try to send in a wrecking ball to disrupt the system.\"\n\nWhen Peter finished with that last line, there was a slight gasp from someone in the class-then silence, then applause. They felt like they got it.\n\nI was also riveted by Peter's account, convinced it might be useful as a counterbalance to glib liberal dismissals of the role of economic decline in building Trumpland. Then I did some research.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, the median household income in Peter's county is a little more than $45,000. By comparison, Detroit's is about $27,000 and Chicago's (with a higher cost of living) is just under $49,000. The poverty rate is 17.5 percent in the county and 7.6 percent in Peter's little town, compared with Chicago's 22.7 percent . The unemployment rate has hovered around 4 percent.\n\nThe town isn't rich, to be sure. But it's also not on the \"bottom.\" Oklahoma on the whole has been rather dynamic economically: Real GDP growth was 2.8 percent in 2014-down from 4.3 percent in 2013, but well above the 2.2 percent nationally. The same was true of other Trump bastions like Texas (5.2 percent growth) and West Virginia (5.1 percent).\n\nPeter, though, perceives the region's economic history as a simple tale of desolation and disappointment. \"Everyone around was poor, including the churches,\" he wrote, \"and charities were nowhere near (this wasn't a city, after all), so more people had to use some sort of government assistance. Taxes went up [as] the help became more widespread.\"\n\nHe was just calling it like he saw it. But it's striking how much a bright, inquisitive, public-spirited guy can take for granted that just is not so. Oklahoma's top marginal income tax rate was cut by a quarter point to 5 percent in 2016, the same year lawmakers hurt the working poor by slashing the earned-income tax credit. On the \"tax burden\" index used by the website WalletHub , Oklahoma's is the 45th lowest, with rock-bottom property taxes and a mere 4.5 percent sales tax. (On Election Day, Oklahomans voted down a 1-point sales tax increase meant to raise teacher pay, which is 49th in the nation.).\n\nAs for government assistance, Oklahoma spends l ess than 10 percent of its welfare budget on cash assistance. The most a single-parent family of three can get is $292 a month-that's 18 percent of the federal poverty line. Only 2,469 of the more than 370,000 Oklahomans aged 18 to 64 who live in poverty get this aid. And the state's Medicaid eligibility is one of the stingiest in the nation, covering only adults with dependent children and incomes below 42 percent of the poverty level-around $8,500 for a family of three.\n\nBut while Peter's analysis is at odds with much of the data, his overall story does fit a national pattern. Trump voters report experiencing greater-than-average levels of economic anxiety , even though they tend have better-than-average incomes. And they are inclined to blame economic instability on the federal government -even, sometimes, when it flows from private corporations. Peter wrote about the sense of salvation his neighbors felt when a Walmart came to town: \"Now there were enough jobs, even part-time jobs...But Walmart constantly got attacked by unions nationally and with federal regulations; someone lost their job, or their job became part-time.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that if the largest retail corporation in the world has been conspicuously harmed by unions and regulations of late, it doesn't show in its net profits, which were $14.69 billion in 2015. * And of course, Walmart historically has had a far greater role in shuttering small-town Main Streets than in revitalizing them. But Peter's neighbors see no reason to resent it for that. He writes, \"The majority of the people do not blame the company for their loss because they realize that businesses [are about] making money, and that if they had a business of their own, they would do the same thing.\"\n\nIt's not fair to beat up on a sweet 21-year-old for getting facts wrong-especially if, as is likely, these were the only facts he was told. Indeed, teaching the class, I was amazed how even the most liberal students took for granted certain dubious narratives in which they (and much of the rest of the country) were marinated all year long, like the notion that Hillary Clinton was extravagantly corrupt.\n\nFeelings can't be fact-checked, and in the end, feelings were what Peter's eloquent essay came down to­-what it feels like to belong, and what it feels like to be culturally dispossessed. \"After continually losing on the economic side,\" he wrote, \"one of the few things that you can retain is your identity. What it means, to you, to be an American, your somewhat self-sufficient and isolated way of life, and your Christian faith and values. Your identity and heritage is the very last thing you can cling to...Abortion laws and gay marriage are the two most recent upsets. The vast majority of the state of Oklahoma has opposed both of the issues, and social values cannot be forced by the government.\"\n\nOn these facts he is correct: In a 2015 poll, 68 percent of Oklahomans called themselves \"pro-life,\" and only 30 percent supported marriage equality. Until 2016 there were only a handful of abortion providers in the entire state, and the first new clinic to open in 40 years guards its entrance with a metal detector.\n\nPeter thinks he's not a reactionary. Since that sounds like an insult, I'd like to think so, too. But in writing this piece, I did notice a line in his essay that I had glided over during my first two readings, maybe because I liked him too much to want to be scared by him. \"One need only look to the Civil War and the lasting legacies of Reconstruction through to today's current racism and race issues to see what happens when the federal government forces its morals on dissenting parts of the country.\"\n\nThe last time I read that, I shuddered. So I emailed Peter. \"I say the intrusions were worth it to end slavery and turn blacks into full citizens,\" I wrote. \"A lot of liberals, even those most disposed to having an open mind to understanding the grievances of people like you and yours, will have a hard time with [your words].\"\n\nPeter's answer was striking. He first objected (politely!) to what he saw as the damning implication behind my observation. Slavery and Reconstruction? \"I was using it as an example of government intrusion and how violent and negative the results can be when the government tries to tell people how to think. I take it you saw it in terms of race in politics. The way we look at the same thing shows how big the difference is between our two groups.\"\n\nTo him, focusing on race was \"an attention-grabbing tool that politicians use to their advantage,\" one that \"really just annoys and angers conservatives more than anything, because it is usually a straw man attack.\" He compared it to what \"has happened with this election: everyone who votes for Trump must be racist and sexist, and there's no possible way that anyone could oppose Hillary unless it's because they're sexist. Accusing racism or sexism eliminates the possibility of an honest discussion about politics.\"\n\nHe asked me to imagine \"being one of those rednecks under the poverty line, living in a camper trailer on your grandpa's land, eating about one full meal a day, yet being accused by Black Lives Matter that you are benefiting from white privilege and your life is somehow much better than theirs.\"\n\nAnd that's when I wanted to meet him halfway: Maybe we could talk about the people in Chicago working for poverty wages and being told by Trump supporters that they were lazy. Or the guy with the tamale cart in front of my grocery store-always in front of my grocery store, morning, noon, and night-who with so much as a traffic violation might find himself among the millions whom Trump intends to immediately deport .\n\nI wanted to meet him halfway, until he started talking about history.\n\n\"The reason I used the Civil War and Reconstruction is because it isn't a secret that Reconstruction failed,\" Peter wrote. \"It failed and left the South in an extreme poverty that it still hasn't recovered from.\" And besides, \"slavery was expensive and the Industrial Revolution was about to happen. Maybe if there had been no war, slavery would have faded peacefully.\"\n\nAs a historian, I found this remarkable, since it was precisely what all American schoolchildren learned about slavery and Reconstruction for much of the 20th century. Or rather, they did until the civil rights era, when serious scholarship dismantled this narrative , piece by piece. But not, apparently, in Peter's world. \"Until urban liberals move to the rural South and live there for probably a decade or more,\" he concluded, \"there's no way to fully appreciate the view.\"\n\nThis was where he left me plumb at a loss. Liberals must listen to and understand Trump supporters. But what you end up understanding from even the sweetest among them still might chill you to the bone.\n\nRead Peter's full essay at motherjones.com/oklahoma .\n\n*This sentence has been clarified to include Walmart's net, not gross, profits in 2015.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "MotherJones SO93: Pro-choice\n\nDavid Osborne has a common-sense prescription for improving the public sector: give it real incentives to perform better. He points to government departments that have boosted efficiency and morale by decentralizing authority, making themselves more accountable to taxpayers, and beginning to compete against the private sector.\n\nNow Osborne wants the nation's schools to give it a try.\n\nWith his emphasis on accountability and competition, it's no surprise that the author of Reinventing Government is an unabashed supporter of charter schools and school choice. And his opinion counts: Osborne has been a friend of Bill's since he interviewed Clinton for his 1988 book Laboratories of Democracy. Now he's a senior adviser to Al Gore's National Performance Review, which seeks to evaluate and improve the efficiency of the federal bureaucracy. We also consider Osborne a member of our extended family-he was a frequent contributor to Mother Jones in the early 1980s.\n\nMother Jones met with Osborne near his home in Essex, Massachusetts, and spoke with him about the state of education in America, the movement to reform it, and the educational experiments he endorses.\n\nMJ: You've spoken highly of school-choice programs in East Harlem and Minnesota. Is school choice the key to educational reform?\n\nOsborne: Choice is the key that unlocks the door and lets you in, but choice alone is not enough. Some choice systems, like Cambridge, Massachusetts, aren't competitive. Parents rank the schools, and some of them get their first choice, some get their second choice, some get their third. But when a school is not chosen by many parents, it's still filled. They don't close it down, they don't send teachers into other schools, they don't hire another principal and let him assemble a team to improve the school.\n\nIn East Harlem, they have more competition. It's not an extraordinary amount; they've only closed three schools in ten years. Still, there's always the chance that your school could be closed if you don't excel.\n\nThe fundamental reason schools don't change rapidly is that they have the next best thing to a monopoly. The only way, in a traditional public-school system, that you can have your children go elsewhere than where they're assigned is by paying a lot of money. Even when you take your kids out, the school district still gets your tax money, so it doesn't hurt them a bit. In fact, it's better from their perspective; they have fewer students to educate with the same dollars.\n\nMJ: What do you think of vouchers, which give kids government money to attend any school, public or private?\n\nOsborne: Public choice is far superior to vouchers. The problem under most voucher proposals is that parents could add money to the voucher. They could buy the most expensive education they wanted.\n\nLet's say a voucher was worth five thousand dollars a child. Some affluent people would add ten thousand dollars and send their kids to the fanciest private school. Some upper-middle-class people would add five thousand dollars and send their kids to the ten-thousand-dollar school. The working class and the poor would go to five-thousand- dollar schools. You'd lose the mixing by social class.\n\nEducation has basically two major missions. One is to educate the kids. The second is to socialize them. Kids get to know kids who aren't like them, kids from the other side of the tracks, kids with different skin color, kids whose parents went to college or didn't go to college, kids who talk differently than they do. You'd lose that under a pure voucher system.\n\nMJ: Don't we already have class segregation? Just look at suburban schools compared to inner-city or rural schools.\n\nOsborne: Sure. That's one of the things that's wrong with this society: we're really pulling apart. The nice thing about choice is that it allows us to root back in a different direction. We segregate our schools by geography now: you live in this district, so you go to this district. If you have a choice system, you can go anywhere, and you can have racial guidelines which increase integration. That's how it's done in Massachusetts.\n\nMJ: People worry that school choice is going to suck money away from the schools that need that money most, the schools where kids do poorly. What happens to the kids who are left behind in these lousy schools, which are bound to become even lousier?\n\nOsborne: That's the main argument used by progressive and liberal opponents of choice. It's dead wrong. They haven't thought it through. What we have now is the poor kids left behind in the inner-city schools. Everybody else either chooses their schools by deciding where to live, or by sending their kids to a private school.\n\nWhat would happen under school choice? Kids would leave those awful inner-city schools. That's good for those kids. Under a real competitive system of choice, what would a school board do if a school lost 40 percent of its students and 40 percent of its money? They'd give the principal a year to turn the damn place around or get out the door. There would finally be a reason why somebody had to care about these schools. It would work for the kids left behind even more than for the kids who move.\n\nMJ: Critics of school choice often say that many parents would choose a school based on \"convenience\"-it's close to work or a day-care center, or it has a great athletic program. If that's how parents would make their decision, would that do much to improve schools academically, or would it only reward schools that have a nice piece of real estate?\n\nOsborne: We need to give parents more credit. Let me give you an example: In East Harlem, they decided the thing that turned the boys on was sports. So they set up a school that had a rigorous academic core and then a focus on sports. But they couldn't fill it, because parents had this fear their kids would spend all day playing basketball, and they wanted them to get a real education. People just aren't as dumb as the media likes to present them, especially when it comes to their kids.\n\nThe second thing is that most parents who care about the academic quality of their kids' schools make their decisions even before they reach the level of public-school choice. That is, they move. They live someplace that has good schools, or they choose private schools.\n\nThe third thing is that when you get down to the level of choosing a public school, there's not an awful lot of information available to parents about what's a good public school and what's not, academically. The next step that they have to take in Minnesota, and they're working on it, is the publication of a kind of Consumer Reports for the public schools. We need to make that information available, or a choice system isn't going to work very well.\n\nIn the end, though, there will be a certain percentage of parents who aren't going to make decisions based on academic criteria. But the fact that information is available so that they could choose a school based on academic performance, even if only a small percentage actually do, is enough to force the schools to keep on their toes.\n\nMJ: Is the private sector better equipped to keep on its toes? Should more systems follow the examples of Baltimore and Dade County, Florida, by contracting private organizations to run some public schools?\n\nOsborne: It's a great idea. You want innovation in the system, and innovation normally comes from new organizations much faster than old ones. A business could run a charter school; a church could run a charter school, as long as it was nonsectarian; a nonprofit organization could run it; a school district could run it; a group of teachers could run it; a group of parents could run it. Theoretically, anybody with a plan and a staff could get a charter and run a school.\n\nMJ: Free private schools.\n\nOsborne: Exactly, except let's call them public. They'd be public, paid for by public dollars, but they would not be controlled by the bureaucratic system. They would be accountable to the parents of the kids who went there, who could fund them or defund them by either sending their kids there or yanking their kids out. It's a different form of accountability.\n\nWe're so hung up on who owns the damn thing, on whether it's a public company or a private company. That's a lot less important than whether or not an institution has the right incentives, whether it's a monopoly or it's competitive, whether it has to please its customers or it can just ignore them. It doesn't really make that much difference to me that the U.S. Postal Service is public and that New England Telephone is a private monopoly. They're both pretty unresponsive to my needs-unlike Sprint, which is incredibly responsive to my needs, because they know I'll go to MCI or AT&T if they're not.\n\nMJ: Will it necessarily take more money to make schools more effective?\n\nOsborne: When it comes to how much money government should spend, I'm a liberal. When it comes to how we spend it, I'm pretty frustrated with the traditional liberal approach. I'm certainly for spending more money on education, but we shouldn't pour more money into the same system. If we reinvent it, though, I'm perfectly willing to invest more money.\n\nMJ: A lot of kids graduate from high school without many marketable skills. How much do we need to change what we're teaching under the traditional method?\n\nOsborne: There are states like Arkansas, Pennsylvania, and Oregon that have rigorous apprenticeship programs for juniors and seniors in high school. They learn half in the classroom and half on the job, including skills that are technologically sophisticated but don't require a liberal arts degree.\n\nApprenticeships are just one example of how we need to rethink what we teach. New York commissioned a survey of employers and employees within the state to find out what skills they needed in their workforce. The survey asked if employees needed algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. The vast majority of those surveyed said no. They said that employees need logic, probability, statistics, and measurement.\n\nNow, maybe those subjects are beginning to be taught, but in 99 percent of schools, it's still algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. There's not a hell of a lot of computer programming being taught in the high schools, and that's a skill that's clearly useful in this economy. This economy needs people who are able to think on their feet, work in teams, be very flexible. But we're still teaching people mostly to memorize and spit it back. We won't get an enormous amount of change in how we teach until we make these schools compete with each other so that they have an incentive to change.\n\nIf you want to see what I mean, visit the District 4 school system in East Harlem and then visit a New York district that doesn't have choice. Ask yourself, where are the poor kids doing best, and why are they doing best? When you look at the test scores in East Harlem, you realize there's been dramatic improvement. It has brought what was the worst district in New York fifteen years ago up to the median level. When you walk through the schools, you're still looking at students who are performing at the median. But everyone admits it's a hell of a lot better than it used to be.\n\nMJ: Many education reforms could threaten the job security of teachers. Should we expect to see free-agent teachers starting to turn up?\n\nOsborne: Part of the idea of the charter schools is that a good teacher who is incredibly frustrated-and there are a lot of teachers who fit that description-would get five other good teachers together and start a charter school. They would be free agents contracting with the school district. They wouldn't be salaried employees anymore. We should open the door for that kind of relationship, which is a much more professional relationship.\n\nOne of the things teachers say is that they want to be treated as professionals. Well, most professionals are not tenured employees. So let's pay them better but also let them be more at risk in the marketplace.\n\nMJ: Is it tougher to reform education than other government functions?\n\nOsborne: It's probably easier, because the public cares about education so intensely. The public sends its most precious possession, its children, to the public schools. There's nothing that the government does that people care about more than education.\n\nThat's the reason education has gone so much further along the path of reinvention than the rest of the public sector. Education is clearly five or ten years out in front of most of the public sector in terms of how much it's changed. If you look at everything that's going on around the country and put it all together, you realize that our public-education system in ten years is going to look radically different than it looked ten years ago.\n\nJosh Clark, a Boston-based freelance writer who contributes frequently to Mother Jones, interviewed David Osborne for this article.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

The program's goal is \"disrupting the dominant narrative that reproductive justice is a 'women's issue.'\"\n\n\"There has been a lot of important conversation lately about rape culture, victim blaming, and masculinity, but it's likely that many of the people who most need take part have not been brought into the dialogue,\" says Andrew Jenkins, a field associate for Choice USA. \"Bro-Choice is intended to reach those men who might recognize sexism and rape culture when they see it, even if they wouldn't use those terms.

      "text": "Are You Pro-Choice?\n\nPerhaps, like me, you've heard that sometimes too much choice is bad.  Consumers get paralyzed by the array of products on offer and just can't make up their minds, so they simply choose to buy nothing. This effect has been demonstrated in experiments several times, but via Tyler Cowen, Tim Harford writes that these experiments may not have been as robust as we thought:\n\nBenjamin Scheibehenne, a psychologist at the University of Basel, was thinking along these lines when he decided (with Peter Todd and, later, Rainer Greifeneder) to design a range of experiments to figure out when choice demotivates, and when it does not.\n\nBut a curious thing happened almost immediately. They began by trying to replicate some classic experiments - such as the jam study, and a similar one with luxury chocolates. They couldn't find any sign of the \"choice is bad\" effect. Neither the original Lepper-Iyengar experiments nor the new study appears to be at fault: the results are just different and we don't know why.\n\nAfter designing 10 different experiments in which participants were asked to make a choice, and finding very little evidence that variety caused any problems, Scheibehenne and his colleagues tried to assemble all the studies, published and unpublished, of the effect.\n\nThe average of all these studies suggests that offering lots of extra choices seems to make no important difference either way. There seem to be circumstances where choice is counterproductive but, despite looking hard for them, we don't yet know much about what they are. Overall, says Scheibehenne: \"If you did one of these studies tomorrow, the most probable result would be no effect.\" Perhaps choice is not as paradoxical as some psychologists have come to believe. One way or another, we seem to be able to cope with it.\n\nInteresting!  Perhaps the paradox of choice used to be true in simpler times, but the internet and the rest of modern life have taught us to revel in choice, rather than being intimidated by it.  In a related vein, maybe it's a generational thing.  Maybe choice dazzles me more than it does a 20-something who grew up with 87 cell phone plans, 300 cable channels, and 1,000 Facebook friends.\n\nPersonally, I find a wide array of choice intimidating mainly if I'm trying to buy something brand new that I don't know anything about.  If there are 20 different kinds of cough syrup on the shelf, and I've never bought cough syrup before, I might just give up on the whole thing and keep on coughing.  I suppose that's pretty obvious, but it might explain the differences in some of the experiments.  If you showed me a huge variety of wines, I might throw up my hands in despair rather than trying to puzzle out which one to buy.  Show me an equally huge variety of candy bars and I'd pretty quickly narrow it down to half a dozen that I liked and then choose one.  That's because I consume a lot more candy bars than I do wine.\n\nIt's worth noting that whether or not social scientists are certain that the paradox of choice really exists, good sales people are certain that it does.  Watch a good sales person at work, and you'll notice that one of the first things they do is try to narrow your choices for you if you seem even the least bit confused.  When they ask what features are most important to you, they're trying to narrow your choices.  When they ask what things you don't like, they're trying to narrow your choices.  When they ask about your price range, they're trying to narrow your choices.  Because they know in their hearts that if they can just get you down to two or three alternatives, there's a pretty good chance you'll get seriously invested in the decision process and then eventually choose one of them.\n\nSo how about you?  When do you get intimidated by choice?\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "\"If You Make That Choice, He Will End Up in Prison.\"\n\nAnthony Conwright December 5, 2023\n\nJanet Mac\n\nJanet Mac\n\nThe United States guarantees 7.2 million students with disabilities an equal education. But the system is broken. For this package, we spoke with students, parents, teachers, and advocates about the dire state of-and efforts to fix-programs for students with disabilities. You can read all the stories here .\n\nWhen Shiloh told me about being restrained by white administrators at his Denver public school, his face was offscreen. I would shy away too-I was a stranger on a Zoom screen asking him questions about a traumatic event. Occasionally, parts of his shirt or curly afro made it into the frame as he sat beside his mother, Lynne, a mental health therapist, her eyes tender and focused on him. I asked, \"What did they do to you that you didn't like?\"\n\n\"Hurting me,\" said Shiloh, age 10. \"There was this one time where they had to pick me up and put me on their shoulder.\" Then he stopped again. I asked, \"Does talking about it make you upset?\" No reply.\n\n\"How are you feeling, bud?\" asked Lynne, who asked me to use only first names due to privacy concerns. She had never heard before that he was thrown over a staff member's shoulder.\n\n\"A tad bit upset,\" Shiloh said. Lynne turned away from him, concealing her eyes with her palms.\n\nWhen Lynne returned her gaze to the screen, her eyes swelled with a shame and grief that is palpable to any self-described \"full-time, solo mom\" who has a child with a disability and an Individualized Education Program . In an IEP, educators and families collaborate to create a plan specific to the student's individual needs and catalog the services a student requires to meet the goals outlined in the plan. Because an IEP is a living document, it can be a lot to track, especially for single parents.\n\nI am a 50 percent custody father of a 12-year-old autistic son in South Jersey. We begged our district to give our son a certified autistic aide for lunch and recess. Our son was beaten up by another 1st grader. No teacher even reported this until I saw my son's black eye. We now pay for online classes with zero help from our district! We are fortunate we can afford this, but many others are being ignored. -John Black\n\nRead more responses here .\n\n\"I failed him,\" Lynne said. \"I brought him to the place that was harming him. I specialize in neurodivergence. I have an education, I know the system, and I still couldn't protect him.\"\n\nLater in our call, I asked Shiloh if he felt he was treated poorly because of his race. \"Mm-hmm,\" he hummed. I asked, \"How did the way you were being treated make you feel about being Black?\" Shiloh said, \"Kind of bad. Like everyone else was kind of better than me.\"\n\nShiloh's school told Lynne that he was cursing, kicking, locking himself in a closet, and throwing objects in the classroom. Once, he walked out of his classroom to shoot spitballs onto the ceiling and walls of the boys' bathroom. Lynne says school officials began alluding to placing him in an affective needs center-a program for students with severe social-emotional issues, where they're separated from the general-education population.\n\nLynne knew she was coming face-to-face with a well-documented but alarming pattern: Black boys are much more likely than other children to be diagnosed with behavioral or intellectual problems, and they're overrepresented among students receiving disability services under the Department of Education's Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. Black students are more likely to be identified with an emotional disturbance than all other students with disabilities.\n\nThis, in turn, makes them more likely than their white counterparts and students of other races to be removed from classrooms and placed in affective needs centers. While sometimes necessary, in general separating kids from the rest of the student body has been shown to result in lower academic outcomes. In recent years, Denver Public Schools was 4.5 times more likely to place Black male students in affective needs centers than kids of any other race or ethnicity.\n\nToo often, these kinds of programs facilitate the segregation of Black students, especially boys, and can be a one-way ticket to a poor education. According to Denver Public Schools data , between 2016 and 2019, only 1 percent of Black students in affective needs centers met or exceeded expectations on statewide assessments for math. (That figure is 3 percent for English language arts.) Of the 55 Black seniors in Denver's ANCs expected to graduate high school, 21 did. Only six went on to enroll in college.\n\n\"Shiloh has ADHD, he is neurodiverse, and he's a Black boy,\" Lynne said. \"If my son were a little white girl, he would not have been treated this way.\" Lynne withdrew Shiloh from his school in December 2021.\n\nLike Lynne, I, too, know the system. I worked in education for 14 years, and, as a former teacher, I can see both sides.\n\nHere is how it is supposed to work: Every child with a diagnosed disability (nearly 15 percent of all students last year) gets an IEP, like Shiloh did. The Department of Education wants kids with disabilities to remain in classrooms alongside those without disabilities because it boosts learning; the IEP is meant to help the child flourish in such a setting. But in some states, such as Colorado , a child diagnosed with a \"serious emotional disability,\" defined broadly as \"emotional or social functioning which prevents the child from receiving reasonable educational benefit from general-education,\" can be removed from the classroom and placed in an affective needs center.\n\nIn theory, the system is designed to be tailored to every child's needs. \"IDEA assumes that every child with a disability, the place you start with is the general-education classroom. There are times that it's appropriate to move away from the general-education classroom based on the individual needs of the child, but you don't move away from that general-education classroom simply because the child wears a label,\" says Paul Foster, the executive director of Colorado DOE's Office of Special Education. \"The system is there to protect every child to ensure that a child-by-child decision is made.\"\n\nNot all schools have affective needs programs. The school in New York where I was an administrator didn't have one because it placed a premium on keeping kids together-students with disabilities are less likely to feel ostracized and to endure segregation or harmful stereotyping. I support that philosophy, but I can also easily recall feeling hopeless knowing that I could not remove, for example, a sixth-grader who was struggling to find success in the general-education setting, even with the help of a classroom aide. He was bullying his peers and spiraling into physical tantrums. On one occassion, after his teacher asked him to leave the classroom due to his behavior, he responded, \"Fuck you, you Indian bitch.\"\n\nI feel for teachers at their wits' end. No matter how much a teacher wants to keep a struggling student integrated into the general-education classroom 100 percent of the time, the school may not have the resources to support that student. This shortcoming is not always intentional or nefarious. IDEA mandates are not always easy to fulfill. In some cases, underfunded schools that are often short-staffed-especially now, in the midst of a nationwide teacher shortage-do not have the personnel or space to provide all the supports written into a student's IEP.\n\nIdeally, I would have been able to provide every resource for that sixth-grader-a one-on-one aide, sensory materials like weighted blankets, and better training for myself so I could understand how to address a student with oppositional defiant disorder, ADHD, and anger management challenges-for him and every other student who needed it. But the school just didn't have the personnel or finances. So I had to keep this kid in his classroom. No matter how many students he bullied, insults he hurled, or times he disrupted the classroom, I had to honor his IDEA rights. On top of that, I knew if I made the case to remove this Black student from the school, I was making him a statistic.\n\nLynne's assumption that her Black son would be displaced in academic purgatory is not a figment of her imagination. In fact, the Colorado Department of Education confirms her intuition. Last year, in response to a complaint by AdvocacyDenver, a nonprofit civil rights organization that advocates for children with disabilities to be educated in the least restrictive environment, the department conducted a sweeping investigation of affective needs centers in Denver. It found that the district was too hastily moving Black kids into affective needs programs: While only 14 percent of the district's students were Black, more than a third of ANC students were Black boys.\n\n\"Affective Needs Center-based programming is one of our most glaring examples of institutionalized racism with Denver Public Schools,\" says Pam Bisceglia, the executive director of AdvocacyDenver. \"We see too many times kids are fast-tracked out of the school, particularly kids with behavioral issues.\"\n\nMy son currently has an IEP that partly failed. I am of the last of the no-child-left-behind generation and was in special ed. At a time when IEPs and 504s were just being developed. Today I wonder, will my son have to continue struggling from similar theoretical plans that have no practical way of being implemented, while the system continues to use kiddos as guinea pigs just to show they are actively doing something? -Andrew D.\n\nRead more responses here .\n\nThis fast-tracking starts long before ANCs are even in the picture. Black kids are suspended and expelled at higher rates in Denver. In June 2021, the US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights released national data that showed that during the 2017-2018 school year, Black students accounted for 28.7 percent of all students referred to law enforcement and 31.6 percent of all students arrested at school or during a school-related activity. That's double the proportion of Black students nationwide (15.1 percent). The trend extends to Black students served under IDEA: Black students represent 2.3 percent of all students served under IDEA, yet accounted for 8.4 percent of students referred to law enforcement and 9.1 percent of students who were arrested.\n\nBisceglia says the reason is racism, essentially: Teachers, most of whom are women and white (when I taught, I was one of the 1.3 percent of Black men in the profession), tend to pathologize Black boys and perceive their behavior as more dangerous. This is the opposite of what should be happening: IDEA requires schools to \"draw upon information from various sources\" to determine a student's eligibility for disability programs. This includes parent input, teacher recommendations, and the student's social and cultural background. Foster acknowledges that lack of cultural competence is a factor in the overrepresentation. \"They may have made a pretty significant decision about identifying a child with a particular kind of disability, like serious emotional disturbance based on a single piece of information.\"\n\nMonique Griffith is the director of the Institute for Generational Resilience Informed by Trauma at Hofstra University and spent more than 15 years consulting in public schools as a psychologist. She suggests more thorough and careful evaluation of behavioral issues to help correct the funneling of Black students into options outside of general education. \"[Black] children who are classified [with a disability] need some flexibility when it comes to policy,\" said Griffith. \"Our children who have an IEP need more effort, more flexibility, and creativity when it comes to providing support. If we're not shifting the question from 'What's wrong with you?' to asking the child 'What happened to you?' we're going to keep seeing the referrals to Special Education.\" Without this modification, Black students will continue experiencing disproportionate discipline in school, segregation from general-education classrooms, and even the school-to-prison pipeline.\n\n\"That is exactly what was gonna happen to Shiloh,\" Lynne recently told me. \"When they were talking about putting him in the affective needs program, I said, 'If you make that choice, he will end up in prison. That's the trajectory you're trying to put my 8-year-old on.'\"\n\nI wonder how much suffering Shiloh could have been spared if he had been allowed to show up as his full self and still be treated with care and support. I don't feel the educational system was designed for Black people-for their experience to contribute to the economy of academia. From bans on abolitionist literature to the establishment of the country's first standardized curriculum , segregated schools, and contemporary efforts to ban critical race theory and the \"1619 Project,\" the ends of the educational system are clear: Blackness is unwelcomed and needs to be segregated. The system still seems to displace Black kids as much as possible-whether or not they have disabilities. Black teachers have to carry out discipline or be disciplined themselves. This leads to Black teachers, like me, leaving the field.\n\nBut despite my complicated feelings about the field of education, I can look at examples like Lynne and Shiloh and feel some sense of hope. At his new private school, Shiloh gets to make mistakes and fully be himself, his mom said. She also recently told me about how he is learning to dismantle negative thoughts about himself.\n\n\"When he was at his old school, he'd always tell me he's a bad kid, he was wrong, and all this negative stuff,\" Lynne said. \"But, roughly six months ago, he started saying to me, 'I believe in myself; I can do it.'\"\n\nRead the rest of our package on the state of education for students with disabilities here .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Will Ranked-Choice Voting Kill MAGA? No. Are Republicans Banning It Anyway? Yup.\n\nAlaskans learn about ranked choice voting in a mock election for drag queens. Mark Thiessen/ AP\n\nIt's the system to \" save America, \" to some experts. To Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, it's a \"scam.\" The ever-so-eloquent wordsmith Donald Trump called it \"crap voting\" and a \"total rigged deal.\" Its backers see it as a path back to political diversity. So do its opponents. None of them are right. It's ranked-choice voting, Alaska-style.\n\nIn November, Alaska's high-profile House and Senate races pitted Trump backers against moderates, a test of the state's famous independent streak. That quickly made Alaska the most prominent state to use ranked-choice voting, which it debuted in that election. The system, which redistributes a losing candidate's votes to their supporters' second choices, is increasingly hyped as an anti-extremism silver bullet. Alaska, where ranked-choice helped take down the MAGA crowd, is a key part of that. But it's just one of three states, two counties, and at least 58 municipalities that use it-from Maine, which enacted RCV in 2016, to Nevada and six cities, including Seattle and Portland, that just voted to adopt it.\n\nBut it's Alaska, where no Democrat has held major office since 2008, that's driving ranked-choice voting's new reputation as a \"surprisingly simple tinker that could fix our democracy.\" The state's MAGA candidates, boosted by Trump's two-for-two record there, were poised to do well in November. But Rep. Mary Peltola broke that streak in Alaska's House, beating celebrity ex-governor Sarah Palin with help from ranked-choice. In the Senate, \" disloyal and very bad \" Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski-unlike other Republicans who stood up to Trump-was spared a certain primary takedown by his handpicked candidate. That's entirely thanks to Alaska's new system.\n\nPeltola \"is kind of a poster child\" for what ranked-choice voting can do, says Rob Richie, the president of FairVote, a nonpartisan advocacy group that backs ranked-choice. Peltola, a former state legislator, picked up enough second- and third-choice votes to flip Congress' longest-standing GOP seat in an August special election, despite initially lacking the funding of her conservative competitors.\n\nRCV's advocates say that it creates a healthier political culture, with more opportunity to pick a candidate voters actually like, rather than the lesser of two evils. They also argue that ranked-choice disfavors extremists' go-to strategy of rallying their base to flood low-turnout primaries. But transforming political culture and checking extremism are huge undertakings, and ultimately, Richie says, \"RCV is just a ballot type.\" It won't unleash a bunch of nonexistent moderates , favor an ideology, or reduce the actual number of extremists. It's a modest way to better empower the electorate, with growing bipartisan support. The problem: Republicans are banning it anyway.\n\nIn February, Tennessee Republicans outlawed ranked-choice voting because officials in Shelby County, home to Memphis, talked about reviving a 2008 RCV law that was signed but never implemented. In March, Florida Republicans passed another ban on ranked-choice as a little-noticed part of Gov. Ron DeSantis' widely criticized election bill , media coverage of which focused on its new state force of \" election police \" to investigate supposed voter fraud.\n\nPalin blamed the system for her back-to-back losses in the special election and midterms, despite the fact that she is wildly unpopular in Alaska. She's repeatedly called ranked-choice \" un-American ,\" and signed a petition to put it to another statewide vote, although the Alaska Supreme Court has already upheld RCV in the face of challenges. In any case, the system has actually benefited Alaska Republicans, who narrowly took the state House after second-choice votes helped two Republicans pull ahead .\n\nBut there are other avenues for ballot reform: Alaska also switched to nonpartisan primaries, which Nevada has now adopted as well. Like RCV, nonpartisan primaries are a tweak-they're not the escape from party \"tyranny\" sought by backers like food magnate and \"rational centrist\" Katherine Gehl, a major force behind Nevada's RCV drive.\n\n\"If the hope is that there are going to be more moderate candidates,\" says Dan Lee , a political scientist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, \"the problem is that there isn't clear evidence that they have that effect.\" Alaska may have elected some moderates, but that's a minuscule sample-and the most extreme candidates still made it to the general. (Maine, also famously independent-minded, uses RCV but maintains party primaries.)\n\nIn a nonpartisan system, there's no guarantee that the major parties will make it to the final ballot. That was a fear for Democrats in the days before the Alaska primary: Peltola, finishing fourth, barely advanced to a general election that would otherwise have included just Republicans and an independent. And not everyone thinks disempowering political parties should be the goal. \"Anti-party reform doesn't rest on a coherent theory of politics,\" says Jack Santucci, a political scientist at Drexel University in Philadelphia. \"A coherent theory begins with the observation that politics is about choosing sides.\"\n\nBoth Lee and Santucci emphasize the importance of other reforms. Santucci suggests, among other things, multi-seat Congressional districts . Lee believes that a true open system, in which independents or third-party voters could vote in an establishment party's primaries, would be a step in the right direction. \"I don't think RCV needs to be a single thing,\" says Richie, the FairVote head. \"It's a better ballot type. Making sure votes count is the common thread.\"\n\nThe GOP, and its desperate measures to block those changes, face a problem: the will of the electorate. Ranked-choice voting has growing bipartisan support , as November's elections proved. So does ballot reform in general . The MAGA politicians banning it? Not so much .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Tulsi Gabbard Is a Uniquely Bad Choice for Director of National Intelligence\n\nTulsi Gabbard at a Trump campaign rally in Pittsburgh on November 4, 2024. Matt Freed/AP\n\nDonald Trump's appointment announcements are getting weird.\n\nThe president-elect's selection of Susie Wiles as his chief of staff, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as his secretary of state nominee, suggested a step toward GOP convention. But Trump's pick of former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as his director of national intelligence-along with his announced plans to nominate Fox News host Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense, and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) for attorney general, represent a pivot toward the kooky.\n\nTrump plans to put Gabbard, a dabbler in conspiracy theories, in a job overseeing 18 spy agencies, with responsiblity for preparing the president's daily intelligence briefing. Gabbard did not respond to inquiries on Wednesday.\n\nGabbard's nomination was announced Wednesday by longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone, who read Trump's press release on the pick aloud on Alex Jones' conspiracy-mongering InfoWars minutes before the release went public .\n\nGabbard, a former lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, is a one-time middle-of-the-road Democratic member of Congress who has evolved into a Trump supporter. She moved leftward in 2016-endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders that year-and ran for the party's presidential nomination in 2020 on a campaign that blasted the Democratic foreign policy establishment, before endorsing Trump this year.\n\nAlong the way, Gabbard has demonstrated excessive credulity about claims of autocrats hostile to the United States. In 2017, she drew fire for meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during a secret trip to Syria. Later that year, she said she was skeptical of US intelligence findings that led then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to say US officials had \"a very high level of confidence\" that chemical weapons attacks that killed dozens of people in Syria were carried out under Assad's direction.\n\nGabbard's position aligned with arguments from Russian officials, who provided key backing to Assad and argued that the 2017 attack was staged by agents of the United Kingdom.\n\nGabbard again bolstered Russian propaganda in 2022, when she tweeted a video repeating Kremlin claims that US-funded labs in Ukraine were developing biological weapons. The Russian claims appeared to be largely made-up justifications for Russia invading its neighbor.\n\nGabbard's comments drew widespread criticism. \"Tulsi Gabbard is parroting false Russian propaganda,\" Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) tweeted at the time. \"Her treasonous lies may well cost lives.\"\n\nGabbard has defended her various statements as examples of her willingness to buck a hawkish Washington foreign policy establishment too eager to drop bombs. \"I am here to help prevent World War III,\" she told Fox News on Monday.\n\nBut in defying what she dubs conventional views, Gabbard has demonstrated a high tolerance for conspiracy theories and disinformation: that is, she seems wide-open to bullshit.\n\nThat's a particularly problematic penchant for someone tasked with advising the president on US intelligence findings-but it appears to be a quality this particular president desires.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Putting Lipstick on a Pig\n\nThe plain-text truth of the matter is that since Eisenhower warned against the \"military-industrial complex,\" the defense industry has been one big \"Jobs for America\" program. There are two ways to look at our \"military-industrial complex.\" The first is as a powerful tool to protect the country. The second is as a resource-sapping beast with an insatiable appetite for money and tremendous political influence. More specifically, as  the proverbial 800-pound gorilla that sleeps, craps, and sits wherever it damn well pleases. Defense is America's brand now, and no one bats an eye as long as they profit from the whole process. That is the way you get your yes-men who fail to think for themselves and question anything. As a consequence Americans now pay taxes via a national debt totalling about 8.3 trillion dollars. The annual interest on the national debt is equal to what we spent on defense just three years ago. Corruption, the practice of skimming money and proceeds from any and all fiscal governmental goings-on, is rampant. Why it goes unaddressed is in and of itself the topic for multiple volumes, but the bitter fact remains that it goes unaddressed, and therefore isn't stopped. There needs to be a civilian independent and fiscally disinterested public body whose entire mission in life is to provide direct, authoritative external third party oversight of the military, to ensure fiscal frugality and effectiveness. This is the whole \"checks and balances\" thing, and right now our whole system is not in balance, due to the fact that the 2 top people that run our country are elbow-deep in money coming from both oil and defense. That represents a textbook conflict-of-interest, and is a situation that needs to be changed. Nationally, we're going to have to make a choice, whether we're going to accept Bushonomics or start choking back on the federal purse strings. This means reverting to John F. Kennedy and his famous \"ask not\" concept. Bert Walker Praise the Lord and Pass the Petition Some of your readers may make the mistake of mixing up the concepts of \"religion\" - which is essentially an organized approach to spirituality - and \"spirituality\" itself, which is the message, often but not always presented to us though religion or religious organizations. Many religious teachers do not openly espouse any given religion, but note the commonality in the spiritual messages of each organized religion. The U.S. Constitution is one of the most spiritual documents ever written. It declares that we have rights that are not decreed by governments but are essential to us because we are human beings. That document says that churches or organized religions should not be a part of government, perhaps because the very act of setting up an organized religion creates an \"us vs. them\" mentality. Such dualities are not part of any modern religion and should not be part of religion, but are. While this duality was part of the Old Testament, it is not a part of the New Testament. Many Jewish people are very open to other faiths, although they espouse their own, by choice of tradition. Most Muslims are driven by the spirituality of peace, not the hate of the fundamentalists who kill even fellow Muslims with whom they have minor differences. Let us remember that hate is a terrible perversion of love; sometimes the opposite of love. All spiritualities teach love, not hate. Some sects of some religions have perverted the teaching of their faiths to preach hate, not love, making a perversions of their basic faiths. Let us remember the message of that great spiritual document, the U.S. Constitution, that we are beloved creatures, by simply being people. That applies to all people, as we are all people of God, however we call Him. Jim H. White Canada Hydrogen's Dirty Secret You are missing the point. The only way America can transition from fossil fuel to hydrogen is if people can convince politicians in Washington that such a change won't harm the energy market. Subsidies will be necessary in the beginning which means accepting a temporary compromise. The most difficult part of the transition away from fossil fuels will be changing the energy infrastructure. Who will produce the hydrogen? Who will refine it? Who will distribute it and who will transport it? Can this all be done efficiently and at a profit? As these questions are being solved by Exxon and BP, smaller research companies will find it easier to attract investors into the clean hydrogen fold.  Once a cost-effective system for producing hydrogen from water is developed and marketed, it will simply be a matter of time before common sense prevails. Be patient.

      "text": "I Am Excited to See if We Get Another Sweet Little Ranked-Choice-Voting Presentation From Maine\n\nI was in line for chili in the Longworth House Office building's cafeteria when my editor messaged me: The Maine secretary of state was about to tabulate the results of the state's 2nd congressional district race. It was November 2018 and Democrats had already secured their new House majority, but the stakes of ME-02 were still high: It was a district Trump had won in 2016-a victory that gave him an electoral college vote, thanks to Maine's wonky distribution -and it would be the first-ever House race decided by ranked-choice voting. I'd covered Maine a bit earlier in the cycle and wanted to see how this new system played out.\n\nMainers are an independent lot who, like men I once dated, don't really like to put a \"label\" on things-in particular, on their political party affiliation. In many races, Democratic and Republican candidates are joined by those affiliated with minor political parties or who run as independents. Ranked-choice voting allows voters to vote for multiple candidates, in order of preference. The candidate with more than 50 percent of the vote wins; if that doesn't happen on the first round of voting, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are redistributed to their voters' second-choice candidate. This continues round by round until a candidate has a majority of the votes.\n\nSo, chili secured, I sat down to watch the presentation.\n\nThe secretary of state's office directed me to a Facebook livestream , which was trained in the direction of a projector screen dancing with the familiar swirl of the Windows 7 screensaver. Matt Dunlap, the Maine secretary of state, and Julie Flynn, his deputy, stood to the side, awkwardly vamping as they awaited-I shit you not-for a staffer to load up a memory stick with the results and work through a find-and-replace in Microsoft Excel to account for spelling irregularities with a candidate's name. Oh, so this was how this was gonna go? Ranked-choice voting was touted as the sophisticated evolution in democracy reform that voting rights advocates have been boosting for years. It was supposed to free us of our two-party tyranny, to be the hominid to our Neanderthal plurality methods that gave us George W. Bush instead of Al Gore because Ralph Nader didn't get dismissed for his measly 2.74 percent. And here it was...in the hands of...Ctrl+H and a laptop that looked no more sophisticated than what I'd written my college papers on.\n\nTen minutes passed. (That was fine; as I mentioned, I had chili.) Then 15. Then 20. My faith in fair and safe elections was frankly feeling a little tested as the minutes wore on. But the delay also afforded Dunlap and Flynn to settle into a charming little routine that was part slapstick, part civics lesson, on every step of their shoestring-looking operation that ultimately assuaged my growing fears. Over the course of 27 minutes, viewers like me learned all about ExpressRunoff (the computer program used to run the ranked-choice-voting algorithm), why some ballots had to be manually tabulated instead of scanned into the results on the memory stick (there's a lot of people who like to spill things on ballots in the Pine Tree State, turns out), and Dunlap and Flynn's astrological signs (Dunlap is a \"big picture guy\" Sagittarius; Flynn a Virgo who \"can't see the forest for the tick that is on the white pine needle on the trees\").\n\nAnd then- bloop ! There the results were. Election over: Democrat Jared Golden won. There were cheers! Not for Jared-that is against the rules of a nonpartisan office, after all-but oh my god, this janky little setup worked! Maine's experiment to satisfy all of its fiercely independent political factions had gotten it done.\n\nSusan Collins detractors, I'm sure, do not share in my hope to see some sort of ranked-choice replay this year. They'd like to see Democrat Sara Gideon win in a landslide on the first ballot and render the precious Excel presentation moot. But I really hope I get to watch the Mainers have their particularly Mainer moment: Their very human ballot tabulation that's been tailor-made to their deeply Mainer selves. - Kara Voght\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump's Choice of Fracking CEO Chris Wright as Energy Secretary Heralds a Swamp Revival\n\nTrump shakes hands with Continental Resources founder Harold Hamm at the Shale Insight Conference in Pittsburgh, October 23, 2019. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nAmericans of a certain age tend to throw around the term \"Orwellian\" willy-nilly. But the expression really suits in describing the behavior of our felonious , twice-impeached president-elect .\n\nIn George Orwell's classic novel 1984 , a dictatorship represented by the all-powerful \"Big Brother\" dictates the reality its citizens must adhere to, however topsy-turvy. Official slogans include \"ignorance is strength,\" \"freedom is slavery,\" and \"war is peace.\"\n\nIn this context, another slogan comes to mind: \"Drain the swamp.\"\n\nTrump didn't invent this populist expression, but he made it a centerpiece of his first campaign-a vow to rid DC of the toxic influence of special interest money, lobbyists, etc. Of course, politicians of both parties have long railed, often without much credibility, against special interests in Washington, and the US Supreme Court's trashing of campaign finance safeguards has indeed created a cesspool of oligarchic influence in DC that crosses party lines.\n\nIt's not the slogan itself that's Orwellian. The Orwellian part is Trump's evocation of the Swamp as he appoints foxes to guard the federal henhouse yet again. It's a trolling of the libs, but a trolling with potentially dire consequences-and a signal that our government is for sale, more openly now than ever.\n\nExhibit A: Trump's selection of Chris Wright, the CEO of a Denver fracking services company called Liberty Energy, for the position of energy secretary. Wright has no government experience and certainly no experience related to the nuclear weapons whose oversight is a critical part of DOE's role.\n\nMeanwhile, as typical of Trump's cabinet picks to date, Wright's other qualifications for the job are-to use Orwellian \"Newspeak\"- doubleplusungood .\n\nIt has escaped nobody's notice that Trump's top consideration in doling out key positions is loyalty to the boss. For attorney general, he chose Matt Gaetz , an inexperienced lawyer (but fierce loyalist) who has been accused of sexual impropriety- no charges were ever filed -and is notorious for allegedly foisting upon House colleagues videos of women he's bedded. For his director of national intelligence, Trump picked Tulsi Gabbard, a former congresswoman my colleague Dan Friedman describes as a \" uniquely bad choice .\" Namely, she lacks intelligence experience and is so in sync with Vladimir Putin's propaganda machine that her nomination was even celebrated on Russian television . To oversee White House communications, he picked a bomb-thrower who cut his teeth at UFC . For Health, he chose Robert Kennedy Jr., a man with no academic expertise in the areas he would oversee, and whose views and priorities are far from the mainstream , as my colleague David Corn has reported. (In this administration, apparently, ignorance is indeed strength.)\n\nWright, too, is a loyalist, but this pick feels distinctly transactional- Swamplike . Trump, after all, met multiple times during his campaign with top fossil-fuel CEOs, promising that, if they gave him money and helped him get elected, they would be richly rewarded . Wright, who denies the climate crisis and completely dismisses the US clean energy transition-which is weird, because it is well under way , despite the fossil fuel industry's attempts to thwart it-is the industry's reward. As was Trump's choice for Interior, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgham, who is apparently champing at the bit to expand drilling on federal land.\n\nThe New York Times reports that Wright's wife, Liz, co-hosted a Trump fund-raiser in Montana, and that the couple donated a total of $350,000 to a Trump campaign committee. Most notably, Wright was the preferred choice of oil billionaire Harold Hamm, a major Trump donor and co-host of gatherings where  candidate Trump wooed oil executives with what sounded suspiciously like a pay-to-play pitch.\n\nHamm has been playing the political money game for ages. As former Mother Jones reporter Josh Harkinson wrote in an early profile of the oilman, Hamm began supporting political causes in earnest starting in 2007, founding a group called the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance (slogan: \"Good things flow from American oil\") and giving millions of dollars to candidates and right-wing causes supported by the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch-including nearly $1 million to support Mitt Romney's unsuccessful 2012 bid for the White House.\n\nIn his rush to exploit North Dakota's Bakken Shale, Harkinson wrote in 2012, Hamm's company, Continental Resources , \"has ridden roughshod over environmental laws....\n\nDocuments acquired by ProPublica show that it has spilled at least 200,000 gallons of oil in North Dakota since 2009, far more than any other company. That year, in one of its few formal citations against oil companies, the state's health department fined Continental $428,500 for poisoning two creeks with thousands of gallons of brine and crude, but later reduced the amount to $35,000 . Around the same time, during a thaw, four Continental waste pits overflowed, spilling a toxic soup onto the surrounding land. The Industrial Commission said it would fine the company $125,000, but it ultimately reduced the sum to less than $14,000, since \"the wet conditions created circumstances that were unforeseen by Continental.\"\n\nHamm stepped up for Trump in 2016, securing a VIP seat at the 2017 inauguration and exerting his influence during Trump's first term. From the Washington Post :\n\nIn early 2020, he lobbied Trump to help persuade Saudi Arabia and Russia to end a price war that had driven down the price of oil below $0 a barrel, causing Hamm to lose $3 billion in just a few days.\n\nThe effort appeared to pay off. In April 2020, under pressure from Trump , members of OPEC, Russia and other oil-producing nations agreed to the largest production cuts ever negotiated -nearly 10 million barrels a day-as oil demand collapsed during the pandemic.\n\nThis time around, Hamm, now Continental's executive chairman, and his fellow oil and gas executives, would love to see some of those pesky environmental regulations go bye-bye, including the fines imposed under President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act on drillers who spew waste methane-a particularly potent greenhouse gas and primary component of so-called natural gas-into the atmosphere.\n\nThe purpose of regulating the fossil fuel industry is to ensure Americans clean air and water and at least some hope of escaping the worst ravages of a warming planet. Killing such regulations, and preventing new ones that cost his donors money, is a big part of what this second Trump administration-not to mention the US Supreme Court, with its decisions crippling the automony of federal agencies-is poised to deliver.\n\nCall it Swamp 2.0.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

In fact, it was earlier this month when Donald Trump declared that that the U.S. would not defend NATO member nations against an attack if those countries had not met defense spending benchmarks.\n\nWith this in mind, the next U.S. ambassador to NATO will need to be highly skilled, mindful of history, sensitive to international relationships and adept at maintaining strained partnerships. So who, pray tell, will be that next ambassador? The Associated Press reported :\n\nThe Senate confirmed Matt Whitaker late Tuesday as President Donald Trump's U.S. ambassador to NATO, a crucial emissary to the Western alliance at a time of growing concern about the American commitment abroad. Whitaker, who had served in Trump's first administration at the Justice Department, brings a law enforcement background rather than deep foreign policy or national security ties. He was confirmed by the Senate on a vote of 52-45.\n\nThough a few senators missed the vote, Whitaker, who said during his confirmation hearings that the administration's support for NATO would be \" ironclad ,\" was confirmed entirely by Republican senators .\n\nIt's easy to imagine some of those GOP senators, at least privately, coming to regret the move sometime fairly soon.\n\nWhitaker will represent the U.S. despite having literally no background in diplomacy, international affairs, foreign policy, national security, military policy or NATO.\n\nHe did, however, play college football at the University of Iowa and later claimed that he was an Academic All-American - despite the fact that he was not an Academic All-American .\n\nHe also helped lead an odd marketing business that was the subject of an FBI criminal investigation and that was accused of being a \"scam\" operation before ultimately being shut down.\n\nI should mention that Whitaker does have a background in law enforcement, including work as a U.S. attorney in George W. Bush's administration, when Whitaker became well known for his legal pursuit of Iowa's first openly gay state legislator, whom Whitaker tried and failed to prosecute .\n\nHe was able to parlay this into a role as a legal commentator, which included making public criticisms of then-special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which naturally led Trump to make him chief of staff to the attorney general - where he reportedly advised the Trump White House on going after Hillary Clinton .\n\nEventually, Trump made Whitaker acting attorney general in late 2018 and early 2019, which proved to be a bit of a problem when the president told reporters, \"I don't know Matt Whitaker.\"\n\nAll of this and more was fleshed out in detail in a Rachel Maddow Show \" Public Servant Announcement ,\" released shortly before Trump was sworn in for a second term.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

      "text": "Marco Rubio may be one of the only adults in Trump's Cabinet\n\nWATCH LIVE: Journalists and political leaders take part in the 2025 White House Correspondents' Dinner\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nOn Jan. 21, president-elect Donald Trump will be sworn into office for the second time. Trump's first administration was concerning, but for the most part his Cabinet picks were viewed as adults in the room . Trump appointed distinguished generals James Mattis and John Kelly as his homeland security secretary and secretary of state, respectively. There were a few billionaires sprinkled in, as well as a couple of peculiar choices, like Department of Housing and Urban Development head Ben Carson. But mostly Trump's appointments seemed qualified and confirmable.\n\nUnlike others in his Cabinet cohort, Rubio is actually  a pretty responsible and solid choice, even if he will make some MAGA Republicans unhappy.\n\nThings are looking a lot different this time. Trump's picks this week include deeply unserious and unqualified candidates such as Matt Gaetz (prior to his abrupt resignation from Congress ), Tulsi Gabbard and Fox News host Pete Hegseth. But that still does not mean that all of the president-elect's picks are poor choices. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is likely to become the next secretary of state. And unlike others in his Cabinet cohort, Rubio is actually  a pretty responsible and solid choice, even if he will make some MAGA Republicans unhappy.\n\nFrom a political perspective, Rubio's selection suggests Trump is willing to look past (at least some) previous political attacks. Few politicos have forgotten the lurid comment Rubio made about the size of Trump's hands during the 2016 Republican primary. Then again, Trump was relentless in calling him \" little Marco .\" Rubio eventually fell into line. But then again, so did nearly every other Republican.\n\nRubio also, arguably, has at least some of the credentials and qualifications necessary for the position of secretary of state. He has been elected to the U.S. Senate three times, starting in 2010. He was also a serious contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Currently, Rubio serves as vice chairman of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and is a senior member of the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nRubio has worked with Democrats in the past, another good sign. In 2013, he was part of a group of four Democratic and four Republican senators known as the \" Gang of Eight \" that proposed comprehensive immigration legislation. The bipartisan legislation passed the Senate with a strong majority. But it failed to advance in the House of Representatives.\n\nAs vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, Rubio has also proven himself willing to take politics out of the equation when it comes to national security. He worked with committee Chairman Mark R. Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, to release a \" Bipartisan Report Detailing Foreign Intelligence Threats .\" The committee also successfully issued a joint statement on the \" national security threat posed by China.\"\n\nAs vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, Rubio has also proven himself willing to take politics out of the equation when it comes to national security.\n\nThere's also plenty of recent precedent for nominating senators for this role. President Barack Obama named two U.S. senators to head up his State Department: New York's Hillary Clinton in 2009 and Massachusetts' John Kerry. Clinton, a former first lady, had fought a contentious primary against then-Sen. Obama during the 2008 presidential nomination primary. Kerry was first elected to Senate in 1984 and went on to serve as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He was also the 2004 Democratic nominee for president, ultimately losing to George W. Bush.\n\nTrump, like all presidents before him, gets to pick his Cabinet. That's his privilege as the duly elected chief executive. And, thanks to the GOP's new Senate majority, most of those Cabinet picks will likely sail through the confirmation process. Rubio should be one of them.\n\nBut given his track record, Trump's foreign policy is also likely to be controversial. It will be dissected by policymakers and pundits and, perhaps, legal scholars. We cannot control what new and improved ideas Trump tries to implement. But we can hope that Rubio will take inspiration from those same adults in the room who helped control some of Trump's darkest impulses in 2016.\n\nSusan Del Percio is a Republican strategist and a political analyst for NBC News and MSNBC.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Matt Gaetz to lead the Justice Department, the result was a predicable fiasco: The unqualified, scandal-plagued, right-wing Florida congressman was forced to withdraw after just eight days.\n\nThe president-elect's choice to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration didn't even last that long. NBC News reported :\n\nChad Chronister, President-elect Donald Trump's selection to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, said Tuesday that he would withdraw from consideration. Chronister, who is the sheriff in Hillsborough County, Florida, said he would turn down Trump's planned nomination to be the next DEA administrator just three days after Trump announced it.\n\nChronister certainly isn't the first person to withdraw in the wake of a president-elect's announcement, but the fact that his prospective nomination only lasted from Saturday to Tuesday is quite extraordinary.\n\nThe larger question, of course, is why Chronister exited the stage so quickly.\n\nFor many Trump administration critics, the choice was quickly panned because Chronister, a local sheriff in Florida, appeared to have dubious qualifications. It also did not go unnoticed that Chronister is the son-in-law of a very wealthy man who received a pardon from Trump shortly before he exited the White House four years ago.\n\nBut it wasn't pressure from the left that derailed this prospective nomination.\n\nThe official explanation is that Trump's choice to lead the DEA made the decision to step aside as \"the gravity of this very important responsibility set in.\" As for the unofficial explanation, The Washington Post highlighted one of Chronister's biggest problems: He had too many critics on the right.\n\nSome conservatives had opposed Trump's choice of Chronister, citing the sheriff's enforcement of public health orders during the covid pandemic. The right-wing opposition crystallized around Chronister's arrest of a pastor who was charged with ignoring state and local public health orders by holding large church services in March 2020 - the same month the World Health Organization declared covid-19 a pandemic and Trump declared a national emergency.\n\nRepublican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, the day after Trump announced his choice to lead the DEA, said Chronister's efforts to keep his community safe during a pandemic \"disqualified\" him for the post. Around the same time, the far-right Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association issued a statement saying that it was \"shocked and dismayed\" by the selection.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that Chronister gave up on pursuing the post. [ Update : The president-elect said online that he pushed Chronister out, further discrediting the sheriff's official explanation.)\n\nLet's not forget the fact that Trump's election victory was less than a month ago, and he's already suffered two embarrassing personnel failures - with more potentially on the way.\n\nThose concerned about the president-elect's competence during the transition period have plenty of evidence to point to.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Kennedy Jr. is the subject of some notable new advertising - from a group with Republican ties and on a subject that is one of the Democratic Party's key campaign issues.\n\nThe new group, called \"SAG PAC,\" was established in June, according to a Federal Election Commission filing. It has not yet filed reports detailing any of its donors, but it is already running ads online, spending more than $137,000 so far on Google platforms, according to the platform's ad disclosure portal.\n\nThe YouTube ads feature pictures of Kennedy alongside banners reading \"pro-choice\" and \"progressive Democrat.\" Meanwhile, a narrator says, \"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wants to restore abortion rights nationally,\" adding that he has \"a long record fighting for abortion rights. That's the real RFK.\"\n\nThe color scheme and tone of the ads are cheerful. And the group behind the ads has Republican connections. Its bank account is at Chain Bridge Bank, a Virginia financial institution that has cornered the market on banking for Republican campaigns and PACs , including former President Donald Trump's. (The pro-Kennedy super PAC has also used Chain Bridge Bank, while Kennedy's campaign has used Amalgamated Bank, long favored by Democratic campaigns.)\n\nSAG PAC's treasurer is Charles Gantt, who is listed on FEC filings holding the same position for numerous PACs backing Republican candidates.\n\nThe ads, which are concentrated in five swing states , come amid a furious battle for support in the 2024 presidential race - and questions about whether Kennedy's presence on the ballot cuts more into Democratic candidate Kamala Harris' potential base or Trump's.\n\nBy calling Kennedy \"pro-choice,\" the ad appears designed to attract voters who might otherwise vote for Harris - or possibly to push away conservative voters who might be Kennedy-curious.\n\nThe ad's focus on abortion rights highlights an issue where Kennedy's stance has wavered throughout his time on the campaign trail. His campaign has walked back interview answers he's given on abortion policy two different times. Last year, Kennedy told NBC News that he would sign a ban on abortion after 15 weeks before reversing course and saying he misheard the question. Then, in May, Kennedy's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, expressed surprise about a comment on abortion that Kennedy had made to the same podcast host.\n\nKennedy said after that time that \"abortion should be legal up until a certain number of weeks, and restricted thereafter. ... Once the baby is viable outside the womb, it should have rights and it deserves society's protection.\" He and his campaign have since highlighted his point about fetal viability .\n\nBefore President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, two NBC News national polls showed Kennedy taking more support from Trump , but other surveys have shown Kennedy, a longtime former Democrat whose father ran for the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination, cutting more into Biden's support. Meanwhile, new polling of the Harris-Trump race suggests the new matchup is encouraging more voters to pick a major-party contender .\n\nIn an interview with CBS News that aired Friday , Kennedy said he told Trump during their meeting last week in Milwaukee that he was pulling more support from him than from Democrats.\n\n\"I hope to draw votes from both of them,\" Kennedy said. \"Right now, I draw many more votes from President Trump than from the Democrats ... He isn't happy. In fact, [at] the RNC, I told him that when I saw him. And he was like, 'Yeah, we got to do something about that.'\"\n\nKennedy's campaign is currently on the ballot in 13 states, according to NBC News analysis of his ballot-access efforts. He is aiming to be on the ballot in all 50 states in November.\n\nGantt did not reply to questions about the new PAC and ads. Rahna Epting, the executive director of the liberal group MoveOn, which is backing Harris, said the digital ads were \"a sad and desperate attempt by Trump allies to weaponize Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s candidacy.\" She added, \"The stakes are too high this November for any progressive to vote for a third-party spoiler over Vice President Harris.\"\n\nKatherine Koretski is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "\n\nThe first black president has created a definitional crisis for whiteness.\n\nPresident Obama created a bit of a stir in early April when he completed his Census form. In response to the question about racial identity the president indicated he was \"Black, African American or Negro.\" Despite having been born of a white mother and raised in part by white grandparents, Obama chose to identify himself solely as black even though the Census allows people to check multiple answers for racial identity. This choice disappointed some who have fought to ensure that multiracial people have the right to indicate their complex racial heritage. It confused some who were surprised by his choice not to officially recognize his white heritage. It led to an odd flurry of obvious political stories confirming that Obama was, indeed, the first African-American president. When Obama marked his Census form, he offered another lesson in what has been an intensive if unintentional seminar on the social construction of race. In just a few years, decades of multiple racial formations have been projected onto him at hyperspeed; it's a bit like watching those nature films that show the growth of an apple tree from a seed in just thirty seconds. When Hillary Clinton held a significant lead among black voters, media outlets regularly questioned if Obama was \"black enough\" to earn African-American electoral support. When the Rev. Jeremiah Wright dominated the news cycle, the question shifted to whether Obama was \"too black\" to garner white votes. By the final months of the campaign, Obama's opponents charged that he was a noncitizen, a Muslim and a terrorist. In less than two years a single body had been subjected to definitions ranging from insufficiently black, to far too black, to somehow foreign and frightening. But Obama did more than disrupt standard definitions of blackness; he created a definitional crisis for whiteness. Imagine for a moment that a young American falls into a Rip Van Winkle sleep in 1960. He awakens suddenly in 2008 and learns that we are in the midst of a historic presidential election between a white and a black candidate. He learns that one candidate is a Democrat, a Harvard Law School graduate, a lecturer at the conservative University of Chicago Law School. He also discovers that this candidate is married to his first wife, and they have two children who attend an exclusive private school. His running mate is an Irish Catholic. The other candidate is a Republican. He was an average student who made his mark in the military. This candidate has been married twice, and his running mate is a woman whose teenage daughter is pregnant out of wedlock. Now ask our recently awakened American to guess which candidate is white and which is black. Remember, his understanding of race and politics was frozen in 1960, when a significant number of blacks still identified themselves as Republican, an Ivy League education was a marker of whiteness and military service a common career path for young black men. Remember that he would expect marriage stability among whites and sexual immorality to mark black life. It's entirely possible that our Rip would guess that Obama was the white candidate and McCain the black one. By displaying all these tropes of traditional whiteness, Obama's candidacy disrupted the very idea of whiteness. Suddenly whiteness was no longer about educational achievement, family stability or the command of spoken English. One might argue that the folksy interventions of Sarah Palin were a desperate attempt to reclaim and redefine whiteness as a gun-toting ordinariness that eschews traditional and elite markers of achievement. Obama's whiteness in this sense is frightening and strange for those invested in believing that racial categories are stable, meaningful and essential. Those who yearn for a postracial America hoped Obama had transcended blackness, but the real threat he poses to the American racial order is that he disrupts whiteness, because whiteness has been the identity that defines citizenship, access to privilege and the power to define national history. In 1998 Toni Morrison wrote that Bill Clinton was the first \"black president\" because he \"displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas.\" Ten years later the man who truly became America's first black president displayed few of these tropes. Instead he was a scholarly, worldly, health food-eating man from Hawaii. In this sense, Obama was the white candidate in 2008, and a substantial portion of white voters preferred Obama's version of whiteness to that of McCain and Palin. Which brings us back to Obama's Census choice. Despite his legitimate claims on whiteness, he chose to call himself black. As historian Nell Painter documents in her new book The History of White People , white identity was a heavily policed and protected border for most of American history. A person born to an African parent and a white parent could be legally enslaved in America until 1865. From 1877 until 1965 that person would have been subject to segregation in public accommodations, schools, housing and employment. In 1896 the Supreme Court established the doctrine of separate but equal in the case of Homer Plessy, a New Orleans Creole of color whose ancestry was only a small fraction African. President Obama's Census self-identification was a moment of solidarity with these black people and a recognition that the legal and historical realities of race are definitive, that he would have been subject to all the same legal restrictions had he been born at another time. So in April, Obama did as he has done repeatedly in his adult life: he embraced blackness, with all its disprivilege, tumultuous history and disquieting symbolism. He did not deny his white parentage, but he acknowledged that in America, for those who also have African heritage, having a white parent has never meant becoming white.\n\nThis choice disappointed some who have fought to ensure that multiracial people have the right to indicate their complex racial heritage.

One might argue that the folksy interventions of Sarah Palin were a desperate attempt to reclaim and redefine whiteness as a gun-toting ordinariness that eschews traditional and elite markers of achievement. Obama's whiteness in this sense is frightening and strange for those invested in believing that racial categories are stable, meaningful and essential. Those who yearn for a postracial America hoped Obama had transcended blackness, but the real threat he poses to the American racial order is that he disrupts whiteness, because whiteness has been the identity that defines citizenship, access to privilege and the power to define national history. In 1998 Toni Morrison wrote that Bill Clinton was the first \"black president\" because he \"displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas.\" Ten years later the man who truly became America's first black president displayed few of these tropes. Instead he was a scholarly, worldly, health food-eating man from Hawaii. In this sense, Obama was the white candidate in 2008, and a substantial portion of white voters preferred Obama's version of whiteness to that of McCain and Palin. Which brings us back to Obama's Census choice. Despite his legitimate claims on whiteness, he chose to call himself black. As historian Nell Painter documents in her new book The History of White People , white identity was a heavily policed and protected border for most of American history. A person born to an African parent and a white parent could be legally enslaved in America until 1865. From 1877 until 1965 that person would have been subject to segregation in public accommodations, schools, housing and employment. In 1896 the Supreme Court established the doctrine of separate but equal in the case of Homer Plessy, a New Orleans Creole of color whose ancestry was only a small fraction African. President Obama's Census self-identification was a moment of solidarity with these black people and a recognition that the legal and historical realities of race are definitive, that he would have been subject to all the same legal restrictions had he been born at another time. So in April, Obama did as he has done repeatedly in his adult life: he embraced blackness, with all its disprivilege, tumultuous history and disquieting symbolism. He did not deny his white parentage, but he acknowledged that in America, for those who also have African heritage, having a white parent has never meant becoming white.\n\nBut Obama did more than disrupt standard definitions of blackness; he created a definitional crisis for whiteness. Imagine for a moment that a young American falls into a Rip Van Winkle sleep in 1960. He awakens suddenly in 2008 and learns that we are in the midst of a historic presidential election between a white and a black candidate. He learns that one candidate is a Democrat, a Harvard Law School graduate, a lecturer at the conservative University of Chicago Law School. He also discovers that this candidate is married to his first wife, and they have two children who attend an exclusive private school. His running mate is an Irish Catholic. The other candidate is a Republican. He was an average student who made his mark in the military. This candidate has been married twice, and his running mate is a woman whose teenage daughter is pregnant out of wedlock. Now ask our recently awakened American to guess which candidate is white and which is black. Remember, his understanding of race and politics was frozen in 1960, when a significant number of blacks still identified themselves as Republican, an Ivy League education was a marker of whiteness and military service a common career path for young black men. Remember that he would expect marriage stability among whites and sexual immorality to mark black life. It's entirely possible that our Rip would guess that Obama was the white candidate and McCain the black one.

In an op-ed piece for the LA Times, \" Nuance  Matters in the Abortion Debate , \" Nancy L. Cohen argues that the  abortion-rights movement needs a verbal (and conceptual) makeover. While recent polls suggesting increasing numbers of Americans  identify themselves as pro-life rather than pro-choice have been hyped  and misreported, Cohen thinks the 'choice\" label is too  weak to contend against mighty \"life\": \" 'Pro-choice' has turned into a  tone-deaf rallying cry, inadequate to our actual policy preferences and  to the philosophical values Americans hold on the subject of abortion.  It essentially cedes the moral high ground to the antiabortion movement.  It doesn't do enough to communicate the very American ideals at the  foundation of the abortion rights movement - the belief that, in a free  and democratic nation, the decision to have a child should rest with the  individual woman and those with whom she freely consults. \"Perhaps 'pro-choice' was once good enough  shorthand for liberty, human dignity, individualism, pluralism,  self-government and women's equality. But anyone who thinks it is still  sufficient, as we enter our fifth decade of the culture wars, hasn't  been paying attention.\" Cohen suggests replacing \"choice\" with  \"freedom\" : \"Are you pro-freedom or pro-life? Now those are values  worthy of debate.\" Freedom is definitely a  stronger, bolder word than choice, which, as many have noticed, sounds  namby-pamby and euphemistic, as if even the supporters of legal and  accessible abortion don't want to refer too openly to what, exactly, is being chosen. Choice also has unfortunate  consumerist, trivializing overtones, as if the  decision to terminate a pregnancy was like deciding what sweater to buy or what burger to order. Where's the sense of need-the urgency, the desperation? Choice has always had that  unfortunate focus-grouped ring to it, which is not surprising since it  was intended to defang the opposition. \"Choice\" says we  can agree to disagree about abortion as long as it stays legal: To  each her own. But would calling for  \"reproductive freedom\" change the debate? Freedom is a  great and noble word, but its fits the same libertarian framework as \"choice.\" The Hyde amendment and other bans on government funding would do fine  under the \"freedom\" banner, because in America freedom  means you can have what you pay for: freedom isn't free. \"Freedom\" thus  cuts both ways in just the same way as 'choice\": if you  are free to get a legal abortion, shouldn't I be free not to support it  with my taxes? It is hard to get from \"freedom\" to fairness,  equality, and social support. We don't talk about unemployment  insurance as income freedom, or national health insurance as healthcare  freedom. Racial freedom is not how we describe civil rights-and in  fact, as the discomfort of Rand Paul and other Republicans  with desegregation law shows, it's not obvious to some  even today why \"freedom\" shouldn't mean the right to refuse to rent a  motel room to black people. If you believe a fertilized  egg/embryo/fetus is a person, then why shouldn't its freedom  to be born trump the pregnant woman's  freedom not to give birth? Freedom is an emotionally more stirring word than choice, while remaining  vulnerable to the same objections and limitations. I think \"reproductive  justice,\" a term some activists prefer, makes a better case for  abortion rights in the area where they are most threatened, which is  access, funding and respect for women. It also links  abortion to other reproductive issues in a broad way: is it justice if a  woman aborts a wanted child because of poverty? If landlords won't rent  to families with children? If mothers are discriminated against in  hiring? If health insurance won't pay for fertility  treatments? If a woman is legally compelled to have a Caesarean? I'm a bit  skeptical about the ability of framing to alter a discussion that has  been going on now for most of my lifetime.  But no question the  cause of abortion rights has suffered by being cut off from the larger  story of reproductive and sexual life, which is much more complex than  can be captured by either \"choice' or \"freedom.\"\n\n\" 'Pro-choice' has turned into a  tone-deaf rallying cry, inadequate to our actual policy preferences and  to the philosophical values Americans hold on the subject of abortion.

I think \"reproductive  justice,\" a term some activists prefer, makes a better case for  abortion rights in the area where they are most threatened, which is  access, funding and respect for women. It also links  abortion to other reproductive issues in a broad way: is it justice if a  woman aborts a wanted child because of poverty? If landlords won't rent  to families with children? If mothers are discriminated against in  hiring? If health insurance won't pay for fertility  treatments? If a woman is legally compelled to have a Caesarean? I'm a bit  skeptical about the ability of framing to alter a discussion that has  been going on now for most of my lifetime.  But no question the  cause of abortion rights has suffered by being cut off from the larger  story of reproductive and sexual life, which is much more complex than  can be captured by either \"choice' or \"freedom.\"\n\nTo  each her own. But would calling for  \"reproductive freedom\" change the debate? Freedom is a  great and noble word, but its fits the same libertarian framework as \"choice.\" The Hyde amendment and other bans on government funding would do fine  under the \"freedom\" banner, because in America freedom  means you can have what you pay for: freedom isn't free. \"Freedom\" thus  cuts both ways in just the same way as 'choice\": if you  are free to get a legal abortion, shouldn't I be free not to support it  with my taxes? It is hard to get from \"freedom\" to fairness,  equality, and social support. We don't talk about unemployment  insurance as income freedom, or national health insurance as healthcare  freedom. Racial freedom is not how we describe civil rights-and in  fact, as the discomfort of Rand Paul and other Republicans  with desegregation law shows, it's not obvious to some  even today why \"freedom\" shouldn't mean the right to refuse to rent a  motel room to black people.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Abortion was certainly a motivating factor for voters , who backed ballot measures protecting abortion access in five very politically different states. One referendum in particular, Montana's, is a critical bellwether for just how supportive of abortion access the nation is becoming. Fifty-three percent of Montanans voted no, which is particularly notable in a state where 57 percent of voters supported President Donald Trump's reelection. But what was too often missed amid the political commentary about the efforts to protect abortion access was the way Montana's failed referendum was worded: Anti-abortion lawmakers intentionally used biased, medically inaccurate, inflammatory language to confuse and outrage voters. The ballot measure claimed to create protections for \"infants born alive during abortion,\" legislating an imagined situation to demonize and further criminalize abortion providers by threatening a felony charge punishable with a 20-year jail sentence and $50,000 fine. The danger for abortion providers lies not only in the threat of jail time but also within the violent language that went unchallenged in the public conversation. The overblown myths weaponized by anti-abortion groups are never-ending. But failing to address anti-abortion myths allows them to persist into perpetuity. This specific propaganda effort is particularly tricky; the bill text uses uninformed technical medical language aimed at portraying abortions later in pregnancy and palliative postnatal care as gruesome and dehumanizing. It was yet another reincarnation of a successful anti-abortion campaign during the abortion bans of the Bush years. In 2002, as the nation's policing and national security surveillance tightened, President George W. Bush signed the so-called Born Alive Infants Protection Act to confuse the public into believing that abortion is infanticide and limit the autonomy of all abortion patients and providers. It changed the way some of the public understands later abortion.

But as anti-abortion lawmakers have pushed access out of reach in many states, abortion patients have had to travel even farther to seek care. In recent years, and particularly now post- Dobbs , such travel has only increased costs and logistical hurdles while contributing to widespread delays in care and thus increased rates of later abortions.

It persists today, as recently as 2016, when a Republican-led Congress demanded an inquiry and report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the topic. In at least six states, anti-abortion legislators called for medically unnecessary mandatory reporting by abortion providers of cases where a living fetus was delivered-conjuring the assumption that this is a common occurrence. Anti-abortion advocates in several states pounced on pro-choice legislators who tried to explain the medical rarity of these situations and how a provider might respond to offer the best care possible. Anti-abortion advocates conflated abortion with infanticide time and time again, including then-President Trump himself . Like the disproportionate focus on all later abortion procedures, anti-abortion advocates are magnifying an incredibly specific, yet visceral, aspect of abortion care in an effort to sow abortion stigma towards all procedures. According to the CDC, there have been 147 such cases between 2003 and 2014. Putting that into context, these cases comprise 0.0003 percent of all live births, 0.001 percent of all abortions, and 0.05 percent of all infant deaths during this period. Current Issue View our current issue According to the CDC data, 97 of the 143 documented cases involved a complication or one or more congenital anomalies experienced by the pregnant person. In these cases, it appears that labor was induced either because the pregnant person was having a medical complication, such as severe preeclampsia or placental bleeding, or because of a severe fetal malformation. Importantly, when this happens, it is known that the fetus cannot survive long after birth, either because of the gestational age of the fetus or because of the severity of the congenital anomaly, and comfort care is typically provided until the infant dies. More than just perpetuating stigma, \"born alive\" proposals harm providers and patients. Given that the majority of these cases took place during a pregnancy that was likely very much wanted but could not continue safely, such legislation can make a painful situation worse. Once a provider determines that a patient is pregnant with a fetus with a condition that is believed to be incompatible with life, the patient has three options: abortion, palliative care, or full neonatal resuscitation and treatment. If measures like Montana's succeed, providers could be legally bound to attempt full neonatal resuscitation, regardless of the patient's wishes and despite any evidence against its long-term success. In other words, rather than protecting fetuses, these proposals could make it harder for providers to do their jobs and for patients to make choices for themselves and their families during an already difficult time. While exceptionally rare, these cases provide vivid anecdotes for anti-abortion advocates, and are one piece of a broader misinformation campaign aimed to confuse and scare the public and ultimately foster public approval for banning abortion. Now post- Dobbs , it's more critical than ever to tackle abortion myths and misinformation to lessen their rhetorical power-and particularly to defang the \"ick factor\" of abortion that antis use to rally support.

In these cases, it appears that labor was induced either because the pregnant person was having a medical complication, such as severe preeclampsia or placental bleeding, or because of a severe fetal malformation. Importantly, when this happens, it is known that the fetus cannot survive long after birth, either because of the gestational age of the fetus or because of the severity of the congenital anomaly, and comfort care is typically provided until the infant dies. More than just perpetuating stigma, \"born alive\" proposals harm providers and patients. Given that the majority of these cases took place during a pregnancy that was likely very much wanted but could not continue safely, such legislation can make a painful situation worse. Once a provider determines that a patient is pregnant with a fetus with a condition that is believed to be incompatible with life, the patient has three options: abortion, palliative care, or full neonatal resuscitation and treatment. If measures like Montana's succeed, providers could be legally bound to attempt full neonatal resuscitation, regardless of the patient's wishes and despite any evidence against its long-term success. In other words, rather than protecting fetuses, these proposals could make it harder for providers to do their jobs and for patients to make choices for themselves and their families during an already difficult time. While exceptionally rare, these cases provide vivid anecdotes for anti-abortion advocates, and are one piece of a broader misinformation campaign aimed to confuse and scare the public and ultimately foster public approval for banning abortion. Now post- Dobbs , it's more critical than ever to tackle abortion myths and misinformation to lessen their rhetorical power-and particularly to defang the \"ick factor\" of abortion that antis use to rally support.

But as anti-abortion lawmakers have pushed access out of reach in many states, abortion patients have had to travel even farther to seek care. In recent years, and particularly now post- Dobbs , such travel has only increased costs and logistical hurdles while contributing to widespread delays in care and thus increased rates of later abortions.

Candidates have openly discussed their personal second choices. Activist groups have issued joint endorsements of competing candidates . Some of these competing candidates have even appeared together at shared promotional events . These signals of unity haven't come out of nowhere. They're direct consequences of a new electoral system: ranked-choice voting. In 2019, New Yorkers voted to implement ranked-choice voting for local primary and special elections, becoming the largest voting population in America to do so. The city's June primary elections are the first to use this system, which lets voters rank multiple candidates instead of selecting one. When the results are tabulated, if any candidate has over 50 percent of the vote, he or she wins; otherwise, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated-and his or her votes are distributed to their voters' second choices. This process repeats until a candidate crosses 50 percent. Already, this new system is changing the race for the better. The first-past-the-post system used in most US elections causes significant problems: To avoid wasting their votes, voters are incentivized to choose the candidates they deem likely to win, not just the candidates who most closely align with their values. Candidates of similar ideologies have to compete against one another for a single spot in a \"lane,\" often creating personality-based rifts within voting groups. And a political movement's hopes end up resting upon a single person; if that candidate stumbles, so can the movement's prospects. Ranked-choice voting solves all these problems.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nC oncord, N.H.- Former secretary of state Mike Pompeo was back in New Hampshire, his day filled with the sorts of activities befitting a wannabe president in the home of the first-in-the-nation primary. He'd hobnobbed with state GOP members and toured a local defense contractor in the state's booming southern suburbs. Here at the state capital, Pompeo is tag-teaming with another former Trump secretary, Betsy DeVos, at an event to promote a signature issue for the GOP: school choice. The packed house at a downtown theater awaited Pompeo's arrival with Alice Cooper's anthem \"School's Out\"- School's out forever, School's been blown to pieces -playing in the background. He took the stage to rapturous applause. \"The founders understood the importance of strong families,\" the campaign-coiffed Pompeo told 250 mostly maskless attendees. Parents should be able to send their kids to a school that \"teaches their children what they want them to learn.\" And children should be taught \"real American history,\" he said, \"not the junk that's brought into the classroom now.\" The crowd went wild. That Trump's former foreign affairs chief would choose school choice as a signature issue for his run at the White House isn't all that surprising. \"Parents' rights\" has emerged as a centerpiece of the Trump-era GOP-an aggrieved rallying cry against mandating vaccines, masks in schools, or the teaching of content that parents find objectionable, including material on race, slavery and other so-called divisive concepts. Florida Governor DeSantis, another likely 2024 candidate, has emerged as the most ardent crusader on behalf of this constituency. But this is the lane that Pompeo hopes to claim too. His new super PAC, Champion American Values , paints a picture of an American family under siege from the rising tide of \"socialist ideology.\" The CAVPAC website is replete with video images of Pompeo in military surroundings, but the army he now wants to mobilize is comprised of families. \"Parents, not government, make choices for children and themselves,\" the site proclaims.

Berkshire The Harris-Walz Vision for Public Schools August 28, 2024 How to Fight the Right's Moral Panic Over Parental Rights May 23, 2023 The West Coast Think Tank Helping to Orchestrate DeSantis's War on the Woke March 30, 2023 First in the nation New Hampshire's primary primacy isn't the only draw for conservative presidential aspirants these days. The GOP's vision for public education may be closer to becoming a reality here than in any other state. This summer, bolstered by trifecta control of state government and a burgeoning libertarian movement, Granite State Republicans enacted a sweeping \"education freedom\" program. Parents who withdraw their children from the public schools (or who never sent them to public schools) are now eligible for $4,600 to spend on private religious schooling, homeschooling, or other education expenses. Another new program devotes millions in pandemic relief money to create for-profit micro schools with the aid of an Arizona company currently under investigation for fraud in that state. Just as anyone with a car can drive for Uber, anyone with a home can transform it into a \"school\" for five to 10 students-no training or degree required.

But the ultimate targets here are the taxes that pay for public schools. The sponsor of the Concord school choice forum where Pompeo appeared was the anti-tax Club for Growth. The Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity (which recently blanketed the state with mailers to parents, encouraging them to claim their education freedom dollar) is also committed to the libertarian principle that education is something consumers should pay for themselves. Current Issue View our current issue Should New Hampshire's new voucher program prove as successful as these groups hope, draining money from local school districts, communities will have no choice but to hike property taxes-a deeply unpopular proposition in a state where the property tax burden is both steep and uneven. The cynical gambit here is that voters in at least some communities will forsake their own schools rather than pay higher taxes. This year saw a bumper crop of new and expanded school choice programs enacted across the country. The favored explanation for why states like New Hampshire enacted new voucher programs and other school choice offerings is that Covid made them do it. In this telling, parent fury-over union-backed school closures, and over the leftist-indoctrinating teachers that populated their children's Zoom rooms-drove legislators to act. But an extensive national poll , released on the very day of Pompeo's visit, paints a much different picture. After 18 months of disruption, parents are increasingly opposed to change of any kind; support for vouchers and even charter schools has plummeted over the past two years. In New Hampshire, the concept of \"education freedom\" has become so unpopular that when legislators held public hearings, nearly 8,000 people turned out-with six out of seven of them in opposition. Without enough support in the House to pass it, proponents were forced to tuck it into the state budget, along with a ban on teaching \"divisive concepts\"-another measure so unpopular that even the GOP's traditional allies in the business community opposed it. \"They basically hid school vouchers in the budget bill instead of going through the whole democratic process,\" says Zandra Rice Hawkins, executive director of Granite State Progress , a progressive advocacy group. \"That may be normal in other states but not in New Hampshire.\" By the numbers The Pompeo town hall marked the kick off of the Club for Growth's nationwide Campaign for Parental School Choice . The campaign \"comes amid,\" in PR speak, rising parent concern about left-wing indoctrination in the schools. The real spike, though, is in the GOP's conviction that mining parent grievance is the way to electoral success, including with the suburban women who fled the party during the Trump years. Pollster Chris Wilson , on hand for the event, quickly punctured this dream. The idea of school choice is popular, he told the crowd, but only if you call it something other than school choice, which holds an overwhelmingly negative association. (This news had evidently not made it to event organizers, who'd invested handsomely in piles of free \"school choice\" T-shirts, ball caps, placards, and buttons, heaped in the theater lobby and displayed prominently behind the marquee guests.) The recommended rebrand is \"school freedom.\" But even this marks something of a setback for a movement eager to wean Americans off their fierce attachment to brick-and-mortar schools. As for critical race theory, the news was even worse. The specter of CRT motivates no one but GOP primary voters, Wilson said. For anyone else it's a turnoff. Even the right's go-to villains had come up empty. Targeting teachers and teachers unions causes support for the cause to dip, Wilson said, flashing a PowerPoint slide stamped with the stern warning, \"Do not say this.\" Losing message The first stop on Pompeo's New Hampshire itinerary was an event for Linda Camarota, a Republican candidate for state representative, running in a special election in the GOP stronghold of Bedford. Pompeo praised Camarota, one of the first candidates his PAC endorsed, as a warrior for school choice and parental rights. Camarota, a self-proclaimed constitutional conservative, ran hard against taxes and CRT in schools. That turned out to be a losing message. Democrat Catherine Rombeau, a former school board member who made public education and how to pay for it the central issue of her campaign, eked out a surprising victory, narrowing an already razor-thin GOP state House majority. Rombeau, like many Bedford residents, moved to this booming suburban community for its strong education system. The idea of defunding the local schools in the name of \"education freedom\" holds little appeal to voters here, something Rombeau appears to have understood.

The answer just might be hiding in plain sight-in the Club for Growth's polling.\n\nThe packed house at a downtown theater awaited Pompeo's arrival with Alice Cooper's anthem \"School's Out\"- School's out forever, School's been blown to pieces -playing in the background. He took the stage to rapturous applause. \"The founders understood the importance of strong families,\" the campaign-coiffed Pompeo told 250 mostly maskless attendees. Parents should be able to send their kids to a school that \"teaches their children what they want them to learn.\" And children should be taught \"real American history,\" he said, \"not the junk that's brought into the classroom now.\" The crowd went wild. That Trump's former foreign affairs chief would choose school choice as a signature issue for his run at the White House isn't all that surprising. \"Parents' rights\" has emerged as a centerpiece of the Trump-era GOP-an aggrieved rallying cry against mandating vaccines, masks in schools, or the teaching of content that parents find objectionable, including material on race, slavery and other so-called divisive concepts. Florida Governor DeSantis, another likely 2024 candidate, has emerged as the most ardent crusader on behalf of this constituency. But this is the lane that Pompeo hopes to claim too. His new super PAC, Champion American Values , paints a picture of an American family under siege from the rising tide of \"socialist ideology.\" The CAVPAC website is replete with video images of Pompeo in military surroundings, but the army he now wants to mobilize is comprised of families. \"Parents, not government, make choices for children and themselves,\" the site proclaims.

The GOP's vision for public education may be closer to becoming a reality here than in any other state. This summer, bolstered by trifecta control of state government and a burgeoning libertarian movement, Granite State Republicans enacted a sweeping \"education freedom\" program.

Another new program devotes millions in pandemic relief money to create for-profit micro schools with the aid of an Arizona company currently under investigation for fraud in that state. Just as anyone with a car can drive for Uber, anyone with a home can transform it into a \"school\" for five to 10 students-no training or degree required.

Current Issue View our current issue Should New Hampshire's new voucher program prove as successful as these groups hope, draining money from local school districts, communities will have no choice but to hike property taxes-a deeply unpopular proposition in a state where the property tax burden is both steep and uneven. The cynical gambit here is that voters in at least some communities will forsake their own schools rather than pay higher taxes. This year saw a bumper crop of new and expanded school choice programs enacted across the country. The favored explanation for why states like New Hampshire enacted new voucher programs and other school choice offerings is that Covid made them do it. In this telling, parent fury-over union-backed school closures, and over the leftist-indoctrinating teachers that populated their children's Zoom rooms-drove legislators to act. But an extensive national poll , released on the very day of Pompeo's visit, paints a much different picture. After 18 months of disruption, parents are increasingly opposed to change of any kind; support for vouchers and even charter schools has plummeted over the past two years. In New Hampshire, the concept of \"education freedom\" has become so unpopular that when legislators held public hearings, nearly 8,000 people turned out-with six out of seven of them in opposition. Without enough support in the House to pass it, proponents were forced to tuck it into the state budget, along with a ban on teaching \"divisive concepts\"-another measure so unpopular that even the GOP's traditional allies in the business community opposed it. \"They basically hid school vouchers in the budget bill instead of going through the whole democratic process,\" says Zandra Rice Hawkins, executive director of Granite State Progress , a progressive advocacy group. \"That may be normal in other states but not in New Hampshire.\" By the numbers The Pompeo town hall marked the kick off of the Club for Growth's nationwide Campaign for Parental School Choice . The campaign \"comes amid,\" in PR speak, rising parent concern about left-wing indoctrination in the schools. The real spike, though, is in the GOP's conviction that mining parent grievance is the way to electoral success, including with the suburban women who fled the party during the Trump years. Pollster Chris Wilson , on hand for the event, quickly punctured this dream. The idea of school choice is popular, he told the crowd, but only if you call it something other than school choice, which holds an overwhelmingly negative association. (This news had evidently not made it to event organizers, who'd invested handsomely in piles of free \"school choice\" T-shirts, ball caps, placards, and buttons, heaped in the theater lobby and displayed prominently behind the marquee guests.) The recommended rebrand is \"school freedom.\" But even this marks something of a setback for a movement eager to wean Americans off their fierce attachment to brick-and-mortar schools. As for critical race theory, the news was even worse. The specter of CRT motivates no one but GOP primary voters, Wilson said. For anyone else it's a turnoff. Even the right's go-to villains had come up empty. Targeting teachers and teachers unions causes support for the cause to dip, Wilson said, flashing a PowerPoint slide stamped with the stern warning, \"Do not say this.\" Losing message The first stop on Pompeo's New Hampshire itinerary was an event for Linda Camarota, a Republican candidate for state representative, running in a special election in the GOP stronghold of Bedford. Pompeo praised Camarota, one of the first candidates his PAC endorsed, as a warrior for school choice and parental rights. Camarota, a self-proclaimed constitutional conservative, ran hard against taxes and CRT in schools. That turned out to be a losing message. Democrat Catherine Rombeau, a former school board member who made public education and how to pay for it the central issue of her campaign, eked out a surprising victory, narrowing an already razor-thin GOP state House majority. Rombeau, like many Bedford residents, moved to this booming suburban community for its strong education system. The idea of defunding the local schools in the name of \"education freedom\" holds little appeal to voters here, something Rombeau appears to have understood.

Pollster Chris Wilson , on hand for the event, quickly punctured this dream. The idea of school choice is popular, he told the crowd, but only if you call it something other than school choice, which holds an overwhelmingly negative association. (This news had evidently not made it to event organizers, who'd invested handsomely in piles of free \"school choice\" T-shirts, ball caps, placards, and buttons, heaped in the theater lobby and displayed prominently behind the marquee guests.) The recommended rebrand is \"school freedom.\" But even this marks something of a setback for a movement eager to wean Americans off their fierce attachment to brick-and-mortar schools. As for critical race theory, the news was even worse. The specter of CRT motivates no one but GOP primary voters, Wilson said. For anyone else it's a turnoff. Even the right's go-to villains had come up empty. Targeting teachers and teachers unions causes support for the cause to dip, Wilson said, flashing a PowerPoint slide stamped with the stern warning, \"Do not say this.\" Losing message The first stop on Pompeo's New Hampshire itinerary was an event for Linda Camarota, a Republican candidate for state representative, running in a special election in the GOP stronghold of Bedford. Pompeo praised Camarota, one of the first candidates his PAC endorsed, as a warrior for school choice and parental rights. Camarota, a self-proclaimed constitutional conservative, ran hard against taxes and CRT in schools. That turned out to be a losing message. Democrat Catherine Rombeau, a former school board member who made public education and how to pay for it the central issue of her campaign, eked out a surprising victory, narrowing an already razor-thin GOP state House majority. Rombeau, like many Bedford residents, moved to this booming suburban community for its strong education system. The idea of defunding the local schools in the name of \"education freedom\" holds little appeal to voters here, something Rombeau appears to have understood. Republicans are reportedly seething over the loss, even as they try to process what went so wrong. The answer just might be hiding in plain sight-in the Club for Growth's polling.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nJeet Heer\n\nThe goal of these innovations is an age-old one: breaking up what Republicans (and some Democrats) refer to derisively as the public school monopoly. But the ultimate targets here are the taxes that pay for public schools. The sponsor of the Concord school choice forum where Pompeo appeared was the anti-tax Club for Growth. The Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity (which recently blanketed the state with mailers to parents, encouraging them to claim their education freedom dollar) is also committed to the libertarian principle that education is something consumers should pay for themselves. Current Issue View our current issue Should New Hampshire's new voucher program prove as successful as these groups hope, draining money from local school districts, communities will have no choice but to hike property taxes-a deeply unpopular proposition in a state where the property tax burden is both steep and uneven. The cynical gambit here is that voters in at least some communities will forsake their own schools rather than pay higher taxes. This year saw a bumper crop of new and expanded school choice programs enacted across the country. The favored explanation for why states like New Hampshire enacted new voucher programs and other school choice offerings is that Covid made them do it. In this telling, parent fury-over union-backed school closures, and over the leftist-indoctrinating teachers that populated their children's Zoom rooms-drove legislators to act. But an extensive national poll , released on the very day of Pompeo's visit, paints a much different picture. After 18 months of disruption, parents are increasingly opposed to change of any kind; support for vouchers and even charter schools has plummeted over the past two years. In New Hampshire, the concept of \"education freedom\" has become so unpopular that when legislators held public hearings, nearly 8,000 people turned out-with six out of seven of them in opposition. Without enough support in the House to pass it, proponents were forced to tuck it into the state budget, along with a ban on teaching \"divisive concepts\"-another measure so unpopular that even the GOP's traditional allies in the business community opposed it. \"They basically hid school vouchers in the budget bill instead of going through the whole democratic process,\" says Zandra Rice Hawkins, executive director of Granite State Progress , a progressive advocacy group. \"That may be normal in other states but not in New Hampshire.\" By the numbers The Pompeo town hall marked the kick off of the Club for Growth's nationwide Campaign for Parental School Choice .

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

It didn't matter that his opponent was credibly accused of being a pedophile, because voters just couldn't pull the lever for a pro-choice candidate. At Politico , for example, Michael Wear wrote that Jones's supposedly \"extreme\" position on abortion would turn away evangelical voters and that he was \"going to have to tone down his rhetoric.\" 1 Jones won because many of our conventional narratives about abortion are flawed. One of the most persistent myths in politics is that Democrats should trade away reproductive rights in order to win over the largely mythical moderate voter. While Americans' views on abortion are complex and multi-faceted, in the final analysis abortion choice is quite popular across the nation. 2 For proof, we can start with the American National Elections Studies 2016 survey, which offered respondents a range of options: 3 By law, abortion should never be permitted. The law should permit abortion only in case of rape, incest, or when the woman's life is in danger. The law should permit abortion for reasons other than rape, incest, or danger to the woman's life, but only after the need for the abortion has been clearly established. By law, a woman should always be able to obtain an abortion as a matter of personal choice. The chart below shows the distribution of support by party for each option. A full abortion ban is incredibly unpopular: Only 14 percent of respondents support it. Only 27 percent of respondents support abortion only in the case of rape, incest, or when a woman's life is in danger, and combined, together those options have support from only 41 percent of the general public. (Notably, only 40 percent of much-sought-after independent voters support those positions.) Another 14 percent say abortion should be allowed for other, clearly established reasons, and 45 percent take the most liberal option, in which abortion should always be available as a matter of choice-putting 59 percent of respondents in the broad pro-choice camp. 4 The 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Studies survey also asked respondents a series of questions about abortion. One option was, \"Always allow a woman to obtain an abortion as a matter of choice,\" which garnered support from 58 percent of the public, while the full abortion-ban option was endorsed by only 16 percent of respondents. 5 In both surveys, we see that the pro-choice option garners around 61 percent of the general public, despite somewhat different wording. That fits with polling from Pew, which shows that 57 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. It's fair to say a durable majority of Americans are in a broad pro-choice camp, though the exact extent varies by question. It's also clear that very, very few Americans support a full abortion ban, which is the preferred policy of the Republican Party. 6 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal But, you might say, that doesn't answer the Doug Jones question-sure, a broad majority of Americans may support abortion rights, but what about the people in deep-red states? To analyze the geography of support for abortion, my think tank Data for Progress used a technique called multilevel regression and post-stratification. MRP has been validated and been shown to generate reliable estimates of state-level public opinion using a national sample. And we found that in 40 states and the District of Columbia, a majority of adults agree with that the law should \"always allow a woman to obtain an abortion as a matter of choice.\" 7 Current Issue View our current issue This is true even in the Deep South. John Logan Ray, a senior adviser at Data for Progress, analyzed survey data from Arkansas and found that , \"While Arkansas overall is more conservative than much of the country, across-the-board opposition to abortion remains an extreme, outlier position even there. My analysis suggests that, across the state's Congressional and legislative districts, seventy to eighty percent of active voters approve of access to abortion in at least some circumstances.\" 8 This interactive chart , sampled below, shows support for abortion choice, an abortion ban, the Hyde Amendment that bans federal funds from being used on abortion services, and the question of whether employers should be able to decline abortion coverage (see the wording here ). These estimates are similar to the estimates generated independently by political scientist Christopher Skovron . 9 Even after he won, some observers asserted that Jones prevailed in spite of his pro-choice stances . But polling provided to me by The Insurrection , a progressive digital strategy firm, suggests a different conclusion: Women's reproductive health was the top-testing pro-Jones message for white Democrats. (It was second-highest for African Americans, behind Jones's prosecution of the 1963 KKK church bombers.) In addition, the polling found that ensuring access to health care was actually more powerful when framed in terms of women and reproductive care than in terms of rural health-care access and opioid treatment. 11 The anti-abortion sentiment that does exist is largely concentrated among white evangelicals, a group so closely associated with the GOP that even the decidedly lascivious Trump cannot separate them from their party-line votes. The extent to which evangelicals stand out becomes immediately clear when you look at the ANES data. Returning to the four-part question, 20 percent of white evangelicals select the option that abortion should be available as a choice. Among individuals who are not white evangelicals, 52 percent do. One in four white evangelicals support a full ban, compared to one in 10 individuals who are not white evangelicals. 12 Overall, this means Democrats who tailor their abortion positions in order to appeal to anti-choice voters are probably making a grievous strategic mistake-they are trying to win voters that will never pull the lever for them anyway, while de-motivating people who find abortion rights to be a compelling message. 13 This cuts against Beltway wisdom, but many Democratic candidates actually get it. In Georgia's Sixth Congressional District, which has a strong Republican lean (it was previously represented by Newt Gingrich and Tom Price), the Democratic nominee, Lucy McBath, doesn't think the GOP lean precludes an open discussion about reproductive choice. \"I make no excuses: I'm fully committed to protecting reproductive rights for women. It does not matter how 'Democratic' or 'Republican' your district or state is,\" she said. \"Women from all walks of life rely on essential family planning services from institutions like Planned Parenthood.\" 14 Democrats shouldn't be afraid to embrace abortion rights in majority-minority districts either-they should ignore the offensive warnings from pundits that people of color are uniquely intolerant of gay people and abortion. There is little support for this idea in the data. Turning again to the ANES survey, we see that people of color are as supportive of choice as white voters. Fifty-nine percent of whites are on the pro-choice side of the spectrum, with 44 percent \"always\" supporting abortion, while 60 percent of minority voters fall into the pro-choice category, with 46 percent always supporting abortion rights. African Americans are the group most supportive of abortion, followed by Asian Americans. Latinos are somewhat less supportive of abortion, though data show that second- and third-generation Latinos are more supportive of abortion rights. 15 In fact, women of color are the most pro-choice group in American politics. According to Data for Progress analysis of Cooperative Congressional Election studies data, women of color are the group who are least likely to support the Hyde Amendment-37 percent, compared with 51 percent of white men. In addition, 69 percent of women of color \"always support choice,\" compared with 56 percent of white men. 16 What may be confusing pundits and party strategists is that Republican have pursued maximalist anti-choice policies with tremendous success. The GOP has managed to make abortion functionally banned in numerous American states, despite polling that shows increasing support for abortion rights. But that can also be seen in a positive light: If Democrats widely embrace abortion rights and also pursue maximalist, pro-choice positions, just imagine what they can achieve with broad public support actually behind them. 17\n\nJones won because many of our conventional narratives about abortion are flawed.

It's also clear that very, very few Americans support a full abortion ban, which is the preferred policy of the Republican Party. 6 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas The Impossibly Intertwined History of the Americas Books & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal But, you might say, that doesn't answer the Doug Jones question-sure, a broad majority of Americans may support abortion rights, but what about the people in deep-red states? To analyze the geography of support for abortion, my think tank Data for Progress used a technique called multilevel regression and post-stratification. MRP has been validated and been shown to generate reliable estimates of state-level public opinion using a national sample. And we found that in 40 states and the District of Columbia, a majority of adults agree with that the law should \"always allow a woman to obtain an abortion as a matter of choice.\" 7 Current Issue View our current issue This is true even in the Deep South. John Logan Ray, a senior adviser at Data for Progress, analyzed survey data from Arkansas and found that , \"While Arkansas overall is more conservative than much of the country, across-the-board opposition to abortion remains an extreme, outlier position even there. My analysis suggests that, across the state's Congressional and legislative districts, seventy to eighty percent of active voters approve of access to abortion in at least some circumstances.\" 8 This interactive chart , sampled below, shows support for abortion choice, an abortion ban, the Hyde Amendment that bans federal funds from being used on abortion services, and the question of whether employers should be able to decline abortion coverage (see the wording here ). These estimates are similar to the estimates generated independently by political scientist Christopher Skovron . 9 Even after he won, some observers asserted that Jones prevailed in spite of his pro-choice stances . But polling provided to me by The Insurrection , a progressive digital strategy firm, suggests a different conclusion: Women's reproductive health was the top-testing pro-Jones message for white Democrats. (It was second-highest for African Americans, behind Jones's prosecution of the 1963 KKK church bombers.) In addition, the polling found that ensuring access to health care was actually more powerful when framed in terms of women and reproductive care than in terms of rural health-care access and opioid treatment. 11 The anti-abortion sentiment that does exist is largely concentrated among white evangelicals, a group so closely associated with the GOP that even the decidedly lascivious Trump cannot separate them from their party-line votes. The extent to which evangelicals stand out becomes immediately clear when you look at the ANES data. Returning to the four-part question, 20 percent of white evangelicals select the option that abortion should be available as a choice. Among individuals who are not white evangelicals, 52 percent do. One in four white evangelicals support a full ban, compared to one in 10 individuals who are not white evangelicals. 12 Overall, this means Democrats who tailor their abortion positions in order to appeal to anti-choice voters are probably making a grievous strategic mistake-they are trying to win voters that will never pull the lever for them anyway, while de-motivating people who find abortion rights to be a compelling message. 13 This cuts against Beltway wisdom, but many Democratic candidates actually get it. In Georgia's Sixth Congressional District, which has a strong Republican lean (it was previously represented by Newt Gingrich and Tom Price), the Democratic nominee, Lucy McBath, doesn't think the GOP lean precludes an open discussion about reproductive choice. \"I make no excuses: I'm fully committed to protecting reproductive rights for women. It does not matter how 'Democratic' or 'Republican' your district or state is,\" she said. \"Women from all walks of life rely on essential family planning services from institutions like Planned Parenthood.\" 14 Democrats shouldn't be afraid to embrace abortion rights in majority-minority districts either-they should ignore the offensive warnings from pundits that people of color are uniquely intolerant of gay people and abortion. There is little support for this idea in the data. Turning again to the ANES survey, we see that people of color are as supportive of choice as white voters. Fifty-nine percent of whites are on the pro-choice side of the spectrum, with 44 percent \"always\" supporting abortion, while 60 percent of minority voters fall into the pro-choice category, with 46 percent always supporting abortion rights. African Americans are the group most supportive of abortion, followed by Asian Americans. Latinos are somewhat less supportive of abortion, though data show that second- and third-generation Latinos are more supportive of abortion rights. 15 In fact, women of color are the most pro-choice group in American politics. According to Data for Progress analysis of Cooperative Congressional Election studies data, women of color are the group who are least likely to support the Hyde Amendment-37 percent, compared with 51 percent of white men. In addition, 69 percent of women of color \"always support choice,\" compared with 56 percent of white men. 16 What may be confusing pundits and party strategists is that Republican have pursued maximalist anti-choice policies with tremendous success. The GOP has managed to make abortion functionally banned in numerous American states, despite polling that shows increasing support for abortion rights. But that can also be seen in a positive light: If Democrats widely embrace abortion rights and also pursue maximalist, pro-choice positions, just imagine what they can achieve with broad public support actually behind them. 17\n\nIn both surveys, we see that the pro-choice option garners around 61 percent of the general public, despite somewhat different wording. That fits with polling from Pew, which shows that 57 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

According to Data for Progress analysis of Cooperative Congressional Election studies data, women of color are the group who are least likely to support the Hyde Amendment-37 percent, compared with 51 percent of white men. In addition, 69 percent of women of color \"always support choice,\" compared with 56 percent of white men. 16 What may be confusing pundits and party strategists is that Republican have pursued maximalist anti-choice policies with tremendous success. The GOP has managed to make abortion functionally banned in numerous American states, despite polling that shows increasing support for abortion rights. But that can also be seen in a positive light: If Democrats widely embrace abortion rights and also pursue maximalist, pro-choice positions, just imagine what they can achieve with broad public support actually behind them. 17\n\nThis cuts against Beltway wisdom, but many Democratic candidates actually get it. In Georgia's Sixth Congressional District, which has a strong Republican lean (it was previously represented by Newt Gingrich and Tom Price), the Democratic nominee, Lucy McBath, doesn't think the GOP lean precludes an open discussion about reproductive choice. \"I make no excuses: I'm fully committed to protecting reproductive rights for women. It does not matter how 'Democratic' or 'Republican' your district or state is,\" she said. \"Women from all walks of life rely on essential family planning services from institutions like Planned Parenthood.\" 14 Democrats shouldn't be afraid to embrace abortion rights in majority-minority districts either-they should ignore the offensive warnings from pundits that people of color are uniquely intolerant of gay people and abortion. There is little support for this idea in the data. Turning again to the ANES survey, we see that people of color are as supportive of choice as white voters. Fifty-nine percent of whites are on the pro-choice side of the spectrum, with 44 percent \"always\" supporting abortion, while 60 percent of minority voters fall into the pro-choice category, with 46 percent always supporting abortion rights. African Americans are the group most supportive of abortion, followed by Asian Americans. Latinos are somewhat less supportive of abortion, though data show that second- and third-generation Latinos are more supportive of abortion rights. 15 In fact, women of color are the most pro-choice group in American politics.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Advertisers may goad us with slogans like \"The choice is clear\" and \"There is only one good choice,\" and the economists who champion rational-choice theory may still evoke a generic, utility-maximizing consumer who sizes up every situation in terms of his or her personal advantage. But after several decades of research-most famously that of Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky-it has become widely accepted, save among some skeptical social scientists, that the ability of any one of us to choose what's in our best interest is severely limited.

We value the objects we possess over the ones we lack in ways that don't make any objective sense. And having better or more extensive information does not necessarily improve matters. That's because when making choices, we also tend to ignore facts that do not jibe with the outcome we desire; we focus on information that is irrelevant, or see patterns where they do not exist, or get distracted by our fleeting emotions. Then, if the possibilities are presented differently, our choices will shift accordingly, suggesting that on top of it all, we are easily manipulated by those in the business of manufacturing situations bloated with options.

On the heels of bestsellers like Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow ; How We Decide, by the discredited former New Yorker staff writer Jonah Lehrer; and Malcolm Gladwell's Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking , all of which successfully popularized scholarly findings on our mental fallibility, have come a slew of instruction manuals promising businesspeople, consumers and even the lovelorn the key to beating the decision-making odds.

What if the real problem is the imperative of making all those choices in all those different realms, from sex to software, in the first place? This is the view of a small number of philosophers, legal theorists and culturally aware psychologists, including Barry Schwartz and, more recently, Sheena Iyengar, Sigal Ben-Porath, Kent Greenfield and Renata Salecl. They insist that we have become overwhelmed and even \"tyrannized\" by our culture's overinvestment in choice. * * * In this telling, the problem stretches from the supermarket, with its average of 42,686 different items from which to prepare tonight's dinner and care for the home, to the halls of Congress, where both sides of the aisle take the expansion of choice to be an unqualified good, even as they disagree about what needs choosing. As Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky told an Energy Department official in exasperation at a 2011 Senate committee hearing, \"You favor a woman's right to an abortion, but you don't favor a woman or a man's right to choose what kind of lightbulb.\" Choice may be a bedrock value in terms of capitalism and democracy, a prerogative that stands for freedom and control over one's own image and destiny. But, argue Salecl, Greenfield and others, an ill-considered collective investment in picking from a proliferating and often phony array of options is having adverse effects on mental health and social and political life alike. On the one hand, the constant obligation to choose leaves people perpetually anxious and, at times, incapable of making up their minds at all. It doesn't matter if the choice concerns shampoos (where the differences among options appear large but are actually negligible) or healthcare (where the differences can be difficult to discern but matter greatly). We dither and refuse to commit, because to make a choice is to enter a realm of uncertainty and missed opportunities. On the other hand, given the dominance of the view that choice-making stands for independence and personal responsibility (remember Milton and Rose Friedman's famed PBS series Free to Choose ), we can't help feeling guilty when, once we have made up our minds, things go awry. We are conditioned to conclude not that luck, fate, God or some other force has let us down, but that the choices we have made must have been less than optimal-which only aggravates the stress of the next \"preference determination.\" This is, in Iyengar's terms, the \"mental and emotional tax\" that too much freedom of choice exacts. We-meaning everyone who lives in countries dominated by the ideology of consumerism, democracy and individualism-feel habitually worn out by all the effort. Plus, according to Greenfield and others, there are secondary effects of choice overload that we have hardly recognized, much less rectified. Many of our choices turn out, upon reflection, to be largely meaningless (think of those scarcely distinguishable shampoos); we are all a lot less free than we generally suppose. But most of us also fail to notice how a consumer-oriented focus on the value of exercising our options leaves out and, indeed, punishes others, especially the poor. Adults without the economic means to enter the market never face the same range of possibilities, yet their (and their children's) failure to flourish is routinely ascribed to their not having \"taken responsibility\" and made the \"right choices,\" whether in school, on the street or around the dinner table. This diagnosis airbrushes structural inequality out of the picture. What's more, Salecl notes in the most thoroughgoing of these social critiques, our collective obsession with individual choice distracts us from pursuing collective solutions to these dilemmas. It seems we are always on the way home to ponder (and worry about) all the incredible possibilities before us on Match.com or the 700-channel desert of cable TV. Technology, however, is but one of the culprits-and not the most significant one-in these cautionary tales. Their subject matter is essentially modern life, considered as the hazily defined and largely unanticipated consequence of some blend of Enlightenment notions of the self and freedom, the explosion of consumer culture, the live-and-let-live ethos of the 1960s and, as icing on the cake, the technological revolution associated with the home computer that has multiplied the offerings in every domain from the hundreds or thousands to the millions or billions. Domestic and international political developments play a smaller explanatory role in each of these accounts than they should. But all of these authors (with the partial exception of Iyengar) take for granted that while an obsession with choice is the peculiar invention of the West, and especially of the United States, it is becoming a global norm. * * * The bulk of these books is given over to laying bare the problem, often with a focus on consumer behavior, rather than considering what could be done to remedy the situation. A repeated touchstone is Iyengar and her colleague Mark Lepper's taste-testing experiment in which shoppers in an upscale food market in California were presented with, on one occasion, samples of three flavors of jam and, on another occasion, twenty-four flavors. After trying a bite or two, those in the first group proved many times more likely to walk out of the store with a purchase. Those in the second group found themselves flummoxed by all the possibilities and consequently paralyzed by indecision when it came to deciding what to buy. This now-famous finding (Iyengar jokes about having to talk about it with strangers on planes) has been widely taken to illustrate the pitfalls of endlessly expanding \"choice sets.\" Advertisers are urged to pay attention: people yearn-despite their protestations to the contrary-for guidance in how to limit their choices. And in keeping with this marketing orientation, the prescriptions for consumers proffered by these books remain, by and large, frustratingly small, personal and individualized in nature. One constant refrain is the importance of developing expertise in the domain in which one needs to make a choice, but even more in the psychology of decision-making. Practical knowledge of the brain's workings gets repackaged as empowerment, a tool that will supposedly allow people not only to work successfully against their biases, but also to prioritize in the realm of choice and, in some cases, to opt out of choosing at all. Barry Schwartz, in his 2003 book The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less , cleverly insisted that choosing not to choose was on its way to becoming the new mark of autonomy. Iyengar's catch-phrase is that we must be \"choosy about choosing.\" There is also an odd infatuation on the part of many of these authors with voluntary restraints and \"precommitments\": marriage contracts, self-imposed retirement savings plans, and websites like StickK.com that commit a user to making donations to unacceptable charities as a punishment for violating a contract-say, to quit smoking or lose twenty pounds-made with oneself. It is hard not to see such responses as signs of resignation in the face of an unalterable status quo. If the overabundance of choice is inescapable, maybe the best one can do is to try occasionally to turn one's back on it, often with the purchase of yet another consumer good or app. This is certainly Iyengar's emphasis. Her pathbreaking research on decision-making was originally made famous by Malcolm Gladwell. In The Art of Choosing , she popularizes her own findings very much in the chatty Gladwellian vein, easily moving from stories drawn from her own life to self-administered \"tests\" for the reader and accounts of quirky academic studies conducted in business schools and psychology departments-many of which, ironically, involve deceiving participants about their aims and, in essence, depriving them of the chance to make an informed choice. Before an oddly compelling personal account of her own experience, as a blind woman, picking a nail polish color, Iyengar makes a cloying appeal to her readers turned pals: \"We've been together in this book for several chapters now, and you've been a good sport, so I'm going to share a secret: Sometimes I like to turn my choice into someone else's problem.\" It comes as no surprise, then, that her \"solutions,\" including boldface takeaways offered in an epilogue, generally amount to no more than platitudes aimed at you individually, dear reader, about not sweating the small stuff, knowing thyself and thy goals, respecting difference, relinquishing control to someone else (a \"choice provider\") when the time is right, and not beating oneself up for making errors (\"maybe we all need to focus a little less on perfection and more on the joys of simply spending time with the people we love\"). She hardly expects us to stop shopping around. * * * But deep in chapter two, Iyengar makes a proposal that saves The Art of Choosing from being a simple Gladwellian knockoff. In her exceedingly cautious way, she sketches the outlines of a political position. According to this view, individual willpower constitutes only half the story; \"freedom from,\" or acting without restraint or interference from other people, is insufficient without \"freedom to,\" or possessing resources that enable one to act. Iyengar thus quietly makes the case for that most unfashionable of ideas-active government-at the middle point between capitalism and socialism. And she does so, she says, as a means to facilitate a natural predilection, evident even in well-tended but depressed zoo animals, for what she calls \"true choice.\" As she explains it, \"true choice requires that a person have the ability to choose an option and not be prevented from choosing it by any external force, meaning that a system tending too far toward either extreme\"-capitalism or socialism-\"will limit people's opportunities.\" This is the same cause that, in different ways, rallies both Ben-Porath and Greenfield and suggests that a critique of the proliferation of choice can also allow for a serious reframing of liberalism and the market model. In Tough Choices , Ben-Porath is blunter about assigning government a positive role in shaping the \"landscape of choice,\" even as she too charts a middle course. Nothing is more wrongheaded, the political theorist notes, than the idea that we all choose as free and equal members of society as long as government stays out of the way. On the contrary, new findings about how badly we perform in the business of decision-making-but also about how limited the choices are for some, and how aggravating an abundance of choice is for others-are cause for reassessing our attachment to liberal paradigms that unthinkingly take choice to be a virtue in and of itself. The problem, argues Ben-Porath, is that liberals still have not relinquished the discredited idea of the rational individual, left to his or her own devices, as an inherently effective and contented master of his or her own domain. If we took seriously the empirical research of psychologists like Kahneman, Tversky and Dan Ariely and accepted that \"simply providing more choice does not necessarily improve individuals' opportunities to make choices that are good for them,\" we would discover that we could all do a better job of determining our preferences if we had some help. Tough Choices is not, however, simply a brief for \"libertarian paternalism,\" or a fashionable defense of small-scale government programs aimed at encouraging people to want what they should want and decide what they should decide-such as whether to take an apple or a doughnut on the cafeteria line. Ben-Porath is after something bigger than merely prompting good choices by moving the apples closer to the cash register. The state is already heavily invested in the business of shaping how we choose, she explains, and minor forms of manipulation (\"nudges,\" in the parlance of libertarian paternalists Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler) do little to alleviate the inequality of choice conditions. A disciple of University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann and an expert in schooling, Ben-Porath argues instead for what she calls \"structured paternalism,\" or more extensive manipulation of the \"choice architecture,\" designed to put adults as well as children in a position where they can make \"informed\" and \"meaningful\" choices. What guidelines the state should follow in establishing this choice architecture remain persistently vague; Ben-Porath pushes the promotion of civic equality (equal participation in the democratic process) as well as the creation of opportunity equality (an equal chance at self-betterment)-while also insisting on safeguarding the \"diverse preferences\" rooted in the culture or personality of those doing the choosing. This seems a rather conflicted set of goals on which to build policy. But in the most basic of terms, Ben-Porath wants to convince us that sometimes it is a very good idea for the state to regulate or even to restrict the menu of options, as in marriage or banking, precisely so as to \"allow individuals to better pursue their preferences and aspirations\" or make sounder choices. This is an important formulation in and of itself. * * * Greenfield offers a different, if not antithetical, response. Most of The Myth of Choice reads as a cheerfully contrarian, verging-on-cute account of the wide variety of unrecognized constraints on free choice that already shape our lives. For the first three-quarters of the book, we are back in the territory of Gladwell and Iyengar, once again being regaled with the Great Jam Experiment alongside juicy court cases, familiar news stories (Abu Ghraib, Hurricane Katrina) and advertising references (\"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\" \"Have it your way\"), and a lot of breezily told anecdotes about a coal-mining grandfather who got paid in scrip, the hazards of middle-class American child-rearing, and the joys and frustrations of shopping at Best Buy and Whole Foods. Our problematic brains trick us at every turn, we learn once again. Cultural norms keep us on the straight and narrow, circumscribing our range of options and stifling dissent. Why else, with all those choices available, do we generally seek to wear almost the same clothes as everyone else? Rules and authority figures do more of the same (and here we also get the famous Milgram experiment of the 1960s, in which participants proved willing to administer electric shocks to fellow volunteers rather than resist a professor's orders). Finally, Greenfield insists that the market itself restricts our choices as much as it enables them, leaving all of us feeling overwhelmed, our collective moral and social dilemmas unsatisfactorily resolved, and the poor essentially powerless. As he notes in one of many clever asides, the one choice not really available to us is the choice to limit the spread of the market and its values. What is more surprising about Greenfield's book is where this overly long rehearsal of the \"myth\" of choice ends up. Rather than simply urge limited disengagement from consumer society as a principled response to a world of hollow choices, as one might expect, Greenfield, a law professor, argues for the cultivation of two old-fashioned virtues: \"empathy,\" or compassion toward others, and \"humility\" about oneself. Empathy, of course, is the very word that sent Republicans into a tailspin when President Obama called it an important quality in a Supreme Court justice on the eve of Sandra Sotomayor's appointment. But Greenfield hopes that if we move away from the destructive tendency to see an idealized world of \"free choice\" as the ground on which we all operate, and if we make more of an effort to acknowledge the various constraints that produced our own (or others') bad choices, we will come to a political conclusion. If we were really serious about promoting choice and personal responsibility across the board, we would need substantially more help from the government, especially the law. Not for Greenfield either is the small-bore paternalism of nudges, in which the tools of advertisers and marketers are turned toward socially constructive ends. Greenfield unabashedly advocates an interventionist state that prevents economic need from becoming a source of coercion and also promotes (as opposed to tolerates) diversity and dissent. He has, in this book, simply found a new way to endorse these progressive goals: by advocating public measures to make our choices more \"genuine\" and \"real.\" Greenfield, like Ben-Porath and Iyengar, still returns in the end to an imagined realm of authentic choice that, for all of these authors, equals authentic freedom. It remains unclear in each case if unhampered choice constitutes the human condition in some earlier period or natural state (in which case, we are reminded of Rousseau's insistence that people in developed societies must now be \"forced to be free\"), or if genuine choice exists only in some utopia yet to be achieved. It is hard to know in part because so much of the writing on this subject is dedicated to explaining, à la Greenfield, that the constraints on our ability to choose are more extensive than we imagine. Nevertheless, the common thread in these accounts is that \"real\" or \"true\" or \"genuine\" or \"meaningful\" choice-the foundation of the liberal imagination-will indeed prevail if, and only if, we learn to pay attention to the ways it is hampered at present and then use our collective energies to enable its flourishing. In a sense, all three authors propose to employ the dominant ideology of consumer society (Greenfield's \"rhetoric of the powerful\") to limit the dominance of the market and to justify an activist state. Salecl offers a strong rejoinder to this view. The Slovenian philosopher, who has no practical suggestions to make and mixes her observations about Internet dating and plastic surgery with largely unhelpful passages of dense Lacanian analysis and a dollop of Marxism, comes close to saying that belief in genuine (unfettered, rational, individual) choice is the greatest myth of all. For not only does this faith require us to ignore our own psychology, in which it is not neurological hardwiring but unconscious impulses and desires that rule; it can also prevent us from acknowledging that today, as the language of choice maximization permeates even the intimate realms of sex and reproduction, we must throw off its chains in order to envision something new. Indeed, Salecl warns us rather ominously that we are never more caught up in the ideology of choice than when we think we have escaped it by embracing simplicity and personally opting out! Iyengar actually makes a similar case-and in more accessible terms. Her position between two cultures (that of India, where she was born and has strong ties, and that of the United States, where she lives and works) allows her some fine observations about choice as ultimately one set of narrative conventions among several possibilities, and one that works less well for her Indian relatives, not to mention postcommunist Eastern Europeans or the Japanese, than for her Columbia Business School colleagues. The Art of Choosing opens with the story of her own family's arrival in North America told from three perspectives-that of fate, accident and choice-precisely to show that there is nothing natural about imposing choice and self-determination as the main rubrics for making sense of the raw data of our lives, from birth to marriage(s) to death. Yet in the end, Iyengar refuses to adjudicate and simply tells her readers of the importance of recognizing cultural differences (or \"metaphorical multilingualism,\" as she calls it) when it comes to business values such as risk and choice. She herself risks nothing more incendiary than that. Salecl alone uses a discussion of free-choice ideology to offer a robust critique of a global culture of individual acquisition and self-betterment that, she argues, has resulted neither in greater happiness nor greater justice. She never denies that making choices is an \"essential human capacity,\" one that renders change possible. But she also wants to remind us that choice and coercion are closely related (for her, the consumer is the new slave), and that the more our menu of options grows in size or significance, the more we will seek, consciously or not, to bind ourselves in other ways in compensation, whether through psychological mechanisms or the legal arm of the state. For Salecl, even the enduring appeal of the idea of a higher power is but another way to deal with the uncertainty and anxiety brought on by having to make so many decisions by and for oneself in the first place. The Tyranny of Choice thus belongs to the very dialectical history it is charting; this brief book is itself a powerful demand for collective restraint in light of the burden of proliferating choice. The question we are left with is whether the way forward lies in turning the neoliberal language of choice against the market model, or in imagining the world in entirely different terms.\n\nThe Art of Choosing By Sheena Iyengar.

What if the real problem is the imperative of making all those choices in all those different realms, from sex to software, in the first place? This is the view of a small number of philosophers, legal theorists and culturally aware psychologists, including Barry Schwartz and, more recently, Sheena Iyengar, Sigal Ben-Porath, Kent Greenfield and Renata Salecl. They insist that we have become overwhelmed and even \"tyrannized\" by our culture's overinvestment in choice. * * * In this telling, the problem stretches from the supermarket, with its average of 42,686 different items from which to prepare tonight's dinner and care for the home, to the halls of Congress, where both sides of the aisle take the expansion of choice to be an unqualified good, even as they disagree about what needs choosing. As Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky told an Energy Department official in exasperation at a 2011 Senate committee hearing, \"You favor a woman's right to an abortion, but you don't favor a woman or a man's right to choose what kind of lightbulb.\" Choice may be a bedrock value in terms of capitalism and democracy, a prerogative that stands for freedom and control over one's own image and destiny. But, argue Salecl, Greenfield and others, an ill-considered collective investment in picking from a proliferating and often phony array of options is having adverse effects on mental health and social and political life alike. On the one hand, the constant obligation to choose leaves people perpetually anxious and, at times, incapable of making up their minds at all. It doesn't matter if the choice concerns shampoos (where the differences among options appear large but are actually negligible) or healthcare (where the differences can be difficult to discern but matter greatly). We dither and refuse to commit, because to make a choice is to enter a realm of uncertainty and missed opportunities. On the other hand, given the dominance of the view that choice-making stands for independence and personal responsibility (remember Milton and Rose Friedman's famed PBS series Free to Choose ), we can't help feeling guilty when, once we have made up our minds, things go awry. We are conditioned to conclude not that luck, fate, God or some other force has let us down, but that the choices we have made must have been less than optimal-which only aggravates the stress of the next \"preference determination.\" This is, in Iyengar's terms, the \"mental and emotional tax\" that too much freedom of choice exacts. We-meaning everyone who lives in countries dominated by the ideology of consumerism, democracy and individualism-feel habitually worn out by all the effort. Plus, according to Greenfield and others, there are secondary effects of choice overload that we have hardly recognized, much less rectified. Many of our choices turn out, upon reflection, to be largely meaningless (think of those scarcely distinguishable shampoos); we are all a lot less free than we generally suppose. But most of us also fail to notice how a consumer-oriented focus on the value of exercising our options leaves out and, indeed, punishes others, especially the poor. Adults without the economic means to enter the market never face the same range of possibilities, yet their (and their children's) failure to flourish is routinely ascribed to their not having \"taken responsibility\" and made the \"right choices,\" whether in school, on the street or around the dinner table. This diagnosis airbrushes structural inequality out of the picture. What's more, Salecl notes in the most thoroughgoing of these social critiques, our collective obsession with individual choice distracts us from pursuing collective solutions to these dilemmas. It seems we are always on the way home to ponder (and worry about) all the incredible possibilities before us on Match.com or the 700-channel desert of cable TV. Technology, however, is but one of the culprits-and not the most significant one-in these cautionary tales. Their subject matter is essentially modern life, considered as the hazily defined and largely unanticipated consequence of some blend of Enlightenment notions of the self and freedom, the explosion of consumer culture, the live-and-let-live ethos of the 1960s and, as icing on the cake, the technological revolution associated with the home computer that has multiplied the offerings in every domain from the hundreds or thousands to the millions or billions. Domestic and international political developments play a smaller explanatory role in each of these accounts than they should. But all of these authors (with the partial exception of Iyengar) take for granted that while an obsession with choice is the peculiar invention of the West, and especially of the United States, it is becoming a global norm. * * * The bulk of these books is given over to laying bare the problem, often with a focus on consumer behavior, rather than considering what could be done to remedy the situation. A repeated touchstone is Iyengar and her colleague Mark Lepper's taste-testing experiment in which shoppers in an upscale food market in California were presented with, on one occasion, samples of three flavors of jam and, on another occasion, twenty-four flavors. After trying a bite or two, those in the first group proved many times more likely to walk out of the store with a purchase. Those in the second group found themselves flummoxed by all the possibilities and consequently paralyzed by indecision when it came to deciding what to buy. This now-famous finding (Iyengar jokes about having to talk about it with strangers on planes) has been widely taken to illustrate the pitfalls of endlessly expanding \"choice sets.\" Advertisers are urged to pay attention: people yearn-despite their protestations to the contrary-for guidance in how to limit their choices. And in keeping with this marketing orientation, the prescriptions for consumers proffered by these books remain, by and large, frustratingly small, personal and individualized in nature. One constant refrain is the importance of developing expertise in the domain in which one needs to make a choice, but even more in the psychology of decision-making. Practical knowledge of the brain's workings gets repackaged as empowerment, a tool that will supposedly allow people not only to work successfully against their biases, but also to prioritize in the realm of choice and, in some cases, to opt out of choosing at all. Barry Schwartz, in his 2003 book The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less , cleverly insisted that choosing not to choose was on its way to becoming the new mark of autonomy. Iyengar's catch-phrase is that we must be \"choosy about choosing.\" There is also an odd infatuation on the part of many of these authors with voluntary restraints and \"precommitments\": marriage contracts, self-imposed retirement savings plans, and websites like StickK.com that commit a user to making donations to unacceptable charities as a punishment for violating a contract-say, to quit smoking or lose twenty pounds-made with oneself. It is hard not to see such responses as signs of resignation in the face of an unalterable status quo. If the overabundance of choice is inescapable, maybe the best one can do is to try occasionally to turn one's back on it, often with the purchase of yet another consumer good or app. This is certainly Iyengar's emphasis. Her pathbreaking research on decision-making was originally made famous by Malcolm Gladwell. In The Art of Choosing , she popularizes her own findings very much in the chatty Gladwellian vein, easily moving from stories drawn from her own life to self-administered \"tests\" for the reader and accounts of quirky academic studies conducted in business schools and psychology departments-many of which, ironically, involve deceiving participants about their aims and, in essence, depriving them of the chance to make an informed choice. Before an oddly compelling personal account of her own experience, as a blind woman, picking a nail polish color, Iyengar makes a cloying appeal to her readers turned pals: \"We've been together in this book for several chapters now, and you've been a good sport, so I'm going to share a secret: Sometimes I like to turn my choice into someone else's problem.\" It comes as no surprise, then, that her \"solutions,\" including boldface takeaways offered in an epilogue, generally amount to no more than platitudes aimed at you individually, dear reader, about not sweating the small stuff, knowing thyself and thy goals, respecting difference, relinquishing control to someone else (a \"choice provider\") when the time is right, and not beating oneself up for making errors (\"maybe we all need to focus a little less on perfection and more on the joys of simply spending time with the people we love\"). She hardly expects us to stop shopping around. * * * But deep in chapter two, Iyengar makes a proposal that saves The Art of Choosing from being a simple Gladwellian knockoff. In her exceedingly cautious way, she sketches the outlines of a political position. According to this view, individual willpower constitutes only half the story; \"freedom from,\" or acting without restraint or interference from other people, is insufficient without \"freedom to,\" or possessing resources that enable one to act. Iyengar thus quietly makes the case for that most unfashionable of ideas-active government-at the middle point between capitalism and socialism. And she does so, she says, as a means to facilitate a natural predilection, evident even in well-tended but depressed zoo animals, for what she calls \"true choice.\" As she explains it, \"true choice requires that a person have the ability to choose an option and not be prevented from choosing it by any external force, meaning that a system tending too far toward either extreme\"-capitalism or socialism-\"will limit people's opportunities.\" This is the same cause that, in different ways, rallies both Ben-Porath and Greenfield and suggests that a critique of the proliferation of choice can also allow for a serious reframing of liberalism and the market model. In Tough Choices , Ben-Porath is blunter about assigning government a positive role in shaping the \"landscape of choice,\" even as she too charts a middle course. Nothing is more wrongheaded, the political theorist notes, than the idea that we all choose as free and equal members of society as long as government stays out of the way. On the contrary, new findings about how badly we perform in the business of decision-making-but also about how limited the choices are for some, and how aggravating an abundance of choice is for others-are cause for reassessing our attachment to liberal paradigms that unthinkingly take choice to be a virtue in and of itself. The problem, argues Ben-Porath, is that liberals still have not relinquished the discredited idea of the rational individual, left to his or her own devices, as an inherently effective and contented master of his or her own domain. If we took seriously the empirical research of psychologists like Kahneman, Tversky and Dan Ariely and accepted that \"simply providing more choice does not necessarily improve individuals' opportunities to make choices that are good for them,\" we would discover that we could all do a better job of determining our preferences if we had some help. Tough Choices is not, however, simply a brief for \"libertarian paternalism,\" or a fashionable defense of small-scale government programs aimed at encouraging people to want what they should want and decide what they should decide-such as whether to take an apple or a doughnut on the cafeteria line. Ben-Porath is after something bigger than merely prompting good choices by moving the apples closer to the cash register. The state is already heavily invested in the business of shaping how we choose, she explains, and minor forms of manipulation (\"nudges,\" in the parlance of libertarian paternalists Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler) do little to alleviate the inequality of choice conditions. A disciple of University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann and an expert in schooling, Ben-Porath argues instead for what she calls \"structured paternalism,\" or more extensive manipulation of the \"choice architecture,\" designed to put adults as well as children in a position where they can make \"informed\" and \"meaningful\" choices. What guidelines the state should follow in establishing this choice architecture remain persistently vague; Ben-Porath pushes the promotion of civic equality (equal participation in the democratic process) as well as the creation of opportunity equality (an equal chance at self-betterment)-while also insisting on safeguarding the \"diverse preferences\" rooted in the culture or personality of those doing the choosing. This seems a rather conflicted set of goals on which to build policy. But in the most basic of terms, Ben-Porath wants to convince us that sometimes it is a very good idea for the state to regulate or even to restrict the menu of options, as in marriage or banking, precisely so as to \"allow individuals to better pursue their preferences and aspirations\" or make sounder choices. This is an important formulation in and of itself. * * * Greenfield offers a different, if not antithetical, response. Most of The Myth of Choice reads as a cheerfully contrarian, verging-on-cute account of the wide variety of unrecognized constraints on free choice that already shape our lives. For the first three-quarters of the book, we are back in the territory of Gladwell and Iyengar, once again being regaled with the Great Jam Experiment alongside juicy court cases, familiar news stories (Abu Ghraib, Hurricane Katrina) and advertising references (\"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\" \"Have it your way\"), and a lot of breezily told anecdotes about a coal-mining grandfather who got paid in scrip, the hazards of middle-class American child-rearing, and the joys and frustrations of shopping at Best Buy and Whole Foods. Our problematic brains trick us at every turn, we learn once again. Cultural norms keep us on the straight and narrow, circumscribing our range of options and stifling dissent. Why else, with all those choices available, do we generally seek to wear almost the same clothes as everyone else? Rules and authority figures do more of the same (and here we also get the famous Milgram experiment of the 1960s, in which participants proved willing to administer electric shocks to fellow volunteers rather than resist a professor's orders). Finally, Greenfield insists that the market itself restricts our choices as much as it enables them, leaving all of us feeling overwhelmed, our collective moral and social dilemmas unsatisfactorily resolved, and the poor essentially powerless. As he notes in one of many clever asides, the one choice not really available to us is the choice to limit the spread of the market and its values. What is more surprising about Greenfield's book is where this overly long rehearsal of the \"myth\" of choice ends up. Rather than simply urge limited disengagement from consumer society as a principled response to a world of hollow choices, as one might expect, Greenfield, a law professor, argues for the cultivation of two old-fashioned virtues: \"empathy,\" or compassion toward others, and \"humility\" about oneself. Empathy, of course, is the very word that sent Republicans into a tailspin when President Obama called it an important quality in a Supreme Court justice on the eve of Sandra Sotomayor's appointment. But Greenfield hopes that if we move away from the destructive tendency to see an idealized world of \"free choice\" as the ground on which we all operate, and if we make more of an effort to acknowledge the various constraints that produced our own (or others') bad choices, we will come to a political conclusion. If we were really serious about promoting choice and personal responsibility across the board, we would need substantially more help from the government, especially the law. Not for Greenfield either is the small-bore paternalism of nudges, in which the tools of advertisers and marketers are turned toward socially constructive ends. Greenfield unabashedly advocates an interventionist state that prevents economic need from becoming a source of coercion and also promotes (as opposed to tolerates) diversity and dissent. He has, in this book, simply found a new way to endorse these progressive goals: by advocating public measures to make our choices more \"genuine\" and \"real.\" Greenfield, like Ben-Porath and Iyengar, still returns in the end to an imagined realm of authentic choice that, for all of these authors, equals authentic freedom. It remains unclear in each case if unhampered choice constitutes the human condition in some earlier period or natural state (in which case, we are reminded of Rousseau's insistence that people in developed societies must now be \"forced to be free\"), or if genuine choice exists only in some utopia yet to be achieved. It is hard to know in part because so much of the writing on this subject is dedicated to explaining, à la Greenfield, that the constraints on our ability to choose are more extensive than we imagine. Nevertheless, the common thread in these accounts is that \"real\" or \"true\" or \"genuine\" or \"meaningful\" choice-the foundation of the liberal imagination-will indeed prevail if, and only if, we learn to pay attention to the ways it is hampered at present and then use our collective energies to enable its flourishing. In a sense, all three authors propose to employ the dominant ideology of consumer society (Greenfield's \"rhetoric of the powerful\") to limit the dominance of the market and to justify an activist state. Salecl offers a strong rejoinder to this view. The Slovenian philosopher, who has no practical suggestions to make and mixes her observations about Internet dating and plastic surgery with largely unhelpful passages of dense Lacanian analysis and a dollop of Marxism, comes close to saying that belief in genuine (unfettered, rational, individual) choice is the greatest myth of all. For not only does this faith require us to ignore our own psychology, in which it is not neurological hardwiring but unconscious impulses and desires that rule; it can also prevent us from acknowledging that today, as the language of choice maximization permeates even the intimate realms of sex and reproduction, we must throw off its chains in order to envision something new. Indeed, Salecl warns us rather ominously that we are never more caught up in the ideology of choice than when we think we have escaped it by embracing simplicity and personally opting out! Iyengar actually makes a similar case-and in more accessible terms. Her position between two cultures (that of India, where she was born and has strong ties, and that of the United States, where she lives and works) allows her some fine observations about choice as ultimately one set of narrative conventions among several possibilities, and one that works less well for her Indian relatives, not to mention postcommunist Eastern Europeans or the Japanese, than for her Columbia Business School colleagues. The Art of Choosing opens with the story of her own family's arrival in North America told from three perspectives-that of fate, accident and choice-precisely to show that there is nothing natural about imposing choice and self-determination as the main rubrics for making sense of the raw data of our lives, from birth to marriage(s) to death. Yet in the end, Iyengar refuses to adjudicate and simply tells her readers of the importance of recognizing cultural differences (or \"metaphorical multilingualism,\" as she calls it) when it comes to business values such as risk and choice. She herself risks nothing more incendiary than that. Salecl alone uses a discussion of free-choice ideology to offer a robust critique of a global culture of individual acquisition and self-betterment that, she argues, has resulted neither in greater happiness nor greater justice. She never denies that making choices is an \"essential human capacity,\" one that renders change possible. But she also wants to remind us that choice and coercion are closely related (for her, the consumer is the new slave), and that the more our menu of options grows in size or significance, the more we will seek, consciously or not, to bind ourselves in other ways in compensation, whether through psychological mechanisms or the legal arm of the state. For Salecl, even the enduring appeal of the idea of a higher power is but another way to deal with the uncertainty and anxiety brought on by having to make so many decisions by and for oneself in the first place. The Tyranny of Choice thus belongs to the very dialectical history it is charting; this brief book is itself a powerful demand for collective restraint in light of the burden of proliferating choice. The question we are left with is whether the way forward lies in turning the neoliberal language of choice against the market model, or in imagining the world in entirely different terms.\n\nIt's a verdict around which a lucrative genre of business and self-help books has developed. On the heels of bestsellers like Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow ; How We Decide, by the discredited former New Yorker staff writer Jonah Lehrer; and Malcolm Gladwell's Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking , all of which successfully popularized scholarly findings on our mental fallibility, have come a slew of instruction manuals promising businesspeople, consumers and even the lovelorn the key to beating the decision-making odds. Airport bookstores are well stocked with offerings like Make Up Your Mind: A Decision Making Guide to Thinking Clearly and Choosing Wisely (2012); Decisive: How to Make Better Choices in Life or Work (2013); Eyes Wide Open: How to Make Smart Decisions in a Confusing World (2013); and The Happiness Choice: The Five Decisions That Will Take You From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be (2013)-not to mention specialized guides focused on careers, marriage, health and nutrition, consumer goods, and personal finance, all of them crammed with lessons about choice. Last year, even the Harvard Business Review weighed in with \"10 Must Reads on Making Smart Decisions.\" The message? If we understand our foibles and learn to choose more self-consciously, each of us will do a lot better making up our minds in the future.

This is an important formulation in and of itself. * * * Greenfield offers a different, if not antithetical, response. Most of The Myth of Choice reads as a cheerfully contrarian, verging-on-cute account of the wide variety of unrecognized constraints on free choice that already shape our lives. For the first three-quarters of the book, we are back in the territory of Gladwell and Iyengar, once again being regaled with the Great Jam Experiment alongside juicy court cases, familiar news stories (Abu Ghraib, Hurricane Katrina) and advertising references (\"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\" \"Have it your way\"), and a lot of breezily told anecdotes about a coal-mining grandfather who got paid in scrip, the hazards of middle-class American child-rearing, and the joys and frustrations of shopping at Best Buy and Whole Foods. Our problematic brains trick us at every turn, we learn once again. Cultural norms keep us on the straight and narrow, circumscribing our range of options and stifling dissent. Why else, with all those choices available, do we generally seek to wear almost the same clothes as everyone else? Rules and authority figures do more of the same (and here we also get the famous Milgram experiment of the 1960s, in which participants proved willing to administer electric shocks to fellow volunteers rather than resist a professor's orders). Finally, Greenfield insists that the market itself restricts our choices as much as it enables them, leaving all of us feeling overwhelmed, our collective moral and social dilemmas unsatisfactorily resolved, and the poor essentially powerless. As he notes in one of many clever asides, the one choice not really available to us is the choice to limit the spread of the market and its values. What is more surprising about Greenfield's book is where this overly long rehearsal of the \"myth\" of choice ends up. Rather than simply urge limited disengagement from consumer society as a principled response to a world of hollow choices, as one might expect, Greenfield, a law professor, argues for the cultivation of two old-fashioned virtues: \"empathy,\" or compassion toward others, and \"humility\" about oneself. Empathy, of course, is the very word that sent Republicans into a tailspin when President Obama called it an important quality in a Supreme Court justice on the eve of Sandra Sotomayor's appointment. But Greenfield hopes that if we move away from the destructive tendency to see an idealized world of \"free choice\" as the ground on which we all operate, and if we make more of an effort to acknowledge the various constraints that produced our own (or others') bad choices, we will come to a political conclusion. If we were really serious about promoting choice and personal responsibility across the board, we would need substantially more help from the government, especially the law. Not for Greenfield either is the small-bore paternalism of nudges, in which the tools of advertisers and marketers are turned toward socially constructive ends. Greenfield unabashedly advocates an interventionist state that prevents economic need from becoming a source of coercion and also promotes (as opposed to tolerates) diversity and dissent. He has, in this book, simply found a new way to endorse these progressive goals: by advocating public measures to make our choices more \"genuine\" and \"real.\" Greenfield, like Ben-Porath and Iyengar, still returns in the end to an imagined realm of authentic choice that, for all of these authors, equals authentic freedom. It remains unclear in each case if unhampered choice constitutes the human condition in some earlier period or natural state (in which case, we are reminded of Rousseau's insistence that people in developed societies must now be \"forced to be free\"), or if genuine choice exists only in some utopia yet to be achieved. It is hard to know in part because so much of the writing on this subject is dedicated to explaining, à la Greenfield, that the constraints on our ability to choose are more extensive than we imagine. Nevertheless, the common thread in these accounts is that \"real\" or \"true\" or \"genuine\" or \"meaningful\" choice-the foundation of the liberal imagination-will indeed prevail if, and only if, we learn to pay attention to the ways it is hampered at present and then use our collective energies to enable its flourishing. In a sense, all three authors propose to employ the dominant ideology of consumer society (Greenfield's \"rhetoric of the powerful\") to limit the dominance of the market and to justify an activist state. Salecl offers a strong rejoinder to this view. The Slovenian philosopher, who has no practical suggestions to make and mixes her observations about Internet dating and plastic surgery with largely unhelpful passages of dense Lacanian analysis and a dollop of Marxism, comes close to saying that belief in genuine (unfettered, rational, individual) choice is the greatest myth of all. For not only does this faith require us to ignore our own psychology, in which it is not neurological hardwiring but unconscious impulses and desires that rule; it can also prevent us from acknowledging that today, as the language of choice maximization permeates even the intimate realms of sex and reproduction, we must throw off its chains in order to envision something new. Indeed, Salecl warns us rather ominously that we are never more caught up in the ideology of choice than when we think we have escaped it by embracing simplicity and personally opting out! Iyengar actually makes a similar case-and in more accessible terms. Her position between two cultures (that of India, where she was born and has strong ties, and that of the United States, where she lives and works) allows her some fine observations about choice as ultimately one set of narrative conventions among several possibilities, and one that works less well for her Indian relatives, not to mention postcommunist Eastern Europeans or the Japanese, than for her Columbia Business School colleagues. The Art of Choosing opens with the story of her own family's arrival in North America told from three perspectives-that of fate, accident and choice-precisely to show that there is nothing natural about imposing choice and self-determination as the main rubrics for making sense of the raw data of our lives, from birth to marriage(s) to death. Yet in the end, Iyengar refuses to adjudicate and simply tells her readers of the importance of recognizing cultural differences (or \"metaphorical multilingualism,\" as she calls it) when it comes to business values such as risk and choice. She herself risks nothing more incendiary than that. Salecl alone uses a discussion of free-choice ideology to offer a robust critique of a global culture of individual acquisition and self-betterment that, she argues, has resulted neither in greater happiness nor greater justice. She never denies that making choices is an \"essential human capacity,\" one that renders change possible. But she also wants to remind us that choice and coercion are closely related (for her, the consumer is the new slave), and that the more our menu of options grows in size or significance, the more we will seek, consciously or not, to bind ourselves in other ways in compensation, whether through psychological mechanisms or the legal arm of the state. For Salecl, even the enduring appeal of the idea of a higher power is but another way to deal with the uncertainty and anxiety brought on by having to make so many decisions by and for oneself in the first place. The Tyranny of Choice thus belongs to the very dialectical history it is charting; this brief book is itself a powerful demand for collective restraint in light of the burden of proliferating choice. The question we are left with is whether the way forward lies in turning the neoliberal language of choice against the market model, or in imagining the world in entirely different terms.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBut what if such how-to manuals, with their emphasis on enlarging the scope of personal responsibility to include choosing to monitor one's own decision-making psychology, are better seen as symptoms of what ails us? What if the real problem is the imperative of making all those choices in all those different realms, from sex to software, in the first place? This is the view of a small number of philosophers, legal theorists and culturally aware psychologists, including Barry Schwartz and, more recently, Sheena Iyengar, Sigal Ben-Porath, Kent Greenfield and Renata Salecl. They insist that we have become overwhelmed and even \"tyrannized\" by our culture's overinvestment in choice. * * * In this telling, the problem stretches from the supermarket, with its average of 42,686 different items from which to prepare tonight's dinner and care for the home, to the halls of Congress, where both sides of the aisle take the expansion of choice to be an unqualified good, even as they disagree about what needs choosing. As Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky told an Energy Department official in exasperation at a 2011 Senate committee hearing, \"You favor a woman's right to an abortion, but you don't favor a woman or a man's right to choose what kind of lightbulb.\" Choice may be a bedrock value in terms of capitalism and democracy, a prerogative that stands for freedom and control over one's own image and destiny. But, argue Salecl, Greenfield and others, an ill-considered collective investment in picking from a proliferating and often phony array of options is having adverse effects on mental health and social and political life alike. On the one hand, the constant obligation to choose leaves people perpetually anxious and, at times, incapable of making up their minds at all. It doesn't matter if the choice concerns shampoos (where the differences among options appear large but are actually negligible) or healthcare (where the differences can be difficult to discern but matter greatly). We dither and refuse to commit, because to make a choice is to enter a realm of uncertainty and missed opportunities. On the other hand, given the dominance of the view that choice-making stands for independence and personal responsibility (remember Milton and Rose Friedman's famed PBS series Free to Choose ), we can't help feeling guilty when, once we have made up our minds, things go awry. We are conditioned to conclude not that luck, fate, God or some other force has let us down, but that the choices we have made must have been less than optimal-which only aggravates the stress of the next \"preference determination.\" This is, in Iyengar's terms, the \"mental and emotional tax\" that too much freedom of choice exacts. We-meaning everyone who lives in countries dominated by the ideology of consumerism, democracy and individualism-feel habitually worn out by all the effort. Plus, according to Greenfield and others, there are secondary effects of choice overload that we have hardly recognized, much less rectified. Many of our choices turn out, upon reflection, to be largely meaningless (think of those scarcely distinguishable shampoos); we are all a lot less free than we generally suppose. But most of us also fail to notice how a consumer-oriented focus on the value of exercising our options leaves out and, indeed, punishes others, especially the poor. Adults without the economic means to enter the market never face the same range of possibilities, yet their (and their children's) failure to flourish is routinely ascribed to their not having \"taken responsibility\" and made the \"right choices,\" whether in school, on the street or around the dinner table. This diagnosis airbrushes structural inequality out of the picture. What's more, Salecl notes in the most thoroughgoing of these social critiques, our collective obsession with individual choice distracts us from pursuing collective solutions to these dilemmas. It seems we are always on the way home to ponder (and worry about) all the incredible possibilities before us on Match.com or the 700-channel desert of cable TV. Technology, however, is but one of the culprits-and not the most significant one-in these cautionary tales. Their subject matter is essentially modern life, considered as the hazily defined and largely unanticipated consequence of some blend of Enlightenment notions of the self and freedom, the explosion of consumer culture, the live-and-let-live ethos of the 1960s and, as icing on the cake, the technological revolution associated with the home computer that has multiplied the offerings in every domain from the hundreds or thousands to the millions or billions. Domestic and international political developments play a smaller explanatory role in each of these accounts than they should. But all of these authors (with the partial exception of Iyengar) take for granted that while an obsession with choice is the peculiar invention of the West, and especially of the United States, it is becoming a global norm. * * * The bulk of these books is given over to laying bare the problem, often with a focus on consumer behavior, rather than considering what could be done to remedy the situation. A repeated touchstone is Iyengar and her colleague Mark Lepper's taste-testing experiment in which shoppers in an upscale food market in California were presented with, on one occasion, samples of three flavors of jam and, on another occasion, twenty-four flavors. After trying a bite or two, those in the first group proved many times more likely to walk out of the store with a purchase. Those in the second group found themselves flummoxed by all the possibilities and consequently paralyzed by indecision when it came to deciding what to buy. This now-famous finding (Iyengar jokes about having to talk about it with strangers on planes) has been widely taken to illustrate the pitfalls of endlessly expanding \"choice sets.\" Advertisers are urged to pay attention: people yearn-despite their protestations to the contrary-for guidance in how to limit their choices. And in keeping with this marketing orientation, the prescriptions for consumers proffered by these books remain, by and large, frustratingly small, personal and individualized in nature. One constant refrain is the importance of developing expertise in the domain in which one needs to make a choice, but even more in the psychology of decision-making. Practical knowledge of the brain's workings gets repackaged as empowerment, a tool that will supposedly allow people not only to work successfully against their biases, but also to prioritize in the realm of choice and, in some cases, to opt out of choosing at all. Barry Schwartz, in his 2003 book The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less , cleverly insisted that choosing not to choose was on its way to becoming the new mark of autonomy. Iyengar's catch-phrase is that we must be \"choosy about choosing.\" There is also an odd infatuation on the part of many of these authors with voluntary restraints and \"precommitments\": marriage contracts, self-imposed retirement savings plans, and websites like StickK.com that commit a user to making donations to unacceptable charities as a punishment for violating a contract-say, to quit smoking or lose twenty pounds-made with oneself. It is hard not to see such responses as signs of resignation in the face of an unalterable status quo. If the overabundance of choice is inescapable, maybe the best one can do is to try occasionally to turn one's back on it, often with the purchase of yet another consumer good or app. This is certainly Iyengar's emphasis. Her pathbreaking research on decision-making was originally made famous by Malcolm Gladwell. In The Art of Choosing , she popularizes her own findings very much in the chatty Gladwellian vein, easily moving from stories drawn from her own life to self-administered \"tests\" for the reader and accounts of quirky academic studies conducted in business schools and psychology departments-many of which, ironically, involve deceiving participants about their aims and, in essence, depriving them of the chance to make an informed choice. Before an oddly compelling personal account of her own experience, as a blind woman, picking a nail polish color, Iyengar makes a cloying appeal to her readers turned pals: \"We've been together in this book for several chapters now, and you've been a good sport, so I'm going to share a secret: Sometimes I like to turn my choice into someone else's problem.\" It comes as no surprise, then, that her \"solutions,\" including boldface takeaways offered in an epilogue, generally amount to no more than platitudes aimed at you individually, dear reader, about not sweating the small stuff, knowing thyself and thy goals, respecting difference, relinquishing control to someone else (a \"choice provider\") when the time is right, and not beating oneself up for making errors (\"maybe we all need to focus a little less on perfection and more on the joys of simply spending time with the people we love\"). She hardly expects us to stop shopping around. * * * But deep in chapter two, Iyengar makes a proposal that saves The Art of Choosing from being a simple Gladwellian knockoff. In her exceedingly cautious way, she sketches the outlines of a political position. According to this view, individual willpower constitutes only half the story; \"freedom from,\" or acting without restraint or interference from other people, is insufficient without \"freedom to,\" or possessing resources that enable one to act. Iyengar thus quietly makes the case for that most unfashionable of ideas-active government-at the middle point between capitalism and socialism. And she does so, she says, as a means to facilitate a natural predilection, evident even in well-tended but depressed zoo animals, for what she calls \"true choice.\" As she explains it, \"true choice requires that a person have the ability to choose an option and not be prevented from choosing it by any external force, meaning that a system tending too far toward either extreme\"-capitalism or socialism-\"will limit people's opportunities.\" This is the same cause that, in different ways, rallies both Ben-Porath and Greenfield and suggests that a critique of the proliferation of choice can also allow for a serious reframing of liberalism and the market model. In Tough Choices , Ben-Porath is blunter about assigning government a positive role in shaping the \"landscape of choice,\" even as she too charts a middle course. Nothing is more wrongheaded, the political theorist notes, than the idea that we all choose as free and equal members of society as long as government stays out of the way. On the contrary, new findings about how badly we perform in the business of decision-making-but also about how limited the choices are for some, and how aggravating an abundance of choice is for others-are cause for reassessing our attachment to liberal paradigms that unthinkingly take choice to be a virtue in and of itself. The problem, argues Ben-Porath, is that liberals still have not relinquished the discredited idea of the rational individual, left to his or her own devices, as an inherently effective and contented master of his or her own domain. If we took seriously the empirical research of psychologists like Kahneman, Tversky and Dan Ariely and accepted that \"simply providing more choice does not necessarily improve individuals' opportunities to make choices that are good for them,\" we would discover that we could all do a better job of determining our preferences if we had some help. Tough Choices is not, however, simply a brief for \"libertarian paternalism,\" or a fashionable defense of small-scale government programs aimed at encouraging people to want what they should want and decide what they should decide-such as whether to take an apple or a doughnut on the cafeteria line. Ben-Porath is after something bigger than merely prompting good choices by moving the apples closer to the cash register. The state is already heavily invested in the business of shaping how we choose, she explains, and minor forms of manipulation (\"nudges,\" in the parlance of libertarian paternalists Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler) do little to alleviate the inequality of choice conditions. A disciple of University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann and an expert in schooling, Ben-Porath argues instead for what she calls \"structured paternalism,\" or more extensive manipulation of the \"choice architecture,\" designed to put adults as well as children in a position where they can make \"informed\" and \"meaningful\" choices. What guidelines the state should follow in establishing this choice architecture remain persistently vague; Ben-Porath pushes the promotion of civic equality (equal participation in the democratic process) as well as the creation of opportunity equality (an equal chance at self-betterment)-while also insisting on safeguarding the \"diverse preferences\" rooted in the culture or personality of those doing the choosing. This seems a rather conflicted set of goals on which to build policy. But in the most basic of terms, Ben-Porath wants to convince us that sometimes it is a very good idea for the state to regulate or even to restrict the menu of options, as in marriage or banking, precisely so as to \"allow individuals to better pursue their preferences and aspirations\" or make sounder choices. This is an important formulation in and of itself. * * * Greenfield offers a different, if not antithetical, response.

Iyengar thus quietly makes the case for that most unfashionable of ideas-active government-at the middle point between capitalism and socialism. And she does so, she says, as a means to facilitate a natural predilection, evident even in well-tended but depressed zoo animals, for what she calls \"true choice.\" As she explains it, \"true choice requires that a person have the ability to choose an option and not be prevented from choosing it by any external force, meaning that a system tending too far toward either extreme\"-capitalism or socialism-\"will limit people's opportunities.\" This is the same cause that, in different ways, rallies both Ben-Porath and Greenfield and suggests that a critique of the proliferation of choice can also allow for a serious reframing of liberalism and the market model. In Tough Choices , Ben-Porath is blunter about assigning government a positive role in shaping the \"landscape of choice,\" even as she too charts a middle course. Nothing is more wrongheaded, the political theorist notes, than the idea that we all choose as free and equal members of society as long as government stays out of the way. On the contrary, new findings about how badly we perform in the business of decision-making-but also about how limited the choices are for some, and how aggravating an abundance of choice is for others-are cause for reassessing our attachment to liberal paradigms that unthinkingly take choice to be a virtue in and of itself. The problem, argues Ben-Porath, is that liberals still have not relinquished the discredited idea of the rational individual, left to his or her own devices, as an inherently effective and contented master of his or her own domain. If we took seriously the empirical research of psychologists like Kahneman, Tversky and Dan Ariely and accepted that \"simply providing more choice does not necessarily improve individuals' opportunities to make choices that are good for them,\" we would discover that we could all do a better job of determining our preferences if we had some help. Tough Choices is not, however, simply a brief for \"libertarian paternalism,\" or a fashionable defense of small-scale government programs aimed at encouraging people to want what they should want and decide what they should decide-such as whether to take an apple or a doughnut on the cafeteria line. Ben-Porath is after something bigger than merely prompting good choices by moving the apples closer to the cash register. The state is already heavily invested in the business of shaping how we choose, she explains, and minor forms of manipulation (\"nudges,\" in the parlance of libertarian paternalists Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler) do little to alleviate the inequality of choice conditions. A disciple of University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann and an expert in schooling, Ben-Porath argues instead for what she calls \"structured paternalism,\" or more extensive manipulation of the \"choice architecture,\" designed to put adults as well as children in a position where they can make \"informed\" and \"meaningful\" choices. What guidelines the state should follow in establishing this choice architecture remain persistently vague; Ben-Porath pushes the promotion of civic equality (equal participation in the democratic process) as well as the creation of opportunity equality (an equal chance at self-betterment)-while also insisting on safeguarding the \"diverse preferences\" rooted in the culture or personality of those doing the choosing. This seems a rather conflicted set of goals on which to build policy. But in the most basic of terms, Ben-Porath wants to convince us that sometimes it is a very good idea for the state to regulate or even to restrict the menu of options, as in marriage or banking, precisely so as to \"allow individuals to better pursue their preferences and aspirations\" or make sounder choices. This is an important formulation in and of itself. * * * Greenfield offers a different, if not antithetical, response. Most of The Myth of Choice reads as a cheerfully contrarian, verging-on-cute account of the wide variety of unrecognized constraints on free choice that already shape our lives. For the first three-quarters of the book, we are back in the territory of Gladwell and Iyengar, once again being regaled with the Great Jam Experiment alongside juicy court cases, familiar news stories (Abu Ghraib, Hurricane Katrina) and advertising references (\"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\" \"Have it your way\"), and a lot of breezily told anecdotes about a coal-mining grandfather who got paid in scrip, the hazards of middle-class American child-rearing, and the joys and frustrations of shopping at Best Buy and Whole Foods. Our problematic brains trick us at every turn, we learn once again. Cultural norms keep us on the straight and narrow, circumscribing our range of options and stifling dissent. Why else, with all those choices available, do we generally seek to wear almost the same clothes as everyone else? Rules and authority figures do more of the same (and here we also get the famous Milgram experiment of the 1960s, in which participants proved willing to administer electric shocks to fellow volunteers rather than resist a professor's orders). Finally, Greenfield insists that the market itself restricts our choices as much as it enables them, leaving all of us feeling overwhelmed, our collective moral and social dilemmas unsatisfactorily resolved, and the poor essentially powerless. As he notes in one of many clever asides, the one choice not really available to us is the choice to limit the spread of the market and its values. What is more surprising about Greenfield's book is where this overly long rehearsal of the \"myth\" of choice ends up. Rather than simply urge limited disengagement from consumer society as a principled response to a world of hollow choices, as one might expect, Greenfield, a law professor, argues for the cultivation of two old-fashioned virtues: \"empathy,\" or compassion toward others, and \"humility\" about oneself. Empathy, of course, is the very word that sent Republicans into a tailspin when President Obama called it an important quality in a Supreme Court justice on the eve of Sandra Sotomayor's appointment. But Greenfield hopes that if we move away from the destructive tendency to see an idealized world of \"free choice\" as the ground on which we all operate, and if we make more of an effort to acknowledge the various constraints that produced our own (or others') bad choices, we will come to a political conclusion. If we were really serious about promoting choice and personal responsibility across the board, we would need substantially more help from the government, especially the law. Not for Greenfield either is the small-bore paternalism of nudges, in which the tools of advertisers and marketers are turned toward socially constructive ends. Greenfield unabashedly advocates an interventionist state that prevents economic need from becoming a source of coercion and also promotes (as opposed to tolerates) diversity and dissent. He has, in this book, simply found a new way to endorse these progressive goals: by advocating public measures to make our choices more \"genuine\" and \"real.\" Greenfield, like Ben-Porath and Iyengar, still returns in the end to an imagined realm of authentic choice that, for all of these authors, equals authentic freedom. It remains unclear in each case if unhampered choice constitutes the human condition in some earlier period or natural state (in which case, we are reminded of Rousseau's insistence that people in developed societies must now be \"forced to be free\"), or if genuine choice exists only in some utopia yet to be achieved. It is hard to know in part because so much of the writing on this subject is dedicated to explaining, à la Greenfield, that the constraints on our ability to choose are more extensive than we imagine. Nevertheless, the common thread in these accounts is that \"real\" or \"true\" or \"genuine\" or \"meaningful\" choice-the foundation of the liberal imagination-will indeed prevail if, and only if, we learn to pay attention to the ways it is hampered at present and then use our collective energies to enable its flourishing. In a sense, all three authors propose to employ the dominant ideology of consumer society (Greenfield's \"rhetoric of the powerful\") to limit the dominance of the market and to justify an activist state. Salecl offers a strong rejoinder to this view. The Slovenian philosopher, who has no practical suggestions to make and mixes her observations about Internet dating and plastic surgery with largely unhelpful passages of dense Lacanian analysis and a dollop of Marxism, comes close to saying that belief in genuine (unfettered, rational, individual) choice is the greatest myth of all. For not only does this faith require us to ignore our own psychology, in which it is not neurological hardwiring but unconscious impulses and desires that rule; it can also prevent us from acknowledging that today, as the language of choice maximization permeates even the intimate realms of sex and reproduction, we must throw off its chains in order to envision something new. Indeed, Salecl warns us rather ominously that we are never more caught up in the ideology of choice than when we think we have escaped it by embracing simplicity and personally opting out! Iyengar actually makes a similar case-and in more accessible terms. Her position between two cultures (that of India, where she was born and has strong ties, and that of the United States, where she lives and works) allows her some fine observations about choice as ultimately one set of narrative conventions among several possibilities, and one that works less well for her Indian relatives, not to mention postcommunist Eastern Europeans or the Japanese, than for her Columbia Business School colleagues. The Art of Choosing opens with the story of her own family's arrival in North America told from three perspectives-that of fate, accident and choice-precisely to show that there is nothing natural about imposing choice and self-determination as the main rubrics for making sense of the raw data of our lives, from birth to marriage(s) to death. Yet in the end, Iyengar refuses to adjudicate and simply tells her readers of the importance of recognizing cultural differences (or \"metaphorical multilingualism,\" as she calls it) when it comes to business values such as risk and choice. She herself risks nothing more incendiary than that. Salecl alone uses a discussion of free-choice ideology to offer a robust critique of a global culture of individual acquisition and self-betterment that, she argues, has resulted neither in greater happiness nor greater justice. She never denies that making choices is an \"essential human capacity,\" one that renders change possible. But she also wants to remind us that choice and coercion are closely related (for her, the consumer is the new slave), and that the more our menu of options grows in size or significance, the more we will seek, consciously or not, to bind ourselves in other ways in compensation, whether through psychological mechanisms or the legal arm of the state. For Salecl, even the enduring appeal of the idea of a higher power is but another way to deal with the uncertainty and anxiety brought on by having to make so many decisions by and for oneself in the first place. The Tyranny of Choice thus belongs to the very dialectical history it is charting; this brief book is itself a powerful demand for collective restraint in light of the burden of proliferating choice. The question we are left with is whether the way forward lies in turning the neoliberal language of choice against the market model, or in imagining the world in entirely different terms.\n\nIn this telling, the problem stretches from the supermarket, with its average of 42,686 different items from which to prepare tonight's dinner and care for the home, to the halls of Congress, where both sides of the aisle take the expansion of choice to be an unqualified good, even as they disagree about what needs choosing. As Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky told an Energy Department official in exasperation at a 2011 Senate committee hearing, \"You favor a woman's right to an abortion, but you don't favor a woman or a man's right to choose what kind of lightbulb.\" Choice may be a bedrock value in terms of capitalism and democracy, a prerogative that stands for freedom and control over one's own image and destiny. But, argue Salecl, Greenfield and others, an ill-considered collective investment in picking from a proliferating and often phony array of options is having adverse effects on mental health and social and political life alike. On the one hand, the constant obligation to choose leaves people perpetually anxious and, at times, incapable of making up their minds at all. It doesn't matter if the choice concerns shampoos (where the differences among options appear large but are actually negligible) or healthcare (where the differences can be difficult to discern but matter greatly). We dither and refuse to commit, because to make a choice is to enter a realm of uncertainty and missed opportunities. On the other hand, given the dominance of the view that choice-making stands for independence and personal responsibility (remember Milton and Rose Friedman's famed PBS series Free to Choose ), we can't help feeling guilty when, once we have made up our minds, things go awry. We are conditioned to conclude not that luck, fate, God or some other force has let us down, but that the choices we have made must have been less than optimal-which only aggravates the stress of the next \"preference determination.\" This is, in Iyengar's terms, the \"mental and emotional tax\" that too much freedom of choice exacts. We-meaning everyone who lives in countries dominated by the ideology of consumerism, democracy and individualism-feel habitually worn out by all the effort. Plus, according to Greenfield and others, there are secondary effects of choice overload that we have hardly recognized, much less rectified. Many of our choices turn out, upon reflection, to be largely meaningless (think of those scarcely distinguishable shampoos); we are all a lot less free than we generally suppose. But most of us also fail to notice how a consumer-oriented focus on the value of exercising our options leaves out and, indeed, punishes others, especially the poor. Adults without the economic means to enter the market never face the same range of possibilities, yet their (and their children's) failure to flourish is routinely ascribed to their not having \"taken responsibility\" and made the \"right choices,\" whether in school, on the street or around the dinner table. This diagnosis airbrushes structural inequality out of the picture. What's more, Salecl notes in the most thoroughgoing of these social critiques, our collective obsession with individual choice distracts us from pursuing collective solutions to these dilemmas. It seems we are always on the way home to ponder (and worry about) all the incredible possibilities before us on Match.com or the 700-channel desert of cable TV. Technology, however, is but one of the culprits-and not the most significant one-in these cautionary tales. Their subject matter is essentially modern life, considered as the hazily defined and largely unanticipated consequence of some blend of Enlightenment notions of the self and freedom, the explosion of consumer culture, the live-and-let-live ethos of the 1960s and, as icing on the cake, the technological revolution associated with the home computer that has multiplied the offerings in every domain from the hundreds or thousands to the millions or billions. Domestic and international political developments play a smaller explanatory role in each of these accounts than they should. But all of these authors (with the partial exception of Iyengar) take for granted that while an obsession with choice is the peculiar invention of the West, and especially of the United States, it is becoming a global norm. * * * The bulk of these books is given over to laying bare the problem, often with a focus on consumer behavior, rather than considering what could be done to remedy the situation. A repeated touchstone is Iyengar and her colleague Mark Lepper's taste-testing experiment in which shoppers in an upscale food market in California were presented with, on one occasion, samples of three flavors of jam and, on another occasion, twenty-four flavors. After trying a bite or two, those in the first group proved many times more likely to walk out of the store with a purchase. Those in the second group found themselves flummoxed by all the possibilities and consequently paralyzed by indecision when it came to deciding what to buy. This now-famous finding (Iyengar jokes about having to talk about it with strangers on planes) has been widely taken to illustrate the pitfalls of endlessly expanding \"choice sets.\" Advertisers are urged to pay attention: people yearn-despite their protestations to the contrary-for guidance in how to limit their choices. And in keeping with this marketing orientation, the prescriptions for consumers proffered by these books remain, by and large, frustratingly small, personal and individualized in nature. One constant refrain is the importance of developing expertise in the domain in which one needs to make a choice, but even more in the psychology of decision-making. Practical knowledge of the brain's workings gets repackaged as empowerment, a tool that will supposedly allow people not only to work successfully against their biases, but also to prioritize in the realm of choice and, in some cases, to opt out of choosing at all. Barry Schwartz, in his 2003 book The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less , cleverly insisted that choosing not to choose was on its way to becoming the new mark of autonomy. Iyengar's catch-phrase is that we must be \"choosy about choosing.\" There is also an odd infatuation on the part of many of these authors with voluntary restraints and \"precommitments\": marriage contracts, self-imposed retirement savings plans, and websites like StickK.com that commit a user to making donations to unacceptable charities as a punishment for violating a contract-say, to quit smoking or lose twenty pounds-made with oneself. It is hard not to see such responses as signs of resignation in the face of an unalterable status quo. If the overabundance of choice is inescapable, maybe the best one can do is to try occasionally to turn one's back on it, often with the purchase of yet another consumer good or app. This is certainly Iyengar's emphasis. Her pathbreaking research on decision-making was originally made famous by Malcolm Gladwell. In The Art of Choosing , she popularizes her own findings very much in the chatty Gladwellian vein, easily moving from stories drawn from her own life to self-administered \"tests\" for the reader and accounts of quirky academic studies conducted in business schools and psychology departments-many of which, ironically, involve deceiving participants about their aims and, in essence, depriving them of the chance to make an informed choice. Before an oddly compelling personal account of her own experience, as a blind woman, picking a nail polish color, Iyengar makes a cloying appeal to her readers turned pals: \"We've been together in this book for several chapters now, and you've been a good sport, so I'm going to share a secret: Sometimes I like to turn my choice into someone else's problem.\" It comes as no surprise, then, that her \"solutions,\" including boldface takeaways offered in an epilogue, generally amount to no more than platitudes aimed at you individually, dear reader, about not sweating the small stuff, knowing thyself and thy goals, respecting difference, relinquishing control to someone else (a \"choice provider\") when the time is right, and not beating oneself up for making errors (\"maybe we all need to focus a little less on perfection and more on the joys of simply spending time with the people we love\"). She hardly expects us to stop shopping around. * * * But deep in chapter two, Iyengar makes a proposal that saves The Art of Choosing from being a simple Gladwellian knockoff. In her exceedingly cautious way, she sketches the outlines of a political position. According to this view, individual willpower constitutes only half the story; \"freedom from,\" or acting without restraint or interference from other people, is insufficient without \"freedom to,\" or possessing resources that enable one to act. Iyengar thus quietly makes the case for that most unfashionable of ideas-active government-at the middle point between capitalism and socialism. And she does so, she says, as a means to facilitate a natural predilection, evident even in well-tended but depressed zoo animals, for what she calls \"true choice.\" As she explains it, \"true choice requires that a person have the ability to choose an option and not be prevented from choosing it by any external force, meaning that a system tending too far toward either extreme\"-capitalism or socialism-\"will limit people's opportunities.\" This is the same cause that, in different ways, rallies both Ben-Porath and Greenfield and suggests that a critique of the proliferation of choice can also allow for a serious reframing of liberalism and the market model. In Tough Choices , Ben-Porath is blunter about assigning government a positive role in shaping the \"landscape of choice,\" even as she too charts a middle course.

Tough Choices is not, however, simply a brief for \"libertarian paternalism,\" or a fashionable defense of small-scale government programs aimed at encouraging people to want what they should want and decide what they should decide-such as whether to take an apple or a doughnut on the cafeteria line. Ben-Porath is after something bigger than merely prompting good choices by moving the apples closer to the cash register. The state is already heavily invested in the business of shaping how we choose, she explains, and minor forms of manipulation (\"nudges,\" in the parlance of libertarian paternalists Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler) do little to alleviate the inequality of choice conditions. A disciple of University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann and an expert in schooling, Ben-Porath argues instead for what she calls \"structured paternalism,\" or more extensive manipulation of the \"choice architecture,\" designed to put adults as well as children in a position where they can make \"informed\" and \"meaningful\" choices.

In The Art of Choosing , she popularizes her own findings very much in the chatty Gladwellian vein, easily moving from stories drawn from her own life to self-administered \"tests\" for the reader and accounts of quirky academic studies conducted in business schools and psychology departments-many of which, ironically, involve deceiving participants about their aims and, in essence, depriving them of the chance to make an informed choice. Before an oddly compelling personal account of her own experience, as a blind woman, picking a nail polish color, Iyengar makes a cloying appeal to her readers turned pals: \"We've been together in this book for several chapters now, and you've been a good sport, so I'm going to share a secret: Sometimes I like to turn my choice into someone else's problem.\" It comes as no surprise, then, that her \"solutions,\" including boldface takeaways offered in an epilogue, generally amount to no more than platitudes aimed at you individually, dear reader, about not sweating the small stuff, knowing thyself and thy goals, respecting difference, relinquishing control to someone else (a \"choice provider\") when the time is right, and not beating oneself up for making errors (\"maybe we all need to focus a little less on perfection and more on the joys of simply spending time with the people we love\"). She hardly expects us to stop shopping around. * * * But deep in chapter two, Iyengar makes a proposal that saves The Art of Choosing from being a simple Gladwellian knockoff. In her exceedingly cautious way, she sketches the outlines of a political position. According to this view, individual willpower constitutes only half the story; \"freedom from,\" or acting without restraint or interference from other people, is insufficient without \"freedom to,\" or possessing resources that enable one to act. Iyengar thus quietly makes the case for that most unfashionable of ideas-active government-at the middle point between capitalism and socialism. And she does so, she says, as a means to facilitate a natural predilection, evident even in well-tended but depressed zoo animals, for what she calls \"true choice.\" As she explains it, \"true choice requires that a person have the ability to choose an option and not be prevented from choosing it by any external force, meaning that a system tending too far toward either extreme\"-capitalism or socialism-\"will limit people's opportunities.\" This is the same cause that, in different ways, rallies both Ben-Porath and Greenfield and suggests that a critique of the proliferation of choice can also allow for a serious reframing of liberalism and the market model. In Tough Choices , Ben-Porath is blunter about assigning government a positive role in shaping the \"landscape of choice,\" even as she too charts a middle course. Nothing is more wrongheaded, the political theorist notes, than the idea that we all choose as free and equal members of society as long as government stays out of the way. On the contrary, new findings about how badly we perform in the business of decision-making-but also about how limited the choices are for some, and how aggravating an abundance of choice is for others-are cause for reassessing our attachment to liberal paradigms that unthinkingly take choice to be a virtue in and of itself. The problem, argues Ben-Porath, is that liberals still have not relinquished the discredited idea of the rational individual, left to his or her own devices, as an inherently effective and contented master of his or her own domain. If we took seriously the empirical research of psychologists like Kahneman, Tversky and Dan Ariely and accepted that \"simply providing more choice does not necessarily improve individuals' opportunities to make choices that are good for them,\" we would discover that we could all do a better job of determining our preferences if we had some help. Tough Choices is not, however, simply a brief for \"libertarian paternalism,\" or a fashionable defense of small-scale government programs aimed at encouraging people to want what they should want and decide what they should decide-such as whether to take an apple or a doughnut on the cafeteria line. Ben-Porath is after something bigger than merely prompting good choices by moving the apples closer to the cash register. The state is already heavily invested in the business of shaping how we choose, she explains, and minor forms of manipulation (\"nudges,\" in the parlance of libertarian paternalists Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler) do little to alleviate the inequality of choice conditions. A disciple of University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann and an expert in schooling, Ben-Porath argues instead for what she calls \"structured paternalism,\" or more extensive manipulation of the \"choice architecture,\" designed to put adults as well as children in a position where they can make \"informed\" and \"meaningful\" choices. What guidelines the state should follow in establishing this choice architecture remain persistently vague; Ben-Porath pushes the promotion of civic equality (equal participation in the democratic process) as well as the creation of opportunity equality (an equal chance at self-betterment)-while also insisting on safeguarding the \"diverse preferences\" rooted in the culture or personality of those doing the choosing. This seems a rather conflicted set of goals on which to build policy. But in the most basic of terms, Ben-Porath wants to convince us that sometimes it is a very good idea for the state to regulate or even to restrict the menu of options, as in marriage or banking, precisely so as to \"allow individuals to better pursue their preferences and aspirations\" or make sounder choices. This is an important formulation in and of itself. * * * Greenfield offers a different, if not antithetical, response. Most of The Myth of Choice reads as a cheerfully contrarian, verging-on-cute account of the wide variety of unrecognized constraints on free choice that already shape our lives. For the first three-quarters of the book, we are back in the territory of Gladwell and Iyengar, once again being regaled with the Great Jam Experiment alongside juicy court cases, familiar news stories (Abu Ghraib, Hurricane Katrina) and advertising references (\"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\" \"Have it your way\"), and a lot of breezily told anecdotes about a coal-mining grandfather who got paid in scrip, the hazards of middle-class American child-rearing, and the joys and frustrations of shopping at Best Buy and Whole Foods. Our problematic brains trick us at every turn, we learn once again. Cultural norms keep us on the straight and narrow, circumscribing our range of options and stifling dissent. Why else, with all those choices available, do we generally seek to wear almost the same clothes as everyone else? Rules and authority figures do more of the same (and here we also get the famous Milgram experiment of the 1960s, in which participants proved willing to administer electric shocks to fellow volunteers rather than resist a professor's orders). Finally, Greenfield insists that the market itself restricts our choices as much as it enables them, leaving all of us feeling overwhelmed, our collective moral and social dilemmas unsatisfactorily resolved, and the poor essentially powerless. As he notes in one of many clever asides, the one choice not really available to us is the choice to limit the spread of the market and its values. What is more surprising about Greenfield's book is where this overly long rehearsal of the \"myth\" of choice ends up. Rather than simply urge limited disengagement from consumer society as a principled response to a world of hollow choices, as one might expect, Greenfield, a law professor, argues for the cultivation of two old-fashioned virtues: \"empathy,\" or compassion toward others, and \"humility\" about oneself. Empathy, of course, is the very word that sent Republicans into a tailspin when President Obama called it an important quality in a Supreme Court justice on the eve of Sandra Sotomayor's appointment. But Greenfield hopes that if we move away from the destructive tendency to see an idealized world of \"free choice\" as the ground on which we all operate, and if we make more of an effort to acknowledge the various constraints that produced our own (or others') bad choices, we will come to a political conclusion. If we were really serious about promoting choice and personal responsibility across the board, we would need substantially more help from the government, especially the law. Not for Greenfield either is the small-bore paternalism of nudges, in which the tools of advertisers and marketers are turned toward socially constructive ends. Greenfield unabashedly advocates an interventionist state that prevents economic need from becoming a source of coercion and also promotes (as opposed to tolerates) diversity and dissent. He has, in this book, simply found a new way to endorse these progressive goals: by advocating public measures to make our choices more \"genuine\" and \"real.\" Greenfield, like Ben-Porath and Iyengar, still returns in the end to an imagined realm of authentic choice that, for all of these authors, equals authentic freedom. It remains unclear in each case if unhampered choice constitutes the human condition in some earlier period or natural state (in which case, we are reminded of Rousseau's insistence that people in developed societies must now be \"forced to be free\"), or if genuine choice exists only in some utopia yet to be achieved. It is hard to know in part because so much of the writing on this subject is dedicated to explaining, à la Greenfield, that the constraints on our ability to choose are more extensive than we imagine. Nevertheless, the common thread in these accounts is that \"real\" or \"true\" or \"genuine\" or \"meaningful\" choice-the foundation of the liberal imagination-will indeed prevail if, and only if, we learn to pay attention to the ways it is hampered at present and then use our collective energies to enable its flourishing. In a sense, all three authors propose to employ the dominant ideology of consumer society (Greenfield's \"rhetoric of the powerful\") to limit the dominance of the market and to justify an activist state. Salecl offers a strong rejoinder to this view. The Slovenian philosopher, who has no practical suggestions to make and mixes her observations about Internet dating and plastic surgery with largely unhelpful passages of dense Lacanian analysis and a dollop of Marxism, comes close to saying that belief in genuine (unfettered, rational, individual) choice is the greatest myth of all. For not only does this faith require us to ignore our own psychology, in which it is not neurological hardwiring but unconscious impulses and desires that rule; it can also prevent us from acknowledging that today, as the language of choice maximization permeates even the intimate realms of sex and reproduction, we must throw off its chains in order to envision something new. Indeed, Salecl warns us rather ominously that we are never more caught up in the ideology of choice than when we think we have escaped it by embracing simplicity and personally opting out! Iyengar actually makes a similar case-and in more accessible terms. Her position between two cultures (that of India, where she was born and has strong ties, and that of the United States, where she lives and works) allows her some fine observations about choice as ultimately one set of narrative conventions among several possibilities, and one that works less well for her Indian relatives, not to mention postcommunist Eastern Europeans or the Japanese, than for her Columbia Business School colleagues. The Art of Choosing opens with the story of her own family's arrival in North America told from three perspectives-that of fate, accident and choice-precisely to show that there is nothing natural about imposing choice and self-determination as the main rubrics for making sense of the raw data of our lives, from birth to marriage(s) to death. Yet in the end, Iyengar refuses to adjudicate and simply tells her readers of the importance of recognizing cultural differences (or \"metaphorical multilingualism,\" as she calls it) when it comes to business values such as risk and choice. She herself risks nothing more incendiary than that. Salecl alone uses a discussion of free-choice ideology to offer a robust critique of a global culture of individual acquisition and self-betterment that, she argues, has resulted neither in greater happiness nor greater justice. She never denies that making choices is an \"essential human capacity,\" one that renders change possible. But she also wants to remind us that choice and coercion are closely related (for her, the consumer is the new slave), and that the more our menu of options grows in size or significance, the more we will seek, consciously or not, to bind ourselves in other ways in compensation, whether through psychological mechanisms or the legal arm of the state. For Salecl, even the enduring appeal of the idea of a higher power is but another way to deal with the uncertainty and anxiety brought on by having to make so many decisions by and for oneself in the first place. The Tyranny of Choice thus belongs to the very dialectical history it is charting; this brief book is itself a powerful demand for collective restraint in light of the burden of proliferating choice. The question we are left with is whether the way forward lies in turning the neoliberal language of choice against the market model, or in imagining the world in entirely different terms.\n\nPlus, according to Greenfield and others, there are secondary effects of choice overload that we have hardly recognized, much less rectified. Many of our choices turn out, upon reflection, to be largely meaningless (think of those scarcely distinguishable shampoos); we are all a lot less free than we generally suppose. But most of us also fail to notice how a consumer-oriented focus on the value of exercising our options leaves out and, indeed, punishes others, especially the poor. Adults without the economic means to enter the market never face the same range of possibilities, yet their (and their children's) failure to flourish is routinely ascribed to their not having \"taken responsibility\" and made the \"right choices,\" whether in school, on the street or around the dinner table. This diagnosis airbrushes structural inequality out of the picture. What's more, Salecl notes in the most thoroughgoing of these social critiques, our collective obsession with individual choice distracts us from pursuing collective solutions to these dilemmas. It seems we are always on the way home to ponder (and worry about) all the incredible possibilities before us on Match.com or the 700-channel desert of cable TV. Technology, however, is but one of the culprits-and not the most significant one-in these cautionary tales. Their subject matter is essentially modern life, considered as the hazily defined and largely unanticipated consequence of some blend of Enlightenment notions of the self and freedom, the explosion of consumer culture, the live-and-let-live ethos of the 1960s and, as icing on the cake, the technological revolution associated with the home computer that has multiplied the offerings in every domain from the hundreds or thousands to the millions or billions. Domestic and international political developments play a smaller explanatory role in each of these accounts than they should. But all of these authors (with the partial exception of Iyengar) take for granted that while an obsession with choice is the peculiar invention of the West, and especially of the United States, it is becoming a global norm. * * * The bulk of these books is given over to laying bare the problem, often with a focus on consumer behavior, rather than considering what could be done to remedy the situation. A repeated touchstone is Iyengar and her colleague Mark Lepper's taste-testing experiment in which shoppers in an upscale food market in California were presented with, on one occasion, samples of three flavors of jam and, on another occasion, twenty-four flavors. After trying a bite or two, those in the first group proved many times more likely to walk out of the store with a purchase. Those in the second group found themselves flummoxed by all the possibilities and consequently paralyzed by indecision when it came to deciding what to buy. This now-famous finding (Iyengar jokes about having to talk about it with strangers on planes) has been widely taken to illustrate the pitfalls of endlessly expanding \"choice sets.\" Advertisers are urged to pay attention: people yearn-despite their protestations to the contrary-for guidance in how to limit their choices. And in keeping with this marketing orientation, the prescriptions for consumers proffered by these books remain, by and large, frustratingly small, personal and individualized in nature. One constant refrain is the importance of developing expertise in the domain in which one needs to make a choice, but even more in the psychology of decision-making. Practical knowledge of the brain's workings gets repackaged as empowerment, a tool that will supposedly allow people not only to work successfully against their biases, but also to prioritize in the realm of choice and, in some cases, to opt out of choosing at all. Barry Schwartz, in his 2003 book The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less , cleverly insisted that choosing not to choose was on its way to becoming the new mark of autonomy. Iyengar's catch-phrase is that we must be \"choosy about choosing.\" There is also an odd infatuation on the part of many of these authors with voluntary restraints and \"precommitments\": marriage contracts, self-imposed retirement savings plans, and websites like StickK.com that commit a user to making donations to unacceptable charities as a punishment for violating a contract-say, to quit smoking or lose twenty pounds-made with oneself. It is hard not to see such responses as signs of resignation in the face of an unalterable status quo. If the overabundance of choice is inescapable, maybe the best one can do is to try occasionally to turn one's back on it, often with the purchase of yet another consumer good or app. This is certainly Iyengar's emphasis.

On the contrary, new findings about how badly we perform in the business of decision-making-but also about how limited the choices are for some, and how aggravating an abundance of choice is for others-are cause for reassessing our attachment to liberal paradigms that unthinkingly take choice to be a virtue in and of itself. The problem, argues Ben-Porath, is that liberals still have not relinquished the discredited idea of the rational individual, left to his or her own devices, as an inherently effective and contented master of his or her own domain. If we took seriously the empirical research of psychologists like Kahneman, Tversky and Dan Ariely and accepted that \"simply providing more choice does not necessarily improve individuals' opportunities to make choices that are good for them,\" we would discover that we could all do a better job of determining our preferences if we had some help. Tough Choices is not, however, simply a brief for \"libertarian paternalism,\" or a fashionable defense of small-scale government programs aimed at encouraging people to want what they should want and decide what they should decide-such as whether to take an apple or a doughnut on the cafeteria line. Ben-Porath is after something bigger than merely prompting good choices by moving the apples closer to the cash register. The state is already heavily invested in the business of shaping how we choose, she explains, and minor forms of manipulation (\"nudges,\" in the parlance of libertarian paternalists Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler) do little to alleviate the inequality of choice conditions. A disciple of University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann and an expert in schooling, Ben-Porath argues instead for what she calls \"structured paternalism,\" or more extensive manipulation of the \"choice architecture,\" designed to put adults as well as children in a position where they can make \"informed\" and \"meaningful\" choices. What guidelines the state should follow in establishing this choice architecture remain persistently vague; Ben-Porath pushes the promotion of civic equality (equal participation in the democratic process) as well as the creation of opportunity equality (an equal chance at self-betterment)-while also insisting on safeguarding the \"diverse preferences\" rooted in the culture or personality of those doing the choosing. This seems a rather conflicted set of goals on which to build policy. But in the most basic of terms, Ben-Porath wants to convince us that sometimes it is a very good idea for the state to regulate or even to restrict the menu of options, as in marriage or banking, precisely so as to \"allow individuals to better pursue their preferences and aspirations\" or make sounder choices. This is an important formulation in and of itself. * * * Greenfield offers a different, if not antithetical, response. Most of The Myth of Choice reads as a cheerfully contrarian, verging-on-cute account of the wide variety of unrecognized constraints on free choice that already shape our lives. For the first three-quarters of the book, we are back in the territory of Gladwell and Iyengar, once again being regaled with the Great Jam Experiment alongside juicy court cases, familiar news stories (Abu Ghraib, Hurricane Katrina) and advertising references (\"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\" \"Have it your way\"), and a lot of breezily told anecdotes about a coal-mining grandfather who got paid in scrip, the hazards of middle-class American child-rearing, and the joys and frustrations of shopping at Best Buy and Whole Foods. Our problematic brains trick us at every turn, we learn once again. Cultural norms keep us on the straight and narrow, circumscribing our range of options and stifling dissent. Why else, with all those choices available, do we generally seek to wear almost the same clothes as everyone else? Rules and authority figures do more of the same (and here we also get the famous Milgram experiment of the 1960s, in which participants proved willing to administer electric shocks to fellow volunteers rather than resist a professor's orders). Finally, Greenfield insists that the market itself restricts our choices as much as it enables them, leaving all of us feeling overwhelmed, our collective moral and social dilemmas unsatisfactorily resolved, and the poor essentially powerless. As he notes in one of many clever asides, the one choice not really available to us is the choice to limit the spread of the market and its values. What is more surprising about Greenfield's book is where this overly long rehearsal of the \"myth\" of choice ends up. Rather than simply urge limited disengagement from consumer society as a principled response to a world of hollow choices, as one might expect, Greenfield, a law professor, argues for the cultivation of two old-fashioned virtues: \"empathy,\" or compassion toward others, and \"humility\" about oneself. Empathy, of course, is the very word that sent Republicans into a tailspin when President Obama called it an important quality in a Supreme Court justice on the eve of Sandra Sotomayor's appointment. But Greenfield hopes that if we move away from the destructive tendency to see an idealized world of \"free choice\" as the ground on which we all operate, and if we make more of an effort to acknowledge the various constraints that produced our own (or others') bad choices, we will come to a political conclusion. If we were really serious about promoting choice and personal responsibility across the board, we would need substantially more help from the government, especially the law. Not for Greenfield either is the small-bore paternalism of nudges, in which the tools of advertisers and marketers are turned toward socially constructive ends. Greenfield unabashedly advocates an interventionist state that prevents economic need from becoming a source of coercion and also promotes (as opposed to tolerates) diversity and dissent. He has, in this book, simply found a new way to endorse these progressive goals: by advocating public measures to make our choices more \"genuine\" and \"real.\" Greenfield, like Ben-Porath and Iyengar, still returns in the end to an imagined realm of authentic choice that, for all of these authors, equals authentic freedom. It remains unclear in each case if unhampered choice constitutes the human condition in some earlier period or natural state (in which case, we are reminded of Rousseau's insistence that people in developed societies must now be \"forced to be free\"), or if genuine choice exists only in some utopia yet to be achieved. It is hard to know in part because so much of the writing on this subject is dedicated to explaining, à la Greenfield, that the constraints on our ability to choose are more extensive than we imagine. Nevertheless, the common thread in these accounts is that \"real\" or \"true\" or \"genuine\" or \"meaningful\" choice-the foundation of the liberal imagination-will indeed prevail if, and only if, we learn to pay attention to the ways it is hampered at present and then use our collective energies to enable its flourishing. In a sense, all three authors propose to employ the dominant ideology of consumer society (Greenfield's \"rhetoric of the powerful\") to limit the dominance of the market and to justify an activist state. Salecl offers a strong rejoinder to this view. The Slovenian philosopher, who has no practical suggestions to make and mixes her observations about Internet dating and plastic surgery with largely unhelpful passages of dense Lacanian analysis and a dollop of Marxism, comes close to saying that belief in genuine (unfettered, rational, individual) choice is the greatest myth of all. For not only does this faith require us to ignore our own psychology, in which it is not neurological hardwiring but unconscious impulses and desires that rule; it can also prevent us from acknowledging that today, as the language of choice maximization permeates even the intimate realms of sex and reproduction, we must throw off its chains in order to envision something new. Indeed, Salecl warns us rather ominously that we are never more caught up in the ideology of choice than when we think we have escaped it by embracing simplicity and personally opting out! Iyengar actually makes a similar case-and in more accessible terms. Her position between two cultures (that of India, where she was born and has strong ties, and that of the United States, where she lives and works) allows her some fine observations about choice as ultimately one set of narrative conventions among several possibilities, and one that works less well for her Indian relatives, not to mention postcommunist Eastern Europeans or the Japanese, than for her Columbia Business School colleagues. The Art of Choosing opens with the story of her own family's arrival in North America told from three perspectives-that of fate, accident and choice-precisely to show that there is nothing natural about imposing choice and self-determination as the main rubrics for making sense of the raw data of our lives, from birth to marriage(s) to death. Yet in the end, Iyengar refuses to adjudicate and simply tells her readers of the importance of recognizing cultural differences (or \"metaphorical multilingualism,\" as she calls it) when it comes to business values such as risk and choice. She herself risks nothing more incendiary than that. Salecl alone uses a discussion of free-choice ideology to offer a robust critique of a global culture of individual acquisition and self-betterment that, she argues, has resulted neither in greater happiness nor greater justice. She never denies that making choices is an \"essential human capacity,\" one that renders change possible. But she also wants to remind us that choice and coercion are closely related (for her, the consumer is the new slave), and that the more our menu of options grows in size or significance, the more we will seek, consciously or not, to bind ourselves in other ways in compensation, whether through psychological mechanisms or the legal arm of the state. For Salecl, even the enduring appeal of the idea of a higher power is but another way to deal with the uncertainty and anxiety brought on by having to make so many decisions by and for oneself in the first place. The Tyranny of Choice thus belongs to the very dialectical history it is charting; this brief book is itself a powerful demand for collective restraint in light of the burden of proliferating choice. The question we are left with is whether the way forward lies in turning the neoliberal language of choice against the market model, or in imagining the world in entirely different terms.\n\n* * * The bulk of these books is given over to laying bare the problem, often with a focus on consumer behavior, rather than considering what could be done to remedy the situation. A repeated touchstone is Iyengar and her colleague Mark Lepper's taste-testing experiment in which shoppers in an upscale food market in California were presented with, on one occasion, samples of three flavors of jam and, on another occasion, twenty-four flavors. After trying a bite or two, those in the first group proved many times more likely to walk out of the store with a purchase. Those in the second group found themselves flummoxed by all the possibilities and consequently paralyzed by indecision when it came to deciding what to buy. This now-famous finding (Iyengar jokes about having to talk about it with strangers on planes) has been widely taken to illustrate the pitfalls of endlessly expanding \"choice sets.\" Advertisers are urged to pay attention: people yearn-despite their protestations to the contrary-for guidance in how to limit their choices. And in keeping with this marketing orientation, the prescriptions for consumers proffered by these books remain, by and large, frustratingly small, personal and individualized in nature. One constant refrain is the importance of developing expertise in the domain in which one needs to make a choice, but even more in the psychology of decision-making. Practical knowledge of the brain's workings gets repackaged as empowerment, a tool that will supposedly allow people not only to work successfully against their biases, but also to prioritize in the realm of choice and, in some cases, to opt out of choosing at all. Barry Schwartz, in his 2003 book The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less , cleverly insisted that choosing not to choose was on its way to becoming the new mark of autonomy. Iyengar's catch-phrase is that we must be \"choosy about choosing.\" There is also an odd infatuation on the part of many of these authors with voluntary restraints and \"precommitments\": marriage contracts, self-imposed retirement savings plans, and websites like StickK.com that commit a user to making donations to unacceptable charities as a punishment for violating a contract-say, to quit smoking or lose twenty pounds-made with oneself. It is hard not to see such responses as signs of resignation in the face of an unalterable status quo. If the overabundance of choice is inescapable, maybe the best one can do is to try occasionally to turn one's back on it, often with the purchase of yet another consumer good or app. This is certainly Iyengar's emphasis. Her pathbreaking research on decision-making was originally made famous by Malcolm Gladwell. In The Art of Choosing , she popularizes her own findings very much in the chatty Gladwellian vein, easily moving from stories drawn from her own life to self-administered \"tests\" for the reader and accounts of quirky academic studies conducted in business schools and psychology departments-many of which, ironically, involve deceiving participants about their aims and, in essence, depriving them of the chance to make an informed choice. Before an oddly compelling personal account of her own experience, as a blind woman, picking a nail polish color, Iyengar makes a cloying appeal to her readers turned pals: \"We've been together in this book for several chapters now, and you've been a good sport, so I'm going to share a secret: Sometimes I like to turn my choice into someone else's problem.\" It comes as no surprise, then, that her \"solutions,\" including boldface takeaways offered in an epilogue, generally amount to no more than platitudes aimed at you individually, dear reader, about not sweating the small stuff, knowing thyself and thy goals, respecting difference, relinquishing control to someone else (a \"choice provider\") when the time is right, and not beating oneself up for making errors (\"maybe we all need to focus a little less on perfection and more on the joys of simply spending time with the people we love\"). She hardly expects us to stop shopping around. * * * But deep in chapter two, Iyengar makes a proposal that saves The Art of Choosing from being a simple Gladwellian knockoff. In her exceedingly cautious way, she sketches the outlines of a political position. According to this view, individual willpower constitutes only half the story; \"freedom from,\" or acting without restraint or interference from other people, is insufficient without \"freedom to,\" or possessing resources that enable one to act. Iyengar thus quietly makes the case for that most unfashionable of ideas-active government-at the middle point between capitalism and socialism. And she does so, she says, as a means to facilitate a natural predilection, evident even in well-tended but depressed zoo animals, for what she calls \"true choice.\" As she explains it, \"true choice requires that a person have the ability to choose an option and not be prevented from choosing it by any external force, meaning that a system tending too far toward either extreme\"-capitalism or socialism-\"will limit people's opportunities.\" This is the same cause that, in different ways, rallies both Ben-Porath and Greenfield and suggests that a critique of the proliferation of choice can also allow for a serious reframing of liberalism and the market model. In Tough Choices , Ben-Porath is blunter about assigning government a positive role in shaping the \"landscape of choice,\" even as she too charts a middle course. Nothing is more wrongheaded, the political theorist notes, than the idea that we all choose as free and equal members of society as long as government stays out of the way.

He has, in this book, simply found a new way to endorse these progressive goals: by advocating public measures to make our choices more \"genuine\" and \"real.\" Greenfield, like Ben-Porath and Iyengar, still returns in the end to an imagined realm of authentic choice that, for all of these authors, equals authentic freedom. It remains unclear in each case if unhampered choice constitutes the human condition in some earlier period or natural state (in which case, we are reminded of Rousseau's insistence that people in developed societies must now be \"forced to be free\"), or if genuine choice exists only in some utopia yet to be achieved. It is hard to know in part because so much of the writing on this subject is dedicated to explaining, à la Greenfield, that the constraints on our ability to choose are more extensive than we imagine. Nevertheless, the common thread in these accounts is that \"real\" or \"true\" or \"genuine\" or \"meaningful\" choice-the foundation of the liberal imagination-will indeed prevail if, and only if, we learn to pay attention to the ways it is hampered at present and then use our collective energies to enable its flourishing. In a sense, all three authors propose to employ the dominant ideology of consumer society (Greenfield's \"rhetoric of the powerful\") to limit the dominance of the market and to justify an activist state. Salecl offers a strong rejoinder to this view. The Slovenian philosopher, who has no practical suggestions to make and mixes her observations about Internet dating and plastic surgery with largely unhelpful passages of dense Lacanian analysis and a dollop of Marxism, comes close to saying that belief in genuine (unfettered, rational, individual) choice is the greatest myth of all. For not only does this faith require us to ignore our own psychology, in which it is not neurological hardwiring but unconscious impulses and desires that rule; it can also prevent us from acknowledging that today, as the language of choice maximization permeates even the intimate realms of sex and reproduction, we must throw off its chains in order to envision something new. Indeed, Salecl warns us rather ominously that we are never more caught up in the ideology of choice than when we think we have escaped it by embracing simplicity and personally opting out! Iyengar actually makes a similar case-and in more accessible terms. Her position between two cultures (that of India, where she was born and has strong ties, and that of the United States, where she lives and works) allows her some fine observations about choice as ultimately one set of narrative conventions among several possibilities, and one that works less well for her Indian relatives, not to mention postcommunist Eastern Europeans or the Japanese, than for her Columbia Business School colleagues. The Art of Choosing opens with the story of her own family's arrival in North America told from three perspectives-that of fate, accident and choice-precisely to show that there is nothing natural about imposing choice and self-determination as the main rubrics for making sense of the raw data of our lives, from birth to marriage(s) to death. Yet in the end, Iyengar refuses to adjudicate and simply tells her readers of the importance of recognizing cultural differences (or \"metaphorical multilingualism,\" as she calls it) when it comes to business values such as risk and choice. She herself risks nothing more incendiary than that. Salecl alone uses a discussion of free-choice ideology to offer a robust critique of a global culture of individual acquisition and self-betterment that, she argues, has resulted neither in greater happiness nor greater justice. She never denies that making choices is an \"essential human capacity,\" one that renders change possible. But she also wants to remind us that choice and coercion are closely related (for her, the consumer is the new slave), and that the more our menu of options grows in size or significance, the more we will seek, consciously or not, to bind ourselves in other ways in compensation, whether through psychological mechanisms or the legal arm of the state. For Salecl, even the enduring appeal of the idea of a higher power is but another way to deal with the uncertainty and anxiety brought on by having to make so many decisions by and for oneself in the first place. The Tyranny of Choice thus belongs to the very dialectical history it is charting; this brief book is itself a powerful demand for collective restraint in light of the burden of proliferating choice. The question we are left with is whether the way forward lies in turning the neoliberal language of choice against the market model, or in imagining the world in entirely different terms.\n\nThe bulk of these books is given over to laying bare the problem, often with a focus on consumer behavior, rather than considering what could be done to remedy the situation. A repeated touchstone is Iyengar and her colleague Mark Lepper's taste-testing experiment in which shoppers in an upscale food market in California were presented with, on one occasion, samples of three flavors of jam and, on another occasion, twenty-four flavors. After trying a bite or two, those in the first group proved many times more likely to walk out of the store with a purchase. Those in the second group found themselves flummoxed by all the possibilities and consequently paralyzed by indecision when it came to deciding what to buy. This now-famous finding (Iyengar jokes about having to talk about it with strangers on planes) has been widely taken to illustrate the pitfalls of endlessly expanding \"choice sets.\" Advertisers are urged to pay attention: people yearn-despite their protestations to the contrary-for guidance in how to limit their choices. And in keeping with this marketing orientation, the prescriptions for consumers proffered by these books remain, by and large, frustratingly small, personal and individualized in nature. One constant refrain is the importance of developing expertise in the domain in which one needs to make a choice, but even more in the psychology of decision-making. Practical knowledge of the brain's workings gets repackaged as empowerment, a tool that will supposedly allow people not only to work successfully against their biases, but also to prioritize in the realm of choice and, in some cases, to opt out of choosing at all. Barry Schwartz, in his 2003 book The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less , cleverly insisted that choosing not to choose was on its way to becoming the new mark of autonomy. Iyengar's catch-phrase is that we must be \"choosy about choosing.\" There is also an odd infatuation on the part of many of these authors with voluntary restraints and \"precommitments\": marriage contracts, self-imposed retirement savings plans, and websites like StickK.com that commit a user to making donations to unacceptable charities as a punishment for violating a contract-say, to quit smoking or lose twenty pounds-made with oneself. It is hard not to see such responses as signs of resignation in the face of an unalterable status quo. If the overabundance of choice is inescapable, maybe the best one can do is to try occasionally to turn one's back on it, often with the purchase of yet another consumer good or app. This is certainly Iyengar's emphasis. Her pathbreaking research on decision-making was originally made famous by Malcolm Gladwell. In The Art of Choosing , she popularizes her own findings very much in the chatty Gladwellian vein, easily moving from stories drawn from her own life to self-administered \"tests\" for the reader and accounts of quirky academic studies conducted in business schools and psychology departments-many of which, ironically, involve deceiving participants about their aims and, in essence, depriving them of the chance to make an informed choice. Before an oddly compelling personal account of her own experience, as a blind woman, picking a nail polish color, Iyengar makes a cloying appeal to her readers turned pals: \"We've been together in this book for several chapters now, and you've been a good sport, so I'm going to share a secret: Sometimes I like to turn my choice into someone else's problem.\" It comes as no surprise, then, that her \"solutions,\" including boldface takeaways offered in an epilogue, generally amount to no more than platitudes aimed at you individually, dear reader, about not sweating the small stuff, knowing thyself and thy goals, respecting difference, relinquishing control to someone else (a \"choice provider\") when the time is right, and not beating oneself up for making errors (\"maybe we all need to focus a little less on perfection and more on the joys of simply spending time with the people we love\"). She hardly expects us to stop shopping around. * * * But deep in chapter two, Iyengar makes a proposal that saves The Art of Choosing from being a simple Gladwellian knockoff. In her exceedingly cautious way, she sketches the outlines of a political position. According to this view, individual willpower constitutes only half the story; \"freedom from,\" or acting without restraint or interference from other people, is insufficient without \"freedom to,\" or possessing resources that enable one to act. Iyengar thus quietly makes the case for that most unfashionable of ideas-active government-at the middle point between capitalism and socialism. And she does so, she says, as a means to facilitate a natural predilection, evident even in well-tended but depressed zoo animals, for what she calls \"true choice.\" As she explains it, \"true choice requires that a person have the ability to choose an option and not be prevented from choosing it by any external force, meaning that a system tending too far toward either extreme\"-capitalism or socialism-\"will limit people's opportunities.\" This is the same cause that, in different ways, rallies both Ben-Porath and Greenfield and suggests that a critique of the proliferation of choice can also allow for a serious reframing of liberalism and the market model. In Tough Choices , Ben-Porath is blunter about assigning government a positive role in shaping the \"landscape of choice,\" even as she too charts a middle course. Nothing is more wrongheaded, the political theorist notes, than the idea that we all choose as free and equal members of society as long as government stays out of the way. On the contrary, new findings about how badly we perform in the business of decision-making-but also about how limited the choices are for some, and how aggravating an abundance of choice is for others-are cause for reassessing our attachment to liberal paradigms that unthinkingly take choice to be a virtue in and of itself. The problem, argues Ben-Porath, is that liberals still have not relinquished the discredited idea of the rational individual, left to his or her own devices, as an inherently effective and contented master of his or her own domain. If we took seriously the empirical research of psychologists like Kahneman, Tversky and Dan Ariely and accepted that \"simply providing more choice does not necessarily improve individuals' opportunities to make choices that are good for them,\" we would discover that we could all do a better job of determining our preferences if we had some help. Tough Choices is not, however, simply a brief for \"libertarian paternalism,\" or a fashionable defense of small-scale government programs aimed at encouraging people to want what they should want and decide what they should decide-such as whether to take an apple or a doughnut on the cafeteria line. Ben-Porath is after something bigger than merely prompting good choices by moving the apples closer to the cash register. The state is already heavily invested in the business of shaping how we choose, she explains, and minor forms of manipulation (\"nudges,\" in the parlance of libertarian paternalists Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler) do little to alleviate the inequality of choice conditions. A disciple of University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann and an expert in schooling, Ben-Porath argues instead for what she calls \"structured paternalism,\" or more extensive manipulation of the \"choice architecture,\" designed to put adults as well as children in a position where they can make \"informed\" and \"meaningful\" choices. What guidelines the state should follow in establishing this choice architecture remain persistently vague; Ben-Porath pushes the promotion of civic equality (equal participation in the democratic process) as well as the creation of opportunity equality (an equal chance at self-betterment)-while also insisting on safeguarding the \"diverse preferences\" rooted in the culture or personality of those doing the choosing. This seems a rather conflicted set of goals on which to build policy. But in the most basic of terms, Ben-Porath wants to convince us that sometimes it is a very good idea for the state to regulate or even to restrict the menu of options, as in marriage or banking, precisely so as to \"allow individuals to better pursue their preferences and aspirations\" or make sounder choices. This is an important formulation in and of itself. * * * Greenfield offers a different, if not antithetical, response. Most of The Myth of Choice reads as a cheerfully contrarian, verging-on-cute account of the wide variety of unrecognized constraints on free choice that already shape our lives. For the first three-quarters of the book, we are back in the territory of Gladwell and Iyengar, once again being regaled with the Great Jam Experiment alongside juicy court cases, familiar news stories (Abu Ghraib, Hurricane Katrina) and advertising references (\"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\" \"Have it your way\"), and a lot of breezily told anecdotes about a coal-mining grandfather who got paid in scrip, the hazards of middle-class American child-rearing, and the joys and frustrations of shopping at Best Buy and Whole Foods. Our problematic brains trick us at every turn, we learn once again. Cultural norms keep us on the straight and narrow, circumscribing our range of options and stifling dissent. Why else, with all those choices available, do we generally seek to wear almost the same clothes as everyone else? Rules and authority figures do more of the same (and here we also get the famous Milgram experiment of the 1960s, in which participants proved willing to administer electric shocks to fellow volunteers rather than resist a professor's orders). Finally, Greenfield insists that the market itself restricts our choices as much as it enables them, leaving all of us feeling overwhelmed, our collective moral and social dilemmas unsatisfactorily resolved, and the poor essentially powerless. As he notes in one of many clever asides, the one choice not really available to us is the choice to limit the spread of the market and its values. What is more surprising about Greenfield's book is where this overly long rehearsal of the \"myth\" of choice ends up. Rather than simply urge limited disengagement from consumer society as a principled response to a world of hollow choices, as one might expect, Greenfield, a law professor, argues for the cultivation of two old-fashioned virtues: \"empathy,\" or compassion toward others, and \"humility\" about oneself. Empathy, of course, is the very word that sent Republicans into a tailspin when President Obama called it an important quality in a Supreme Court justice on the eve of Sandra Sotomayor's appointment. But Greenfield hopes that if we move away from the destructive tendency to see an idealized world of \"free choice\" as the ground on which we all operate, and if we make more of an effort to acknowledge the various constraints that produced our own (or others') bad choices, we will come to a political conclusion. If we were really serious about promoting choice and personal responsibility across the board, we would need substantially more help from the government, especially the law. Not for Greenfield either is the small-bore paternalism of nudges, in which the tools of advertisers and marketers are turned toward socially constructive ends. Greenfield unabashedly advocates an interventionist state that prevents economic need from becoming a source of coercion and also promotes (as opposed to tolerates) diversity and dissent.

And she does so, she says, as a means to facilitate a natural predilection, evident even in well-tended but depressed zoo animals, for what she calls \"true choice.\" As she explains it, \"true choice requires that a person have the ability to choose an option and not be prevented from choosing it by any external force, meaning that a system tending too far toward either extreme\"-capitalism or socialism-\"will limit people's opportunities.\" This is the same cause that, in different ways, rallies both Ben-Porath and Greenfield and suggests that a critique of the proliferation of choice can also allow for a serious reframing of liberalism and the market model. In Tough Choices , Ben-Porath is blunter about assigning government a positive role in shaping the \"landscape of choice,\" even as she too charts a middle course. Nothing is more wrongheaded, the political theorist notes, than the idea that we all choose as free and equal members of society as long as government stays out of the way. On the contrary, new findings about how badly we perform in the business of decision-making-but also about how limited the choices are for some, and how aggravating an abundance of choice is for others-are cause for reassessing our attachment to liberal paradigms that unthinkingly take choice to be a virtue in and of itself. The problem, argues Ben-Porath, is that liberals still have not relinquished the discredited idea of the rational individual, left to his or her own devices, as an inherently effective and contented master of his or her own domain. If we took seriously the empirical research of psychologists like Kahneman, Tversky and Dan Ariely and accepted that \"simply providing more choice does not necessarily improve individuals' opportunities to make choices that are good for them,\" we would discover that we could all do a better job of determining our preferences if we had some help. Tough Choices is not, however, simply a brief for \"libertarian paternalism,\" or a fashionable defense of small-scale government programs aimed at encouraging people to want what they should want and decide what they should decide-such as whether to take an apple or a doughnut on the cafeteria line. Ben-Porath is after something bigger than merely prompting good choices by moving the apples closer to the cash register. The state is already heavily invested in the business of shaping how we choose, she explains, and minor forms of manipulation (\"nudges,\" in the parlance of libertarian paternalists Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler) do little to alleviate the inequality of choice conditions. A disciple of University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann and an expert in schooling, Ben-Porath argues instead for what she calls \"structured paternalism,\" or more extensive manipulation of the \"choice architecture,\" designed to put adults as well as children in a position where they can make \"informed\" and \"meaningful\" choices. What guidelines the state should follow in establishing this choice architecture remain persistently vague; Ben-Porath pushes the promotion of civic equality (equal participation in the democratic process) as well as the creation of opportunity equality (an equal chance at self-betterment)-while also insisting on safeguarding the \"diverse preferences\" rooted in the culture or personality of those doing the choosing. This seems a rather conflicted set of goals on which to build policy. But in the most basic of terms, Ben-Porath wants to convince us that sometimes it is a very good idea for the state to regulate or even to restrict the menu of options, as in marriage or banking, precisely so as to \"allow individuals to better pursue their preferences and aspirations\" or make sounder choices. This is an important formulation in and of itself. * * * Greenfield offers a different, if not antithetical, response. Most of The Myth of Choice reads as a cheerfully contrarian, verging-on-cute account of the wide variety of unrecognized constraints on free choice that already shape our lives. For the first three-quarters of the book, we are back in the territory of Gladwell and Iyengar, once again being regaled with the Great Jam Experiment alongside juicy court cases, familiar news stories (Abu Ghraib, Hurricane Katrina) and advertising references (\"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\" \"Have it your way\"), and a lot of breezily told anecdotes about a coal-mining grandfather who got paid in scrip, the hazards of middle-class American child-rearing, and the joys and frustrations of shopping at Best Buy and Whole Foods. Our problematic brains trick us at every turn, we learn once again. Cultural norms keep us on the straight and narrow, circumscribing our range of options and stifling dissent. Why else, with all those choices available, do we generally seek to wear almost the same clothes as everyone else? Rules and authority figures do more of the same (and here we also get the famous Milgram experiment of the 1960s, in which participants proved willing to administer electric shocks to fellow volunteers rather than resist a professor's orders). Finally, Greenfield insists that the market itself restricts our choices as much as it enables them, leaving all of us feeling overwhelmed, our collective moral and social dilemmas unsatisfactorily resolved, and the poor essentially powerless. As he notes in one of many clever asides, the one choice not really available to us is the choice to limit the spread of the market and its values. What is more surprising about Greenfield's book is where this overly long rehearsal of the \"myth\" of choice ends up. Rather than simply urge limited disengagement from consumer society as a principled response to a world of hollow choices, as one might expect, Greenfield, a law professor, argues for the cultivation of two old-fashioned virtues: \"empathy,\" or compassion toward others, and \"humility\" about oneself. Empathy, of course, is the very word that sent Republicans into a tailspin when President Obama called it an important quality in a Supreme Court justice on the eve of Sandra Sotomayor's appointment. But Greenfield hopes that if we move away from the destructive tendency to see an idealized world of \"free choice\" as the ground on which we all operate, and if we make more of an effort to acknowledge the various constraints that produced our own (or others') bad choices, we will come to a political conclusion. If we were really serious about promoting choice and personal responsibility across the board, we would need substantially more help from the government, especially the law. Not for Greenfield either is the small-bore paternalism of nudges, in which the tools of advertisers and marketers are turned toward socially constructive ends. Greenfield unabashedly advocates an interventionist state that prevents economic need from becoming a source of coercion and also promotes (as opposed to tolerates) diversity and dissent. He has, in this book, simply found a new way to endorse these progressive goals: by advocating public measures to make our choices more \"genuine\" and \"real.\" Greenfield, like Ben-Porath and Iyengar, still returns in the end to an imagined realm of authentic choice that, for all of these authors, equals authentic freedom. It remains unclear in each case if unhampered choice constitutes the human condition in some earlier period or natural state (in which case, we are reminded of Rousseau's insistence that people in developed societies must now be \"forced to be free\"), or if genuine choice exists only in some utopia yet to be achieved. It is hard to know in part because so much of the writing on this subject is dedicated to explaining, à la Greenfield, that the constraints on our ability to choose are more extensive than we imagine. Nevertheless, the common thread in these accounts is that \"real\" or \"true\" or \"genuine\" or \"meaningful\" choice-the foundation of the liberal imagination-will indeed prevail if, and only if, we learn to pay attention to the ways it is hampered at present and then use our collective energies to enable its flourishing. In a sense, all three authors propose to employ the dominant ideology of consumer society (Greenfield's \"rhetoric of the powerful\") to limit the dominance of the market and to justify an activist state. Salecl offers a strong rejoinder to this view. The Slovenian philosopher, who has no practical suggestions to make and mixes her observations about Internet dating and plastic surgery with largely unhelpful passages of dense Lacanian analysis and a dollop of Marxism, comes close to saying that belief in genuine (unfettered, rational, individual) choice is the greatest myth of all. For not only does this faith require us to ignore our own psychology, in which it is not neurological hardwiring but unconscious impulses and desires that rule; it can also prevent us from acknowledging that today, as the language of choice maximization permeates even the intimate realms of sex and reproduction, we must throw off its chains in order to envision something new. Indeed, Salecl warns us rather ominously that we are never more caught up in the ideology of choice than when we think we have escaped it by embracing simplicity and personally opting out! Iyengar actually makes a similar case-and in more accessible terms. Her position between two cultures (that of India, where she was born and has strong ties, and that of the United States, where she lives and works) allows her some fine observations about choice as ultimately one set of narrative conventions among several possibilities, and one that works less well for her Indian relatives, not to mention postcommunist Eastern Europeans or the Japanese, than for her Columbia Business School colleagues. The Art of Choosing opens with the story of her own family's arrival in North America told from three perspectives-that of fate, accident and choice-precisely to show that there is nothing natural about imposing choice and self-determination as the main rubrics for making sense of the raw data of our lives, from birth to marriage(s) to death. Yet in the end, Iyengar refuses to adjudicate and simply tells her readers of the importance of recognizing cultural differences (or \"metaphorical multilingualism,\" as she calls it) when it comes to business values such as risk and choice. She herself risks nothing more incendiary than that. Salecl alone uses a discussion of free-choice ideology to offer a robust critique of a global culture of individual acquisition and self-betterment that, she argues, has resulted neither in greater happiness nor greater justice. She never denies that making choices is an \"essential human capacity,\" one that renders change possible. But she also wants to remind us that choice and coercion are closely related (for her, the consumer is the new slave), and that the more our menu of options grows in size or significance, the more we will seek, consciously or not, to bind ourselves in other ways in compensation, whether through psychological mechanisms or the legal arm of the state. For Salecl, even the enduring appeal of the idea of a higher power is but another way to deal with the uncertainty and anxiety brought on by having to make so many decisions by and for oneself in the first place. The Tyranny of Choice thus belongs to the very dialectical history it is charting; this brief book is itself a powerful demand for collective restraint in light of the burden of proliferating choice. The question we are left with is whether the way forward lies in turning the neoliberal language of choice against the market model, or in imagining the world in entirely different terms.\n\n* * * But deep in chapter two, Iyengar makes a proposal that saves The Art of Choosing from being a simple Gladwellian knockoff. In her exceedingly cautious way, she sketches the outlines of a political position.

But in the most basic of terms, Ben-Porath wants to convince us that sometimes it is a very good idea for the state to regulate or even to restrict the menu of options, as in marriage or banking, precisely so as to \"allow individuals to better pursue their preferences and aspirations\" or make sounder choices. This is an important formulation in and of itself. * * * Greenfield offers a different, if not antithetical, response. Most of The Myth of Choice reads as a cheerfully contrarian, verging-on-cute account of the wide variety of unrecognized constraints on free choice that already shape our lives. For the first three-quarters of the book, we are back in the territory of Gladwell and Iyengar, once again being regaled with the Great Jam Experiment alongside juicy court cases, familiar news stories (Abu Ghraib, Hurricane Katrina) and advertising references (\"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas,\" \"Have it your way\"), and a lot of breezily told anecdotes about a coal-mining grandfather who got paid in scrip, the hazards of middle-class American child-rearing, and the joys and frustrations of shopping at Best Buy and Whole Foods. Our problematic brains trick us at every turn, we learn once again. Cultural norms keep us on the straight and narrow, circumscribing our range of options and stifling dissent. Why else, with all those choices available, do we generally seek to wear almost the same clothes as everyone else? Rules and authority figures do more of the same (and here we also get the famous Milgram experiment of the 1960s, in which participants proved willing to administer electric shocks to fellow volunteers rather than resist a professor's orders). Finally, Greenfield insists that the market itself restricts our choices as much as it enables them, leaving all of us feeling overwhelmed, our collective moral and social dilemmas unsatisfactorily resolved, and the poor essentially powerless. As he notes in one of many clever asides, the one choice not really available to us is the choice to limit the spread of the market and its values. What is more surprising about Greenfield's book is where this overly long rehearsal of the \"myth\" of choice ends up. Rather than simply urge limited disengagement from consumer society as a principled response to a world of hollow choices, as one might expect, Greenfield, a law professor, argues for the cultivation of two old-fashioned virtues: \"empathy,\" or compassion toward others, and \"humility\" about oneself. Empathy, of course, is the very word that sent Republicans into a tailspin when President Obama called it an important quality in a Supreme Court justice on the eve of Sandra Sotomayor's appointment. But Greenfield hopes that if we move away from the destructive tendency to see an idealized world of \"free choice\" as the ground on which we all operate, and if we make more of an effort to acknowledge the various constraints that produced our own (or others') bad choices, we will come to a political conclusion. If we were really serious about promoting choice and personal responsibility across the board, we would need substantially more help from the government, especially the law. Not for Greenfield either is the small-bore paternalism of nudges, in which the tools of advertisers and marketers are turned toward socially constructive ends. Greenfield unabashedly advocates an interventionist state that prevents economic need from becoming a source of coercion and also promotes (as opposed to tolerates) diversity and dissent. He has, in this book, simply found a new way to endorse these progressive goals: by advocating public measures to make our choices more \"genuine\" and \"real.\" Greenfield, like Ben-Porath and Iyengar, still returns in the end to an imagined realm of authentic choice that, for all of these authors, equals authentic freedom. It remains unclear in each case if unhampered choice constitutes the human condition in some earlier period or natural state (in which case, we are reminded of Rousseau's insistence that people in developed societies must now be \"forced to be free\"), or if genuine choice exists only in some utopia yet to be achieved. It is hard to know in part because so much of the writing on this subject is dedicated to explaining, à la Greenfield, that the constraints on our ability to choose are more extensive than we imagine. Nevertheless, the common thread in these accounts is that \"real\" or \"true\" or \"genuine\" or \"meaningful\" choice-the foundation of the liberal imagination-will indeed prevail if, and only if, we learn to pay attention to the ways it is hampered at present and then use our collective energies to enable its flourishing. In a sense, all three authors propose to employ the dominant ideology of consumer society (Greenfield's \"rhetoric of the powerful\") to limit the dominance of the market and to justify an activist state. Salecl offers a strong rejoinder to this view. The Slovenian philosopher, who has no practical suggestions to make and mixes her observations about Internet dating and plastic surgery with largely unhelpful passages of dense Lacanian analysis and a dollop of Marxism, comes close to saying that belief in genuine (unfettered, rational, individual) choice is the greatest myth of all. For not only does this faith require us to ignore our own psychology, in which it is not neurological hardwiring but unconscious impulses and desires that rule; it can also prevent us from acknowledging that today, as the language of choice maximization permeates even the intimate realms of sex and reproduction, we must throw off its chains in order to envision something new. Indeed, Salecl warns us rather ominously that we are never more caught up in the ideology of choice than when we think we have escaped it by embracing simplicity and personally opting out! Iyengar actually makes a similar case-and in more accessible terms. Her position between two cultures (that of India, where she was born and has strong ties, and that of the United States, where she lives and works) allows her some fine observations about choice as ultimately one set of narrative conventions among several possibilities, and one that works less well for her Indian relatives, not to mention postcommunist Eastern Europeans or the Japanese, than for her Columbia Business School colleagues. The Art of Choosing opens with the story of her own family's arrival in North America told from three perspectives-that of fate, accident and choice-precisely to show that there is nothing natural about imposing choice and self-determination as the main rubrics for making sense of the raw data of our lives, from birth to marriage(s) to death. Yet in the end, Iyengar refuses to adjudicate and simply tells her readers of the importance of recognizing cultural differences (or \"metaphorical multilingualism,\" as she calls it) when it comes to business values such as risk and choice. She herself risks nothing more incendiary than that. Salecl alone uses a discussion of free-choice ideology to offer a robust critique of a global culture of individual acquisition and self-betterment that, she argues, has resulted neither in greater happiness nor greater justice. She never denies that making choices is an \"essential human capacity,\" one that renders change possible. But she also wants to remind us that choice and coercion are closely related (for her, the consumer is the new slave), and that the more our menu of options grows in size or significance, the more we will seek, consciously or not, to bind ourselves in other ways in compensation, whether through psychological mechanisms or the legal arm of the state. For Salecl, even the enduring appeal of the idea of a higher power is but another way to deal with the uncertainty and anxiety brought on by having to make so many decisions by and for oneself in the first place. The Tyranny of Choice thus belongs to the very dialectical history it is charting; this brief book is itself a powerful demand for collective restraint in light of the burden of proliferating choice. The question we are left with is whether the way forward lies in turning the neoliberal language of choice against the market model, or in imagining the world in entirely different terms.\n\nTough Choices is not, however, simply a brief for \"libertarian paternalism,\" or a fashionable defense of small-scale government programs aimed at encouraging people to want what they should want and decide what they should decide-such as whether to take an apple or a doughnut on the cafeteria line. Ben-Porath is after something bigger than merely prompting good choices by moving the apples closer to the cash register. The state is already heavily invested in the business of shaping how we choose, she explains, and minor forms of manipulation (\"nudges,\" in the parlance of libertarian paternalists Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler) do little to alleviate the inequality of choice conditions. A disciple of University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann and an expert in schooling, Ben-Porath argues instead for what she calls \"structured paternalism,\" or more extensive manipulation of the \"choice architecture,\" designed to put adults as well as children in a position where they can make \"informed\" and \"meaningful\" choices. What guidelines the state should follow in establishing this choice architecture remain persistently vague; Ben-Porath pushes the promotion of civic equality (equal participation in the democratic process) as well as the creation of opportunity equality (an equal chance at self-betterment)-while also insisting on safeguarding the \"diverse preferences\" rooted in the culture or personality of those doing the choosing.

For not only does this faith require us to ignore our own psychology, in which it is not neurological hardwiring but unconscious impulses and desires that rule; it can also prevent us from acknowledging that today, as the language of choice maximization permeates even the intimate realms of sex and reproduction, we must throw off its chains in order to envision something new. Indeed, Salecl warns us rather ominously that we are never more caught up in the ideology of choice than when we think we have escaped it by embracing simplicity and personally opting out! Iyengar actually makes a similar case-and in more accessible terms. Her position between two cultures (that of India, where she was born and has strong ties, and that of the United States, where she lives and works) allows her some fine observations about choice as ultimately one set of narrative conventions among several possibilities, and one that works less well for her Indian relatives, not to mention postcommunist Eastern Europeans or the Japanese, than for her Columbia Business School colleagues. The Art of Choosing opens with the story of her own family's arrival in North America told from three perspectives-that of fate, accident and choice-precisely to show that there is nothing natural about imposing choice and self-determination as the main rubrics for making sense of the raw data of our lives, from birth to marriage(s) to death. Yet in the end, Iyengar refuses to adjudicate and simply tells her readers of the importance of recognizing cultural differences (or \"metaphorical multilingualism,\" as she calls it) when it comes to business values such as risk and choice. She herself risks nothing more incendiary than that. Salecl alone uses a discussion of free-choice ideology to offer a robust critique of a global culture of individual acquisition and self-betterment that, she argues, has resulted neither in greater happiness nor greater justice. She never denies that making choices is an \"essential human capacity,\" one that renders change possible. But she also wants to remind us that choice and coercion are closely related (for her, the consumer is the new slave), and that the more our menu of options grows in size or significance, the more we will seek, consciously or not, to bind ourselves in other ways in compensation, whether through psychological mechanisms or the legal arm of the state. For Salecl, even the enduring appeal of the idea of a higher power is but another way to deal with the uncertainty and anxiety brought on by having to make so many decisions by and for oneself in the first place. The Tyranny of Choice thus belongs to the very dialectical history it is charting; this brief book is itself a powerful demand for collective restraint in light of the burden of proliferating choice. The question we are left with is whether the way forward lies in turning the neoliberal language of choice against the market model, or in imagining the world in entirely different terms.\n\nWhat is more surprising about Greenfield's book is where this overly long rehearsal of the \"myth\" of choice ends up. Rather than simply urge limited disengagement from consumer society as a principled response to a world of hollow choices, as one might expect, Greenfield, a law professor, argues for the cultivation of two old-fashioned virtues: \"empathy,\" or compassion toward others, and \"humility\" about oneself. Empathy, of course, is the very word that sent Republicans into a tailspin when President Obama called it an important quality in a Supreme Court justice on the eve of Sandra Sotomayor's appointment. But Greenfield hopes that if we move away from the destructive tendency to see an idealized world of \"free choice\" as the ground on which we all operate, and if we make more of an effort to acknowledge the various constraints that produced our own (or others') bad choices, we will come to a political conclusion. If we were really serious about promoting choice and personal responsibility across the board, we would need substantially more help from the government, especially the law. Not for Greenfield either is the small-bore paternalism of nudges, in which the tools of advertisers and marketers are turned toward socially constructive ends. Greenfield unabashedly advocates an interventionist state that prevents economic need from becoming a source of coercion and also promotes (as opposed to tolerates) diversity and dissent. He has, in this book, simply found a new way to endorse these progressive goals: by advocating public measures to make our choices more \"genuine\" and \"real.\" Greenfield, like Ben-Porath and Iyengar, still returns in the end to an imagined realm of authentic choice that, for all of these authors, equals authentic freedom. It remains unclear in each case if unhampered choice constitutes the human condition in some earlier period or natural state (in which case, we are reminded of Rousseau's insistence that people in developed societies must now be \"forced to be free\"), or if genuine choice exists only in some utopia yet to be achieved. It is hard to know in part because so much of the writing on this subject is dedicated to explaining, à la Greenfield, that the constraints on our ability to choose are more extensive than we imagine. Nevertheless, the common thread in these accounts is that \"real\" or \"true\" or \"genuine\" or \"meaningful\" choice-the foundation of the liberal imagination-will indeed prevail if, and only if, we learn to pay attention to the ways it is hampered at present and then use our collective energies to enable its flourishing. In a sense, all three authors propose to employ the dominant ideology of consumer society (Greenfield's \"rhetoric of the powerful\") to limit the dominance of the market and to justify an activist state.

Activate your online access\n\nIn Colorado, Kentucky, and Nebraska, referendums on \"school choice\" are on the ballot in the 2024 election.\n\nSigns lie in the grass during a rally celebrating National School Choice Week.\n\nBallot referendums on \"school choice\" in Colorado, Kentucky, and Nebraska will decide whether billions of dollars of public funding should be used to subsidize private-school education.\n\nCampaigns around \"school choice\"-or the ability for parents to use funding originally allocated for their child's public education for a private school instead-have attracted millions in political donations during the 2024 election cycle. While proponents argue that it gives them greater control over their child's education, school choice can divert funding away from public schools and opens the door to using taxpayer money to fund private, religious education.\n\nSuch measures have been previously implemented in numerous other states through the establishment of education savings accounts, tax credits, and school vouchers. As of September, 29 states have at least one of these programs. In states with universal private school choice, more than $4 billion was spent on these programs, and $57.7 billion on public schools, according to FutureEd. The vast majority of these programs, a study found, exceeded their initial budget. And they're growing.\n\nThe National Education Association, the largest labor union for educators in the United States, has been among the most fervent groups in opposition to the measures, pouring millions of dollars into campaigns opposing school choice ballot referendums.\n\n\"Every student needs well-resourced neighborhood public schools that allow them to thrive in an interdependent world and live into their brilliance,\" NEA president Becky Pringle told The Nation . \"Instead of spending taxpayer dollars on private schools, we should focus on funding our public schools, where 90 percent of our students attend.\" Funding private schools is not what the people in these states want, she continued. \"We are confident that voters will reject vouchers at the ballot box this November.\"\n\nIn Kentucky, voters will decide whether to add an amendment to their state Constitution that would allow the legislature to \"provide financial support for the education of students outside the system of common schools.\" Originally introduced in the state legislature, the bill to add the amendment passed with overwhelming support: 65-12 in the House and 27-2 in the Senate.\n\nState Representative Susanne Miles, who helped spearhead the amendment, told The Nation that \"we are committed to continuing our support of public education, but know that there are far too many children left behind in the current system. If passed, this amendment would give us all more latitude to look at what's working in other states, and help us ensure that every Kentucky child has the opportunity to reach his or her potential.\" Kentucky's Board of Education unanimously passed a resolution opposing the bill and reaffirming its support for using tax dollars exclusively to fund public education.\n\nCharter schools are currently legal in Kentucky, but cannot be funded with tax dollars. This amendment could fundamentally change the model of education funding in the state, and allow parents to use public funds to support their child's religious education.\n\nIn a statement to The Nation , the chair of the Kentucky Democrats said the \"voucher scheme would be most destructive to our Commonwealth's rural communities, which includes 75 counties that lack private schools, and could cost Kentucky taxpayers $1.2 billion each year.\" The Kentucky GOP chair did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn Nebraska, voters will decide whether to repeal a state law known as LB1402, which authorizes $10 million annually in education scholarships to cover attendance costs for students at accredited private institutions. Support our Schools Nebraska put Referendum 435 on the ballot. \"Nebraskans cannot afford to pay for two school systems,\" Jenni Benson, the president of the organization, told The Nation .\n\nAmong the supporters of repeal are the Nebraska Democratic Party and the League of Women Voters of Nebraska, with their cause raising over $3.2 million in donations. In opposition are the Nebraska Family Alliance and the Omaha Catholic School Consortium. State Senator Lou Ann Linehan introduced the bill in question last year, passing it on a Senate vote of 32-14.\n\n\"Every child deserves an opportunity to attend the school that best fits his or her needs,\" Linehan told The Nation . She said that approximately 2,000 students have applied for and are already receiving funding under her law. \"I do not believe Nebraskans will take scholarships away from students,\" she said.\n\nColorado will also vote on a new constitutional amendment, but the ballot measure's vague phrasing has so far confused voters. The measure, as printed on the ballot, reads that \"each K-12 child has the right to school choice\" and defines school choice as \"neighborhood, charter, private, and home schools, open enrollment options, and future innovations in education.\"\n\nUnder current law , \"students may attend any public school for free, even if they do not live in the school district,\" but no public funding is spent on private schools or homeschooling. Although the ratification of the amendment would not immediately implement a school choice program, it would pave the way to doing so in the future.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nChris Lehmann\n\nA Colorado-based group-Catholic Education Partners-supports the school choice amendment, with president Shawn Peterson calling school choice the \"fundamental right of the parents, whom God in His Providence explicitly chooses for each child as the fruit of their love,\" adding that it is an \"amazing opportunity that will be and what a gift to all parents and children for generations to come.\"\n\nColorado Democratic Party chair Shad Murib said that \"school choice is something Coloradans already enjoy for their children, and this initiative is meant to sneakily open the door to taxpayers' footing the bill for private institutions.\"\n\n\"They know how unpopular that is when the truth is told, which is why they're misleading voters with lies and no disclaimer on who is paying for it,\" he said. \"This is shameful politics at its worst, and should make every Coloradan question the motives of the proponents.\"\n\nRead the rest of StudentNation's dispatches on the 2024 election here .\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Lives and lies graze one another in Neel Mukherjee's tragicomic novel.\n\nBy Jonathan Lee\n\nJonathan Lee's latest book, \"The Great Mistake,\" is out in paperback.\n\nWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\n\nCHOICE, by Neel Mukherjee\n\nNeel Mukherjee's \"Choice\" is a novel full of characters deciding how much truth to tell. As in \"The Lives of Others,\" the author's 2014 Booker Prize-shortlisted novel, we are confronted with subtle, powerful narratives within narratives exploring the gap between wealth and poverty, myopia and activism, fact and fiction. But here these themes deepen into an exploration of free will. A line from V.S. Naipaul's \"In a Free State\" comes to mind: \"The only lies for which we are truly punished are those we tell ourselves.\"\n\nIn the first of the novel's three parts, we follow a South Asian man named Ayush. The lie he is telling himself is that he can control his career, his family, his future. As the editorial director at a London publishing house, he reports to a white woman \"reputed to have a 'nose for a winner'\" - but the press is called Sewer, and Ayush can't \"shake off the feeling that he is their diversity box, ticked.\"\n\nAt home his husband, Luke, worries about Ayush's O.C.D. tendencies, but also his attempts to expose their two children to the repercussions of their choices. When they choose to eat meat, Ayush swaps out a bedtime story for a video of pigs being slaughtered. And when the kids seem as if they might still take their privilege for granted, he redirects 200,000 pounds from their education fund to \"three different climate change charities.\"\n\nThese choices may seem like the actions of a crackpot, but Mukherjee's trick is to make them also read as the plausible acts of a man clinging to a social conscience. Late capitalism doesn't seem to have helped Ayush's mental health, but when he acquires a brilliant manuscript, he is unburdened. Other people's stories offer a space within which he can stop struggling to control his own narrative.\n\nOne such manuscript forms the second section of \"Choice.\" We have already experienced Ayush's excitement about a short story by a publicity-shy author who goes by the pseudonym \"M.N. Opie\" - a tale about a young academic named Emily who gets caught up in a car accident. Now, in an enactment of Ayush's own thrill, we get to read that very story.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, the target of the proposed deal, rejected the offer from Choice, which is now pursuing a hostile takeover . And in early December, an association representing the majority of hoteliers who own Choice and Wyndham-branded properties came out strongly against it.\n\n\"We all don't know what's driving this merger. Many of us feel it's not needed,\" said Bharat Patel, the chairman of the organization, the Asian American Hotel Owners Association. The group surveyed its 20,000 members and found that about 77 percent of respondents who own hotels under either brand or both thought a merger would hurt their business.\n\n\"I'm not against Choice or Wyndham,\" said Mr. Patel, who owns two Choice hotels. \"We just need robust competition in the markets.\"\n\nThat opposition illustrates a growing resistance to consolidation in industries that have grown more concentrated in recent years. Even some Wall Street analysts have expressed skepticism that Choice's proposal is a good idea.\n\nCombining the two companies would create America's largest branded hotel chain\n\nNote: Data is as of Dec. 19.\n\nSource: CoStar Group\n\nBy The New York Times\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "The Choice Explosion\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy David Brooks\n\nLansing, W.Va. - A few years ago, the social psychologist Sheena Iyengar asked 100 American and Japanese college students to take a piece of paper. On one side, she had them write down the decisions in life they would like to make for themselves. On the other, they wrote the decisions they would like to pass on to others.\n\nThe Americans filled up the side for decisions they want to decide for themselves. Where to live. What job to take. The other side was almost blank. The only \"decision\" they commonly wanted to hand off to others was, \"When I die.\"\n\nThe Japanese filled up the back side of the sheet with things they wanted others to decide: what they wore; what time they woke up; what they did at their job. The Americans desired choice in four times more domains than the Japanese.\n\nAmericans have always put great emphasis on individual choice. But even by our own standards we've had a choice explosion over the past 30 years. Americans now have more choices over more things than any other culture in human history. We can choose between a broader array of foods, media sources, lifestyles and identities. We have more freedom to live out our own sexual identities and more religious and nonreligious options to express our spiritual natures.\n\nThis opening has produced much that is wonderful. But making decisions well is incredibly difficult, even for highly educated professional decision makers. As Chip Heath and Dan Heath point out in their book \" Decisive ,\" 83 percent of corporate mergers and acquisitions do not increase shareholder value, 40 percent of senior hires do not last 18 months in their new position, 44 percent of lawyers would recommend that a young person not follow them into the law.\n\nIt's becoming incredibly important to learn to decide well, to develop the techniques of self-distancing to counteract the flaws in our own mental machinery. The Heath book is a very good compilation of those techniques.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Anyone who was not perniciously rebelling against the order of things had to accept what the authorities in the family, the state and the church saw fit to impose. The notion that you should have some say in constituting those authorities - by giving or withholding your consent to this or that leader or by deciding for yourself how to worship God (let alone by considering whether to believe in God at all) - was fiercely denounced. And though obedience was expected of all, it was particularly insisted upon for women, for it was Eve who was the first and most disastrous chooser.\n\nIn \"The Age of Choice ,\" the historian Sophia Rosenfeld offers a rich, compelling account of how the experience of choosing ceased to be the object of suspicion and condemnation and became instead the hallmark, at least in liberal, democratic societies, of any life worth living.\n\nOn Freedom by Maggie Nelson Nelson's brainy, affecting, genre-crossing books have earned her a deserved reputation as a sui generis amalgam of poet, memoirist, theorist and critic. This provocative meditation on the ethics of freedom as a source of constraint, as well as liberation, shows her at her most original and brilliant.\n\nRead our review.\n\nJane Austen by Helena Kelly Was Jane Austen a radical or a monarchist? This wide-ranging, informative survey of the 18th-century novelist's life and writing is a clear vote in the former column and an important revisionary work.\n\nRead our review.\n\nInventing Human Rights by Lynn Hunt Hunt argues that the concept of human rights had its origin in 18th-century France. In the midst of the republican revolution there emerged \"an implacable logic\" that expanded an ideal of equality to all sorts of individuals and groups, including Jews, enslaved people and women.\n\nRead our review.\n\nThe transformation, she acknowledges, did not happen overnight, and its roots are too tangled to allow her to construct a single, straightforward narrative. But, locating crucial initial impulses in the 18th century, she first focuses attention on a London auctioneer named Christopher Cock. Cock cleverly came up with sales techniques that engaged potential purchasers \"in a form of carefully choreographed choice-making behavior.\" Renting a large space, he artfully arranged the goods he was auctioning off and invited the public to stroll about and decide what they might want to acquire. In effect, he invented shopping. And shopping, Rosenfeld suggests, is at once the supreme model and the most powerful motor force for a society centered on choice rather than compulsion.\n\nThe discovery of choice, wrote Immanuel Kant, at once awakened in whole nations the freedom to fashion their own futures and aroused ceaseless anxiety. By comparison, a shopper's decision as whether to buy a purple or yellow calico seems too trivial to notice. But Rosenfeld convincingly argues that the republican agitator and the bargain hunter are bound up in the same story and that a surprisingly crucial role in this story is played by women. During the 18th century, shopping, and hence the whole culture of consumption engaged in fueling it, was, she writes, \"increasingly coded as feminine.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Too Many Choices: A Problem That Can Paralyze\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nShortcuts\n\nBy Alina Tugend\n\nTAKE my younger son to an ice cream parlor or restaurant if you really want to torture him. He has to make a choice, and that's one thing he hates. Would chocolate chip or coffee chunk ice cream be better? The cheeseburger or the turkey wrap? His fear, he says, is that whatever he selects, the other option would have been better.\n\nGabriel is not alone in his agony. Although it has long been the common wisdom in our country that there is no such thing as too many choices, as psychologists and economists study the issue, they are concluding that an overload of options may actually paralyze people or push them into decisions that are against their own best interest.\n\nThere is a famous jam study (famous, at least, among those who research choice), that is often used to bolster this point. Sheena Iyengar, a professor of business at Columbia University and the author of \"The Art of Choosing,\" (Twelve) to be published next month, conducted the study in 1995.\n\nIn a California gourmet market, Professor Iyengar and her research assistants set up a booth of samples of Wilkin & Sons jams. Every few hours, they switched from offering a selection of 24 jams to a group of six jams. On average, customers tasted two jams, regardless of the size of the assortment, and each one received a coupon good for $1 off one Wilkin & Sons jam.\n\nHere's the interesting part. Sixty percent of customers were drawn to the large assortment, while only 40 percent stopped by the small one. But 30 percent of the people who had sampled from the small assortment decided to buy jam, while only 3 percent of those confronted with the two dozen jams purchased a jar.\n\nThat study \"raised the hypothesis that the presence of choice might be appealing as a theory,\" Professor Iyengar said last year, \"but in reality, people might find more and more choice to actually be debilitating.\"\n\nOver the years, versions of the jam study have been conducted using all sorts of subjects, like chocolate and speed dating.\n\nBut Benjamin Scheibehenne, a research scientist at the University of Basel in Switzerland, said it might be too simple to conclude that too many choices are bad, just as it is wrong to assume that more choices are always better. It can depend on what information we're being given as we make those choices, the type of expertise we have to rely on and how much importance we ascribe to each choice.\n\nMr. Scheibehenne recently co-wrote an analysis, to be published in October in The Journal of Consumer Research, examining dozens of studies about choices. One problem, he said, is separating the concept of choice overload from information overload.\n\nIn other words, he said, how much are people affected by the number of choices and \"how much from the lack of information or any prior understanding of the options?\"\n\nI know this from experience. A while back, I spent a great deal of time trying to decide which company should provide our Internet, phone and television cable service. I was looking at only two alternatives, but the options - cost, length of contract, present and future discounts, quality of service - made the decision inordinately difficult.\n\nThis was not only because I wanted to get the best deal, but because the information from the companies was overly complicated and vague. I suspected that both companies were less interested in my welfare than in getting my money - and I didn't want to be a sucker. This was a problem partly of choice overload - too many options - but also of poor information.\n\nResearch also shows that an excess of choices often leads us to be less, not more, satisfied once we actually decide. There's often that nagging feeling we could have done better.\n\nUnderstanding how we choose could guide employers and policy makers in helping us make better decisions. For example, most of us know that it's a wise decision to save in a 401(k). But studies have shown that if more fund options are offered, fewer people participate. And the highest participation rates are among those employees who are automatically enrolled in their company's 401(k)'s unless they actively choose not to.\n\nThis is a case where offering a default option of opting in, rather than opting out (as many have suggested with organ donations as well) doesn't take away choice but guides us to make better ones, according to Richard H. Thaler, an economics professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago, and Cass R. Sunstein, a professor at Chicago's law school, who are the authors of \"Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness\" (Yale University Press, 2008). Making choices can be most difficult in the area of health. While we don't want to go back to the days when doctors unilaterally determined what was best, there may be ways of changing policy so that families are not forced to make unbearable choices.\n\nProfessor Iyengar and some colleagues compared how American and French families coped after making the heart-wrenching decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment from an infant. In the United States, parents must make the decision to end the treatment, while in France, the doctors decide, unless explicitly challenged by the parents.\n\nThis contrast in the \"choosing experience,\" she wrote, made a difference in how the families later coped with their decisions.\n\nFrench families weren't as angry or confused about what had happened, and focused much less on how things might have been or should have been than the American parents.\n\nIt is important to note that no one is suggesting that parents be kept out of the loop in such a crucial matter. Rather, the choice, as Professor Iyengar said, was between \"informed choosers\" and \"informed nonchoosers.\"\n\nSince, fortunately, most of our decisions are less weighty, one way to tackle the choice problem is to become more comfortable with the idea of \"good enough,\" said Barry Schwartz, a professor of psychology at Swarthmore College and author of \"The Paradox of Choice\" (Ecco, 2003).\n\nSeeking the perfect choice, even in big decisions like colleges, \"is a recipe for misery,\" Professor Schwartz said.\n\nThis concept may even extend to, yes, marriage. Lori Gottlieb is the author of \"Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough\" (Dutton Adult, 2010). Too many women - her book focused on women - \"think I have to pick just the right one. Instead of wondering, 'Am I happy?' they wonder, 'Is this the best I can do?' \"\n\nAnd even though we now have the capacity, via the Internet, to research choices endlessly, it doesn't mean we should. When looking, for example, for a new camera or a hotel, Professor Schwartz said, limit yourself to three Web sites. As Mr. Scheibehenne said: \"It is not clear that more choice gives you more freedom. It could decrease our freedom if we spend so much time trying to make choices.\"\n\nE-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com\n\nAdvertisement"

Clearly his talent for emotional manipulation far exceeds his humility.\n\nTo oil the assembly line and hawk the brand more efficiently, Mr. Sparks now has his own production company, and \"The Choice\" is its first release. As such, it hews closely to the tried-and-tested formula of a white-bread love affair, usually set in North Carolina and with an unending supply of hurdles and Hallmark moments. Puppies and beaches, sunsets and sappy dialogue slosh around on screen in a suspension of sugary pop tunes; rain-soaked trysts and lingering tragedy are virtually a given.\n\nYet \"The Notebook\" had a mad, youthful energy and a romantic authenticity that its stars, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, and its director, Nick Cassavetes, knew how to deliver. As the bickering-but-besotted pair Gabby and Travis in \"The Choice,\" Teresa Palmer and Benjamin Walker struggle to achieve not just chemistry but a single sincere moment.\n\nHe's a commitment-phobic veterinarian whose father, Shep (Tom Wilkinson), is so kindly he's even named after a dog. She's the least stressed medical student ever, with a boyfriend (Tom Welling, somewhat chunkier than when he trained for the Superman suit in the excellent \"Smallville\" ) who is nothing more than a cardboard prop. The lovers' only real obstacle, in fact, is that she's a pill.\n\nDirected by Ross Katz and filmed like an ad for erectile-dysfunction medication, \"The Choice\" is almost repellently synthetic. Travis's dog, Moby, however, should be given his own movie immediately.\n\n\"The Choice\" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Kitchen-table coitus and illegitimate puppies.\n\nMovie data powered by IMDb.com\n\nAdvertisement"

To have choice is to be free, according to many.\n\nSo how many Americans actually have choices, and what type of freedom do choices provide?\n\nCurrent Medicare enrollees have more choices than any other Americans - to some, in fact, an overwhelmingly large number of them.\n\nIn 2019 , 90 percent of Medicare enrollees had access to at least 10 Medicare Advantage plans, which are government-subsidized, private-plan alternatives to the traditional public program.\n\nBut this is just the beginning.

      "text": "On Charlotte Lucas's Choice\n\nIn honor of the two-hundredth anniversary of the publication of \"Pride and Prejudice\" this year, we're running a series of pieces on Jane Austen and her legacy.\n\nLike many long-time readers of \"Pride and Prejudice,\" I've returned, again and again, to the problem of Charlotte Lucas. Pretty much everyone in \"Pride and Prejudice\" gets the spouse they deserve, except for Charlotte. Elizabeth's best friend is a sensible, intelligent person, but because she isn't young, pretty, or rich, she ends up married to the maddening and empty-headed Mr. Collins. (Lizzy calls him, in a letter to her sister, a \"conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man.\") \"Pride and Prejudice\" is a joyous novel, but Charlotte's marriage is like the tomb in that Poussin painting \"Et in Arcadia ego.\" Even at Pemberley, I am here, it seems to say.\n\nI first read \"Pride and Prejudice\" in high school, and back then I didn't devote a lot of thought to Charlotte's marriage. As time has gone on, though, it's seemed more and more important to me. Growing older involves making compromises, and I suppose that has something to do with it. But I've also become more familiar with the importance, in life, of choice. In a lot of ways, that's what \"Pride and Prejudice\" is about: how we make choices. And no story in the novel says more about choices, about their difficulty and meaning, than Charlotte's.\n\nIt's often said that, from a material point of view, Charlotte has \"no choice\" but to marry Collins. I myself talked this way just now, when I said that Charlotte ends up marrying Collins \"because she isn't young, pretty, or rich,\" despite the fact that she's \"a sensible, intelligent person.\" But that's actually to misstate, or reverse, Charlotte's situation. It's certainly true that she isn't young, pretty, or rich, and that those facts set the stage for her marriage. But it's also true that Charlotte marries Collins because she is sensible and intelligent. It's actually her sensibleness that gives her no choice but to do it. What really compels her to marry him is her thoughtfulness.\n\nCharlotte's been thinking about marriage for years, and she's developed for herself a code of conduct for marriage, a set of rules that recognize the reality of her situation and direct her toward a solution. Long ago, she recognized that she was trapped in a social web; rather than ignoring her predicament, she set about understanding it. Charlotte's father, Sir William Lucas, was once a tradesman; after becoming the mayor of his town, he was presented with a knighthood. He retired, and is now a not-very-rich knight. Charlotte, therefore, is too wealthy, educated, and upper-class to marry a working man-that would be a kind of social demotion for her family-but too poor and average-looking to attract a truly wealthy one. She can't marry up or down-she can only marry sideways. She knows and understands all of this. Collins, awful as he is, is actually her social equal. He is stupid and horrible (or \"neither sensible nor agreeable,\" as Charlotte thinks), but, like Charlotte, he occupies the very lowest rung on the ladder of social respectability. For her whole life Charlotte has probably known that she would end up marrying someone like him: a clergyman, probably with some education and the prospect of a growing income in the future. She's always known that there wouldn't be a lot of men to choose from.\n\nCharlotte knows, moreover, that she has to marry someone ; it's part of her responsibility to herself. When Charlotte first tells Lizzy about her decision, Lizzy is unequivocal in her response: Charlotte, she thinks, is \"disgracing herself\"; she has \"sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage\"; it will be, she thinks, \"impossible\" for her to be happy. To Lizzy, and to us, it can seem as though Charlotte has chosen a kind of oblivion, or spiritual suffocation. Charlotte's life, as Lizzy sees it, will consist entirely of \"her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry.\" But Lizzy, when she thinks these things, hasn't thought as carefully as Charlotte has about what \"worldly advantage\" might mean.\n\nAlmost certainly, Charlotte has a finely textured idea of the future she is choosing-she's spent a long time thinking not just about her present situation but also about what the future might hold. You can get a sense of the sort of future Charlotte might be hoping for by looking to Austen's own family. Austen's father, George Austen, was an orphan; his father had been a surgeon (a good job, but not a \"respectable\" one). In all likelihood, George, too, would have learned a trade and become a workingman, but he had an uncle, Francis Austen, who was a solicitor, and who steered him away from the trades and into the Anglican church, where he could achieve a certain degree of gentility. A clergyman could never become an aristocrat, of course. But he could live a respectable life because his income derived from tithe rather than trade; eventually, he might even achieve some measure of political power by becoming, say, a justice of the peace. With this in mind, Francis paid George's tuition until he could win a scholarship to Oxford. Unlike Mr. Collins, George Austen was intelligent, charming, and attractive. (One of Jane Austen's nieces, Anne Lefroy, wrote that he was \"considered extremely handsome... it was a beauty which stood by him all his life.\" In particular, she remembered his hair, remarkable for its perfect \"milk-whiteness,\" \"very beautiful, with short curls about the ears,\" and his eyes, \"not large, but of a peculiar and bright hazel\"; Aunt Jane, she thought, had inherited them.) While at Oxford, he met Jane's mother, Cassandra Leigh. She wasn't rich, but she came from a well-educated and well-connected family; one of her ancestors had been the Lord Mayor of London.\n\nEventually, George was able to become what was known as a \"pluralist\": a clergyman who oversaw two churches and had two incomes. They added to that money by farming their land and selling the produce, as well as by taking on pupils in the parsonage. With all of that combined, George and Cassandra were able to raise a large family. They had six sons and two daughters. Neither of the daughters married, but two of the sons became clergymen themselves, and two more became admirals in the navy. One son was adopted by a childless couple, and inherited a great deal of property from them.\n\nThe Austens struggled; they weren't rich. But they did live with a degree of security and gentility that many people would have envied, and, in this, they followed one of the recognizable patterns of social mobility in the Georgian age. It's easy to imagine Charlotte hoping for a similar future. In the best of all possible worlds, she and Collins might build a life like the Austens'. That possibility isn't something that, in good conscience, Charlotte could set aside. She's happy to have the chance for such a life. \"At the age of twenty-seven,\" Austen writes, \"without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.\"\n\nIf Mr. Collins were like George Austen, of course, no one would find Charlotte's marriage the least bit unsettling. Unfortunately, he's heart-stoppingly awful. My favorite televisual Collins is David Bamber, who played him for the BBC, in 1995. Bamber's Collins isn't merely dumb or silly; he's aggressive, even slightly unhinged, the Cujo of suitors, a mentally shambling matrimonial zombie. (\"Almost as soon as I entered the house,\" he tells Lizzy , \"I singled you out as the companion of my future life.\") The idea of living with him, and of intimacy with him, is horrifying.\n\nCollins, you might feel, isn't quite a real person. He's more like a villain: so awful that he makes you wonder whether Charlotte's sensible, intelligent plan might be a mistake. In an odd way, Collins's awfulness and Charlotte's pragmatism take the measure of one another: in order to make Charlotte's pragmatism feel problematic, Austen has to make Collins really terrible; and, by the same token, in order to make marriage to Collins even remotely plausible, she has to make Charlotte almost unbelievably pragmatic. But the result, at any rate, is an almost perfect puzzle for readers. Charlotte, by her own reasoning, has no choice but to marry Collins; Collins, meanwhile, is so terrible that he makes you question the whole idea of being responsible in the first place. Maybe, you think, Charlotte should toss everything out. Do something crazy. Decide, in a Dostoyevskian grand gesture, that it would be better to be alone than to be with him.\n\nAusten herself once received a proposal-her only proposal, in fact-from a Collins-like man. His name was Harris Bigg-Wither, and she had known him since childhood. He wasn't a catch. (Caroline Austen, another of Jane's nieces, recalled him this way: \"Very plain in person-awkward, and even uncouth in manner-nothing but his size to recommend him-he was a fine big man-but one need not look about for secret reasons to account for a young lady's not loving him.\") He was, however, well-to-do; he owned several estates, and marrying him would have given Austen a family life of her own, as well as financial security not just for herself but also for her unmarried sister. She accepted his proposal, and there was a celebration in the Austen house that evening. Then, the next morning, she announced that she had changed her mind. Austen, I imagine, agreed to marry him because it made sense, and because she was the kind of person who did what was sensible. But, as Fanny Lefroy, one of her nieces, wrote, overnight she experienced a \"revulsion of feeling.\" By and large, this has been seen as a wise decision, rather than a disaster. (\"We would naturally rather have 'Mansfield Park' and 'Emma,'\" the Austen biographer Claire Tomalin writes, a little venomously, \"than the Bigg-Wither baby Jane Austen might have given the world.\") All this happened in early December, 1802, a few weeks before Jane turned twenty-seven-Charlotte's age.\n\nThinking about George and Cassandra, Charlotte and Collins, and Jane and Harris, I've often been struck by the way their stories overlap. There's a sense in which, by writing about Lizzy and Charlotte, Austen was writing about two generations of her own family. Charlotte's marriage is animated by her parents' hope but it's made dangerous by her own experience. She is taking two different stories, from two different moments in time, and placing them alongside one another, implicitly comparing the caution and constraint of an earlier generation with the individualistic freedom of a later one. Family history, I find, is an interesting lens through which to think about the marriages in \"Pride and Prejudice.\" I come from an immigrant family, and, when I contemplate its history, I often think about how lucky we've all been. My parents and grandparents came, pretty much, from nothing, but were blessed with intelligence and character, and favored, on an unknowably vast number of occasions, by chance. If things had been slightly different, who knows where we might've ended up?\n\nI'm the beneficiary of all their good fortune; I've had to make fewer compromises and accept fewer hard realities than my parents or grandparents. Perhaps Austen had similar thoughts and, in writing Charlotte and Collins, tried to correct for the sample bias created by her parents' luck and success. Just as Austen herself had just enough security, just enough freedom, to reject Harris Bigg-Wither, so Lizzy can reject Collins: accepting his proposal, she can tell him, is \"absolutely impossible.\" But that impossibility, we know, is just a matter of chance-just a matter of where you happen to be located along the path of social progress. A few days later, when Charlotte tells Lizzy that she's engaged to Collins, the same phrase slips out, in a moment of almost unforgivable rudeness: \"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte-impossible!\" It's now a cruel thing to say. For Charlotte, marrying Collins is the only possibility. In fact, it's not marrying Collins that's impossible.\n\nIn 1940, the critic D. W. Harding wrote an influential essay on Austen called \"Regulated Hatred.\" Harding wanted to overturn a certain view of Austen. For some readers, Austen's novels are a kind of cathedral, within which certain ideals-vivacity, thoughtfulness, wit, affection, romance, and so on-are enshrined. To them, Austen seems like a philosopher, a romantic rationalist; you go to her books when you want to be reminded of what's great and good. Harding, who had trained as both a literary critic and a psychologist, thought that this view of Austen missed what was most interesting about her. To understand Austen, he thought, you had to think of her as a person living in a town, in a house, surrounded by friends and family. Her novels, he argued, were really for, about, and against the people she lived with everyday. How did Austen feel about the people around her? She loved her family and friends, and \"had a deep need of their affection and a genuine respect for the ordered, decent civilisation that they upheld.\" But, at the same time, she \"was sensitive to their crudenesses and complacencies, and knew that her real existence depended on resisting many of the values they implied.\" She wanted to express her resistance, to declare her spiritual, if not practical, independence. She needed to share her interior life, her deep convictions and feelings. What she needed was a way to do this without transgressing the bounds of decorum, of propriety, of good taste, of sound judgment, fairness, and equanimity. \"The novels,\" Harding wrote,\n\ngave her a way out of this dilemma. This, rather than the ambition of entertaining a posterity of urbane gentlemen, was her motive force in writing.... Part of her aim was to find the means for unobtrusive spiritual survival, without open conflict with the friendly people around her whose standards in simpler things she could accept and whose affection she greatly needed.\n\nFew critics today are as openly therapeutic as Harding. Even so, I like the way he thinks about Austen. I admire the philosophical aspects of her novels, the way they're like perfectly organized little worlds-French gardens planted in English soil. But I love Harding's Austen more: the Expressionist Austen, the modern, emotional, psychological one, the writer trying to say something, in a gentle, \"regulated\" way, to them -her friends and family. Charlotte's marriage, more than any other episode in the novel, seems to me a coded expression of Austen's own dissent. In thinking about Charlotte, most people I know waver between acceptance and anger, between frustration and understanding. Like Lizzy, they pace back and forth between \"How could she marry that man?\" and \"Of course, she had to\"; between \"What a sad case!\" and \"Lots of people do it.\" Maybe that's how Austen felt about her own disappointing, insufficient proposal. And Charlotte's choice expresses some other, more surprising feelings. There's anger, sadness, understanding, and all the rest of it. But there's also a thirst for rebellion, a desire for risk, even a smidgen of relief, which Lizzy feels-a sense of being very lucky. Among other things, Charlotte's marriage says: \"Thank God I didn't have to marry him. Thank God I had a choice, and could say no.\" Charlotte's decision gives Austen a way to express everything that Lizzy and Darcy's marriage can't.\n\nIt goes without saying, too, that Charlotte's marriage doesn't just sit there, inert; it plays a role in the plot. The critic Stuart Tave, in a classic essay on Austen called \"Limitations and Definitions,\" describes the way it affects Lizzy. Charlotte's marriage, he writes, pushes Lizzy \"to rethink what she has been doing, to understand better those people who have not acted as she expected they would.\"\n\nThere was a time when she would not, for the sake of one individual, \"change the meaning\" of principle and integrity or blur the line between selfishness and prudence in matrimonial affairs. Now she is asking cynically what the difference is between the mercenary and the prudent motive, and where does discretion end and avarice begin.\n\nLizzy, before Charlotte's choice, was a bit of a fantasist herself; after it, she grows more realistic. Her own openness to Darcy derives, to a large degree, from her openness to Charlotte. It's because of Charlotte that Lizzy permits herself that famous thought, when she looks across the valley at Darcy's estate: \"To be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\" And Charlotte's choice teaches Lizzy other, more abstract lessons. One lesson is that there are many kinds of happiness. Another, as Tave writes, is that \"life is not a disorder to be ordered, a given mess on which those of tidy compulsions impose a tidiness. It is not a meaningless heap from which meaning is extracted.... Meaning is the first fact.\" From Charlotte, who will always live an imperfect life, Lizzy learns that imperfect things matter just as much as perfect ones.\n\nAnd Lizzy learns to trust in the sturdiness of individuals-in their ability to persist, to survive, even to thrive, through the most dramatic changes and upheavals. It seems impossible that Lizzy's friendship with Charlotte should be able to survive Mr. Collins, and yet they remain friends. Charlotte is still Charlotte. This lends Lizzy a certain confidence. The core of a person isn't so easily changed; and, conversely, a person can change a great deal, can navigate her way through extreme circumstances, and still remain herself. That, really, is the most remarkable aspect of Lizzy's relationship with Darcy. It's a wildly changeable relationship. They've argued and flirted, offended, admired, disdained, respected, hated, and loved one another. They've said all sorts of outrageous and unforgivable things-starting, of course, with Darcy's muttered verdict about Elizabeth, \"Tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me .\" At some point, you'd think, a line would've been crossed; something would have been said that couldn't be unsaid; a commitment to animosity would've been made that couldn't be dissolved, an opinion formed that couldn't be reversed. It never happens. When Darcy proposes to Lizzy, he's nervous, for the obvious reason that, over the past year, he's offended her in a hundred different ways. But Lizzy, Austen writes, reassures him \"that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.\" It's a miracle, he knows. His behavior, he tells her, was \"unpardonable\"; the letter he wrote, he says, contained \"expressions which might justly make you hate me.\" \"The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it,\" Lizzy says, \"are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it must be forgotten.\" A little later, Lizzy comes home and tells Jane the good news.\n\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here. \"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!-engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\"\n\nYou can't blame Jane for her skepticism. And her skepticism must be only a shadow of what Lizzy and Darcy themselves felt once they had examined their feelings and recognized them for what they were. They could easily have given up-could have concluded, sensibly, that after all that had happened a future together would be impossible.\n\nIt turns out, though, that people can change their minds, their circumstances, their opinions, their plans, their rules, their lives, without losing track of themselves. There's something miraculous in people-a resilience, an infiniteness-which can survive constraint, transformation, reversal, and anything else imaginable. The thread doesn't have to be broken. This never-ending pulse of personality is what gives Lizzy and Darcy the courage to change, and it's what makes it possible, I think, to hope for Charlotte's happiness. People, Austen seems to say, are not so easily dominated by their own lives. Charlotte will always be a little apart from her circumstances. Her life will go on.\n\nPrevious pieces in this series included William Deresiewicz's \" Happy Birthday, Pride and Prejudice! \" and Rebecca Mead on George Eliot and Jane Austen .\n\nIllustration by Barry Blitt.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Choice\n\nThe morning was cold and the sky was bright. Aretha Franklin wore a large and interesting hat. Yo-Yo Ma urged his frozen fingers to play the cello, and the Reverend Joseph E. Lowery, a civil-rights comrade of Martin Luther King, Jr.,'s, read a benediction that began with \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" the segregation-era lamentation of American realities and celebration of American ideals. On that day in Washington-Inauguration Day, January 20, 2009-the blustery chill penetrated every coat, yet the discomfort was no impediment to joy. The police estimated that more than a million and a half people had crowded onto the Mall, making this the largest public gathering in the history of the capital. Very few could see the speakers. It didn't matter. People had come to be with other people, to mark an unusual thing: a historical event that was elective, not befallen.\n\nJust after noon, Barack Hussein Obama, the forty-seven-year-old son of a white Kansan and a black Kenyan, an uncommonly talented if modestly credentialled legislator from Illinois, took the oath of office as the forty-fourth President of the United States. That night, after the inaugural balls, President Obama and his wife and their daughters slept at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, a white house built by black men, slaves of West African heritage.\n\nObama succeeded George W. Bush, a two-term President whose misbegotten legacy, measured in the money it squandered and the misery it inflicted, has become only more evident with time. Bush left behind an America in dire condition and with a degraded reputation. On Inauguration Day, the United States was in a downward financial spiral brought on by predatory lending, legally sanctioned greed and pyramid schemes, an economic policy geared to the priorities and the comforts of what soon came to be called \"the one per cent,\" and deregulation that began before the Bush Presidency. In 2008 alone, more than two and a half million jobs were lost-up to three-quarters of a million jobs a month. The gross domestic product was shrinking at a rate of nine per cent. Housing prices collapsed. Credit markets collapsed. The stock market collapsed-and, with it, the retirement prospects of millions. Foreclosures and evictions were ubiquitous; whole neighborhoods and towns emptied. The automobile industry appeared to be headed for bankruptcy. Banks as large as Lehman Brothers were dead, and other banks were foundering. It was a crisis of historic dimensions and global ramifications. However skillful the management in Washington, the slump was bound to last longer than any since the Great Depression.\n\nAt the same time, the United States was in the midst of the grinding and unnecessary war in Iraq, which killed a hundred thousand Iraqis and four thousand Americans, and depleted the federal coffers. The political and moral damage of Bush's duplicitous rush to war rivalled the conflict's price in blood and treasure. America's standing in the world was further compromised by the torture of prisoners and by illegal surveillance at home. Al Qaeda, which, on September 11, 2001, killed three thousand people on American soil, was still strong. Its leader, Osama bin Laden, was, despite a global manhunt, living securely in Abbottabad, a verdant retreat near Islamabad.\n\nAs if to intensify the sense of crisis, on Inauguration Day the national-security apparatus informed the President-elect that Al Shabaab, a Somali affiliate of the Al Qaeda network, had sent terrorists across the Canadian border and was planning an attack on the Mall, possibly on Obama himself. That danger proved illusory; the others proved to be more onerous than anyone had imagined. The satirical paper The Onion came up with a painfully apt inaugural headline: \" BLACK MAN GIVEN NATION'S WORST JOB .\"\n\nBarack Obama began his Presidency devoted to the idea of post-partisanship. His rhetoric, starting with his \"Red State, Blue State\" Convention speech, in 2004, and his 2006 book, \"The Audacity of Hope,\" was imbued with that idea. Just as in his memoir, \"Dreams from My Father,\" he had tried to reconcile the disparate pasts of his parents, Obama was determined to bring together warring tribes in Washington and beyond. He extended his hand to everyone from the increasingly radical leadership of the congressional Republicans to the ruling mullahs of the Iranian theocracy. The Republicans, however, showed no greater interest in working with Obama than did the ayatollahs. The Iranian regime went on enriching uranium and crushing its opposition, and the Republicans, led by Dickensian scolds, including the Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, committed themselves to a single goal: to engineer the President's political destruction by defeating his major initiatives. Obama, for his part, did not always prove particularly adept at, or engaged by, the arts of retail persuasion, and his dream of bipartisanship collided with the reality of obstructionism.\n\nPerhaps inevitably, the President has disappointed some of his most ardent supporters. Part of their disappointment is a reflection of the fantastical expectations that attached to him. Some, quite reasonably, are disappointed in his policy failures (on Guantánamo, climate change, and gun control); others question the morality of the persistent use of predator drones. And, of course, 2012 offers nothing like the ecstasy of taking part in a historical advance: the reëlection of the first African-American President does not inspire the same level of communal pride. But the reëlection of a President who has been progressive, competent, rational, decent, and, at times, visionary is a serious matter. The President has achieved a run of ambitious legislative, social, and foreign-policy successes that relieved a large measure of the human suffering and national shame inflicted by the Bush Administration. Obama has renewed the honor of the office he holds.\n\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009-the $787-billion stimulus package-was well short of what some economists, including Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman, thought the crisis demanded. But it was larger in real dollars than any one of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal measures. It reversed the job-loss trend-according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as many as 3.6 million private-sector jobs have been created since June, 2009-and helped reset the course of the economy. It also represented the largest public investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower's interstate-highway program. From the start, though, Obama recognized that it would reap only modest political gain. \"It's very hard to prove a counterfactual,\" he told the journalist Jonathan Alter, \"where you say, 'You know, things really could have been a lot worse.' \" He was speaking of the bank and auto-industry bailouts, but the problem applies more broadly to the stimulus: harm averted is benefit unseen.\n\nAs for systemic reform, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which Obama signed into law in July, 2010, tightened capital requirements on banks, restricted predatory lending, and, in general, sought to prevent abuses of the sort that led to the crash of 2008. Against the counsel of some Republicans, including Mitt Romney, the Obama Administration led the takeover, rescue, and revival of the automobile industry. The Administration transformed the country's student-aid program, making it cheaper for students and saving the federal government sixty-two billion dollars-more than a third of which was put back into Pell grants. AmeriCorps, the country's largest public-service program, has been tripled in size.\n\nObama's most significant legislative achievement was a vast reform of the national health-care system. Five Presidents since the end of the Second World War have tried to pass legislation that would insure universal access to medical care, but all were defeated by deeply entrenched opposition. Obama-bolstered by the political cunning of the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi-succeeded. Some critics urged the President to press for a single-payer system-Medicare for all. Despite its ample merits, such a system had no chance of winning congressional backing. Obama achieved the achievable. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is the single greatest expansion of the social safety net since the advent of Medicaid and Medicare, in 1965. Not one Republican voted in favor of it.\n\nObama has passed no truly ambitious legislation related to climate change, shying from battle in the face of relentless opposition from congressional Republicans. Yet his environmental record is not as barren as it may seem. The stimulus bill provided for extensive investment in green energy, biofuels, and electric cars. In August, the Administration instituted new fuel-efficiency standards that should nearly double gas mileage; by 2025, new cars will need to average 54.5 miles per gallon.\n\nPresident Obama's commitment to civil rights has gone beyond rhetoric. During his first week in office, he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which protects women, minorities, and the disabled against unfair wage discrimination. By ending the military's ban on the service of those who are openly gay, and by endorsing marriage equality, Obama, more than any previous President, has been a strong advocate of the civil rights of gay men and lesbians. Finally, Obama appointed to the Supreme Court two highly competent women, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, the Court's first Hispanic. Kagan and Sotomayor are skilled and liberal-minded Justices who, abjuring dogmatism, represent a sober and sensible set of jurisprudential values.\n\nIn the realm of foreign policy, Obama came into office speaking the language of multilateralism and reconciliation-so much so that the Nobel Peace Prize committee, in an act as patronizing as it was premature, awarded him its laurels, in 2009. Obama was embarrassed by the award and recognized it for what it was: a rebuke to the Bush Administration. Still, the Norwegians were also getting at something more affirmative. Obama's Cairo speech, that same year, tried to help heal some of the wounds not only of the Iraq War but, more generally, of Western colonialism in the Middle East. Speaking at Cairo University, * Obama expressed regret that the West had used Muslim countries as pawns in the Cold War game of Risk. He spoke for the rights of women and against torture; he defended the legitimacy of the State of Israel while offering a straightforward assessment of the crucial issue of the Palestinians and their need for statehood, citing the \"humiliations-large and small-that come with occupation.\"\n\nIt was an edifying speech, but Obama was soon instructed in the limits of unilateral good will. Vladimir Putin, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Bashar al-Assad, Hu Jintao, and other autocrats hardened his spirit. Still, he proved a sophisticated and reliable diplomat and an effective Commander-in-Chief. He kept his promise to withdraw American troops from Iraq. He forbade torture. And he waged a far more forceful campaign against Al Qaeda than Bush had-a campaign that included the killing of Osama bin Laden. He negotiated-and won Senate approval of-a crucial strategic-arms deal with the Russians, slashing warheads and launchers on both sides and increasing the transparency of mutual inspections. In Afghanistan, he has set a reasonable course in an impossible situation.\n\nThe unsettled situations in Egypt and Libya, following the Arab Spring of 2010, make plain that that region's political trajectory is anything but fixed. Syria shames the world's inaction and confounds its hopes of decisive intervention. This is where Obama's respect for complexity is not an indulgence of intellectual vanity but a requirement for effective action. In the case of bin Laden, it was necessary to act alone and at once; in Libya, in concert with the Europeans; in Iran, cautiously but with decisive measures.\n\nOne quality that so many voters admired in Obama in 2008 was his unusual temperament: inspirational, yet formal, cool, hyper-rational. He promised to be the least crazy of Presidents, the least erratic and unpredictable. The triumph of that temperament was in evidence on a spring night in 2011, as he performed his duties, with a standup's precision and preternatural élan, at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, all the while knowing that he had, with no guarantee of success, dispatched Navy SEAL Team Six to kill bin Laden. In the modern era, we have had Presidents who were known to seduce interns (Kennedy and Clinton), talk to paintings (Nixon), and confuse movies with reality (Reagan). Obama's restraint has largely served him, and the country, well.\n\nBut Obama is also a human being, a flawed and complicated one, and as the world has come to know him better we have sometimes seen the downside of his temperament: a certain insularity and self-satisfaction; a tendency at times-as in the first debate with Mitt Romney-to betray disdain for the unpleasant tasks of politics. As a political warrior, Obama can be withdrawn, even strangely passive. He has sometimes struggled to convey the human stakes of the policies he has initiated. In the remaining days of the campaign, Obama must be entirely, and vividly, present, as he was in the second debate with Romney. He must clarify not only what he has achieved but also what he intends to achieve, how he intends to accelerate the recovery, spur employment, and allay the debt crisis; how he intends to deal with an increasingly perilous situation in Pakistan; what he will do if Iran fails to bring its nuclear program into line with international strictures. Most important, he needs to convey the larger vision that matches his outsized record of achievement.\n\nThere is another, larger \"counterfactual\" to consider-the one represented by Obama's Republican challenger, Willard Mitt Romney. The Republican Party's nominee is handsome, confident, and articulate. He made a fortune in business, first as a consultant, then in private equity. After running for the Senate in Massachusetts, in 1994, and failing to unseat Edward Kennedy, Romney relaunched his public career by presiding successfully over the 2002 Winter Olympics, in Salt Lake City. (A four-hundred-million-dollar federal bailout helped.) From 2003 to 2007, he was the governor of Massachusetts and, working with a Democratic legislature, succeeded in passing an impressive health-care bill. He has been running for President full time ever since.\n\nIn the service of that ambition, Romney has embraced the values and the priorities of a Republican Party that has grown increasingly reactionary and rigid in its social vision. It is a party dominated by those who despise government and see no value in public efforts aimed at ameliorating the immense and rapidly increasing inequalities in American society. A visitor to the F.D.R. Memorial, in Washington, is confronted by these words from Roosevelt's second Inaugural Address, etched in stone: \"The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide for those who have too little.\" Romney and the leaders of the contemporary G.O.P. would consider this a call to class warfare. Their effort to disenfranchise poor, black, Hispanic, and student voters in many states deepens the impression that Romney's remarks about the \"forty-seven per cent\" were a matter not of \"inelegant\" expression, as he later protested, but of genuine conviction.\n\nRomney's conviction is that the broad swath of citizens who do not pay federal income tax-a category that includes pensioners, soldiers, low-income workers, and those who have lost their jobs-are parasites, too far gone in sloth and dependency to be worth the breath one might spend asking for their votes. His descent to this cynical view-further evidenced by his selection of a running mate, Paul Ryan, who is the epitome of the contemporary radical Republican-has been dishearteningly smooth. He in essence renounced his greatest achievement in public life-the Massachusetts health-care law-because its national manifestation, Obamacare, is anathema to the Tea Party and to the G.O.P. in general. He has tacked to the hard right on abortion, immigration, gun laws, climate change, stem-cell research, gay rights, the Bush tax cuts, and a host of foreign-policy issues. He has signed the Grover Norquist no-tax-hike pledge and endorsed Ryan's winner-take-all economics.\n\nBut what is most disquieting is Romney's larger political vision. When he said that Obama \"takes his political inspiration from Europe, and from the socialist democrats in Europe,\" he was not only signalling Obama's \"otherness\" to one kind of conservative voter; he was suggesting that Obama's liberalism is in conflict with a uniquely American strain of individualism. The theme recurred when Romney and his allies jumped on Obama's observation that no entrepreneur creates a business entirely alone (\"You didn't build that\"). The Republicans continue to insist on the \"Atlas Shrugged\" fantasy of the solitary entrepreneurial genius who creates jobs and wealth with no assistance at all from government or society.\n\nIf the keynote of Obama's Administration has been public investment-whether in infrastructure, education, or health-the keynote of Romney's candidacy has been private equity, a realm in which efficiency and profitability are the supreme values. As a business model, private equity has had a mixed record. As a political template, it is stunted in the extreme. Private equity is concerned with rewarding winners and punishing losers. But a democracy cannot lay off its failing citizens. It cannot be content to leave any of its citizens behind-and certainly not the forty-seven per cent whom Romney wishes to fire from the polity.\n\nPrivate equity has served Romney well-he is said to be worth a quarter of a billion dollars. Wealth is hardly unique in a national candidate or in a President, but, unlike Franklin Roosevelt-or Teddy Roosevelt or John Kennedy-Romney seems to be keenly loyal to the perquisites and the presumptions of his class, the privileged cadre of Americans who, like him, pay extraordinarily low tax rates, with deductions for corporate jets. They seem content with a system in which a quarter of all earnings and forty per cent of all wealth go to one per cent of the population. Romney is among those who see business success as a sure sign of moral virtue.\n\nThe rest of us will have to take his word for it. Romney, breaking with custom, has declined to release more than two years of income-tax returns-a refusal of transparency that he has not afforded his own Vice-Presidential nominee. Even without those returns, we know that he has taken advantage of the tax code's gray areas, including the use of offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands. For all his undoubted patriotism, he evidently believes that money belongs to an empyrean far beyond such territorial attachments.\n\nBut holding foreign bank accounts is not a substitute for experience in foreign policy. In that area, he has outsourced his views to mediocre, ideologically driven advisers like Dan Senor and John Bolton. He speaks in Cold War jingoism. On a brief foray abroad this summer, he managed, in rapid order, to insult the British, to pander crudely to Benjamin Netanyahu in order to win the votes and contributions of his conservative Jewish and Evangelical supporters, and to dodge ordinary questions from the press in Poland. On the thorniest of foreign-policy problems-from Pakistan to Syria-his campaign has offered no alternatives except a set of tough-guy slogans and an oft-repeated faith in \"American exceptionalism.\"\n\nIn pursuit of swing voters, Romney and Ryan have sought to tamp down, and keep vague, the extremism of their economic and social commitments. But their signals to the Republican base and to the Tea Party are easily read: whatever was accomplished under Obama will be reversed or stifled. Bill Clinton has rightly pointed out that most Presidents set about fulfilling their campaign promises. Romney, despite his pose of chiselled equanimity, has pledged to ravage the safety net, oppose progress on marriage equality, ignore all warnings of ecological disaster, dismantle health-care reform, and appoint right-wing judges to the courts. Four of the nine Supreme Court Justices are in their seventies; a Romney Administration may well have a chance to replace two of the more liberal incumbents, and Romney's adviser in judicial affairs is the embittered far-right judge and legal scholar Robert Bork. The rightward drift of a court led by Justices Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito-a drift marked by appalling decisions like Citizens United-would only intensify during a Romney Presidency. The consolidation of a hard-right majority would be a mortal threat to the ability of women to make their own decisions about contraception and pregnancy, the ability of institutions to alleviate the baneful legacies of past oppression and present prejudice, and the ability of American democracy to insulate itself from the corrupt domination of unlimited, anonymous money. Romney has pronounced himself \"severely conservative.\" There is every reason to believe him.\n\nThe choice is clear. The Romney-Ryan ticket represents a constricted and backward-looking vision of America: the privatization of the public good. In contrast, the sort of public investment championed by Obama-and exemplified by both the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Affordable Care Act-takes to heart the old civil-rights motto \"Lifting as we climb.\" That effort cannot, by itself, reverse the rise of inequality that has been under way for at least three decades. But we've already seen the future that Romney represents, and it doesn't work.\n\nThe reëlection of Barack Obama is a matter of great urgency. Not only are we in broad agreement with his policy directions; we also see in him what is absent in Mitt Romney-a first-rate political temperament and a deep sense of fairness and integrity. A two-term Obama Administration will leave an enduringly positive imprint on political life. It will bolster the ideal of good governance and a social vision that tempers individualism with a concern for community. Every Presidential election involves a contest over the idea of America. Obama's America-one that progresses, however falteringly, toward social justice, tolerance, and equality-represents the future that this country deserves. ♦\n\n* Obama's speech was given at Cairo University, not at Al Azhar University.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Mavis Gallant's Choice\n\nExactly five years ago, in February, 2009, I travelled to Paris to interview Mavis Gallant for Granta . It was my second trip to Paris, my first after discovering her work. And so it was her Paris in which I found myself, a city she had long ago claimed and made her own, a city she had described to me repeatedly and unforgettably in her stories. From reading her, I recognized its dark mornings, its buildings, its streets, though I hardly knew my way around.\n\nShe picked me up in a taxi on Rue Jacob and told the driver to take us to the Village Voice Bookshop, where we were given a room upstairs to talk. A small woman, eighty-six years old, at once fierce and frail, with a girlish voice, a disarming smile, dramatic rings on her fingers. To prepare to meet her, I had reread everything, brought several tape recorders, and written out pages of questions. But, as soon as I posed the first, the conversation, much like her stories, veered sharply off course. She was at once gracious and proud, loquacious and cagey. She saw immediately beyond the contours, the confines of the conversation. She could not be captured or contained. She refused to discuss what did not interest her, just as she refused to waste words on the dispensable and predictable elements of a plot. There are only certain moments in life that matter, she told me. Those were the moments in which meaning lay.\n\nIn some ways, I was not the right person at all to interview her. I loved her work too much, and my debt to her was too great. I longed, in the course of three conversations that February, for some form of connection. But this proved to be impossible. I felt bewildered, disoriented, overwhelmed by her presence. It was not unlike the way I felt when reading her. But she was not a story I could go back to and read, and right away I felt she was running away from me. After the first conversation, I ignored my questions and listened. It was only afterward, hearing the tapes and transcribing them, that I absorbed the things she said.\n\nOur last evening together, I sat across from her at a Vietnamese restaurant, part of a small group at a long table. She was quiet, and seemed tired. I intuited, in the course of our time together, that she was reading but no longer writing, and I sensed her frustration because of it. At the last minute, before leaving, I told her the only thing I felt was worth conveying: \"No one writes as you do.\" I saw in her eyes that she had heard me, that it meant something to her. In the years that followed, we exchanged a few letters. Hers, written on postcards, were whimsical observations about nothing in particular. I kept the envelopes, addressed to me in her increasingly unsteady hand, propped against the wall of my writing desk.\n\nIn Italy, where I live now, I have put some distance between myself and the world that has formed me. Mavis is a part of that world. I have not read her in a few years, but I think of her constantly in Rome. I understand now what drew her to live and work abroad, untethered. I understand why she never returned. I understand the need to be detached not only from one's past but, to a certain degree, from one's present. Only then can one see without impediment or inhibition, as she did.\n\nIn her essay \"What Is Style,\" she writes, \"Literature is no more and nothing less than a matter of life and death.\" I have thought often and hard about this statement. It seemed at first a sweeping declaration, somewhat opaque. But over time this observation has grown specific, profound, startling in its significance. Stories were her means of survival. She belonged to them and nothing else. The defiant choice she made, to live as an expatriate, without family, and solely by means of her writing, was and remains a revolutionary act. Both in life and on the page, she blazed a trail no one since has dared follow.\n\nWhen I visited her in Paris, I was aware of the cost of this choice. She was alone, increasingly dependent on others. She had already given everything she had to the lives she had invented, the moments of truth and revelation she saw fit to preserve. She had understood families, history, the effects of war, pettiness, loneliness, absurdity, identity, exile, pain. She understood the brutality of life. She made her home in Paris and in the pages of this magazine. She marked her territory and mined it, as no one did.\n\nJhumpa Lahiri's most recent novel is \"The Lowland.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Choice\n\nThis Presidential campaign has been as ugly and as bitter as any in American memory. The ugliness has flowed mostly in one direction, reaching its apotheosis in the effort, undertaken by a supposedly independent group financed by friends of the incumbent, to portray the challenger-who in his mid-twenties was an exemplary combatant in both the Vietnam War and the movement to end that war-as a coward and a traitor. The bitterness has been felt mostly by the challenger's adherents; yet there has been more than enough to go around. This is one campaign in which no one thinks of having the band strike up \"Happy Days Are Here Again.\"\n\nThe heightened emotions of the race that (with any luck) will end on November 2, 2004, are rooted in the events of three previous Tuesdays. On Tuesday, November 7, 2000, more than a hundred and five million Americans went to the polls and, by a small but indisputable plurality, voted to make Al Gore President of the United States. Because of the way the votes were distributed, however, the outcome in the electoral college turned on the outcome in Florida. In that state, George W. Bush held a lead of some five hundred votes, one one-thousandth of Gore's national margin; irregularities, and there were many, all had the effect of taking votes away from Gore; and the state's electoral machinery was in the hands of Bush's brother, who was the governor, and one of Bush's state campaign co-chairs, who was the Florida secretary of state.\n\nBush sued to stop any recounting of the votes, and, on Tuesday, December 12th, the United States Supreme Court gave him what he wanted. Bush v. Gore was so shoddily reasoned and transparently partisan that the five justices who endorsed the decision declined to put their names on it, while the four dissenters did not bother to conceal their disgust. There are rules for settling electoral disputes of this kind, in federal and state law and in the Constitution itself. By ignoring them-by cutting off the process and installing Bush by fiat-the Court made a mockery not only of popular democracy but also of constitutional republicanism.\n\nA result so inimical to both majority rule and individual civic equality was bound to inflict damage on the fabric of comity. But the damage would have been far less severe if the new President had made some effort to take account of the special circumstances of his election-in the composition of his Cabinet, in the way that he pursued his policy goals, perhaps even in the goals themselves. He made no such effort. According to Bob Woodward in \"Plan of Attack,\" Vice-President Dick Cheney put it this way: \"From the very day we walked in the building, a notion of sort of a restrained presidency because it was such a close election, that lasted maybe thirty seconds. It was not contemplated for any length of time. We had an agenda, we ran on that agenda, we won the election-full speed ahead.\"\n\nThe new President's main order of business was to push through Congress a program of tax reductions overwhelmingly skewed to favor the very rich. The policies he pursued through executive action, such as weakening environmental protection and cutting off funds for international family-planning efforts, were mostly unpopular outside what became known (in English, not Arabic) as \"the base,\" which is to say the conservative movement and, especially, its evangelical component. The President's enthusiastic embrace of that movement was such that, four months into the Administration, the defection of a moderate senator from Vermont, Jim Jeffords, cost his party control of the Senate. And, four months after that, the President's political fortunes appeared to be coasting into a gentle but inexorable decline. Then came the blackest Tuesday of all.\n\nSeptember 11, 2001, brought with it one positive gift: a surge of solidarity, global and national-solidarity with and solidarity within the United States. This extraordinary outpouring provided Bush with a second opportunity to create something like a government of national unity. Again, he brushed the opportunity aside, choosing to use the political capital handed to him by Osama bin Laden to push through more elements of his unmandated domestic program. A year after 9/11, in the midterm elections, he increased his majority in the House and recaptured control of the Senate by portraying selected Democrats as friends of terrorism. Is it any wonder that the anger felt by many Democrats is even greater than can be explained by the profound differences in outlook between the two candidates and their parties?\n\nThe Bush Administration has had success in carrying out its policies and implementing its intentions, aided by majorities-political and, apparently, ideological-in both Houses of Congress. Substantively, however, its record has been one of failure, arrogance, and-strikingly for a team that prided itself on crisp professionalism-incompetence.\n\nIn January, 2001, just after Bush's inauguration, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office published its budget outlook for the coming decade. It showed a cumulative surplus of more than five trillion dollars. At the time, there was a lot of talk about what to do with the anticipated bounty, a discussion that now seems antique. Last year's federal deficit was three hundred and seventy-five billion dollars; this year's will top four hundred billion. According to the C.B.O., which came out with its latest projection in September, the period from 2005 to 2014 will see a cumulative shortfall of $2.3 trillion.\n\nEven this seven-trillion-dollar turnaround underestimates the looming fiscal disaster. In doing its calculations, the C.B.O. assumed that most of the Bush tax cuts would expire in 2011, as specified in the legislation that enacted them. However, nobody in Washington expects them to go away on schedule; they were designated as temporary only to make their ultimate results look less scary. If Congress extends the expiration deadlines-a near-certainty if Bush wins and the Republicans retain control of Congress-then, according to the C.B.O., the cumulative deficit between 2005 and 2014 will nearly double, to $4.5 trillion.\n\nWhat has the country received in return for mortgaging its future? The President says that his tax cuts lifted the economy before and after 9/11, thereby moderating the downturn that began with the Nasdaq's collapse in April, 2000. It's true that even badly designed tax cuts can give the economy a momentary jolt. But this doesn't make them wise policy. \"Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans,\" Bush said during his final debate with Senator John Kerry. This is false-a lie, actually-though at least it suggests some dim awareness that the reverse Robin Hood approach to tax cuts is politically and morally repugnant. But for tax cuts to stimulate economic activity quickly and efficiently they should go to people who will spend the extra money. Largely at the insistence of Democrats and moderate Republicans, the Bush cuts gave middle-class families some relief in the form of refunds, bigger child credits, and a smaller marriage penalty. Still, the rich do better, to put it mildly. Citizens for Tax Justice, a Washington research group whose findings have proved highly dependable, notes that, this year, a typical person in the lowest fifth of the income distribution will get a tax cut of ninety-one dollars, a typical person in the middle fifth will pocket eight hundred and sixty-three dollars, and a typical person in the top one per cent will collect a windfall of fifty-nine thousand two hundred and ninety-two dollars.\n\nThese disparities help explain the familiar charge that Bush will likely be the first chief executive since Hoover to preside over a net loss of American jobs. This Administration's most unshakable commitment has been to shifting the burden of taxation away from the sort of income that rewards wealth and onto the sort that rewards work. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, another Washington research group, estimates that the average federal tax rate on income generated from corporate dividends and capital gains is now about ten per cent. On wages and salaries it's about twenty-three per cent. The President promises, in a second term, to expand tax-free savings accounts, cut taxes further on dividends and capital gains, and permanently abolish the estate tax-all of which will widen the widening gap between the richest and the rest.\n\nBush signalled his approach toward the environment a few weeks into his term, when he reneged on a campaign pledge to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions, the primary cause of global warming. His record since then has been dictated, sometimes literally, by the industries affected. In 2002, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rescinding a key provision of the Clean Air Act known as \"new source review,\" which requires power-plant operators to install modern pollution controls when upgrading older facilities. The change, it turned out, had been recommended by some of the nation's largest polluters, in e-mails to the Energy Task Force, which was chaired by Vice-President Cheney. More recently, the Administration proposed new rules that would significantly weaken controls on mercury emissions from power plants. The E.P.A.'s regulation drafters had copied, in some instances verbatim, memos sent to it by a law firm representing the utility industry.\n\n\"I guess you'd say I'm a good steward of the land,\" Bush mused dreamily during debate No. 2. Or maybe you'd say nothing of the kind. The President has so far been unable to persuade the Senate to allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but vast stretches of accessible wilderness have been opened up to development. By stripping away restrictions on the use of federal lands, often through little-advertised rule changes, the Administration has potentially opened up sixty million acres, an area larger than Indiana and Iowa combined, to logging, mining, and oil exploration.\n\nDuring the fevered period immediately after September 11th, the Administration rushed what it was pleased to call the U.S.A. Patriot Act through a compliant Congress. Some of the reaction to that law has been excessive. Many of its provisions, such as allowing broader information-sharing among investigative agencies, are sensible. About others there are legitimate concerns. Section 215 of the law, for example, permits government investigators to obtain-without a subpoena or a search warrant based on probable cause-a court order entitling them to records from libraries, bookstores, doctors, universities, and Internet service providers, among other public and private entities. Officials of the Department of Justice say that they have used Section 215 with restraint, and that they have not, so far, sought information from libraries or bookstores. Their avowals of good faith would be more reassuring if their record were not otherwise so troubling.\n\nSecrecy and arrogance have been the touchstones of the Justice Department under Bush and his attorney general, John Ashcroft. Seven weeks after the 9/11 attacks, the Administration announced that its investigation had resulted in nearly twelve hundred arrests. The arrests have continued, but eventually the Administration simply stopped saying how many people were and are being held. In any event, not one of the detainees has been convicted of anything resembling a terrorist act. At least as reprehensible is the way that foreign nationals living in the United States have been treated. Since September 11th, some five thousand have been rounded up and more than five hundred have been deported, all for immigration infractions, after hearings that, in line with a novel doctrine asserted by Ashcroft, were held in secret. Since it is official policy not to deport terrorism suspects, it is unclear what legitimate anti-terror purpose these secret hearings serve.\n\nPresident Bush often complains about Democratic obstructionism, but the truth is that he has made considerable progress, if that's the right word, toward the goal of stocking the federal courts with conservative ideologues. The Senate has confirmed two hundred and one of his judicial nominees, more than the per-term averages for Presidents Clinton, Reagan, and Bush senior. Senate Republicans blocked more than sixty of Clinton's nominees; Senate Democrats have blocked only ten of Bush's. (Those ten, by the way, got exactly what they deserved. Some of them-such as Carolyn Kuhl, who devoted years of her career to trying to preserve tax breaks for colleges that practice racial discrimination, and Brett Kavanaugh, a thirty-eight-year-old with no judicial or courtroom experience who co-wrote the Starr Report-rank among the worst judicial appointments ever attempted.)\n\nEven so, to the extent that Bush and Ashcroft have been thwarted it has been due largely to our still vigorous federal judiciary, especially the Supreme Court. Like some of the Court's worst decisions of the past four years (Bush v. Gore again comes to mind), most of its best-salvaging affirmative action, upholding civil liberties for terrorist suspects, striking down Texas's anti-sodomy law, banning executions of the mentally retarded-were reached by one- or two-vote majorities. (Roe v. Wade is two justices removed from reversal.) All but one of the sitting justices are senior citizens, ranging in age from sixty-five to eighty-four, and the gap since the last appointment-ten years-is the longest since 1821. Bush has said more than once that Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas are his favorite justices. In a second Bush term, the Court could be remade in their images.\n\nThe record is similarly dismal in other areas of domestic policy. An executive order giving former Presidents the power to keep their papers indefinitely sealed is one example among many of a mania for secrecy that long antedates 9/11. The President's hostility to science, exemplified by his decision to place crippling limits on federal support of stem-cell research and by a systematic willingness to distort or suppress scientific findings discomfiting to \"the base,\" is such that scores of eminent scientists who are normally indifferent to politics have called for his defeat. The Administration's energy policies, especially its resistance to increasing fuel-efficiency requirements, are of a piece with its environmental irresponsibility. Even the highly touted No Child Left Behind education program, enacted with the support of the liberal lion Edward Kennedy, is being allowed to fail, on account of grossly inadequate funding. Some of the money that has been pumped into it has been leached from other education programs, dozens of which are slated for cuts next year.\n\nOrdinarily, such a record would be what lawyers call dispositive. But this election is anything but ordinary. Jobs, health care, education, and the rest may not count for much when weighed against the prospect of large-scale terrorist attack. The most important Presidential responsibility of the next four years, as of the past three, is the \"war on terror\"-more precisely, the struggle against a brand of Islamist fundamentalist totalitarianism that uses particularly ruthless forms of terrorism as its main weapon.\n\nBush's immediate reaction to the events of September 11, 2001, was an almost palpable bewilderment and anxiety. Within a few days, to the universal relief of his fellow-citizens, he seemed to find his focus. His decision to use American military power to topple the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan, who had turned their country into the principal base of operations for the perpetrators of the attacks, earned the near-unanimous support of the American people and of America's allies. Troops from Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, Norway, and Spain are serving alongside Americans in Afghanistan to this day.\n\nThe determination of ordinary Afghans to vote in last month's Presidential election, for which the votes are still being counted, is clearly a positive sign. Yet the job in Afghanistan has been left undone, despite fervent promises at the outset that the chaos that was allowed to develop after the defeat of the Soviet occupation in the nineteen-eighties would not be repeated. The Taliban has regrouped in eastern and southern regions. Bin Laden's organization continues to enjoy sanctuary and support from Afghans as well as Pakistanis on both sides of their common border. Warlords control much of Afghanistan outside the capital of Kabul, which is the extent of the territorial writ of the decent but beleaguered President Hamid Karzai. Opium production has increased fortyfold.\n\nThe White House's real priorities were elsewhere from the start. According to the former counter-terrorism adviser Richard Clarke, in a Situation Room crisis meeting on September 12, 2001, Donald Rumsfeld suggested launching retaliatory strikes against Iraq. When Clarke and others pointed out to him that Al Qaeda-the presumed culprit-was based in Afghanistan, not Iraq, Rumsfeld is said to have remarked that there were better targets in Iraq. The bottom line, as Bush's former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill has said, was that the Bush-Cheney team had been planning to carry out regime change in Baghdad well before September 11th-one way or another, come what may.\n\nAt all three debates, President Bush defended the Iraq war by saying that without it Saddam Hussein would still be in power. This is probably true, and Saddam's record of colossal cruelty--of murder, oppression, and regional aggression--was such that even those who doubted the war's wisdom acknowledged his fall as an occasion for satisfaction. But the removal of Saddam has not been the war's only consequence; and, as we now know, his power, however fearsome to the millions directly under its sway, was far less of a threat to the United States and the rest of the world than it pretended-and, more important, was made out-to be.\n\nAs a variety of memoirs and journalistic accounts have made plain, Bush seldom entertains contrary opinion. He boasts that he listens to no outside advisers, and inside advisers who dare to express unwelcome views are met with anger or disdain. He lives and works within a self-created bubble of faith-based affirmation. Nowhere has his solipsism been more damaging than in the case of Iraq. The arguments and warnings of analysts in the State Department, in the Central Intelligence Agency, in the uniformed military services, and in the chanceries of sympathetic foreign governments had no more effect than the chants of millions of marchers.\n\nThe decision to invade and occupy Iraq was made on the basis of four assumptions: first, that Saddam's regime was on the verge of acquiring nuclear explosives and had already amassed stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons; second, that the regime had meaningful links with Al Qaeda and (as was repeatedly suggested by the Vice-President and others) might have had something to do with 9/11; third, that within Iraq the regime's fall would be followed by prolonged celebration and rapid and peaceful democratization; and, fourth, that a similar democratic transformation would be precipitated elsewhere in the region, accompanied by a new eagerness among Arab governments and publics to make peace between Israel and a presumptive Palestinian state. The first two of these assumptions have been shown to be entirely baseless. As for the second two, if the wishes behind them do someday come true, it may not be clear that the invasion of Iraq was a help rather than a hindrance.\n\nIn Bush's rhetoric, the Iraq war began on March 20, 2003, with precision bombings of government buildings in Baghdad, and ended exactly three weeks later, with the iconic statue pulldown. That military operation was indeed a success. But the cakewalk led over a cliff, to a succession of heedless and disastrous mistakes that leave one wondering, at the very least, how the Pentagon's civilian leadership remains intact and the President's sense of infallibility undisturbed. The failure, against the advice of such leaders as General Eric Shinseki, then the Army chief of staff, to deploy an adequate protective force led to unchallenged looting of government buildings, hospitals, museums, and-most inexcusable of all-arms depots. (\"Stuff happens,\" Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld explained, though no stuff happened to the oil ministry.) The Pentagon all but ignored the State Department's postwar plans, compiled by its Future of Iraq project, which warned not only of looting but also of the potential for insurgencies and the folly of relying on exiles such as Ahmad Chalabi; the project's head, Thomas Warrick, was sidelined. The White House counsel's disparagement of the Geneva Conventions and of prohibitions on torture as \"quaint\" opened the way to systematic and spectacular abuses at Abu Ghraib and other American-run prisons--a moral and political catastrophe for which, in a pattern characteristic of the Administration's management style, no one in a policymaking position has been held accountable. And, no matter how Bush may cleave to his arguments about a grand coalition (\"What's he say to Tony Blair?\" \"He forgot Poland!\"), the coalition he assembled was anything but grand, and it has been steadily melting away in Iraq's cauldron of violence.\n\nBy the end of the current fiscal year, the financial cost of this war will be two hundred billion dollars (the figure projected by Lawrence Lindsey, who headed the President's Council of Economic Advisers until, like numerous other bearers of unpalatable news, he was cashiered) and rising. And there are other, more serious costs that were unforeseen by the dominant factions in the Administration (although there were plenty of people who did foresee them). The United States has become mired in a low-intensity guerrilla war that has taken more lives since the mission was declared to be accomplished than before. American military deaths have mounted to more than a thousand, a number that underplays the real level of suffering: among the eight thousand wounded are many who have been left seriously maimed. The toll of Iraqi dead and wounded is of an order of magnitude greater than the American. Al Qaeda, previously an insignificant presence in Iraq, is an important one now. Before this war, we had persuaded ourselves and the world that our military might was effectively infinite. Now it is overstretched, a reality obvious to all. And, if the exposure of American weakness encourages our enemies, surely the blame lies with those who created the reality, not with those who, like Senator Kerry, acknowledge it as a necessary step toward changing it.\n\nWhen the Administration's geopolitical, national-interest, and anti-terrorism justifications for the Iraq war collapsed, it groped for an argument from altruism: postwar chaos, violence, unemployment, and brownouts notwithstanding, the war has purchased freedoms for the people of Iraq which they could not have had without Saddam's fall. That is true. But a sad and ironic consequence of this war is that its fumbling prosecution has undermined its only even arguably meritorious rationale-and, as a further consequence, the salience of idealism in American foreign policy has been likewise undermined. Foreign-policy idealism has taken many forms-Wilson's aborted world federalism, Carter's human-rights jawboning, and Reagan's flirtation with total nuclear disarmament, among others. The failed armed intervention in Somalia and the successful ones in the Balkans are other examples. The neoconservative version ascendant in the Bush Administration, post-9/11, draws partly on these strains. There is surely idealistic purpose in envisioning a Middle East finally relieved of its autocracies and dictatorships. Yet this Administration's adventure in Iraq is so gravely flawed and its credibility so badly damaged that in the future, faced with yet another moral dilemma abroad, it can be expected to retreat, a victim of its own Iraq Syndrome.\n\nThe damage visited upon America, and upon America's standing in the world, by the Bush Administration's reckless mishandling of the public trust will not easily be undone. And for many voters the desire to see the damage arrested is reason enough to vote for John Kerry. But the challenger has more to offer than the fact that he is not George W. Bush. In every crucial area of concern to Americans (the economy, health care, the environment, Social Security, the judiciary, national security, foreign policy, the war in Iraq, the fight against terrorism), Kerry offers a clear, corrective alternative to Bush's curious blend of smugness, radicalism, and demagoguery. Pollsters like to ask voters which candidate they'd most like to have a beer with, and on that metric Bush always wins. We prefer to ask which candidate is better suited to the governance of our nation.\n\nThroughout his long career in public service, John Kerry has demonstrated steadiness and sturdiness of character. The physical courage he showed in combat in Vietnam was matched by moral courage when he raised his voice against the war, a choice that has carried political costs from his first run for Congress, lost in 1972 to a campaign of character assassination from a local newspaper that could not forgive his antiwar stand, right through this year's Swift Boat ads. As a senator, Kerry helped expose the mischief of the Bank of Commerce and Credit International, a money-laundering operation that favored terrorists and criminal cartels; when his investigation forced him to confront corruption among fellow-Democrats, he rejected the cronyism of colleagues and brought down power brokers of his own party with the same dedication that he showed in going after Oliver North in the Iran-Contra scandal. His leadership, with John McCain, of the bipartisan effort to put to rest the toxic debate over Vietnam-era P.O.W.s and M.I.A.s and to lay the diplomatic groundwork for Washington's normalization of relations with Hanoi, in the mid-nineties, was the signal accomplishment of his twenty years on Capitol Hill, and it is emblematic of his fairness of mind and independence of spirit. Kerry has made mistakes (most notably, in hindsight at least, his initial opposition to the Gulf War in 1990), but-in contrast to the President, who touts his imperviousness to changing realities as a virtue-he has learned from them.\n\nKerry's performance on the stump has been uneven, and his public groping for a firm explanation of his position on Iraq was discouraging to behold. He can be cautious to a fault, overeager to acknowledge every angle of an issue; and his reluctance to expose the Administration's appalling record bluntly and relentlessly until very late in the race was a missed opportunity. But when his foes sought to destroy him rather than to debate him they found no scandals and no evidence of bad faith in his past. In the face of infuriating and scurrilous calumnies, he kept the sort of cool that the thin-skinned and painfully insecure incumbent cannot even feign during the unprogrammed give-and-take of an electoral debate. Kerry's mettle has been tested under fire-the fire of real bullets and the political fire that will surely not abate but, rather, intensify if he is elected-and he has shown himself to be tough, resilient, and possessed of a properly Presidential dose of dignified authority. While Bush has pandered relentlessly to the narrowest urges of his base, Kerry has sought to appeal broadly to the American center. In a time of primitive partisanship, he has exhibited a fundamentally undogmatic temperament. In campaigning for America's mainstream restoration, Kerry has insisted that this election ought to be decided on the urgent issues of our moment, the issues that will define American life for the coming half century. That insistence is a measure of his character. He is plainly the better choice. As observers, reporters, and commentators we will hold him to the highest standards of honesty and performance. For now, as citizens, we hope for his victory.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Being Transgender Is a Condition, Not an Choice\n\nThis post is part of Outward , Slate's home for coverage of LGBTQ life, thought, and culture. Read more here .\n\nRoger Severino, the director of the Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Civil Rights and the apparent architect of the trans-erasing draft memo revealed by the New York Times on Sunday, once called the Obama-era protections he'd like to reverse the result of \" radical gender ideology .\" Embedded in this phrase is an idea-a pernicious one ﻿ -that trans people are an intellectual exercise, an argument from queer theory made flesh. To put it bluntly, that becoming trans amounts to an aesthetic choice. Worryingly, I think more people than Severino, even LGBTQ-supportive ones, believe this, or at least sort of wonder about it.\n\nIn light of that, as my right to exist is under attack, I feel the need to say: I never wanted to be transgender.\n\nGender dysphoria-the clinical term for the distress a trans person feels when forced to present as the wrong sex-was a crippling, painful fact of my life for 26 years. Having breasts and hips felt like a gross slime was covering my body and I could never get it off. When I looked in the mirror, the girl I saw seemed like a stranger. I developed an eating disorder, I was depressed, I barely left the house. If there was any way at all I could have gotten over it without transitioning, I would have done so. Please, believe me. I don't even like doctors! I'm afraid of surgery! I didn't choose to be transgender.\n\nTransition is the only known effective treatment for gender dysphoria . With a doctor's help, after months of gender affirming therapy, I started testosterone injections because I hoped to recognize my own face as really me and to walk through the world without a constant feeling that my body moved wrong. I intentionally put off coming out as trans until after I was sure testosterone was working, just in case I found out I was mistaken. But once I finally began to recognize the person I saw in the mirror, after I stopped having any nagging feeling that I wasn't real (a serious psychological condition called depersonalization) or that the world around me was colorless and two dimensional, it was unavoidable. I had to come out as transgender because I was transgender, not because I wanted to be.\n\nPeople around me, even those who were skeptical at first, have noticed I'm more present, more engaged, less anxious and self-conscious. But, there's a big downside. In order to treat my medical condition, I had to accept myself as a member of one of the most mocked, hated, feared, and misunderstood groups in America. I didn't-wouldn't-ask for that. I am so hated that the U.S. government appears to be moving to re-define sex to make it easier to discriminate against me. I am so feared that some people want to make it impossible for me to use a public restroom.\n\nI didn't ask for any of this, and if I could have avoided it I would have. If I could be cisgender-whether as a man or a cisgender woman-I would be.\n\nIn the 1990s, I remember a common form of persuasive essay in which a gay person-most often a gay man-would heartrendingly explain that he didn't choose to be gay, would never, ever in his life have chosen to be gay, then beg mainstream America not to persecute him for something that he had no control over. That sort of essay has rightly fallen out of favor in the LGBTQ community. It undermines our pride to explain, in painful detail, how desperately many of us once wished not to be who we are. It undermines our liberty, because there's no good reason to forbid people from choosing a gender, even if gender was a choice. And, it undermines our dignity to have to beg for scraps of tolerance, to perform this ritual of saying that it's better to be straight and cisgender, that we just can't help our differences.\n\nI don't enjoy writing an essay in this old-fashioned mode, but I am writing this one because I think you need to read it. With every joke about trans people's appearances, with every snide remark about someone identifying as a helicopter or an animal, with every suggestion that Democrats abandon transgender rights for the sake of mythical white working class moderates, and with every pseudoscientific article that attempts to re-re-re-open the question of whether trans identities are legitimate, it's been made clear: Cisgender Americans just don't get it. You don't get how crippling it is to experience gender dysphoria. You think being transgender is about wearing different clothing or preferring different pronouns. It's not.\n\nI don't know what the biological basis for transgender identity is, but I know there must be one, because I tried for more than a quarter century not to be trans, and nothing worked. My gender dysphoria didn't go away with years of talk therapy, from several different therapists. None of the dozens of anti-depressants and mood stabilizers I was given helped either. Trying yoga and other forms of physical activity to feel more present in my own skin backfired-I felt more trapped, and more dysphoric than ever. Transition-only transition-has given me the life I wanted, not because I'm now a man but because, living as the man I always was, I'm finally able to be a normal, healthy person.\n\nI tried to be cis and pretended I was cis for 26 years, but it didn't make me any less transgender. It did, however, make me miserable, unemployable, and prone to depression and thoughts of suicide. I would never have chosen to be trans, but in the end I had to accept the truth, and so do you. Transition is the only known effective treatment for gender dysphoria . Trans people are real. As much as some of us might wish we weren't trans or that gender dysphoria wasn't a condition at all, that's not reality. We are here, and we cannot be erased.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why Abortion Activists Need to Stop Using the Word Choice\n\nListen to What Next:\n\nAnat Shenker-Osorio is the kind of political consultant who tells Democrats what to say and how to say it. I called her up because I was wondering what Democrats should start saying about abortion. Shenker-Osorio has some mixed thoughts on what President Joe Biden has said recently. She liked to see that he was claiming the moral high ground, but she took issue with a cringey moment when Biden used the phrase \"abort a child.\" \"That's incredibly problematic language,\" Shenker-Osorio says. \"By definition, if you are seeking abortion care, then you are not talking about a child. It implies a certain level of development. It implies a certain level of relationship that already exists.\"\n\nSo: How should Joe Biden-or anyone who cares about abortion reproductive rights-talk about abortion now?\n\nOn Monday's episode of What Next , I spoke with Shenker-Osorio about how changing minds on this topic is still possible and what American activists can learn from their international peers. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nMary Harris: Recently, you tweeted out this ad campaign that caught my attention . I t sounded so different from how Americans usually talk about abortion .\n\nAnat Shenker-Osorio : It situates the abortion care conversation within the context of relationships, which is a pretty stark contrast to how abortion has generally been talked about and argued in the United States\n\nIn the U.S., we talk about abortion as an individual right.\n\nThat's right.\n\nIt's almost by definition separate from the community.\n\nSeparate from the community, separate from relationships. And it has historically been argued in a libertarian framework. U.S. out of my uterus . Get your laws off my body . My child, my choice . And what happens with that \"individual choice\" language is, in policy terms, we get the Hyde Amendment.\n\nWhich bans Medicaid from covering abortion.\n\nIt bans government funding from abortion. It doesn't force insurance providers to include it in their coverage. You can have the \"legal right to an abortion\"-it can be a codified law-but if you live in a county or a community, which many, many, many people do, in which there is no provider, so you have to travel for a day or days and then you have to come back again because of certain laws that make you go to the appointment more than once, then the right is empty, right? It's hollow without access.\n\nIt's so funny because listening to you talk, it's almost like making a woman seeking an abortion into, like, the Marlboro Man-alone on the prairie, just getting it done. But you're showing all the ways that that's problematic.\n\nI would go a step farther. I believe that it paves the way to what we have in our society today, which is essentially: Why should I pay for X public school, that park, that library, that program? You chose to have that child. It basically reduces children to the status of pets, when in fact, as we know, children are future adults. There's a reason why that choice framework lends itself so well to antisocial behavior.\n\nYou've done this deep dive into other places that have framed abortion differently-not in this kind of libertarian freedom way-and where abortion activists have found success in changing people's minds. I want to start with Ireland, which is a country that repealed an abortion ban just recently, 2018. How did abortion become illegal in Ireland in the first place?\n\nThere was a ballot initiative in the 1980s that made abortion illegal, and that was passed with overwhelming margins-around two-thirds of the voting population. Interestingly, the 2018 repeal of that ban was passed with pretty much the identical margin.\n\nIt's so interesting that voters did it both times.\n\nYes, it was direct democracy in both cases. And so in the Irish case, obviously, there are a million things that lead to victory. But their core slogan was the three C's, and those three C's were care , compassion , change -notably not the other C, choice .\n\nWhy no choice ?\n\nIf you look at the way that choice occurs in common speech, both within the United States and in Ireland, it tends to co-occur with consumer things. So vanilla or chocolate, decaf or caf. We tend to use the word choice in situations in which we're making inconsequential decisions without much deliberate thought.\n\nIt makes women look careless.\n\nIt makes women look careless. It feeds the opposition notion that women are using this as \"contraception.\" And it cannot stand up to the rhetorical weight of life.\n\nWhen you were reporting on what happened in Ireland, you played this ad that was used to talk about repealing the abortion ban there. And it was so interesting for me to listen to because of what it said and also what it didn't say. It never used the word abortion .\n\nYeah. That ad-and \"care, compassion, change\"-argues for this in a creation of good versus an amelioration of harm frame. In framing it as this is what a forward-looking country has and does, this is what a modern, caring, compassionate country does, it recognizes that you just don't know. None of us know as human beings the path that a pregnancy could take.\n\nIt also makes the listener the hero. And I realized as I listened to this ad, in the U.S., this whole caring argument that you're talking about, which seems to have been very important to what happened in Ireland-the left has kind ceded it to the anti-abortion folks . Y ou can say what you want about how they express that caring and what they say about it and who they're prioritizing , b ut they're at least dressing up what they say as caring about women and babies.\n\nAnd they are constantly providing a role for the audience. They're directing their audience to be the hero. They're directing their audience to \"save babies.\"\n\nIn contrast, for a long time, the job of the listener on the \"pro-choice\" side was to mind your own business. It was to stay out of it.\n\nAnd when you don't provide within your storyline agency for the people that you're trying to either persuade or mobilize, then what you have is an asymmetrical response. The smaller group of people for whom this needs to be illegal in all cases, no exemptions, no allowances, etc.-this is their issue. And then for the greater majority of U.S. voters, who don't harbor those beliefs, this is not their issue.\n\nIt's just life. It's just something that happens.\n\nIt's just something that happens. And their issue, understandably, is making ends meet, filling up the gas tank, being able to see the dentist, etc., etc., etc.\n\nThat seems harder to overcome. The fact that you may not know you need this right until you need it.\n\nCorrect. It's basically growing that choir by saying to people, \"Hey, this thing that you think has nothing to do with you? You're going to need this thing because your daughter is going to need it, or your neighbor is going to need it, or your cousin is going to need it, or your colleagues are going to need it. And then what's going to happen?\" This issue that you think has not been your issue, it's your issue.\n\nNotably, one of the people you interviewed in Ireland was a woman who voted to ban abortion in the 1980s. And then when this came back up in 2018, her own daughter had just had to get an abortion. And she realized, Oh man, this could happen to anyone and voted yes to pull the amendment out.\n\nI can put an even finer point on that. We see in testing that the mere switch from the mass down to the singular changes people's view. So when we ask people: \"Do you think that women should be able to have abortions?,\" we get a lesser response than \"Do you think a woman should be able to have an abortion?\"\n\nSo not even, like, your daughter or your sister? Just a woman.\n\nA woman. Because when you ask about women, it evokes that stereotyping. When you ask about a woman, you are more likely to unconsciously make the listener think about a specific person in their life.\n\nLet's talk about what happened in Argentina. Argentina had allowed abortions in the case of rape or incest, but there were still real barriers to access. And abortion was legalized in 2020. So how did this campaign differ from or learn from the campaign in Ireland in 2018?\n\nThere's so much incredible to say about the Argentina example. What I want to lift up most concretely is the interplay between different messages: one to engage the base, one to persuade the middle, and another to marginalize the opposition.\n\nSo that engage the base message was \" la revolución de las hijas \"-the revolution of our daughters-and it was the green handkerchief, which inspiringly we're seeing now in protests in Chicago and in New York.\n\nWhat is the green handkerchief?\n\nThe green handkerchief was originally a symbol that was adopted in Argentina in homage to the white handkerchief of the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo , the mothers who would walk around during the Argentinean dictatorship protesting the disappearance of their loved ones, often their children. When the reproductive rights movement began-and first began actually as a response to intimate partner violence and to the killing of women by partners-they adopted this handkerchief, but instead of making it white, they made it green. And they wrote on it a very particular three phrase slogan, which you can see over and over again in Spanish. And essentially it translates to a call for sex education so that we have knowledge over our bodies, contraception so that we don't need to have abortions, and abortions so that we don't die.\n\nThey understood, because they had done their research, that the people most likely to need to be persuaded didn't live in Buenos Aires. They lived in the provinces. And so what they did is they used as their messengers medical providers from the provinces. And the message that they utilized was \" salvemos miles de vidas \"- we will save thousands of lives. That was deployed by making short social media digital ads of these medical care providers.\n\nThe providers spoke in really, really, really short clips about cases that they had had-obviously anonymized-where they had had to treat somebody who had attempted to induce abortion themselves and they would have to deal with the fallout. And by making this change, actually, what we will be doing is saving lives.\n\nIf you are going to tell American activists to do something similar that called back to previous movements , what's the American version of the green handkerchief?\n\nI think it's the green handkerchief.\n\nHuh.\n\nIt calls back to this idea that there is a shared global struggle for the recognition of the equal rights and the full humanity of people who can get pregnant. This isn't a U.S.-specific issue. This is a broader issue. Not that I would use this language in messaging, but it's a broader issue of patriarchy. It's a broader issue of attempting to hold a certain class of people subservient and under the thumb and in control of other people.\n\nIt's also, really importantly, a thing that you wear. When you don't just believe a thing, but you actually wear it on your body, what you're doing is you're making an identity symbol to other people. And then other people are like, Oh, that's what a my kind of a person thinks. That's what a my kind of a person wears. And so what a green handkerchief or a red hat or any other kind of visual symbology that you actually wear on your body transmits is a continuous message that this is the dominant cultural idea.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Is Polyamory a Choice?\n\nJupiterimages\n\nWhen my last essay appeared in Slate , a number of people were offended that I compared polyamory and homosexuality. The commenters' chief objection seemed to be that homosexuality is innate, like race, and therefore \"more worthy\" of civil rights, while polyamory is a choice.\n\nEven a cursory examination of the facts will blur any claim of a black-and-white, binary distinction. Sexual orientation-how sexual desire and emotional connection are informed by the physical sex and gender performance of a potential partner-is informed by both nurture and nature. Otherwise you couldn't possibly get the vast differences that are observed across cultures and eras . There's good reason to believe that it's partly genetic and perhaps partly developmental as well, but at the margin, there are surely some people for whom same-sex intimacy is a choice.\n\nMeanwhile, there are some people whose innate personality traits make it very difficult to live happily in a monogamous relationship but relatively easy to be happy in an open one. Given the persecution heaped on gays in most of the world in recent generations, and the relative difficulty of \"passing,\" there are probably few people who would choose that identity unless they could not find happiness in straight life. So, sure, there may be a larger fraction of non-monogamists for whom their unconventional relationship is \"optional\" or \"a choice.\" But there are almost certainly also some \"obligate\" non-monogamists who would never feel emotionally satisfied and healthy in a monogamous relationship, any more than a gay man would be satisfied and healthy in a straight marriage.\n\nFor many polyamorists, the idea of a partner telling them that they can never, under any circumstance, embrace their feelings for a new partner feels terrifying and stifling. If you're a monogamist, the idea of your partner wanting somebody else may make you ask, \"Why am I not enough for you?\" But if you are innately poly, the idea of a primary partner trying to cut you off from even the possibility of new love fills you with a parallel anguish: \"I promise I'll never spend so much time and energy elsewhere that it takes away anything I promised to you, any more than I'd let work or hobbies take me away from you. You'll get everything from me that you always have. Why isn't my adoration and devotion enough for you?\"\n\nI have little experience with non-monogamists who are purely interested in outside sex without wanting emotional involvement. I would guess that among swingers, there's a larger fraction for whom it's \"optional\"-essentially a hobby. However, I also expect that if you asked enough of them, you'd find some who would tell you that they can't imagine feeling fulfilled any other way; that in order to be satisfied with their primary relationship, they need to experience others' desire for their partner. Is that unusual, or even rare? Sure. But as long as everyone's having fun and nobody's getting hurt, why should that matter? The left-handed are also a small minority. That doesn't mean we need to tag them as abnormal or aberrant . (Or sinister. )\n\nI'm hopeful that the psychological and sociological studies of non-monogamists that are beginning to emerge will eventually address these issues clearly. My experience suggests that perhaps half to two-thirds of polyamorists-those who want to be able to fully embrace multiple loving relationships, with sex as merely part of that (albeit an important part, just as it is in monogamous relationships)-are \"obligate poly.\" I've heard a lot of stories from people about having a few miserable monogamous relationships before they were introduced to the concept of honest, consensual non-monogamy. I doubt there are many gay folks, anymore, who get to age 20 or 25 without learning that the kind of relationship they yearn for is actually possible. That kind of experience was common when I first joined the poly community in the '90s. Media exposure is gradually ending that problem, just as it did for gays. I suppose it may also lead to an increase in the number of \"optional poly\" folks joining the community, just as increasing acceptance of same-sex relationships has probably encouraged more bi people to try a same-sex relationship.\n\nStill, as much as I enjoy omphaloskeptical explorations of the origins of my tribe, when it comes to the more important question of social acceptance, this entire conversation is a red herring. The \"born this way\" argument has been politically useful, but the moral argument for acceptance of gay relationships doesn't require it. Nobody ever claimed that Mildred and Richard Loving were born with some kind of overwhelming predisposition to prefer partners of another race and that they thus couldn't marry somebody of their own race. Choosing an interracial partner was, and is, a choice. So what? The correct response to the nature vs. nurture question is: There's no way to know for sure, and it doesn't matter. What matters is that people love each other, treat each other with respect, and live happy, productive lives.\n\nA monogamous bisexual has the \"choice\" to simply settle down with an opposite-sex partner, without ever trying intimacy with a same-sex partner. You could even argue that a \"truly\" monogamous straight person would \"choose\" to settle down with their very first partner. But very few of us would seriously recommend that. The statistics say that those who marry young divorce far more frequently. Those who take the time to experiment and figure out what they really want from a relationship when they finally do marry, stay married and are better able to invest in their children.\n\nSpeaking of children, recall that the evidence to date on gay families shows that their children grow up just as well-adjusted as those from comparable straight families (similar income, similar ages at marriage and childbirth, etc.). To the extent that they experience problems, it seems likely that these are caused by stigmatization and persecution, not by anything \"wrong\" with their parents. In any case, you never see anyone say that just because a straight couple has the deck stacked against them when it comes to raising their children-if, for instance, they're young and poor-that this is a good reason to stigmatize and persecute them or to prohibit them from marrying. I know a few adults who grew up with poly parents, and dozens of polyamorists who have children ranging from newborn to college age. As far as I can tell, we're no more likely to have relationship problems or mental-health issues than the general population-though I'd love to see more serious academic studies on the subject.\n\nNobody who builds a life in which they feel happy and fulfilled should have to fear having their relationships \"discovered.\" It is tragic, and morally offensive, that there are still places in the world, even in this country, where gay people face consequences like loss of custody of their children, loss of employment, rejection from family, or even violent attack, all simply for loving who they love. The same logic applies, with equal force, to polyamorists. In this sense, the slippery slope argument-that if we have to \"tolerate\" gay relationships, soon we'll have to \"tolerate\" poly relationships-is correct.\n\nIf you are concerned about the complexities that legalizing plural marriage would introduce into family courts and estate law, I should note that I agree that the argument for destigmatizing poly relationships doesn't necessarily map cleanly to an argument for poly marriage . I have friends who are in favor, but I'm skeptical that it can be addressed with the kind of simple, sweeping action that makes sense for gay marriage. For legal and financial purposes, individuals of different genders are interchangeable in a way that a pair of people simply is not. A pair of people may disagree with each other, and they obviously have separate property, and separate income and expense streams. I'd favor, instead, an incremental approach, aiming to serve the needs of all unconventional families. For instance, a pair of widowed sisters with children who move in together and function as a household should be able to file joint taxes, while not necessarily treating each other as spouses for other purposes. In an ideal world, I'd envision a process of separating out the rights and privileges of marriage, letting people assign them in more complex ways. So those widows could, without hiring an expensive contract lawyer and risking having things challenged in court by hostile family members, spell out their preferences about passage of custody, who should be their estate executor, who should have medical power of attorney, and so on. You'd still have the current version of marriage as an option-call it the Civil Union EZ, if you like Michael Kinsley's old argument against government control of marriage-but we'd also offer a stack of a dozen or so other forms that would recognize legal arrangements for people with less common family structures.\n\nI have no interest in playing Oppression Olympics. I chose to write about polyamory because I believe my experience and perspective may help broaden some readers' horizons. I believe there are valid comparisons to be found in the history of attitudes towards gay and interracial relationships, and I hope these analogies will help people understand that people like me are not some kind of threat to the moral fiber of the country. I also acknowledge that all comparisons are imperfect. It seems clear that gays face a far higher probability than polyamorists of getting hurt or killed, both because it's harder for them to pass, and because the oppression directed against them more frequently includes violence. I've been in a situation where I was afraid I was about to get gay-bashed. I was at a sci-fi convention, wearing a somewhat androgynous-to-feminine outfit, and stepped away from the con to visit a friend's place for a while. Walking back to the con hotel, I was followed down a mostly deserted street for several blocks, at about 11 p.m., by four large drunken men who were upset that the local football team had just lost a game and decided to work out their frustrations by loudly expressing their offense at my existence and making threats that, luckily for me, they did not follow through on. I have nothing but sympathy for the perils faced by my gay peers.\n\nBut it's possible to care about more than one injustice at a time. I'm concerned about attacks against gays in Russia; racially biased law enforcement policies in New York and other large cities; the misogyny displayed by influential media figures and politicians and embedded in attacks on the right to choose or even to access contraception; and all of the inter-racial, inter-tribal, and inter-sectarian violence around the world. If you believe in social justice, you should seek it universally, not narrowly for your own personal benefit. We are all human first. Everything else-nationality, sex, race, orientation-is secondary, and irrelevant to our fundamental rights. As Brian D. Earp recently argued in \"Future Tense,\" even if homosexuality becomes a choice , mutable under pharmacological \"treatment,\" it should still be regarded as part of the normal range of human behavior. We should agree on the principle that anyone pursuing consensual, loving, respectful relationships, forming happy families, and participating productively in society should be welcomed, not ostracized in the name of irrational, ossified stigma.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "School Choice Was the Main Policy Mentioned at Monday's RNC. Why?\n\nThe first night of the Republican National Convention was extremely light on policy talk. The party put together no platform this year, opting instead to draft a simple resolution declaring its intent to support whatever Donald Trump decides he wants to do. So, instead of mounting an argument in favor of a sweeping policy agenda on Monday night, the convention's cast members spent most of their time painting Trump as an empathetic leader who loves Black people-but will also keep Black people from moving to the suburbs where you, white voters, live.\n\nOne of the few exceptions was the topic of school choice, which was raised by almost every speaker on Monday's docket. California public school teacher Rebecca Friedrichs, who has been fighting for years to prevent teachers unions from compelling members who oppose their union's politics to pay union dues, appeared at the beginning of the evening. In her speech, Friedrichs accused teachers unions of \"trapping so many precious, low-income children in dangerous, corrupt, and low-performing schools\" by opposing policies that divert money from public schools to charter, private, and parochial schools. Friedrichs praised Trump for \"empower[ing] kids to escape dangerous, low-performing schools\" with a proposed tax credit program that would encourage funding for private and home-school education.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nTrump himself showed up to promise he would \"rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\" Kim Klacik, a congressional candidate from Maryland, said Democrats have \"neglected\" Black voters, who \"want school choice.\" Two other Black Republicans, Georgia state Rep. Vernon Jones and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, suggested that their party's school choice policies could provide a counterweight to the racism and poverty that close off opportunities for children of color. Donald Trump Jr. agreed. \"It is unacceptable that too many African American and Hispanic American children are stuck in bad schools, just because of their ZIP code,\" he said in his Monday night speech. \"Donald Trump will not stand for it. If Democrats really wanted to help minorities in underserved communities, instead of bowing to big money union bosses, they'd let parents choose what school is best for their kids.\" On Tuesday morning, Trump Jr. followed up his speech with an op-ed on Fox News' website , titled \"President Trump defends school choice from attacks by Democrats and teachers' unions.\"\n\nSchool choice wasn't a major winning issue for Trump during his last campaign, and it hasn't been a significant focus of his first term. Education isn't a determinative issue for the vast majority of presidential voters. So what's with this sudden emphasis on school choice?\n\nThe first reason is that party conventions-and, sometimes, entire campaigns-are designed to energize a candidate's base. School choice is the top issue for a relatively small population of voters, but that population is a passionate one, and one that has found a stalwart ally in Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. At the same time, Democrats are far from united on the issue. It might be one of the few places where Trump stands to soften some swing voters' perceptions of him.\n\nSchool choice has also become a resonant topic in the culture wars Trump relies on to animate his base. The second pillar of Trump's two-prong education plan, in addition to the tax credit proposal, is \" teach American exceptionalism .\" Conservative parents fret about the secular indoctrination of public schools; liberals are incensed by voucher programs that enrich parochial schools where LGBTQ students are mistreated or banned. The GOP loves to promote the myth of anti-Christian bias in the U.S., couching a variety of anti-choice and anti-LGBTQ bills in the language of \"religious freedom.\" The party promotes its efforts to send taxpayer money to religious schools the same way. School choice sits at the nexus of many of the topics-Christian persecution, transgender kids in sports-Trump and his allies like to talk about most.\n\nIn some places, there are also visible racial divides on the issue of school choice. In Florida, the biggest swing state in the country, where several Black Democratic legislators support tax credit scholarship programs like Trump's, some analysts have credited Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' position on the issue with his ability to win 18 percent of Black women's votes in 2018. (Just 8 percent of Black men voted for DeSantis.) Along with the criminal justice reform bill he trumpeted in his Super Bowl commercial , Trump has made school choice part of his attempt to convince Black voters that he has their best interests at heart: During his State of the Union address in February, he used the story of Black middle schooler Janiyah Davis , the recipient of a school voucher funded by DeVos, to sell his tax credit proposal. Never mind that Trump's proposed federal policy and the tax credit and voucher programs he supports are decimating funding for public schools around the country, which plenty of kids still attend.\n\nOne interesting factor is that they're talking about all of this right now, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. Parents around the country are struggling with the competing demands of work, child care, their children's education, and ensuring their family's safety during a public health crisis. Some families who would have never dreamed of home-schooling their children are now considering that doing so may be the least bad of several bad options in this previously unimaginable bind. Without any solid federal guidance or relief plan for school reopenings, virtual learning, or any other aspect of pandemic survival and recovery, parents have been set adrift , forced to cobble together an education plan on their own. The concept of school choice, so frequently framed as a path toward a better school, might sound pretty good right now. That assumes frazzled parents might not think too hard about what it really means-leaving public schools, and everyone who relies on them, behind.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Women the Pro-Choice Movement Left Behind\n\nSubscribe to What Next on Apple Podcasts for the full episode.\n\nAs we watch the Senate rush to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court this week, many people are worried about what her seating on the court will mean for Roe v. Wade and the right to abortion. But reproductive justice activist Laurie Bertram Roberts says we should have already been worried, like, 20 years ago. \"I'm serious. We should have been worrying in the '90s,\" Roberts told me on Monday's episode of What Next .\n\nLaurie Bertram Roberts wasn't always on this side of the issue. She was raised fundamentalist, but after suffering a miscarriage and later needing an abortion herself (one she was unable to obtain), she became a champion for reproductive rights. She's spent much of her life straddling the poverty line as a working mother. Roberts now splits her time between Mississippi and Alabama, where she's running two separate reproductive freedom funds-organizations that offer no-strings-attached cash to women who need help getting an abortion, diapers for their kids, or contraception. I spoke to her about what the pro-choice movement misses and how to avoid complacency in the fight to come. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nMary Harris: How did your views on abortion begin to evolve?\n\nLaurie Bertram Roberts: I needed an abortion. So let me rewind. First, the thing that happened was I had a miscarriage at our biggest hospital in the area, which was a Catholic hospital in Indiana called St. Anthony's. When I went in there the first time, I just had some light-pink discharge and they said, Well, you're not bleeding yet. If you start bleeding, come back and we'll do an ultrasound. But right now, you're not miscarrying. Go home. And I didn't have insurance, so I wasn't really keen on going to the E.R. a bunch of times. But within a few hours, I was bleeding pretty heavily. So I came back and they did an ultrasound and they found a heartbeat, but it was a weak heartbeat. And they said, Well, you're miscarrying. There's nothing we can do for you because there's a heartbeat. Go home.\n\nBecause it's a Catholic hospital. And they weren't allowed to do an abortion.\n\nA D and C [dilation and curettage]. Yup. Because that's an abortion. And I didn't fully understand that at the time. But I do remember my husband saying to me, \"They won't help you because they're Catholic.\" And I didn't fully understand what he was saying at the time. And I went home and within a few hours I was hemorrhaging and I didn't want to go back because I didn't think they were going to help me. And I ended up almost bleeding to death.\n\nWas that the beginning of you thinking differently about abortion?\n\nOh, yes, because I realized that they literally let me almost die over their beliefs about abortion. So time goes forward and my ex and I break up and we're separated. I got pregnant shortly after we got separated. We had just had a baby. My daughter Sarah. She's amazing. And I found myself pregnant, and my doctor had already told me, Don't have another baby, at least for two years, or it could kill you because I had complications with all my pregnancies. And I really had decided I was going to have an abortion. I went for my first appointment. I had made the appointment for the procedure.\n\nThat must have felt like a big step for you.\n\nIt was. I did a lot of praying and crying. I mean, a lot.\n\nBut in the end, you didn't end up getting an abortion because you didn't have the money for it.\n\nI was a turn-away patient. I remember crying at the clinic going, \"Don't you guys have any help for people who don't have enough money?\" And they didn't. There wasn't anyone to help me.\n\nYou were 18 years old, trying to start college. You were recently separated. You had three kids at home. You were about to have your fourth, even though your doctor had said it was unadvisable.\n\nSo more praying, more crying. I love my child. They know this story. They understand. But I kept this story to myself for years because I felt so guilty. How dare I not want my child? What does that say about me? But I know I'm not the only person with this story. Turn-away patients happen all the time. And the trauma that it causes for you, right? My family and I ended up homeless that next year. Babies cost money. C-sections mean you gotta stop working. I stopped going to school.\n\nThat's such a visceral experience. It feels so divorced from the way we talk about abortion on the Supreme Court or in Washington.\n\nWhen we talk about abortion, we always talk about people who get their abortions. We don't really talk about what happens when people don't get their abortions because people aren't willing to tell those stories, because like me, they feel like if they tell that story, it means that they didn't love their kid. But that's not true.\n\nYou eventually moved down South and started working with the local chapter of the National Organization for Women, starting as a secretary and eventually becoming president of the Mississippi chapter. You would go to national board meetings and meet with fellow activists from all over the country. What was that like?\n\nWe would meet up and we'd have these long three-day meetings. Very few of us are women of color. But I spent a lot of time going, \"Excuse me. Well, that's not really true for women in Mississippi.\" \"Well, excuse me. That's not really true for rural women.\" \"Excuse me. Well, that's not true for people who are low income.\" That was pretty much what I did at every meeting, was just remind them that there were people other than them in the world.\n\nSo it was very coastal and very white.\n\nYeah, it was a lot of older white women who were of a certain income bracket who had big blind spots when it came to race and class.\n\nThere's been so much hand-wringing about how the pro-choice movement reached this place where we are one Supreme Court appointment away from Roe v. Wade falling. I wonder if you look back at your time on the board of an organization like NOW, and you see the problems? You see that the folks who are doing the sort of Washington strategic work weren't necessarily talking to folks like you.\n\nIt wasn't that they weren't talking to people like me. It's that they weren't listening. People like me were at the tables and have been at the tables for years. And then people like me walk away from the tables because people aren't listening. And honestly, it goes back even before this. This goes all the way back to women's suffrage and white women co-opting feminism. They set what the agenda is.\n\nWhat were they leaving out?\n\nThey were leaving out, like, Medicaid expansion. Medicaid expansion is a major thing in states that don't have it. It impacts maternal health. It impacts senior health. It impacts general health of the community.\n\nDo you want to just explain what exactly an abortion fund like yours does?\n\nSo you call us or you text us, because sometimes we do stuff by text, especially for domestic violence victims. For example, we had a domestic violence victim where it took us three weeks to get her set up because she could only text on the sly when her abuser wasn't paying attention.\n\nSo when someone calls us, we find out how far along they are and if we can assist them. Are you from Mississippi? Where do you live? What exactly do you need? How much money do you need toward your procedure? Do you need travel money? If they're really early, sometimes we'll see if they have a couple pay periods that they can wait, that they can put together some more money. So we're really strategizing with them on all of these things. We book their hotel. We make sure to pay for their incidentals online already so they don't have to put up a credit card. Sometimes we're booking Ubers for people. Sometimes we're picking people up. Lately, because of COVID, we're not picking people up. Sometimes we're flying out of state with people. Sometimes we're doing long-distance abortion doula services. We're in constant contact with them. Someone is on call for them 24 hours a day from the time that they leave the state till the time they come home; there's someone specifically assigned to them to be on call.\n\nIn every profile I've read of you, there's this moment where the reporter talks about the breadth of the work that you do. We're talking about funding abortions, but that's not all of the work that you do. After an abortion, you'll take a woman to Red Lobster to have something to eat, or you'll get a stroller for the woman down the street who's worried that child protective services is going to come do an inspection of her house, or you have a diaper bank for people who need that kind of help. Do you think a lot about why it is that supporting parents is seen as so divorced from everything else about sex, like abortion?\n\nI think about it a lot, and I think about how absurd it is. I don't think they're separate issues. I think it's all connected, especially considering most of the people who call us are already parents. So I don't think you can talk about abortion without talking about parenting, especially since parenting is one of the options that they have.\n\nA lot of people who are pro-choice think that if we talk about parenting in the same context as abortion, then somehow we're ceding some kind of ground to the anti-choicers. I don't feel that way. I don't want anyone to ever have an abortion they don't want. I don't want anyone to have to parent if they don't want to. And I don't want anyone to ever go into an adoption that they'll regret. So when we talk about people having all of their options on the table, we want all of those options to be without stigma and without coercion. And I don't feel like there are unequal options. Even people who say they're on our side somehow still think of parenting as the good option and abortion as this other option-and that they're divorced from each other. But a lot of our parents are coming to have an abortion because they're good parents, because they see having another child as something that's not going to be beneficial to their family.\n\nDo you think about the day after Roe ends and what happens then?\n\nOnly for the last eight years.\n\nI guess we should be pretty clear about the implications. My understanding is that in Mississippi, where you were, there's a trigger law.\n\nIn Alabama too.\n\nSo if Roe is overturned, that means full stop on abortion right away.\n\nYep. And one of the reasons it's important to own a clinic [like the one my fund, the Yellowhammer Fund, bought in Alabama earlier this year] is to expand the services so that if a trigger ban happens, they can still be open and sustained, doing full reproductive care: contraception, OB-GYN, trans health care.\n\nBuying a clinic is a hedge in some ways-making a commitment that this will not be shut down.\n\nThat's our hope. We've been thinking about: How do we address these things? How do we talk about self-managed abortion in responsible ways? How do we start working on making sure people aren't going to be criminalized if they're engaging in self-managed abortion?\n\nYou've said that people should consider hoarding misoprostol.\n\nYeah, I wasn't joking.\n\nYou said people need to prepare for a future outside of clinics, too?\n\nI'm talking about midwifery-centered care, a midwifery-centered model that is more inclusive of people who cannot easily come to clinics. People like me who have severe fibromyalgia and can't always make it to a clinic. People in the undocumented community who are not always safe coming to clinics due to stuff like roadblocks or lack of accessibility to a driver's license. And I'm not even talking about abortion care per se. I'm hoping that we get to a place where telemed for abortion care is accessible to people, and to get to that place on the state levels, we're going to need to shift statehouses and governorships. And that's going to take a minute. But in the meantime, we need to be talking about: What does autonomous pelvic health care look like in a community setting? What does teaching people about birth control look like in the community setting so that they're prepared to go to their doctor and they don't settle for being offered three options when there's really a plethora of options, which is happening to poor women every day?\n\nListening to you talk about women-centered care and midwifery, it almost sounds like going back in time, because my understanding is that in the 1800s, many women manage their pregnancies with midwives and midwives were doing abortions. And 100-plus years later, we are where we are.\n\nAnd there's actually no medical reason why midwives can't perform abortions, if we're being honest. Midwives already do miscarriage management. So there is no reason why a midwife could not handle a first-term abortion. The only reason that access is cut off and why primary care doctors are not handling medical abortions in office is because of laws on the books, like if you provide more than 10 abortions a year, you're an abortion clinic. We have allowed abortion to be sectioned off away from the rest of health care. We've made it this stigmatized, sectioned-off, ostracized part of health care.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Good Riddance, \"Pro-Choice\"\n\nPhoto by David McNew/Getty Images.\n\nNews that Planned Parenthood is planning to abandon the old familiar serviceable term \"pro-choice\" has ruffled feathers and awakened a certain amount of predictable feminist grumbling , including some by Slate 's own Amanda Marcotte, who argues that the term was useful.\n\nHowever, this decisive public shift in rhetoric has been a long time coming. Many critics have complained about the inadequacy of feminist language surrounding the issue of abortion. Nearly 20 years ago, Naomi Wolf wrote a bold and thought-provoking piece in the New Republic claiming that the movement's rhetoric and attitude toward abortion did not take into account the emotional and moral complexities of real abortions.\n\nAs someone unwavering in my support of women's right to legal abortion I think it is clear that, from the beginning, the war of words was lost: The term \"pro-choice\" is far less charismatic, less uplifting, less capacious than the term \"pro-life.\" Who does not want to be arguing in favor of life ? (It is interesting to note that polls have found that significant numbers of people identifying as pro-life are in fact in favor of legal abortions; such is the irrational magnetism of the term.) \"Choice\" sounds, in comparison, cool, flippant, casual, bourgeois. \"Choice\" belongs to realms like whether to have a tuna sandwich or a Caesar salad for lunch; it does not naturally evoke the gravity of the awe-inspiring issues at stake.\n\nBut how should the movement better express the crucial and complicated idea of a woman's right to control her own body? I think \"pro-freedom\" would be better, closer to what we mean, though still not as transcendent a term as \"pro-life.\" (It would be excellent if Planned Parenthood somehow had the power to obliterate the term \"pro-life\" as well.) \"Freedom\" is at least a more expansive word than \"choice,\" with glimmers of promise, of possibility, of amber waves of grain; it has a patriotic undertone that might appeal to those confused people who do believe in at least a limited right to abortion but won't call themselves \"pro-choice,\" because \"choice\" seems to belong to a pampered elite.\n\nBut behind this question of words lies the more arduous question of concepts and philosophy. The idea that \"life begins at birth\" is also outdated, too easy. It is useful politically, but as many have pointed out, in the age of sonograms, of cloudy little hands and feet coming into focus at nine weeks, how many people actually believe it?\n\nOur language betrays our desire. A cluster of cells that is wanted is a \"baby,\" and one that is unwanted is a \"fetus.\" One never hears excited parents-to-be referring to the \"fetus\"; the leap of imagination from fetus to baby is so ordinary, so automatic, so universal that we cannot pretend, even in the realm of political expediency, that it is not so. We can't try to argue that some clusters of cells are not \"life\" if we are, say, busy calling our own cluster of cells a baby.\n\nWolf argued persuasively in her long-ago piece that the dismissal of abortion as no big deal among certain ideologically efficient feminists was not serving the movement well, and not admitting that there is \"life\" involved discredits the entire movement. How can anyone believe us if we do not believe ourselves? Surely one of the reasons the anti-choice movement (god, now what will we call it?) has gained such traction is that there were lacunae, weaknesses, holes in the absoluteness, the moral cleanness of the abortion rights position. (That there are also holes in the other side's absoluteness does not make this any less true.)\n\nIt's easy to see why the early crusaders for these rights would feel the need for certainty, for admitting no complexity, for brooking no sentimentality or mysticism, but the acknowledgement of ambiguity, of difficulty, lies at the center of any honest conversation on women's reproductive rights: There are sometimes hard choices to be made, about a woman's body and the nascent life therein, but it is the woman herself who should be making them.\n\nIt may be that a change in language frees those who believe in an absolute right to abortion to a more honest wrestling with the issue. Let's imagine a scenario in which we admit that abortions may involve an obliteration of something that could legitimately be called life but that they are done to protect something that could also be called life. Planned Parenthood is, after all, in the business of protecting women's lives, their futures, their ability to pursue education, to establish security, to have homes filled with future children, and their freedom to decide how best to use their short time on earth.\n\nIf the last election showed anything, it was that the Republican attempt to control women's bodies, in all variety of weird ways, in language and in law, failed spectacularly in winning over the hearts and minds of the American public. Secure in this knowledge, Planned Parenthood, and other agencies of women's rights, should have the space to invent a more honest, persuasive, modern way of talking about this cluster of pressing issues.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Pro-Choice Groups Are Taking a Page From the Anti-Abortion Playbook\n\nMichigan is at the forefront of the fight for abortion rights It's one of the many states that has an old law on the books that criminalizes abortion. A judge has suspended the law-but conservative lawyers want that decision appealed . Should they succeed, the 1931 law could, after Roe is overturned, become enforceable and make anyone who provides abortion-a health care service-guilty of a felony.\n\nAbortion rights activists in the state, where I live and have worked as a political reporter, are taking matters into their own hands, and collecting signatures for a ballot initiative that would guarantee abortion rights in the state constitution. Michiganders aren't the only ones reverting to the ballot to enshrine abortion rights: in Vermont, there's an effort to make them part of the state constitution (there's no trigger law against abortion in Vermont; this would prevent any future laws from taking away the right to an abortion). In other states, we're also seeing the opposite happen: In Kansas and Kentucky they want to pass measures to amend the Constitution to say that there isn't a right to an abortion\n\nOn a recent episode of The Waves, Slate's podcast on gender and feminism, I spoke with Mark Joseph Stern, Slate senior writer covering the courts and the law. We talked about how ballot initiatives have been used in the past, and just how useful they'll be going forward. Mark also had some very specific advice on what those who want to fight for health care access should be doing urgently. Our conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.\n\nCheyna Roth: Mark, I feel I usually see anti-abortion groups going to the ballot for measures they want, but are pro-choice groups starting to sort of take a page from their playbook?\n\nMark Joseph Stern: That's exactly right. For many years, abortion foes have promoted ballot initiatives to restrict access to reproductive healthcare and also override state courts that rule in favor of abortion, and of course, push the limits of Roe v. Wade to see how far the Supreme Court would go to allow abortion restrictions.\n\nSince 1970, 84 percent of statewide ballot measures relating to abortion were designed to restrict access, not expand it. That lopsided figure is largely a result of the status quo under Roe, where progressives were generally happy, if not perfectly content, with the baseline guarantee of the right to abortion before viability. Conservatives, on the other hand, used every tool at their disposal to roll back that right, even with Roe still on the books. In a lot of Red States, direct democracy proved to be a pretty potent weapon. Now with Roe about to fall, the energy is really shifting. Suddenly you see almost every red state poised to enact a complete or near total ban on abortion the moment Roe is off the books, but the progressives in blue and purple states are scrambling to enshrine reproductive rights into their state laws once Roe's baseline guarantee disappears.\n\nIn Michigan, there have been quite a few anti-abortion ballot initiatives, but I don't know that there's been this level of excitement for either side when it comes to abortion initiatives in the past. They need 425,000 ballot signatures by July 11th, and it sounds like they are very much well on their way to getting enough signatures to potentially get this on the ballot for the people to vote on. I have seen people out there gathering signatures for this initiative in ways that I haven't seen for others. So given this level of excitement, I'm surprised that more states don't have similar initiatives for the midterms.\n\nA big part of that is how Roe's imminent demise kind of crept up on a lot of the country. People like me have been screaming since Amy Coney Barrett joined the court, even since Brett Kavanaugh joined the court, that Roe was in serious jeopardy. But for whatever reason that didn't seem to register until first, the Supreme Court allowed the Texas ban to stand back in the late fall. That is the law that allows any stranger to sue an abortion provider or anyone who facilitates an abortion for $10,000 if they perform the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThen of course on May 2nd, this draft opinion leaked from the Supreme Court. I think not only reading that draft, but seeing it already laid out in the format of an official opinion really made a dent in peoples' psyches. They were like, \"Oh my God, this is real.\"\n\nThe problem here is that the initiative process is often really cumbersome and time-consuming. You have to gather a gazillion signatures. I mean, in Michigan, it's 425,000. In other states it's even more. Then you have to make sure that enough of them survive the inevitable challenges from your opponents, which can be really time-consuming. Go through signature by signature, making sure it's legible, making sure that person is a valid voter, didn't sign twice, whatever. Then you have to make sure your initiative survives other legal challenges in the courts. There are just so many veto points that activists have to make sure that they do literally everything right, and even then that's not always enough. So, it takes years of preparation and execution. It's not the kind of thing you can do off the cuff.\n\nYou've called Michigan the most prominent success story so far when it comes to purple states.What is it doing that other purple states could learn from aside from the ballot initiative?\n\nReproductive rights advocates have launched a kind of two-pronged approach. First, they filed a regular lawsuit asking a lower court judge to strike down that 1931 abortion ban. They prevailed. They convinced this lower court judge to issue an injunction that bars the enforcement of that ban from 1931. The attorney general of the state is a Democrat, and she said she's not going to appeal that decision. So, if Roe fell tomorrow, even absent any other action here, Michigan still would not be able to enforce its anti-abortion law because it is on hold in the courts.\n\nAt the same time, the democratic Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, has asked the state Supreme court to declare that as a matter of state law, the Michigan Constitution protects the right to abortion already. If the court agrees, it will not only strike down that 1931 ban, but also potentially a bunch of other restrictions that Republicans have put in place over the last few decades. So, the irony here is that after Roe falls, Michigan might end up with more liberal and permissive abortion laws than it has right now as we speak.\n\nWhile people are debating next moves in this likely-post-Roe world, what do you think is the best thing that everyday citizens should be doing?\n\nDonating to abortion funds honestly. Until we get this mess sorted out, which in my view will take the next 30 to 50 years, the most helpful thing that individual advocates for reproductive rights can do is pay to ensure that people in need can terminate their pregnancies.\n\nWhen I talk to progressive groups about this stuff, they always ask at the end, \"Well, what can we do?\" Aside from voting for pro-choice politicians and signing these initiatives and whatever, I say, \"You need to tithe. Think of this as a tithe. You should be opening your wallet to abortion funds, especially in the South right now, but soon in the Midwest as well, so that women can get the money that they need to hop on a plane and miss work and take unpaid leave to terminate the pregnancy that they got for whatever reason. If you are not actively subsidizing reproductive healthcare and ensuring that people can get the care they need where and when they need it, then you are really kind of betraying them and betraying the cause that you claim to stand for.\"\n\nVote, then tithe.\n\nThat fits on a bumper sticker.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "You Should Ignore the \"Amazon's Choice\" Label While Holiday Shopping\n\nIt's that time of year when there's no shortage of magazines ( including Slate!) and Instagram influencers telling you what to buy. Another source of advice is Amazon itself, which appears to highlight recommendations from its vast ocean of stuff through an \"Amazon's Choice\" badge. Your \" best\"-addled brain might be tempted by products with this badge-after all, who better to know what's good than the purveyor of goods. Don't do it!\n\n\"Amazon Choice\" isn't so much a promise of quality as a marker of popularity-and a faulty one at that. In a number of cases, the Amazon's Choice label seems to have been affixed with all the care and skill of a robot flinging milk and cereal in the general direction of a bowl .\n\nIf you pay attention to it-as I have, in so many hours as a professional human product reviewer-Amazon Choice's sloppiness becomes apparent. Its product categorizations, for example, often don't quite make sense: an eyebrow and lash growth serum earned the Amazon's Choice label in the category of \"magnetic eyelashes\"-surely someone wanting instant giant lashes would be disappointed with a potion demanding continual use for an eventual result. When I checked the page again a few hours later, the designation had been moved to a set of actual false magnetic eyelashes . While the category was now correct, these lashes had just one review (four stars) and were not available on Amazon Prime. \"May arrive after Christmas,\" red letters above the buy buttons warned. Hmmm.\n\nIn other cases, the category in which an item is \"Amazon's Choice\" is so wildly specific as to be meaningless: A card game called Exploding Kittens gets the badge of best product in the category of ... \"exploding kittens.\" The other contenders on that search page are hardly competition: They include games called \"Unstable Unicorn,\" \"Joking Game\" as well as an Exploding Kittens expansion pack called Imploding Kittens. Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner is listed as the winner in the category \"stila stay all day waterproof liquid eyeliner.\"\n\nIn these cases, the label seems like a way to make random (if well-rated) things look enticing, rather than signifying an intentional recommendation of a genuinely good product compared to the other things on offer. In at least one case, the Amazon Choice badge was affixed to something outright dangerous: \"Humble's Miracle Solution A Mineral,\" was, at one time, Amazon's Choice in a category that began \"jim humble mms miracle mineral.\" Banned in Canada, it's a bogus and harmful \"treatment\" for autism and HIV/AIDS, and was removed from Amazon entirely after the Daily Beast inquired as to why it bore Amazon's endorsement .\n\nAmazon won't share exactly how they make the Amazon's Choice selections with me or other product review professionals who have questioned the badge's utility and framing . In response to my request for comment, they said it's based on \"popularity, rating and reviews, price, shipping speed and more,\" suggesting that there's some sort of algorithm behind it. (Given the mishaps mentioned above, it seems clear there isn't much human curation.)\n\nAnd yet, the Amazon's Choice badge tries to impose a sense of editorial order-it guides you from a sprawling list of search results to something that was picked , cutting out the decision fatigue of shopping, making sure you purchase something instead of getting overwhelmed and wandering away without spending money. It seems more authoritative than a Best-seller or Amazon Charts badge-both of which are earned based on more straightforward numbers. But it is ultimately less useful than either of those-it's just a loose label that alerts you to items that are popular for a vague mash-up of reasons. You're probably better off spending a few minutes reading the reviews.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The conservative push for \"school choice\" has had its most successful year ever\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWhy did it break through after decades of effort - and what comes next?\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nWith little national attention, the conservative movement has racked up a remarkable series of victories on one of their long-held policy dreams.\n\nFor decades, activists on the right have pushed to steer state money toward alternatives to the public school system. Typically, they proposed vouchers, in which the state would pay part or all of a child's private school tuition.\n\nBut despite all this effort, conservatives could only get limited and targeted voucher programs into place - vouchers for low-income families, or those in low-performing school districts, or for students with disabilities.\n\nEven in the reddest states, they fell short of their true Holy Grail: public money funding private school tuition, for all who want it, including middle-class and wealthy families.\n\nVery suddenly, that has changed. It started with West Virginia in 2021 and Arizona in 2022, and then continued with a flood this year - Iowa, Utah, Arkansas, Florida, Oklahoma, Ohio, and Indiana. More may follow. \"It's happening!\" Corey DeAngelis, a conservative activist who describes himself as a \" school choice evangelist ,\" regularly tweets, joyfully chronicling each new victory.\n\nThe reform sweeping red America is slightly different from a voucher - it's called an education savings account, or an ESA. In a voucher system, public funds go directly to schools. With ESAs, parents who opt out of the public school system get several thousand dollars in an account that they can use for private school tuition, homeschooling, or other education-related expenses.\n\nBut the biggest change is in who can use them: everyone. \"It's really hard to overstate how different from any kind of previous legislation these programs are,\" said Liz Cohen, policy director for Georgetown University's FutureEd think tank. \"It's not income-tested; it's not about getting the lowest-income kids in the worst schools. Prior to three years ago, I would have bet a lot of money you would have never seen this happen.\"\n\nThe aftereffects of the Covid-19 pandemic and an unfolding culture war shook up the status quo enough that a longstanding, well-financed conservative advocacy effort could finally defeat longstanding resistance. Now, in many red states and the occasional purple state, we're seeing what could prove the most sweeping change in K-12 education policy in decades.\n\n\"We're ending up with, really, two different systems for arranging our schools,\" said Morgan Polikoff, an associate professor at USC Rossier School of Education. Blue states are sticking with the traditional state-funded public education system, while red states are increasingly creating an option for government-subsidized private school tuition - the full consequences of which won't be clear for some time.\n\nCritics of these changes argue they amount to a wealth transfer to families with kids in private schools, and they fear it will result in the weakening or even the eventual privatization of public school systems. They also voice concern over the separation of church and state, since many ESA funds will go toward sending children to religious education.\n\nFor many supporters, those are features, not bugs. They characterize the new ESA laws as letting parents take \"their money\" - the dollars that would have been used to educate their kids - out of public schools they have no interest in using. They call this \"funding students instead of systems.\" Their critics say it's the destruction of the common good.\n\nPublic schools have long been treated as a public resource. They are typically administered by local governments, free to all, and funded by taxpayers generally, including those who don't have children.\n\nBut in a 1955 paper , economist Milton Friedman proposed a different model. The government should stop running schools, and instead merely give parents vouchers worth a certain amount that could be redeemed at \"approved\" educational institutions. This, he asserted, would create free market competition, expand the choices available to parents, and produce better outcomes than the current government-funded monopolies.\n\nIn the ensuing decades, various groups dissatisfied with the public school system would come to embrace vouchers as an alternative, as journalist Cara Fitzpatrick writes in her new book The Death of Public School . The coalition included free market enthusiasts like Friedman, but also devout families preferring religious schooling for their children. And as school desegregation was taking place, some Southern white parents hoped voucher-like policies could help fund their kids' exit to mostly white private schools. These policies were eventually blocked by courts, meaning \"white flight\" had to occur without government help.\n\nThe most effective converts to the voucher cause were several deep-pocketed conservative donors - members of the DeVos , Koch , and Walton families, and leaders of the Bradley Foundation , among others. Some appeared to be motivated by free market ideology and others by religious belief, but the common thread was a disdain for government.\n\nThese donors' largesse and consistency ensured that, whichever way the political winds were blowing, there would always be a well-funded network of voucher supporters refining policy arguments, shaping advocacy strategy, and conducting research that would produce results showing vouchers \"work.\" Over the past few decades, these donors spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the cause - promoting vouchers as well as other policies, like charter schools, under the banner of \"school choice.\"\n\nWhen the quality of American schools became a nationwide concern in the 1980s and onward, conservatives pitched vouchers as a solution, framing them now as a civil rights cause . Too many poor or minority children, they said, were trapped in dysfunctional public schools. Vouchers could give some of them other options - and perhaps they could even create competitive pressures to make the public schools better. This argument prevailed in Wisconsin in 1990, when Republicans joined with a few Democrats to create the nation's first modern voucher program , for low-income kids in Milwaukee (an idea promoted by the Wisconsin-based Bradley Foundation).\n\nBut most Democrats were anti-voucher. They argued that voucher programs would harm the public school system, draining funds and students from it. Teachers unions , a powerful Democratic-aligned interest group, were staunch opponents because private schools were non-unionized.\n\nSo at the peak of the education reform movement in the 2000s, most of the bipartisan action was on other issues. President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind Act focused instead on testing and accountability for schools deemed to be \"failing\" - Bush supported vouchers, but Democrats largely didn't, and he needed them to pass the bill. President Barack Obama notably backed charter schools , which are public schools administered by independent operators, but he was hostile to vouchers.\n\nWhen a few Republican-controlled states, such as Ohio, Florida, Arizona, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Indiana, did pass statewide voucher programs, they came with sharply restricted eligibility. These were specialized programs for low-income people, those in districts with poor-performing schools, foster children, or children with special needs.\n\nFor vouchers' biggest backers, this was never just about helping the disadvantaged. They wanted vouchers for all. And yet, despite all that conservative money and activism, not a single state had managed to create such a program by 2020.\n\nThe simplest reason is that proposals to radically disrupt public schools were unpopular. The opposition was typically led by Democrats and teachers unions, but even many Republican voters were deeply skeptical about anything that could be framed as weakening their own public schools.\n\nOften, suburban parents had moved to an area specifically for high-quality public schools. Meanwhile, in rural areas, there could be few private options, the public schools were often significant employers, and a loss of students could mean a painful loss of funding. \"The main opposition to these programs in Republican-dominated states has come from rural superintendents,\" a recent Heritage Foundation paper stated . So typically, proposals for statewide vouchers ended up watered down or blocked even in Republican-controlled legislatures.\n\nWhen voucher proponents took their case to the public, it went even more disastrously.\n\nIn 2000, Betsy DeVos (who would later go on to become President Donald Trump's education secretary) and her family spent about $5 million on a Michigan voucher ballot initiative, but it failed by a 69 percent to 31 percent margin. A similar measure in California that same year failed 70-30 . Out of about two dozen voucher ballot initiatives, none were approved .\n\nMeanwhile, the few programs that passed the legislature faced court challenges, nationally and on the state level, often over government funding of religious schools. Some were struck down - including Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's prized voucher program and a fledgling Arizona voucher program for special needs students. An alternative policy scheme involving tax credits for families who donated to nonprofits that would provide private school scholarship money gained steam in some states .\n\nThe obstacles for vouchers seemed so daunting that, in 2005, Dan Lips, an education policy expert at the Arizona-based Goldwater Institute, proposed a new spin on the policy : education savings accounts (ESAs). Now, instead of a voucher coupon that would be given directly to a private school, parents would get an account in which actual money would be deposited, and the money could also be spent on tutoring, homeschooling, or other education-related expenses.\n\nAdvocates hoped this would address the Arizona Supreme Court's concern over funding religious schools, which had undone the state's voucher program. Now the state money would be given to parents, not to schools directly.\n\nESAs were also a helpful rebranding. \"Part of my job was to actively call reporters and try to get them to take the word 'voucher' out of their stories,\" said Charles Siler, a former lobbyist for the Goldwater Institute who has since become a critic of his onetime allies.\n\nIn 2011, Arizona Republicans passed the nation's first ESA program, limited to special needs students. They immediately went to work expanding eligibility to other groups - just one year later, nearly 20 percent of the public school population was eligible (though far fewer actually chose to participate).\n\nBut a 2018 attempt to make every Arizona student eligible ran into the Red for Ed movement of teacher activism and walkouts in conservative states. Opponents of the new law gathered enough signatures to put it up for a statewide referendum before it could go into effect. The result was similar to the other referendums: a lopsided defeat , 65 to 35 percent.\n\nEven in red states, it seemed, you still couldn't mess with the public schools.\n\nIt's a cliché to say the pandemic changed everything, but for the politics of K-12 education that happens to be true.\n\nUniversal voucher bills had long failed because most parents didn't want radical disruption of the public school status quo. The pandemic brought this radical disruption. Polarizing battles unfolded over school closures, mask and vaccine requirements, and (after reopening) how long kids should be kept home if classmates tested positive.\n\nThen the culture war that erupted over race, gender, and sexuality teaching in schools in 2020 and beyond ensured that things never entirely returned to \"normal.\" Activists like Christopher Rufo argued that \" critical race theory \" concepts were pervading teaching about race, Twitter accounts like Libs of TikTok spread videos of educators discussing gender identity , and such matters became omnipresent on Fox News and in conservative media.\n\nIn the right's narrative, parents reasonably recoiled against the incompetence or ideological extremism of educators. In the left's narrative, conservatives targeted the public school system with a strategic and unrelenting campaign of vilification, laden with exaggeration and moral panic . \"The overriding message has been to drive a wedge between parents and public schools,\" Polikoff said.\n\nConservative activists saw opportunity. \"It is time for the school choice movement to embrace the culture war,\" the Heritage Foundation's Jay Greene and James Paul wrote in 2022 .\n\nIn a 2019 survey, 31 percent of Republican respondents said they had very little or no confidence in public schools; in a 2022 survey, that number had risen to 50 percent. Democratic and independent voters, in contrast, remained roughly as confident in the public school system as before the pandemic.\n\nBut the drop in Republican support shifted the previous political status quo, especially in red states, making rank-and-file GOP voters less hostile about proposals to shake up the system.\n\nIn June 2021, Joel John was a few months into his first term in the Arizona House of Representatives, when the state's governor, Doug Ducey, took another shot at greatly expanding ESAs. Though a Republican, John wasn't on board. He was concerned that public schools had to compete with unregulated private schools that lacked accountability measures. Two other Republicans, citing similar objections, joined him and blocked the proposal .\n\n\"It was my first term; it takes time to get your bearings and to understand how things work,\" John told me in an interview. He would soon learn. Afterward, John and the other two holdouts were attacked in YouTube ads funded by an outside group: the American Federation for Children (AFC).\n\nThe American Federation for Children has long been the leading advocacy group trying to get vouchers passed into law. It was initially funded, founded, and chaired by Betsy DeVos, who was for many years the main financial force behind the voucher movement. (The group's name is a dig at the American Federation of Teachers - meant to imply that the union represents teachers' interests, while the group represents children's.)\n\nInvestor Bill Oberndorf, who took over as board chair when DeVos became education secretary, outlined AFC's strategy on a 2021 podcast . Statewide referendums were hopeless, he said: \"There has never been a ballot initiative that's passed.\" Instead, AFC would identify \"states where we feel that, over a three- to five-year period, we can change the legislative composition to be favorable to choice and where we can help elect a governor who is receptive to signing such legislation.\" That legislation, it became increasingly clear, was ESAs for all who wanted them.\n\nIn Arizona, a sympathetic governor was already in place: Ducey. Ambitious Republican governors seeking to cultivate the conservative base have long been drawn to the school choice issue - it's important to both big donors and the religious right, two key factions in GOP power politics, and it earns positive press in conservative media outlets . John's impression, he told me, was that Ducey was \"hoping to build a national platform\" off the issue.\n\nIn 2021, West Virginia Republicans had created an ESA for which 90 percent of students would be eligible (students currently attending private schools were excluded ). Implementation there was delayed due to a lawsuit . So in 2022, his final year in office, Ducey took another shot at getting the nation's first truly universal ESA program - in which even families already sending their kids to private school could get money - off the ground in Arizona.\n\nDucey faced the same three GOP holdouts in the state House. But he and his party's legislative leaders deployed carrots and sticks. The carrot was a historic boost in funding to the public education system, made possible due to a large budget surplus. The stick was pressure from party leaders and outside groups before the primaries. In the end, all three of the holdouts flipped, voting for the bill . \"To be frank, I have regretted it ever since,\" John told me.\n\nAll three went on to lose their primaries that year anyway. Meanwhile, liberal activists tried to gather signatures to force the new law onto the ballot, as they did during the Red for Ed days, but they fell short . So the nation's first universal ESA program went into effect in Arizona in the fall of 2022.\n\nIt would not be the last. AFC intervened in state legislative primaries across the country that year, hoping some attention-getting defeats of incumbents could scare others into going along. In Iowa, after Gov. Kim Reynolds's ESA bill failed in the state House, she backed primary challenges against several holdout Republicans. Assisted by campaign ads funded by AFC and other conservative groups like the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, they defeated four of them.\n\nOne, Jim Thorup, was a solid conservative but feared the bill would harm rural school districts. \"I think if I agree with the governor on nine out of ten issues, that tenth issue, if we disagree on it, that should be okay,\" Thorup had told the Iowa Capital Dispatch before the election.\n\nAFC's goal was to make sure that wasn't okay - they wanted to make \"universal school choice\" a litmus test issue for Republicans, as previous generations of anti-abortion, pro-gun rights, and anti-tax activists had successfully done for their own causes. Yet the groups could only succeed in this if enough Republican voters felt the same way, and largely, they now did.\n\nThe midterms didn't end up producing a GOP wave, but as 2023 began, a wave of ESA bills rippled through red states. Corey DeAngelis, a senior fellow at AFC, became the public face of the effort, traveling from state to state, holding rallies, making media appearances, and tweeting constantly. After getting his PhD at the University of Arkansas's ( Walton-funded ) education reform program, DeAngelis concluded that he could \"make more of an impact\" in an advocacy role. \"You can write a thousand white papers and politicians won't even read it,\" he told me.\n\nIowa was the first domino to fall this year, with Gov. Reynolds finally getting her ESA bill through the now-more-pliable legislature in January. Republicans in Utah, Arkansas, Florida, Oklahoma, Ohio, and Indiana soon followed with their own universal or near-universal ESA laws (though some will phase in eligibility gradually over a few years).\n\nOther GOP-controlled states didn't go quite so far, but took steps in that direction - South Carolina created its first ESA program, New Hampshire expanded eligibility for the program it created in 2021. In other states like Georgia and Texas, advocates have fallen short for now, but they will try again.\n\nArizona's universal ESA program, which went into effect in fall 2022, is the furthest along so far. Arizona families who already sent their children to private schools or homeschools were immediately eligible for the $7,000-per-student benefit, if they signed up. Many have.\n\nAfter John left office, he told me, he spoke with a local banker about the bill: \"I told him it was such bad policy, I was embarrassed I supported it,\" John said. \"He said he was happy about it: it saved him seven grand per kid on tuition.\"\n\n\"In the short term, mostly it's just going to be a funding giveaway to families that were already sending their kids to private schools,\" said Douglas Harris, an economist at Tulane University who studies education policy. \"In the long run, there's potentially a much bigger story here.\"\n\nBy mid-May 2023, about 61,000 Arizona students were enrolled in an ESA, and the state department of education estimated that number would rise to 100,000, about 8 percent of school-aged children in the state, over the next year.\n\nShortly after the universal program was opened, the state superintendent (then a Democrat) said that 75 percent of applicants had never attended public schools in the state. More recently, the current superintendent (a Republican) said 49 percent of enrollees had been in public schools . All we know for sure is that some families who weren't using the public school system are now getting money to do what they were already doing, and some families who had been attending public schools are now getting money to go elsewhere.\n\nWhat is the money producing? Again, the answer is unclear. The Goldwater Institute bragged in 2022 that Arizona's ESA bill \"does not have any testing requirements.\" (Iowa legislators, in contrast, did include some .)\n\nCritics fear state money will go to low-quality private schools that don't actually educate children well - and that, without transparent testing requirements, we'll never find that out for sure. \"These policies being passed now are almost being evidence-proofed,\" said Polikoff. \"You won't be able to say, 'This isn't working, we need to do something different,' because there won't be the data. The data will just be, 'Look at all these people who've enrolled their kids.'\"\n\nPublic school enrollment will likely decline somewhat now that funds are available to go elsewhere, with the question being exactly how much. In the short term, an overwhelming exodus from public to private schools likely won't materialize simply because the existing private school infrastructure can only support so much. (Tuition will surely increase, as is already happening in Iowa .)\n\nBut already, Arizona's superintendent Tom Horne has said he would push to close some public schools if enrollment dropped, which is just what rural school voucher skeptics long feared.\n\nAs time passes, there could be greater change. For-profit K-12 schools will likely expand, eager to get their hands on newly available state funding (Arizona's program is now estimated to cost $900 million). \"In some places where similar things have been tried for low-income kids, there were not enough private schools, so new low-quality private schools opened,\" said Cohen of FutureEd.\n\nMany controversies surely lie ahead as well. Private schools have wide latitude to discriminate in admissions (though it's illegal to do so based on race) - can it truly be called \"universal school choice\" if children can't get into the school they want?\n\nThe politicized curriculum controversies that have dogged public schools could also soon hit private schools, with more scrutiny from the left about what certain private schools are teaching. And there will be questions about the appropriateness of some spending (one article names \"chicken coops, trampolines and tickets to SeaWorld\" as among homeschooling parents' claimed education-related expenses).\n\nThere's also the budget question. In many of these states, universal ESAs were passed at a time when state budgets were flush with Covid aid. States could create what was essentially a new benefit for families who weren't previously utilizing government money to educate their children, while often increasing funding and teacher pay at public schools, in \"have your cake and eat it too\" fashion.\n\nBut the Covid aid is ending, which will eventually present a math problem for states if revenues slow down. Either taxes will have to go up, or something - ESAs, public schools, or other state spending - will have to be cut. \"The federal money drying up is going to be a big deal, and the whole tenor of the conversation is going to change,\" said Andrew Rotherham of Bellwether Education Partners.\n\nDemocratic opposition to ESAs remains high, but in states where they've been implemented, Republicans have staunchly defended them (Katie Hobbs, Arizona's new Democratic governor, couldn't get her effort to roll back ESAs past the GOP-controlled legislature). The wind could change in purple states, but in red states, the GOP is highly likely to hold onto legislative majorities, so ESAs are likely here to stay.\n\n\"I'd like to see the legislature roll it back and reconsider the soundness of this policy, for sure,\" said John, the former Arizona legislator. \"But while Republicans have a majority, don't count on that. No one's gonna break ranks on this where a lot of people have an interest in it and there's so much money behind it.\"\n\nRobert Enlow, president and CEO of the group EdChoice and a supporter of the new laws, put it a different way: \"Once you give choice to families, it's going to be very hard to take it away.\"\n\nEven in states that have passed \"universal school choice,\" advocates may keep pushing for more. Milton Friedman, in his original voucher article from 1955, mused about getting government out of the business of administering public schools altogether.\n\nOnce the market of educational options was up and running, Friedman wrote, the role of the government could be something more like a restaurant inspector ensuring \"certain minimum standards\" are met. We're a long way from that happening. But perhaps not as far off from it as we once were.\n\nFor now, DeAngelis still has more battles to fight.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe limitations of ranked-choice voting.\n\nby Dylan Matthews\n\nTuesday might have been the last traditional Election Day of my life in Washington, DC, where I've been voting for the past 12 years.\n\nThe ballot included Initiative 83 , a measure adopting ranked-choice voting (RCV); it passed overwhelmingly . While it's possible that the DC government could just refuse to implement the measure (they've done it before ), it's more likely that from now on, I'll be ranking candidates for the DC Council and mayor - not just voting for one candidate per post.\n\nSign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.\n\nRanked choice is an electoral reform that felt like a pipe dream only a few years ago, but has been becoming mainstream over the past decade or so. Alaska , Hawaii , and Maine , have adopted it for some elections to Congress or statewide office. While a small handful of municipalities like San Francisco and Minneapolis have used it for decades, they were recently joined by New York City , Seattle , and Portland, Oregon . Alongside DC, the states of Colorado , Idaho , Nevada , and Oregon all voted Tuesday on adopting the system, and Alaska voted on whether to keep it. Interestingly, only in DC and Alaska did the system pass.\n\nFull disclosure: I voted yes on the DC initiative. I think it probably does more good than harm in the context of our city. First-past-the-post voting clearly has deep flaws, which is why so many places are jumping on the RCV bandwagon. But I also think RCV's benefits have been oversold and that we should experiment with other ways to make our elections more proportional.\n\nIn ranked-choice voting (also called \"instant runoff\"), voters rank candidates in order. All the first-choice ballots are counted. If no candidate has a majority of first-choice votes, then the candidate with the smallest share is eliminated; their votes are then redistributed based on who their supporters ranked second. This continues until a candidate has an outright majority.\n\nI first encountered the idea after the 2000 election. In Florida, 97,488 people voted for Ralph Nader ; of whom only 537 would have had to vote for Al Gore to give him the win in the state and thus the presidency. What if those Nader voters - who were overwhelmingly liberal - had been able to rank Gore second? Then this would've happened naturally, and the failure of left-of-center voters to coordinate wouldn't have resulted in George W. Bush's presidency, the war in Iraq, etc.\n\nThis rationale is also why I support the idea in DC. Here, like a lot of coastal cities, almost all the political competition occurs in the Democratic primary, which is often incredibly crowded. Every four years, good-government folks here try to unseat Anita Bonds , our notoriously ineffective and incompetent at-large city councilor, and every time, multiple challengers wind up dividing the anti-Bonds vote. Two years ago , she won renomination with 36 percent of the vote, while two challengers each got 28 percent. RCV would make it harder for unpopular incumbents to get renominated by dividing the opposition.\n\nAs a narrow tool to avoid spoiler effects, RCV works quite well. But its supporters also have grander ambitions.\n\nKatherine Gehl, a wealthy former CEO who has bankrolled many recent RCV initiatives , argues that her particular version (called \"final five\" voting) will almost single-handedly make politicians work together again. Gehl wrote two years ago :\n\nBarriers to cooperation fall. Senators and representatives are liberated from the constraints of negative partisanship. They are free to enact solutions to complex problems by reaching across the aisle, innovating and negotiating.\n\nThe theory is elegant. In final five voting , all candidates - regardless of party - participate in a primary. The top five contenders are then placed on the general election ballot, where voters can rank them.\n\nThe hope is that this eliminates the dynamic where partisan primaries push party nominees to ideological extremes, and where fear of such a primary prevents incumbents from compromising or defying their party (see the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, of whom four lost renomination when challenged by a pro-Trump Republican). Then, ranked-choice voting in the general election means candidates compete for No. 2 and No. 3 votes, reducing the incentive to negatively campaign.\n\nSounds great! So why would someone oppose RCV?\n\nOne possible reason is the finding by political scientist Nolan McCarty that under RCV, precincts with more ethnic minorities see more \"ballot exhaustion\" (failing to rank as many candidates as one is allowed to). That means, McCarty has argued, that the reform tends to \"reduce the electoral influence of racial and ethnic minority communities.\"\n\nWork by Lindsey Cormack, an associate professor at Stevens Institute of Technology, has similarly found that \" overvoting \" (using the same ranking more than once, which means ballots can't be counted accurately) is more common in minority communities, while University of Pennsylvania's Stephen Pettigrew and Dylan Radley have found that ballot errors in general are much more common in ranked choice than traditional elections.\n\nAnything that raises the specter of reducing electoral influence for minority communities in the US is worth worrying about. That said, I'm not sure this case is disqualifying either. Ranked choice is a significant change that takes time for an electorate to understand and adjust to. I'm not sure that higher error rates for a newly adopted approach to voting indicate these error rates will persist as the practice becomes normalized.\n\nTo me the more compelling counterargument is that RCV seems unlikely to do anything to reduce partisanship and encourage cross-party compromise. The reason why has to do with the classic case against instant-runoff voting, which you might have heard if you're friends with social choice theory nerds (as, alas, I am).\n\nOne thing you'd want a voting system to do is elect the person who would win in a one-on-one race against every other candidate. This is called the \" Condorcet winner ,\" and while there isn't always one in an election, when there is one, it seems like a good election system should give them the win, as the person the electorate prefers to all alternatives.\n\nRanked-choice voting does not always pick the Condorcet winner, and we've now seen multiple real-world elections in which the Condorcet winner (which you can figure out from ranked-choice ballot records) lost. In Alaska's US House special election in 2022 , which used ranked choice, the Condorcet winner was Republican Nick Begich, but Democrat Mary Peltola won. Something similar happened in the 2009 Burlington, Vermont, mayoral race .\n\nImportantly, in both cases the Condorcet winner was the most moderate of the three main candidates. Begich was to the right of Peltola, but to the left of Sarah Palin (!), the third candidate. In Burlington, the left-wing Progressive Party nominee beat both the Democratic and Republican nominees, though the Democrat (a centrist in Burlington terms) was the Condorcet winner.\n\nRCV advocates note that these are two cases out of thousands of RCV elections, and that in practice, Condorcet failures are rare . I'm not so sure about that.\n\nResearch from Nathan Atkinson, Edward Foley, and Scott Ganz used a national ranked-choice survey of American voters to simulate what elections would look like under the system nationwide. For each state, they simulate 100,000 elections with four candidates. They find that in 40 percent of cases, the Condorcet winner loses, which suggests that the rarity of Condorcet failures in practice may just be an artifact of RCV being relatively new, and that such outcomes would become more common in time as the method spreads.\n\nWorse, the simulation paper finds that the system results in much more extreme winners (that is, winners who are farther away from the median voter) than one that picks the Condorcet winner. Indeed, \"the states where [the system] performs worst (including Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia) are among the most polarized, whereas the states where [it] performs the best (including Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Vermont) are among the least polarized.\" The system seems to actually encourage polarization, not avoid it.\n\nDC aside, voters themselves on Tuesday mostly opposed RCV. In Colorado , Idaho , Nevada , and Oregon , electorates all voted down ballot initiatives that would have introduced some form of RCV. In Alaska , a ballot initiative to repeal that state's RCV is currently slightly ahead.\n\nNew America political scientist Lee Drutman was once such a great fan of RCV that he wrote a book calling for it, but has in recent years come to think it's hardly the cure for polarization and dysfunction he once viewed it as, in part due to findings like Atkinson, et al. A better solution, he argues, is to strengthen parties and encourage more of them to form.\n\nStates should allow \"fusion voting,\" in which candidates can run on multiple parties' lines (New York already does this), and for legislatures, seats should be allocated proportionally: If there are 100 seats, and Democrats and Republicans each get 45 percent of the vote and Greens and Libertarians each get 5, then they should get 45, 45, 5, and 5 seats, respectively.\n\nThis is a much more radical change than ranked-choice voting, and requires a real rethinking by politicians. It's hard to imagine a DC with multiple functional political parties, or where anyone important isn't a Democrat. But it's worth trying it and experimenting. We have learned a lot from trying RCV, and we can learn even more.\n\nUpdate, November 6, 11:19 am ET: This story was originally published on November 6 and has been updated to include the results on numerous state ballot initiatives around ranked-choice voting.\n\nYou've read 1 article in the last month\n\nHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you - threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.\n\nOur mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTo protect reproductive rights after Roe, advocates will need to mobilize people with real reservations about abortion.\n\nby Rachel Cohen\n\nThree weeks after the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health decision, campaign staffers, donors, and ordinary people are wondering how, exactly, the political landscape might change.\n\nFor nearly 50 years, the parameters of Roe v. Wade defined the terms of the abortion debate. Reproductive rights supporters focused on preserving access to the procedure, and fought back against restrictions that could be challenged as unconstitutional. While some anti-abortion leaders wanted to ban the practice outright, the federal backstop of Roe meant they had to focus their energies on making it practically difficult to end a pregnancy.\n\nThe end of Roe means that fight has changed. It's no longer about just passing or surmounting barriers like mandatory waiting periods or restrictions on government funding. The Dobbs era will entail fighting over things that previously weren't realistic threats, like outright bans and granting legal rights to embryos.\n\nGiven this, how should pro-choice candidates, elected officials, and advocates make the best case for abortion access in a world where there is no longer a nationwide right, and in an environment where many pro-choice Americans have deep reservations about abortion?\n\nThe groups that worked to overturn Roe are facing their own version of these questions. Some writers have already started to call for more reliance on persuasion tactics ; it's time, they say, to fight for more family-friendly policies, both on the merits and to win over voters in the muddled middle - entreaties that many abortion rights supporters view with rightful skepticism.\n\nBut the anti-abortion movement is, for now, winning, making these messaging questions more urgent for supporters of reproductive rights. At least three national surveys have shown majorities of Americans favor banning abortion after 15 weeks, even as those same respondents said they wanted to see Roe upheld. Republicans are already talking about voting on a 15-week ban if they retake Congress in November.\n\nOver the last decade, progressives have rallied for reproductive rights in part by speaking more openly and unapologetically about abortion. Democratic leaders joining Republicans in stigmatizing the procedure, activists maintain, is a major reason women's rights are being rolled back today.\n\nThat advocacy work is not over, but it is more complicated in light of Roe' s overturn, which has left the movement with new political battlefields to navigate. Activists now have to figure out both how to mobilize the diverse pro-choice coalition - and to keep it together.\n\nNext month, in Kansas, will be the first time abortion rights are tested on the ballot post- Dobbs. In 2019, the state supreme court ruled that Kansas's constitution protects the right to an abortion. A proposed amendment would explicitly remove that right, opening the way for the legislature to restrict or ban the procedure. Republicans will likely outnumber Democrats at the polls by a 2:1 margin.\n\nTo defeat the ballot measure, supporters will have to find a way to depolarize the issue as much as possible, and that might mean avoiding attacking institutions and politicians that Republicans support.\n\nEthan Winter, a Data for Progress pollster who has experience working on state ballot initiatives and plans to poll abortion-related measures over the next few months, said that when Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey were law, it made more sense to think about abortion politics on a national level.\n\n\"In the post- Roe era, we have to think about 50 different electorates, which means you're assembling a pro-choice coalition that could look different in each state,\" he told Vox.\n\nAmericans tend not to like big, disruptive changes, and rolling back a legal right that's existed for 50 years is a very big, disruptive change. It's why, researchers believe, they observe a \"status quo bias\" when voters weigh in on ballot initiatives, often rejecting proposals - including abortion-related ones - they otherwise tell pollsters they support.\n\nWinter thinks the tendency for voters to resist big change is good news for reproductive rights supporters this cycle, who are fighting against ballot initiatives in Kansas and Montana that would further restrict access to abortion.\n\n\"The pro-choice movement is on the 'no' side, and when you're on the no side, and you are talking about preserving the status quo, you can win those fights even in deeply red states,\" he said. \"You can make an argument to conservative voters that you need to vote against this amendment because it represents a radical change.\"\n\nThis doesn't mean abortion rights advocates could never win affirmative ballot measures - progressives have won measures in red states to raise the minimum wage and expand Medicaid, for example. But in those cases, campaigners worked to depict the implementation of those proposals as minimally disruptive to the status quo.\n\nPollsters say there are arguments in favor of abortion rights that can resonate across the ideological spectrum. The most popular messages, researchers find again and again, are those that emphasize freedom from government control, and those that stress that abortion should be a decision between a woman and her doctor.\n\nFor the past decade, these concepts haven't always been prominent in abortion access debates. As the procedure came under increasing attack nationwide, reproductive rights supporters mobilized Democrats and allies to stand up more forcefully for abortion access, and challenged the idea that some abortions - like in the event of rape or incest - are more worthy than others.\n\nRather than accept the \"safe, legal, and rare\" messaging popularized by Bill Clinton in the 1990s, celebrities, lawmakers, and activists have encouraged amplifying abortion stories, even, or especially, less sympathetic ones. Activists have also emphasized that messages about a \"woman and her doctor\" could diminish the reproductive agency of the pregnant woman herself. As feminist writer Rebecca Traister put it earlier this week , \"It's at the heart of the attitude that a person who can be pregnant... cannot simply get access to that procedure by their own damn self, without consultation or permission from anyone.\"\n\nThe issue now is that, although a majority of American voters have repeatedly said they believe Roe should be upheld, roughly one-third of that majority personally opposes abortion. Those who believe abortion should be legal only in some cases primarily cite rape, incest, or a threat to a woman's life.\n\nNavigator Research, a group that works to provide messaging guidance to progressives, including Planned Parenthood , has conducted a few surveys on reproductive rights over the last few months: one in April before the leak of the draft Dobbs decision, one in May after it , and one following the Supreme Court's final ruling. They found that respondents found a few consequences of the ruling especially concerning and believable: that women would have to seek unsafe abortions and that victims of rape and incest would be forced to give birth.\n\nThese ideological tensions between reproductive activists and other self-identified pro-choice people were not of huge concern when Roe was the law and defending the decision was a collective rallying point. But it makes building a coalition in a post- Roe world a more delicate balance.\n\nSome groups are already thinking through these questions of persuasion. Heidi Sieck, the CEO of #VOTEPROCHOICE , a group that started in 2016 and focuses on electing down-ballot candidates, said a lot of her work is helping people understand how every public office has a role to play in protecting reproductive freedom, something she believes has been obscured by the heavy focus on federal-level rights in the Roe era.\n\n\"What happened in the context of political mobilization was the Democratic Party abdicated its responsibility around abortion to a few feminist organizations like Feminist Majority, NARAL, and Planned Parenthood,\" she said. \"And those groups were only speaking to those voters who prioritize abortion as their number one mobilizing issue, and among the 80 percent of the pro-choice majority, that's only about 20 percent.\"\n\nSieck said the problem is there have been large numbers of voters who didn't want Roe overturned, but who have not felt heard by the Democratic Party, or their local officials or reproductive rights groups. \"The groups are wonderful but they only resonate with a small portion\" of the coalition, she said, adding that the brands of Planned Parenthood and NARAL don't connect with a lot of people \"because it's so pink and feminine and doesn't meet a lot of people where they are.\"\n\nMen4Choice , another relatively young group that focuses on educating and mobilizing pro-choice men off the sidelines, has been thinking through ways to empower men to engage as \"stakeholders\" on abortion rights, not just occasional \"beneficiaries.\"\n\n\"Pro-choice men don't know how or if they're allowed to talk about this issue, they don't see an entry point for themselves in the movement, and so all of our work has been on engaging men, educating them, and we're helping to give them a sense of ownership,\" co-founder Oren Jacobson told Vox. \"One of the things we say over and over again is this isn't just a fight about abortion, but it's a fight about freedom and power and control.\"\n\nBryan Bennett, a pollster with Navigator, says abortion is an issue where Democrats should be going on the offensive, and he encourages candidates and elected officials to \"meet people where they are\" and emphasize freedom language. \"Many people associate 'freedom' with Republican values, but in this particular instance,\" he said, referring to abortion, \"freedom is extraordinarily resonant and that's a very important thing to keep in mind.\"\n\nSieck said her group is working on \"deep canvassing,\" a campaign method that involves longer, empathetic conversations with voters, since people have \"very complex perspectives\" on reproductive rights. \"People might identify as pro-life or anti-choice, but when you actually talk to them they really don't think that elected officials should be involved in the decision, or they want their own daughters to have access,\" she said. The threat of criminalization is an aspect Sieck says they're finding to really resonate in conversations, even among those against abortion. \"Still, in the end this going to be a mobilization game,\" she said.\n\nWhen it comes to mobilization, a big question on candidates' minds is whether all of this outrage at the Supreme Court decisions will lead, or can be channeled, into voting in November.\n\nBennett said he has observed strikingly large drops in favorability for the Supreme Court. \"For years going into this past February, it had been extremely stable in the 55-60 percent range, with only about 30 percent not favorable,\" he told Vox. \"Now, perceptions of the Court are underwater for the first time.\"\n\nLess than a quarter of Democrats have a favorable view of the Court, Navigator found, down from just over half in February. Among Republicans, favorability hasn't really shifted. But independents, who were essentially split, are now at 31 favorable and 55 unfavorable. \"These are fairly dramatic and significant shifts,\" Bennett said. \"As entrenched as partisanship is, you would typically not see that much in the shift considering how polarized we are.\"\n\nSeveral polls conducted just after the Dobbs decision came down suggest the ruling is motivating more voters to turn out in the midterms, especially Democratic voters.\n\nBut how leaders decide to talk about the overturn of Roe to get voters to the polls remains an open question. Earlier this week, Politico reported that the Justice Department urged House Democrats to scrap language about their intent to \"codify Roe\" through the expansive Women's Health Protection Act, even though Democrats have been saying that to describe their bill since last September.\n\nAnd in May, the House Pro-Choice Caucus circulated new talking points that warned \"choice\" is \"harmful language\" for reproductive rights supporters, and should be replaced with the \"helpful\" alternative of \"decision.\" This generated some laughter, but other aides and activists were upset that leaders would seek to ditch the well-known and popular messaging frame at such a high-visibility moment, and without real opinion research to support it.\n\nFor now Democrats say they don't plan to listen to the DOJ guidance and they don't seem to be abandoning \"pro-choice\" language , either . Some commentators have said they worry Democrats and advocacy organizations \"haven't passed the denial stage\" of grief, and are failing to accept that post- Roe battles will look fundamentally different. Former campaign staffers told Vox they used to expect reproach from advocacy groups if candidates moderated their abortion language on the trail.\n\nGabby Richards, the director of federal advocacy communications for Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said polls are clear that protecting abortion access is a winning issue and there's value to candidates and elected officials reiterating and clarifying their stances. \"Anti-abortion politicians have never been afraid to tell people how they feel when it comes to abortion,\" she said. \"Reproductive rights champions, at every level of government, are on solid ground in sharing where they stand when it comes to safeguarding our ability to make decisions about our own bodies.\"\n\nIn a statement, NARAL Pro-Choice America president Mini Timmaraju told Vox that their organizing and electoral work \"combines persuasion and mobilization to effectively engage\" the majority of people in the United States who support reproductive freedom. \"We're pulling out all of the stops this election cycle to make sure voters across the country know the stakes of the midterms and can channel the anger they feel at having their rights and freedoms trampled upon by extremist lawmakers into action at the ballot box,\" she said.\n\nA spokesperson for Emily's List did not return requests for comment.\n\nLooking at the polling on 15-week abortion bans and parental consent laws, it's fair to wonder if pro-choice supporters will be at a disadvantage if they no longer have the more euphemistic Roe language to use. If they focus on drilling down into the harms of specific restrictions, will they lose in the court of public opinion?\n\nStill, in other ways, talking about constitutional law and the comparative details of past Supreme Court decisions can get rather abstract, and pollsters say there's value in speaking more directly about risks in the coming months.\n\n\"We've done a lot of various messaging batteries that look at different scenarios, and in terms of the top concerns if Roe v. Wade is overturned, emphasizing women's rights is critical,\" said Bennett, of Navigator. \"I do think that getting crystal clear about what's at stake - 'protecting a woman's right to have an abortion as a decision between her and her doctor' is extremely safe ground, and 'protecting a right for a woman to have an abortion' is also pretty strong.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

It's part of a pattern.\n\nby Anna North\n\nDonald Trump is headed to the White House, again, so it's not surprising that Americans are again contending with a rise in hate speech .\n\nThis time around, one of the attack lines is \" your body, my choice .\" Attributed by some to an election night post on X by white supremacist Nick Fuentes that read \"Your body, my choice. Forever,\" the phrase transforms the longstanding feminist and abortion rights slogan \"My body, my choice\" into an attack on women's autonomy, and, at worst, a threat of rape.\n\nIn the days following the election, TikTok creators have reported seeing the phrase crop up in comments on their videos, according to a report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a global nonpartisan think tank that studies disinformation and extremism. One creator said she had to delete a video because commenters were \"saying they couldn't wait until I get raped or 'your body my choice.'\"\n\nGirls and young women are also hearing the line in schools, according to family members, with one mom posting on Facebook that her daughter had heard it three times on campus, and that boys told her to \"sleep with one eye open tonight.\"\n\nInstances of the phrase increased 4,600 percent on X between last Thursday and Friday, according to the report . Meanwhile, Fuentes's original post has been reposted more than 35,000 times .\n\nThe spike in sexist hate is a reflection of one of the dominant narratives of the election: that it was essentially a triumph of men over women . Trump tailored much of his campaign to disaffected American men - especially young men, many of whom feel they are victims of discrimination and who have expressed resentment against feminist movements like Me Too . For a lot of these men, the election feels like vindication, and for some, it's more than that: a chance to put women back in their place.\n\nFor anyone on the receiving end of the misogynist insults in the last few days, meanwhile, the phrase feels like a scary harbinger of things to come. At the same time, experts told Vox that Americans have experienced this kind of hate speech before, particularly in the aftermath of Trump's first election in 2016 - and that history can hold lessons for navigating the present.\n\nThe feminist phrase \"my body, my choice\" was used regularly in chants at rallies by 1970, though it's not clear who originally coined it, said Laura Prieto, program director of Our Bodies Ourselves Today , a digital platform that is an iteration of the iconic reproductive health book Our Bodies, Ourselves . In the years before Roe v. Wade , it was a call for abortion rights, but it was also \"a statement about women demanding their right as equal human beings to have decision-making power over what happened to them,\" Prieto said.\n\nThe term has become less popular on the left in recent years, especially after it was adopted by anti-vaccine activists . Now \"my body, my choice\" has been co-opted by Fuentes and others, who have transformed it into a tool to harass and intimidate women.\n\nOthers aren't using the phrase, but are echoing the idea that with Trump's election, women must submit to the will of men. On social media, posts have ranged from \"more coded misogyny\" to \"very direct threats of rape,\" Isabelle Frances-Wright, director of technology and society at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and one of the authors of the report, told Vox.\n\nMany of the sexist posts stem from \"manosphere\" influencers like Andrew Tate and their followers, according to the report - Tate, for example, posted on X on November 7, \"I saw a woman crossing the road today but I just kept my foot down. Right of way? You no longer have rights.\"\n\n\"Manosphere\" creators are part of a larger online ecosystem directed at men that's lurched hard to the right in recent years, and helped carry Trump to victory, Vox's Rebecca Jennings reported . Fifty-five percent of male voters cast their ballots for Trump this year, compared with just 45 percent of female voters, according to exit polling by the Washington Post . (Though we ought to note that exit polling is preliminary, and therefore unreliable, data.)\n\nOnline, that gender divide emerged before the election. The Institute for Strategic Dialogue reports spotting a rise in misogynistic posts (including calls to repeal the 19th Amendment ) starting in October, apparently in response to the Harris campaign's focus on women voters and reproductive rights. The spread of the posts \"demonstrated the influence of an increasingly vindictive set of online actors, who appear to be using the election results as a permission structure to more overtly and aggressively espouse narratives about curbing women's rights,\" Frances-Wright and co-author Moustafa Ayad write in their report.\n\nA similar pattern emerged after Trump's first election in 2016, when civil rights groups and law enforcement agencies saw a spike in hate speech and attacks on women and people perceived to be Muslim or immigrants - all groups Trump explicitly or implicitly denigrated in his first campaign. The harassment even made its way into classrooms; a BuzzFeed analysis found more than 50 incidents of a student invoking Trump's name or message to attack a classmate during the 2016-'17 school year.\n\nThe fact that the attacks aren't new doesn't make them less scary for the people on the receiving end. \"It is very traumatic, particularly the younger that you are,\" Frances-Wright said. Implicit threats of rape can feel doubly frightening in a country where Trump just cruised to victory despite multiple allegations of sexual assault .\n\nSince the harassment people are experiencing today is part of a longstanding pattern, however, there's an existing playbook to counteract it.

In front of you are two nearly identical doors - you know that one leads to the exit, and you know that behind the other is a complete unknown. Which one would you choose?\n\nThis question was at the heart of an experiment that Vox Creative was asked to run on behalf of Volvo. Because Volvo believes that understanding human decision-making helps them make better cars for their drivers, they wanted to understand why some are so much more willing than others to embrace the unknown.\n\nWhile choosing the unknown certainly wasn't easy for many of the experiment's participants, a majority nevertheless made that choice - even those who might be expected to do otherwise, or who vocalized fear or uncertainty beforehand. The choice was each person's own to make.\n\nIn total, we recruited over 100 individuals and asked them - alone or in pairs - to enter a room and pick between two doors that represented either the complete unknown (Door 1) and the escape from having to face that unknown (Door 2). The latter led directly to the exit.\n\nPrior to our subjects entering the testing room, we worked to subtly ratchet up tension in ways approved by an expert consultant. For example, we had them sign a foreboding waiver, we prevented them from seeing or talking with any other participants that had run through the test, and we issued instructions just once via a recording that played over the room's speakers. After those instructions were issued, the participants were left alone and given as much time as they needed to make their decision.\n\nAfter their choice was made, we interviewed them to find out more about who they were and what was on their mind while they chose between the known and the unknown.\n\nParticipants heard this recording: \"In front of you are two doors. The only way you will know what's behind the door on the left is to go through it. Behind Door 2 is the exit. You can leave and go about your day.\"\n\nWhat we witnessed was a fairly overwhelming decision on the part of our participants in favor of Door 1 - about 77 percent of them went in the direction of the unknown. That number lines up with some studies that show that human beings are more likely to be optimistic . Other than that, though, the percentages revealed little. There were no strong predictors along demographic lines, whether it be gender, age, or income. Rather, every individual seemingly based their own choice on some complex interplay of probability assessment, emotion, and memory.\n\nAmong those that opted for the exit, one common thread was safety and security. For them, the unknown represented just one more risk in a world already full of them; commonly used words were \"scary,\" \"terrifying,\" and \"stressful.\" One participant who picked Door 2 later said, \"I feel like people who don't have to be as worried about safety in general and societal oppression - it's easier for them to take risks and make unsafe choices. I'd just rather take the safe route.\"\n\nBut the expressed desire for safety and security wasn't always controlling. Other participants spoke at length about their own struggles - and, indeed, fear - and yet still chose what was behind Door 1.\n\nThe participants who chose the unknown seemed to possess a slightly wider variety of reasons for doing so. Several cited the idea of adventure - the unknown to them was a chance to explore further, to gain skills, to push the limits of their knowledge, or sometimes even just to talk to new people.\n\n\"That's just the explorer in me. I just gotta know.\"\n\nBut for others - of sometimes surprisingly disparate backgrounds - the choice of the unknown represented a rejection of conformity. To them, the masses play it safe, making it imperative that they take the opposite route. One of the subjects said, \"I'm true to myself, which is in itself a risk in today's world. Because a lot of people tend to go with the flow of whatever's around them.\"\n\nThere were those who chose the experience of the unknown for the experience itself, and those who chose the unknown simply because sitting and thinking about safety only spawned new doubts and risks. And for everyone who expressed an almost philosophical depth when describing their choice, there were others who were much more practical: a missed meal and a looming dentist's appointment were other reasons we heard.\n\nWhen the time comes, which door will you choose? In the end, each participant made their own choice.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC. All Rights Reserved"

The minutes tick by. Your stomach begins to grumble. The waiter arrives. And you still don't know what to order?\n\nThat feeling is called \"choice overload .\" It's why we can't decide what to order for lunch when faced with too many options - and the same psychology applies to why we struggle to make major financial decisions. When it comes to finances, choice overload isn't just about the amount of choices but the complexity of those choices and the variables involved in each choice.\n\nTake home loans, for example: Choosing a lender is a crucial part of the homebuying process and one that will determine the amount of money that you'll spend over time. And yet many homebuyers fail to compare rates. With countless options to research - from lenders to loan programs to rates and fees - the mortgage process can easily become overwhelming and confusing for many. It may explain why almost 50 percent of homebuyers don't shop before applying for a mortgage, and more than 75 percent end up applying to only one lender.\n\nLendingTree's comparison shopping tools not only reduce the complexity of choice overload by showing you the top competitive rates but can also save you cash. With LendingTree, you can compare and shop offers within minutes. By using LendingTree to shop around for a mortgage, a buyer could potentially save an average of about $44,500 over the life of their loan.\n\nLearn how comparison shopping can help save you money down the homebuying road - the choice is yours.

      "text": "Ranked-choice voting faces its biggest test yet in New York City\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nNext Tuesday, New York City will vote to decide on whether to switch to a ranked-choice voting system.\n\nby Lee Drutman\n\nOn Tuesday, New York City residents will vote on whether to double the number of Americans who use a new system of voting - ranked-choice voting - to elect officials.\n\nTechnically, Ballot Question 1 amends the City Charter to \"Give voters the choice of ranking up to five candidates in primary and special elections for Mayor, Public Advocate, Comptroller, Borough President, and City Council beginning in January 2021.\"\n\nBut practically, it would be a tremendous lift for a growing electoral reform movement that includes Maine ; Sante Fe, New Mexico ; Oakland, California ; and Memphis, Tennessee . As the biggest city in the nation (population 8.6 million), New York City would add considerably to the users of ranked-choice voting.\n\nAs the name suggests, ranked-choice voting lets voters mark their first-choice candidate first, their second-choice candidate second, their third-choice candidate third, and so on. Each voter has only one vote but can indicate their backup choices: If one candidate has an outright majority of first-place rankings, that candidate wins, just like a traditional election.\n\nBut if no candidate has a majority in the first round, the candidate in last place is eliminated. Voters who had ranked that candidate first have their votes transferred to the candidate they ranked second. This process continues until a single candidate gathers a majority.\n\nMost expect New Yorkers to approve ranked-choice voting on Election Day. A wide range of groups and local leaders have endorsed the reform, and it has faced little opposition. New York City has often been on the forefront of good government reforms. Its small-donor campaign finance matching system was the first in the nation, and a model for the campaign finance proposal in HR 1 .\n\nSupporters argue that ranked-choice voting can reduce polarization and divisive campaigning by changing the incentives. Instead of just competing to be voters' first choice, candidates are also competing to be voters' second, third, and sometimes fourth choices, encouraging candidates to make wider appeals. Ranked-choice voting also tends to encourage a more diverse candidate pool, and leaves voters feeling happier about the process, both because their vote is more likely to matter and because they can vote for their favorite candidate without worrying about playing spoiler.\n\nVox is covering the results live, here .\n\nNew York City may become the most populous place in the US yet to adopt ranked-choice voting, but it's hardly a pioneer.\n\nTwenty cities in the United States have already adopted ranked-choice voting . In 2018, Maine became the first state to adopt it for federal elections. That catapulted the reform to a national spotlight, with presidential candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bennet now championing it . Australia has used ranked-choice voting for 101 years, and Ireland has used it for 98 years.\n\nStudies have shown that in places that have adopted it, ranked-choice voting has made politics a little less nasty . Candidates spent less time attacking each other, as compared to similar cities that didn't adopt ranked-choice voting. Voters in cities with the system reported being more satisfied with local campaigns as a result (again, as compared to similar cities).\n\nRanked-choice voting has also increased the share of racial minority, female, and female minority candidates running compared to similar cities. The scholars who have studied this most closely believe more minority candidates ran because under ranked-choice voting, such candidates could reach out to other communities where they might not be the natural first choice and ask for second-choice votes.\n\nThe researchers believe women were more likely to run because under traditional winner-take-all elections, \"women were deterred from running for office by ... negative campaigning.\" But with less negative campaigning and more cooperative campaigning, women are more likely to run. They're also more likely to win, scholar Sarah John and her colleagues concluded .\n\nUnder ranked-choice systems, voters don't have to try to figure out whether to support the candidate with the best chance of winning or the candidate they like best but fear can't win. They can vote sincerely for their favorite candidate on their first choice, and then select back-up choices if their preferred candidates don't do well. This also allows voters to express their full range of preferences, sending clearer signals than the traditional approach to voting. And in the end, more voters are likely to wind up voting for a winner. Voters prefer this kind of \"preferential\" voting because they consider it fairer .\n\nNo voting system is perfect. Critics of ranked-choice say the task of having to rank multiple candidates unfairly overwhelms low-information voters, and that the added complexity hits low-income minorities hardest. The editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle last year called the process - in place for more than 15 years - \"a baffling experience for many voters,\" and decried a plan by two San Francisco mayoral candidates to defeat another, London Breed, by \"gaming\" the ranked-choice system.\n\nHowever, surveys have shown no difference in understanding of ranked-choice voting between white and nonwhite voters, and more than 90 percent of voters who have used the system describe it as simple. Some studies show turnout declines among minority voters. But most likely, when properly accounting for other factors, turnout has probably remained stable, with no declines in poorer precincts.\n\nWhile some cities with ranked-choice voting have used it to combine primary and general elections or general and run-off elections (saving taxpayers money), New York City would be unusual in applying ranked-choice voting only to the primary election and not to the general election.\n\nHowever, in a heavily Democratic city like New York City, the deciding election is often the Democratic primary. Because of this, the primary often generates a crowded field, which means that a candidate can win with a mere plurality - not a majority - of votes under the current rules.\n\nAccording to one analysis, in the last three election cycles, almost two-thirds of multi-candidate city primary contests (64 percent) did not generate a majority winner. And in almost a third of those elections (30 percent), the winning candidate got less than 40 percent of the vote. In other words, under the current rules, candidates preferred by far less than half of their constituents get to represent all of their constituents.\n\nUnder ranked-choice voting, outcomes like this can't happen. The winning candidate needs to earn true majority support - a plurality does not make a victory. And if no candidate gets a majority of first-preference votes, that's when the rankings kick in, and candidates are eliminated and their preferences redistributed until one candidate has a winning majority. This ensures that candidates need to build broad appeal. A candidate who doubles down on an intense but ultimately narrow group of supporters cannot win.\n\nIf New York City adopts ranked-choice voting, it will join Eastpointe, Michigan , a Detroit suburb, as a fellow 2019 adoptee. Eastpointe agreed to switch to ranked-choice voting in June as a remedy for Voting Rights Act violations. The Department of Justice approved the new voting system as a way to help the city's minority voters better elect their candidates of choice. According to the American Community Survey , the white population of Eastpointe is 48 percent, and the black population is 46 percent. Yet it wasn't until 2017 that the city elected its first black city council member, Monique Owens . This year, she was elected the city's first black mayor .\n\nThere's more to come. 2020 is shaping up to be a big year for ranked-choice voting. Four states will use it in the Democratic primary - Alaska , Hawaii, Kansas , and Wyoming . And Maine voters will use it for the first time in the general election for president . And both Alaska and Massachusetts will likely vote on ballot measures in 2020 to adopt ranked-choice voting statewide.\n\nSo ranked-choice voting is catching on . If New Yorkers vote themselves into the ranks, it will be yet another sign of the movement's momentum - and a growing desire among Americans to improve our political institutions.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this piece stated that the white population of Eastpointe, Michigan was 42 percent. According to the American Community Survey , it is actually 48 percent.

Yet despite the ongoing culture wars schools have faced in recent years, pollsters find that parents still generally like their kids' schools , and most of the political opposition has come from those without kids in the public school system.\n\nCara Fitzpatrick , a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and editor at Chalkbeat, is the author of The Death of Public School: How Conservatives Won the War Over Education in America , a book coming out next week that traces the history of the fight to define what \"public education\" means and who gets to decide. She lays out in clarifying detail the patient strategy conservatives embraced to expand their vision for schooling in America, establishing small school choice programs and then using those experiments to push the boundaries of state and federal law.\n\nSenior policy reporter Rachel Cohen talked with Fitzpatrick about the trajectory of school vouchers as an idea and the future of public schooling in the US. Their conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYou can also listen to Fitzpatrick's conversation on a recent episode of The Weeds , Vox's policy podcast.\n\nYour book does a very good job of showing how the boundaries between church and state have eroded over the last few decades, and why the legal arguments for private school vouchers have gotten stronger as a result. I think many readers will be surprised to learn all of this, so emphatically have we been taught that there's a separation between religion and public institutions.\n\nWhen I started doing the research, I thought there was going to be this very clear line between church and state, but the legal history was murkier, which is why then we've seen this progression of cases more recently leaning more toward the religious liberty side of things. One of the questions I often get asked is, \"Well, how can you give money to a religious school?\" And it's like, \"Here's 40, 50, 70 years of case law that kind of explains it.\" But if you're not following all those cases, most people find that to be pretty confusing.\n\nYeah, there's always been a small legal window, and over time conservatives have cleaved that open wider. But we had basically been taught in schools that it was a firm, unchanging boundary.\n\nAnd there have been justices on the Supreme Court who have spoken to the fact that it's just this tricky area of law, and has been tricky for a long time. And then watching where the Court has gone recently with the Establishment Clause has been kind of wild, actually, because it's pretty far from where they were when some of these early school voucher cases were litigated. I think it's gone even farther than school choice advocates thought it would.\n\nWhere would you say things are today?\n\nI think it's pretty clear that the Supreme Court's conservative majority has been ruling in favor of religious liberty - not just in school choice cases but in a variety of cases - and I think the window is open for it to go even further than it has. I mean, I'm really interested in where it's going to go with the religious charter school issue that's coming out of Oklahoma. I don't want to predict how that will go, but I think it seems like there's definitely some room to believe that the conservative majority might eventually sign off on that.\n\nPrivate school vouchers have been picking up steam lately , making political gains in recent years. What were some of the most surprising things you learned about the history of school vouchers, and what, if anything, about that history feels important to understanding the programs we're seeing today?\n\nOne of the things that was interesting for me to grapple with was that in the 1950s and '60s, segregationists in the South essentially used the idea of school vouchers to thwart Brown v. Board of Education. But then in the 1990s and 2000s, school choice advocates argued this was a civil rights issue. So I've been trying to sort out and make connections between those two eras.\n\nOne of the main figures in the book is Polly Williams, who was a Black state representative in Wisconsin who very much viewed vouchers as a tool of empowerment for low-income kids, and particularly low-income kids of color. Her involvement in that issue was really fascinating and kind of linked those two periods in a way. Williams had fears that vouchers would become sort of what they've become today: subsidies for everyone, regardless of income.\n\nI think one of the things I really wanted to do with the book was not take a hard and fast position on school choice or on school vouchers, but give someone who might come across a headline about universal school vouchers a way to understand how we got here.\n\nThe title of your book is The Death of Public School: How Conservatives Won the War Over Education in America. I hear you on not wanting to take a clear position on vouchers or choice, but I think conservatives may argue it's simply a new era of public school, not the death of it. I wanted to invite you to talk more about your title.\n\nI think the title and subtitle will please no one. But for me, I think it raises that question, right? Does this spell the end for the public school system? That's something that I had to grapple with throughout because, even just a few years ago, it was very much a talking point from school choice advocates that choice can help drive improvements to traditional public schools. But then in the last couple of years we've seen some pretty aggressive attacks on public education by Republicans and the rhetoric has definitely become more extreme, referring to schools as \"government indoctrination camps\" and things like that. A few prominent conservative school choice advocates have pretty openly said we should really use these school culture wars to push the movement forward.\n\nBased on your research, do you see any sort of path for the more liberal, progressive vision of public education to mount a comeback? Is there any sort of competing strategy in the courts or politics?\n\nIt's hard to predict. The book is landing - just coincidentally - at this moment in time when school choice is dominating the news cycle and \"parental rights\" are all over the place. But even just a few years ago, I remember in 2017 a couple people saying to me, \"Well, aren't school vouchers dead?\"\n\nEducation can really change in a short period of time. It does feel to me like Milton Friedman's side of the debate on the free-market vision for vouchers has really eclipsed what Polly Williams and some of the more progressive voices were about. But I think some of this may depend on how the new choice programs actually play out, including whether people take states up on these universal voucher programs.\n\nIs the lesson here to just stick with a political goal for 50 or 60 years and then eventually you might win?\n\nMaybe! It is really fascinating: On vouchers, conservatives have played the long game and it seems to have worked out pretty well for them.\n\nThere's often this debate over whether charters or vouchers or tax credit scholarships result in better academic outcomes for students, either through competition or simply by injecting the power of \"privateness\" into the equation. Did your book lead you to any conclusions or clarity on those questions?\n\nI think there's a pretty solid amount of research at this point - not about universal vouchers, since that's still kind of new and uncharted territory - but on some of these voucher programs that have existed for a long time. And what researchers have found is that the programs haven't lived up to the promise of what the early advocates wanted or assumed would happen. I think there was this belief that private schools were just sort of inherently better than public schools, so if you just got more kids in private then all those kids would do better. A lot of the major research studies have shown either the same results for test scores between public and private, or actually a decline in private. And then there's been a little bit of research on some other life outcomes that have been positive, like showing kids in some of these voucher programs are more likely to graduate .\n\nThere are a lot of studies out there, some far less rigorous than others, and I think wading through all that can be a little intimidating. What I believe and I wanted the book to show is that this debate in America is really more about values than about outcomes.\n\nWe're in a moment when the conservative legal movement is at its strongest on school choice and teacher unions are in a very weakened position. Can you talk about the role you saw unions play in accelerating or slowing down these policies? How much do you think it matters today that unions are in a less powerful position?\n\nUnions were typically opponents of school choice programs, but I didn't get into the role of specific union leaders in the book with the exception of [former American Federation of Teachers president] Albert Shanker, since he was sort of outside the mold of what a lot of union leaders were saying. But I didn't see unions' opposition making a huge difference for the most part. Mostly they become convenient scapegoats in the partisan conversations.\n\nWith teacher unions, what's interesting is that a lot of their fears about where the programs would go seem to have come true. Unions warned from the start that this was not in fact going to be just a little experiment, that these programs are not going to be just limited to disadvantaged students, and now we are seeing these universal programs pass.\n\nUnions have played pivotal roles in different places and in moments of time in blocking or slowing school choice , but ultimately I don't think that they were necessarily going to stop all of this. They stopped some of it. A lot of voucher proposals failed. It's just that enough of them passed to have this toehold over time.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "The hidden politics of New York City's new ranked-choice voting system\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nReformers hope it can transform campaigns. Are they right?\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nWhat if I told you that instead of voting for just one candidate in the next election, you could vote for several - ranking them in order of your preference?\n\nRegistered Democratic voters in New York City are getting that opportunity. Their mayoral primary on June 22 will be the city's first to use ranked-choice voting - and that race will be the biggest spotlight yet for this system in the United States.\n\nRanked choice is the reform of wonky activists' dreams. They believe that more traditional elections, where whoever gets the most votes is simply the winner, can go wrong when there are multiple candidates, as someone most voters oppose can win due to the split of the vote. One famous example is Ralph Nader being the third-party \"spoiler,\" apparently drawing votes away from Al Gore and tipping key states to George W. Bush in 2000.\n\nRanked choice can, in theory, avert this outcome, because it asks voters to rank candidates in order of their preference. As votes are counted, the lower-performing candidates are gradually eliminated, and votes for them are redirected to those voters' backup choices. (In the 2000 example, when Nader gets eliminated, ballots that ranked Nader as first choice and Gore as second turn into votes for Gore, increasing his total.)\n\nRanked-choice voting is still pretty rare in the US, but it's getting less so. Several cities (most notably San Francisco, Oakland, Minneapolis, and St. Paul) have used it for over a decade. Maine adopted it for federal races in 2018, and Alaska will try its own version of the system next year. And with New York, it's arrived at the country's most populous city.\n\nSupporters of the new system hope it will have even more dramatic benefits - indeed, that it will help cure much of what they think ails American politics. They argue that ranked choice's incentives could lead to less negative campaigning and polarization. And many of them hope it will help new ideas and types of candidates, which had been previously blocked by the two-party system and party establishments, to thrive.\n\n\"Fundamentally, what a ranked-choice ballot as we propose it does is give a voter a backup to their first choice,\" says Rob Richie, president and CEO of FairVote, the nonprofit group that has done more than any other to evangelize for ranked choice across the country. \"From that, it creates really positive incentives for how candidates act and how voters act.\"\n\nBut not everyone has been thrilled about New York's new system. Several Black members of New York's City Council unsuccessfully sued to try and block it last year. \"Some progressive white folks got together in a room and thought this would be good, but it's not good for our community,\" Hazel Dukes, the president of the NAACP's New York state chapter, said at the time .\n\nAs ranked choice has slowly caught on in more places across the country, questions about complexity and equity have dogged its proponents. Are its advantages worth the drawbacks? And how does it actually play out with actual voters in the real world?\n\nThe \"plurality winner\" system used in most US elections - where the candidate with the highest number of votes wins, even if they're short of a majority - can get weird in contests with multiple candidates.\n\nThe very conservative Republican Paul LePage won Maine's governorship in 2010 with 37.6 percent of the vote, while a moderate independent got 35.9 percent and the Democratic nominee got 18.8 percent. More Democrats surely would have preferred the independent to LePage, but they couldn't coordinate behind him. Another version of this phenomenon is the \"spoiler,\" where a third-party candidate apparently draws votes mainly from one major contender and tips the outcome to the other, as arguably seen with Nader and Gore in 2000.\n\nThese are examples where Democrats felt robbed, but it can happen to any party or faction. Republicans blamed Ross Perot's candidacy for electing Bill Clinton in 1992. In party primaries, sometimes multiple establishment candidates split the vote and let a reformist or ideologue win, and sometimes it's the other way around.\n\nThe outcome can seem kind of arbitrary: It hinges on just how the vote happens to split, and who happens to end up with the biggest slice of the pie, rather than what a majority of voters want.\n\nEnter ranked-choice voting, which is supposed to let voters more effectively express their \"backup\" preferences. In theory, this produces something closer to a consensus choice. It differs in key ways from the elections Americans are most familiar with.\n\nThe voting: In typical US elections, for each office on the ballot, a voter just picks one candidate. But in a ranked-choice election, they get to pick several, marking one candidate as their first choice, another as their second choice, and so on. The number of ranking slots for each race varies by jurisdiction, but in New York City there are five.\n\nThe counting: The real action happens when the votes are counted. If no candidate wins a majority in the initial tally, the reallocation rounds begin, and lower-performing candidates are eliminated one by one, reality show style:\n\nThe strategy: One key to understanding this system is that you cannot hurt your first-choice candidate by ranking others below them. Your backup rankings will only matter if your first-choice candidate is eliminated from contention (due to getting low support from others). One argument is that you should figure out your true first choice - the person you genuinely want to win, strategic considerations aside - and rank them first. (Though for an example of how even that could go awry, check out this New York Times article on the \"Alaska dilemma.\")\n\nFrom there, it gets even trickier. In New York City, there are 13 candidates on the ballot. Eight of them are generally viewed as credible - Eric Adams, Kathryn Garcia, Andrew Yang, Maya Wiley, Scott Stringer, Dianne Morales, Shaun Donovan, and Ray McGuire. But voters are only permitted to rank five.\n\nThis means voters could well use all five of their rankings on candidates who get eliminated. For example, it's plausible that, after reallocation, the race will come down to Adams versus Yang. If your ranked picks were Garcia, Wiley, Stringer, Morales, and Donovan, your ballot will become \"exhausted\" and play no role in the final round.\n\nSo if you do want to affect the final outcome, you should try to think about who the race is likely to come down to. Perhaps you dislike both Adams and Yang, but if you would prefer one over the other, it might be smart to rank your preference fifth.\n\nAnother complication, though, is that the race may not come down to Adams versus Yang - other polls have shown Adams versus Garcia and Adams versus Wiley as the final matchup, and it's also possible polls will be off and we'll get a surprise. If you want to maximize your chances of affecting the outcome, you should probably include at least three of the Adams-Wiley-Garcia-Yang quartet in your rankings. But that might come at the cost of leaving off some lower-profile candidates you genuinely like. It's a trade-off.\n\nHow it really plays out: In recent decades, there have been 236 ranked-choice elections in the US with single winners and at least three candidates running. FairVote has assembled data on how these races turn out. In about 94 percent of these elections, the candidate leading in first-choice preferences ended up winning.\n\nSo despite all the drama about backup choices and reallocation, the outcome is usually the same as in a plurality winner system.\n\nRanked-choice fans, though, would argue the exceptions are the point. Perhaps most of the time, the plurality leader really is acceptable to the majority. But when they're not, ranked choice lets the plurality leader be unseated - usually by whoever's in second place during round one.\n\nJared Golden (D) defeated a Republican incumbent US House member in Maine in 2018 in a ranked-choice election only after voters for independent candidates were reallocated. Jean Quan (D) won Oakland's mayoral race in 2010 by defeating a controversial incumbent who led in the first round, because the anti-incumbent voters consolidated around her during reallocation.\n\nAll kinds of political players can back ranked choice if they view it as in their interests (like mainstream Maine Democrats, who blamed the plurality system for LePage's governor win). But it's an odd combination of moderate centrists and establishment-skeptical progressives who tend to be true believers in the system.\n\nThese groups, despite ideological differences, have some things in common. Both share a deep-seated belief that the public is really on their side and would vote accordingly were it not for distorting influences. Both believe that, if people were freed up to vote for their \"true\" first choice (without worrying about who could win or \"wasting\" a vote), candidates with their views would thrive.\n\nFairVote has built deep ties with progressive reformers, but for over a decade, its board chair was John Anderson, a former Republican member of Congress who ran for president in 1980 as an independent candidate challenging Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan; a more recent leading donor to FairVote and to ranked-choice campaigns across the country has been John Arnold, an idiosyncratic Texas billionaire who has voiced frustration with the two parties and said both of them should moderate . FairVote and Arnold backed a particular ranked-choice ballot initiative in Alaska that passed and could help Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) defeat a conservative challenger next year (though there are questions about whether it would, in practice).\n\nBut it's not just moderates. Green Party leaders Howie Hawkins and Jill Stein are also fans, as are \"Squad\" members Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Progressives with an interest in government reform also like it - Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) is a former board member of FairVote, and the liberal nonprofit stalwart Common Cause has been a key supporter.\n\n\"We're asking people to fundamentally shift and change the way they've voted their entire lives, in a very short period of time, with very little education, in the wake of a global pandemic\" -Christina Greer\n\nRevealingly, in cities where ranked choice has been implemented, the most enthusiastic backers have often been progressives who have tense relations with the Democratic establishment or \"machine.\" Many of these cities already had a way of dealing with the plurality winner issue for a crowded contest: a runoff, where the top two candidates from the initial round face off at a later date. The winner of a two-candidate race by definition has a majority of the vote.\n\nYet ranked choice's most enthusiastic backers in cities hated those runoffs. They pointed out that turnout usually dropped between the initial election and the runoff, claiming that made the winner less representative. They also complained holding another election was expensive and inconvenient for voters who had to turn out at the polls again.\n\nFor many critics, though, the real issue may have been that they didn't like the runoffs' typical outcomes: Establishment candidates tended to beat reformers or outsiders. \"Big money would really spend bigger in runoffs. It's easier to negatively blast one of the two candidates in runoffs,\" Richie said. \"It's easier to control.\" Supporters hope ranked choice will be tougher for these interests to game. (The counterargument is that these establishment forces are only getting their way by, well, persuading more people to vote for them.)\n\nReformers also hope ranked choice will make campaigns more pleasant overall. The idea here is that every candidate is going to want to be listed as the second or third choice from voters who don't already support them, so they'll be less likely to alienate those voters. This, reformers hope, will disincentivize negative campaigning (though it won't eliminate it entirely).\n\nMany objections to ranked-choice voting are situational. Republicans generally dislike the system, due to either instinctive conservatism or a belief that general election vote splits generally tended to help them. (Still, the Virginia GOP implemented the system at its convention this year in an effort to prevent an extreme Trump superfan from winning the governor's nomination.) Democratic establishment forces in cities feared ranked choice would disadvantage them compared to the runoff system: Gavin Newsom voted against ranked-choice voting while he was on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, and as governor he vetoed a bill that would have allowed it in more California cities.\n\nBut there are more principled objections as well. I'm a weirdo who loves complexity and making ordered lists of things. Not everyone is like me, though, and the task of ranking multiple candidates in a crowded field may make voting seem more daunting. The added element of gaming out who the final two candidates are likely to be, to ensure you use one of your limited ranking slots on at least one of them, can also be challenging in a complex race.\n\nRelatedly, many fear that less privileged voters - voters who don't speak English, who are lower-income, or who are less educated - will have more difficulty with the new system, if they haven't been sufficiently informed about how to use it. Perhaps they may be more likely to have their ballots thrown out due to improper rankings. Or perhaps they may be less likely to use all their ranking slots, making their ballots disproportionately likely to be discarded in a later round.\n\n\"We're asking people to fundamentally shift and change the way they've voted their entire lives, in a very short period of time, with very little education, in the wake of a global pandemic,\" says Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham University.\n\nMayoral candidate Eric Adams had his own self-interested reasons to oppose ranked choice - he feared it would hurt him - but he made this argument last year , saying, \"Voting can't be for the astute, the technically astute people. It must be for everyone, and we're not ready right now.\"\n\nAnother critique holds that ranked choice can fall short of its promise of producing a winner with majority support among voters, because of \"ballot exhaustion.\" During the various reallocations and rounds of a ranked-choice count, there's a drop-off in the overall number of ballots still being counted. Partly this is because voters have limited ranking slots, and all their ranked picks could get eliminated. Other voters don't even use all their slots in the first place, listing no backup candidates, so their ballot is exhausted when their first choice is out.\n\nThis happens frequently. Of the 128 US ranked-choice elections that have proceeded to at least a second round of counting, only 64 ended up producing a winner with a majority of the voters who turned out, per FairVote .\n\nIn the San Francisco mayoral election of 2018 , for instance, there were 251,032 votes counted in the first round; in the final and decisive ninth round of counting, only 229,408 votes remained. This was a drop-off of 21,624 votes, or 8.6 percent of the total, and because of it, the narrow winner, London Breed, did not end up getting a majority of votes cast.\n\nRanked choice is more successful at producing majority winners than the simple \"plurality winner\" system. But ballot exhaustion rates raise questions about whether it's really better at it than a runoff. Supporters argue that the problem was that, in many of these elections, voters only had three ranking slots, so ballots were exhausted more easily as all three were eliminated. But adding more ranking slots means foisting more complexity on voters.\n\nSome real voting systems nerds have a different critique. They say that, compared to alternatives such as \" Condorcet voting ,\" ranked choice doesn't do enough to help the consensus \"backup\" choice. The complaint here is basically that the one-by-one candidate elimination in the count can end up eliminating most voters' second choice, if that candidate doesn't have enough first-choice votes. (This doesn't seem to happen very often , but it did happen in Burlington Vermont's 2009 mayoral race , and it could happen in Alaska's Senate race next year.)\n\nFinally, some simply don't agree with the reformers' view that \"party establishment\" and \"negative campaigning\" should be dirty words. Reformers \"who believe politics is the problem often don't end up thinking about how parties help voters,\" says Jason McDaniel, a political science professor at San Francisco State University.\n\nThere's a school of thought among political scientists that negative campaigning can actually be useful and helpful to voters, because it at least can be more substantive than hazy, image-burnishing positive ads. Ranked choice, in contrast, might incentivize a sort of inoffensive lowest common denominator campaign, rather than a bold one. (Though you do have to stand out to some extent to avoid getting eliminated.)\n\nParty endorsements and campaigns can also help simplify choices for voters who trust the party. And runoffs have their virtues - they concentrate the mind, bringing clarity to a crowded field, by offering a binary choice, rather than tasking voters with researching and forming opinions on multiple little-known candidates, as they will in a ranked-choice election.\n\nWith a decade or more of experience with ranked choice in some jurisdictions, the sky generally has not fallen, but politics hasn't been fundamentally transformed either. Voters adapted - and so did the parties.\n\nThe theory that ranked choice gives progressives a marginal boost in primaries in liberal cities seems plausible, but the system certainly hasn't shattered establishment power. The task of negative campaigning may have been effectively outsourced to independent groups rather than the candidates themselves.\n\nSome studies say ranked choice may have resulted in somewhat more minorities and women winning, versus comparable cities that didn't use ranked choice. But it's too early to say for sure: Ultimately, we're mainly talking about a handful of high-profile mayoral races and dozens of lower-profile city races so far. Evidence on turnout is mixed , but it doesn't seem that ranked choice makes turnout fall off a cliff.\n\nOverall, despite ranked choice's impressive spread in recent years, Richie, FairVote's president, is still looking down the road. The group was initially called Citizens for Proportional Representation (CPR, for \"resuscitating democracy\"), in the hopes that proportional election results would lead to a multi-party system. But Richie told me that moving to a proportional system was too heavy a lift for the time being.\n\n\"I and the people that got the organization going were visionary but pragmatic at the same time,\" Richie said. \"The country's ready for ranked-choice voting. It is, we believe, an important step toward a conversation about proportional voting.\"\n\nThe real reform he's long thought the US needs, though, is multi-member districts. This would allow for proportional ranked-choice voting - where seats are split up according to how the vote breaks down.\n\nBut that's a reform for another day.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

      "text": "Elizabeth Warren leads Joe Biden in ranked-choice poll\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe YouGov/FairVote poll let national Democratic voters rank several of their top candidates rather than picking just one.\n\nby Andrew Prokop and Christina Animashaun\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead the crowded Democratic field - but under a \"ranked-choice\" system designed to suss out the majority's ultimate preference, Sen. Elizabeth Warren would top Biden, 53 percent to 47 percent, according to a new poll exclusively provided in advance to Vox.\n\nThe online national poll of likely Democratic voters was conducted by YouGov, and sponsored by FairVote , a nonpartisan advocacy group supporting electoral reform. Unlike an ordinary poll, it asked respondents to rank several candidates in order of preference - so as to simulate ranked-choice voting , a system currently used in Maine and other localities . (FairVote advocates in favor of the system and hopes it will be adopted elsewhere in the US as well.)\n\nThe way ranked-choice voting works is that candidates with fewer votes are eliminated, and then their votes are redistributed to whomever each voter designated as their next-ranked preference. For instance, a voter could rank Sen. Bernie Sanders as their first choice and Warren as their second choice - meaning that, if Sanders was eliminated, this vote would be transferred to Warren.\n\nYouGov tested the ranked choice methodology offering all 20 remaining Democratic candidates as options (with the ability to rank 10 of them) - and also by just offering the current top five candidates (Biden, Warren, Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg) as options. The end results were quite similar for both versions, so this article will focus on the five-candidate version for simplicity's sake. (The more extensive results for both versions are available at FairVote's website .)\n\nIn an initial tally counting only voters' top-ranked choices, Biden leads the Democratic field with 33 percent, and is followed by Warren with 29 percent, Sanders with 20 percent, Harris with 10 percent, and Buttigieg with 8 percent, per the poll.\n\nBut it turns out that respondents who initially favored Sanders and Harris prefer Warren over Biden, by about a two-to-one ratio. So once the field is narrowed to a head-to-head matchup of just Biden and Warren, and votes for the eliminated candidates are to whomever each voter ranked higher, Warren would lead Biden by 6 points.\n\nThe results are an interesting indication of how an outcome can change due to a different tallying system. But they could also be indicative of something bigger.\n\nThough voters theoretically can choose among many of candidates, we are still months away from a day when primary voters will cast votes. So how voters rank their options in a smaller field could tell us a lot about what the race might look like in the future, and what might happen were the field to winnow further. These results, at least, suggest that Warren would benefit more than Biden would.\n\nTo the uninitiated, ranked-choice voting (sometimes called \"instant runoff voting,\" or IRV) might seem like a confusing and convoluted system. Our respondents were asked to rank Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, Sanders, and Warren by preference - from first choice, to second, to third, to fourth, to fifth. (If they wouldn't vote for some of these candidates at all, they could notate that as well.) The graphic below walks through the tally.\n\nA quick note here: The actual counts of voters are rounded from a weighted sample - they're being presented here to help simulate how the tally would work in a real election, based on these poll results.\n\nIf the topline results of this poll were the results in a typical American election, Biden would just win outright - he got the most first-choice votes in that first tally. But he only has slightly more than a third of the vote among five candidates.\n\nNow, if it was a typical Democratic presidential primary election, it wouldn't be so simple. That's because rather than declaring one winner, Democrats allot delegates proportionally to all candidates who get 15 percent of the vote in each primary or caucus. Those delegates go on to cast ballots at the convention.\n\nRanked-choice can inform a system like that, too. You could cut off the tally once there are only candidates who have 15 percent of the vote or more - to ensure that no votes are \"wasted\" on candidates who didn't meet the threshold. In our example above, things would wrap up at the third tally (showing Biden with 39 percent, Warren with 38 percent, and Sanders with 23 percent).\n\nHowever, at DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee meetings this summer, several members expressed skepticism about whether ranked-choice voting could or should be incorporated into the primary contest given the party's current rules. And Maine, the state that has most embraced the system, will only use it in the general election next year rather than the presidential primary.\n\nThe goal with ranked-choice in general is to ensure the winner is at least in some sense the choice of a majority of the electorate - and that voters who cast ballots for candidates other than the top contenders won't just see their votes thrown away.\n\nImagine an election with just three candidates. Candidate A gets 35 percent of the vote, Candidate B gets 33 percent, and Candidate C gets 32 percent. In the most common American voting system (\"first-past-the-post\"), that Candidate A would just win. But 65 percent of the voters didn't vote for him - in fact, they might utterly despise him, and have badly wanted him to lose, but been divided between the other two options.\n\nRanked-choice would avert that outcome: Candidate C would be eliminated, and their supporters would be redistributed to their next-ranked pick. Another benefit is that, under ranked-choice, voters are free to pick an unconventional or underdog candidate as their first choice, without worrying about their vote being \"thrown away.\"\n\nOf course, there are critiques of ranked-choice voting as well. Simon Waxman has argued that, in practice, the system can be confusing or exhausting - and that the promised majority support doesn't always materialize, because voters don't rank enough candidates. (In this YouGov poll, 85 percent of respondents ranked all five candidates - but of course, that also means 15 percent did not.)\n\nOthers argue for alternative systems designed to find a \"Condorcet winner\" - that is, whoever would win a head-to-head race against every other candidate. (It's at least possible that such a candidate would have little first-choice support and be eliminated quickly under ranked-choice.)\n\nWhatever you think about which voting system is best, for a deeper dive into this poll data, you can head over to FairVote's website - they have interactive graphics for both the five-candidate result this article discusses, and a separate result in which all 20 candidates were offered as options.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "'The Choice' Movie Review\n\nThe Nicholas Sparks film might be better suited to TV.\n\n&#151; -- Starring Benjamin Walker. Teresa Palmer and Tom Wilkinson\n\nRated PG-13\n\nTwo-and-a-half out of five stars\n\nIf you have a choice, wait for it to come to cable.\n\n\"The Choice\" is the eleventh love story from Nicholas Sparks to hit the big screen. They're the perfect thing to pair with Valentine's Day: both have the potential to be magical, but you've learned not to expect much out of either so as not to be disappointed. \"The Choice\" fits right into that mold.\n\nIt's not terrible, but it's not great either. Benjamin Walker (\"In the Heart of the Sea,\" \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\") stars as handsome Southern veterinarian Travis Parker, an easygoing guy who likes to fish and hang out with his dog. Teresa Palmer (\"Warm Bodies,\" \"Point Break\") is Gabby Holland, the tightly wound medical student who moves in next door. From the first five minutes of the movie we know they're going to get together. It's just a matter of how they get there.\n\nThere are obstacles, of course: courtship, and - naturally, for this genre -- a coma. That's not a spoiler, by the way, it's all in the trailer. Way too much is in the trailer.\n\nWalker is charming and likeable, with his slow Southern charm. And Tom Wilkinson, who plays his dad, is a welcome addition to almost any movie.\n\nAs for Palmer, that's one of the movie's problems. Her character is rather abrasive, which is compounded by Palmer's occasional enthusiastic but unnatural overacting. And her accent (she's supposed to be from South Carolina) goes in and out like waves on the shore - I picked up right away that she wasn't American, which is fine, but she has enough trouble trying to hide her Australian accent under a flat American accent. Adding a Southern drawl to the mix is only asking for trouble. I'm by no means saying she's a bad actress - she's not. But this role isn't exactly suited to her talents.\n\nAs for the accent thing, she's not alone. Tom Wilkinson, who's British but here is supposed to be a native North Carolinian, makes almost zero attempt to sound like his Southern son. Maybe accents get thicker with each generation? Who knows, but it's hard to get lost in the story when you're spending the whole time wondering where the actors are from. Walker is from Georgia, by the way, which is why he gets a pass.\n\nOne thing \"The Choice\" does have going for it is its setting. I may not have loved the movie, but I loved where it takes place. The waters of North Carolina, the houses with the docks and the rolling green lawns, the afternoons spent in the sun overlooking a dock while the dogs eat fish guts out of a pail -- that's all good stuff.\n\nAlso good are the dogs. Kudos to whomever decided to give so much screen time to the adorable St. Bernard, Golden Retriever, and a couple of puppies. I'd like to have seen more of that love story.\n\n\"The Choice\" is highly predictable, often cheesy, and emotionally manipulative...and even so, you still might shed a tear. A colleague of mine admitted she didn't like it, but still cried a bit at the end. Should you rush out to see it in theaters? No need. But if it comes on cable one night while you're snuggling with your honey, you've probably watched worse.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "School choice programs divide Republicans as Trump moves to eliminate Department of Education\n\nTennessee lawmaker Todd Warner doesn't want to see public schools lose money.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to reduce the Department of Education to its essential functions . The directive tells what's left of the agency to prioritize sending money to school choice programs across America.\n\nThese programs -- which are also referred to as school vouchers and school freedom -- allow parents to take tax dollars allocated for their children to attend public schools and, in most cases, use that money to send them to private schools.\n\nThe argument supporting this movement is that private schools often provide a better education for children.\n\nIn Tennessee, where supporters of the programs refer to them as scholarships, State House Rep. Todd Warner is a proud product of rural public schools. He's a self-described \"die-hard Republican,\" but told ABC News that he believes what some conservatives are currently trying to do to education is wrong.\n\n\"Public schools are the backbone of the community,\" Warner said. \"On Friday nights, Friday night lights, the football game. It's where everybody comes together. It's where we tailgate and see each other's family before the game. It's where we cheer each other's children on.\"\n\nFor the past four years at the Tennessee Statehouse, Warner represented what he refers to as \"country folk\" from counties so red that Confederate flags continue to fly over a few homes and monuments.\n\n\"I'm in favor of reducing the Department of Education on the federal level,\" Warner said. \"I would love to see President Trump send more money back to the states. I'm good with that, but I don't want to see that go to the private sector. I want to see it help our public schools.\"\n\nBut in February, Gov. Bill Lee signed Tennessee's universal school choice program into law . It joined at least 29 states that allow some form of school vouchers, including about 15 states that do not consider parental wealth.\n\nWarner is currently working to limit the number of vouchers in Tennessee.\n\nHe may have a life size Trump cutout in his office and hang his red hat on the wall above a dead buck, but Warner told ABC News that he doesn't mind being called a sellout in Nashville because he knows that at home in the district he represents south of the city, his constituents know that isn't who he is.\n\n\"You know, the best memories in life that I have,\" Warner said. \"Some of them are in the public school, in high school, you know, with those teachers, with those coaches. And it's that way in a lot of rural Tennessee. I mean, it's the public school or it's nothing.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Where Harris, Trump stand on school choice, voucher programs\n\nEducational Savings Accounts are increasing nationwide but are a divisive topic.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have proposed vastly different policies on education - and one key difference highlights a battle that has been happening on the ground in states across the country.\n\nEducation Savings Accounts, or ESAs, and school vouchers have spurred debates at the local level for years.\n\nESA programs allow families to divert a designated amount of per-student public school spending to pay for expenses for private schools, microschools and homeschooling -- including tuition, books, tutoring, transportation and more.\n\nSchool vouchers similarly use public funds to allow students to pay for tuition.\n\nArizona passed the country's first ESA program in 2011, and at least eight other states have followed its lead: Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah and West Virginia.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has expressed support for ESAs and has proposed a plan that will allow parents to spend up to $10,000 a year per child in taxpayer money, \"completely tax-free,\" on alternative education or homeschooling costs.\n\nThe Democratic 2025 platform opposes using private school vouchers and tuition tax credits, opportunity scholarships, \"and other schemes that divert taxpayer-funded resources away from public education.\"\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former public school teacher who is running for vice president on Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential ticket, has opposed private school vouchers in the past.\n\nIn opposition to a school voucher policy proposal from Republicans in his state amid the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, Walz stated: \"We are not going to defund our public schools at this time, when especially those hardest hit need them more than ever,\" MPR News reported at the time.\n\nScholars trace the origins of school choice to the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, where the United States Supreme Court ruled that segregating public school students based on race was unconstitutional.\n\nAnti-segregation efforts led to state-funded school voucher programs in some states like Virginia and Georgia, offering financial assistance to white students to attend all-white private academies known as segregation academies.\n\nHowever, the first modern private school voucher program started in Milwaukee in 1990, as some communities of color saw vouchers as a chance to help low-income students of color attend private schools.\n\nVouchers also have been geared toward disabled students; however, vouchers often force students with disabilities to forfeit some Individuals with Disabilities Education Act protections because they are considered \"parentally placed\" in private schools.\n\nThese schools are not legally required to provide individualized or \"appropriate\" education to students and are not held to the same nondiscrimination standards as public schools.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, microschools, private schools, and homeschooling have seen a boom -- and so has the availability for families to use vouchers or ESAs to fund tuition at these institutions or fund alternative forms of education and their expenses.\n\nAccording to pro-ESA organization EdChoice, the number of students using ESAs has increased seven-fold between 2022 and 2024 to a total of more than 328,000 students.\n\nAs these programs continue to gain momentum, the debate about these policies continues.\n\nHow much ESA programs cost has varied from state to state -- in Arizona, the ESA program has been estimated by the state governor's office to cost the state $943,795,600 for the 2024 fiscal year for roughly 79,728 students . Meanwhile, in West Virginia, it could cost over $10 million for roughly 2,333 applicants to the 2022-2023 academic year of the program, according to the scholarship program report.\n\nThis has been one major source of contention around ESAs.\n\nCritics of school choice, including West Virginia Education Association President Dale Lee, say that public schools are already under pressure due to underfunding and poor staffing. Shifting funds away from public schools will make it harder for them to thrive, Lee said.\n\n\"Because of the loss of funding, we've reduced the opportunities in the curriculum areas that they have,\" said Lee, adding that vocational and technical schools have reduced the number of offerings they have and reduce the number of courses that secondary students have available.\n\nIn some cases, that includes the arts.\n\n\"As a high school teacher myself, the arts are one of the areas that for many students, that's what drew them into the school, and that's why they were continuing,\" Lee said.\n\nHe said public education is supposed to be \"the great equalizer\" ... \"if you go back to the system of the haves and have nots, you eliminate that opportunity for students.\"\n\nEmily Kirkland, communications director at the Arizona Education Association, slammed some ESA programs for funding controversial purchases. These purchases have been dubbed \"welfare for the wealthy\" by critics, after a CNN analysis of state and federal data found that wealthy communities are disproportionately benefiting from these programs.\n\nABC affiliate KNXV-TV in Arizona analyzed ESA data for the 2022-2023 school year and found that some of the money was used for purposes that have been condemned by critics, including ski resort passes, trampoline parks and ninja warrior training centers, aeroponic indoor gardens, pianos and more.\n\nExpenses in some states, like Arizona, are approved by program staffers.\n\nSupporters of school choice, including president and CEO of pro-school choice EdChoice Robert Enlow, applauds the transparency, arguing that its more insight into specific expenditures than is publicly known from public schools. He adds that the expenses allow families to tailor their education to their individual needs.\n\n\"You can see in Arizona, every single minute of every single day where every single dollar is going in the ESA program, I challenge you to do that in public schools, right?\" said Enlow. \"You may not like where the dollars are going. There may be an issue of whether you like it, but the reality is, you know exactly where they're going.\"\n\nEnlow adds that these programs allow students to take an individualized approach, noting that those who may have different needs based on disability, neurodiversity, and other needs can make adjustments based on those needs.\n\nHe adds that criticism over spending doesn't take into account that, in some cases, families are buying what schools would buy: \"It's OK if a government system buys $1,000 per classroom Lego set, but it's not OK if a family does it?\"\n\nIt is unclear how successful alternative education like microschooling or homeschooling can be. Rules and regulations dictating microschool and homeschool requirements are determined by each state's Department of Education. For example, the National Microschooling Center notes that some microschool educators do not need to be licensed teachers and some institutions do not need to follow state academic standards.\n\nEnlow notes that as these kinds of educations become more popular, the question about what regulation should look like and how success is measured is being asked: \"You can't put a one-size-fits-all system of regulation on a system that is meant for families to have individual options and choices.\"\n\n\"Successes are in children making progress towards what makes them a successful human being, a successful strategy for coping and for living and for being successful right in life,\" Enlow said. \"We believe, for example, that families want to have knowledge about how their kids are doing on a test, but we don't think this is the only way to go.\"\n\nCritics are concerned about the lack of regulations and accountability about the quality of education, success of the institution and the stability of the institution.\n\n\"I called microschools the food trucks of the education industry, because they can open up, go wherever they want, and close down very quickly,\" said Josh Cowen, author of \"The Privateers: How Billionaires Created a Culture War and Sold School Vouchers.\"\n\nCowen calls alternative education \"a predatory environment where private schools and microschools are promising the world to each of these kids,\" making it hard for families to know what the truth is because of the lack of oversight and measures of success.\n\nHe continued, \"It could take months, if not years, for a parent to understand that they've gone to a school that has substantially altered their child's academic trajectory. Or worse, it could take three or four years, and by then, it's too late. And so that's where you need oversight.\"\n\nIn West Virginia, Lee argues that the school choice program has contributed to a teacher shortage, citing poor teacher pay, poor school funding and poor resources that contributes to low moral \"when you're seeing the dollars go to these microschools and learning pods where there's no accountability.\"\n\nEnlow argues that adding more education paths for students could lead to improvements in public schools: \"Who's going to really buy a system where we're just trying to let it continue the way it is without any kind of challenge?\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The latest is \"The Choice,\" which follows a couple from their very first meeting through a lifetime of, yes, choices.\n\nTravis Shaw and Gabby Holland meet as neighbors in a small, picturesque North Carolina town. Shaw is a veterinarian, loving life as a bachelor, while Holland has a serious boyfriend and is preparing to take her board exams. The two don't exactly hit it off when they meet, but they eventually become friends before the sparks start to fly.\n\n\"The Choice\" follows Shaw and Holland as they're faced with some very difficult decisions; decisions that - no matter what - will change the course of their lives. This movie is at times funny, and as with any relationship, at times sad and heartwrenching.\n\n\"I think people are really gonna be amazed at the wide range of emotion, everything from laughter, to sadness, to deep heartfelt emotion, and I think that this film does an extraordinary job of at really moving the viewer through all the emotions of life,\" said author and producer Nicholas Sparks.\n\nYes, \"The Choice\" is definitely a story that couples everywhere will be able to relate to. And, it's one that longtime Sparks fans - as well as those who may be new to his work - will thoroughly enjoy.\n\nSee you at the movies!\n\nBe sure to tune in to WWJ Newsradio 950 every Friday for my weekly look at the movies with Midday Anchor Jackie Paige.\n\nFollow Terri on Twitter @TerriJLee\n\nMember: Broadcast Film Critics Association (BFCA) Detroit Film Critics Society (DFCS) African American Film Critics Association (AAFCA) Digital Arts, Film & Television (DAFT) National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ)\n\n© 2016 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

In October, Choice offered to buy Wyndham's stock for around $8 billion.\n\nTo further pressure Wyndham into accepting the bid, Choice said it plans to nominate a slate of directors to Wyndham's board.\n\nChoice said in a press release that a merger with Wyndham is \"pro-competitive and would generate value for both Wyndham and Choice shareholders as well as deliver significant benefits to franchisees, guests and associates of both companies.\"\n\nBut Wyndham has refused to engage with Choice thus far.\n\n\"While we would have preferred to come to a negotiated agreement, the Wyndham board's refusal to explore a transaction has left us with no choice but to take our proposal directly to Wyndham's shareholders,\" Choice CEO Patrick Pacious said in a statement.\n\nShares of Wyndham ( WH ) and Choice ( CHH ) were flat in early trading.\n\nChoice first approached Wyndham with the bid in April with a cash and stock offer and has made numerous bids since. Most recently in October, Wyndham rejected and blasted Choice's bid as \"underwhelming\" and \"opportunistic\" because it \"undervalues Wyndham's future growth potential.\"\n\nPacious said the company will meet with Wyndham's shareholders \"in the days and weeks ahead.\"\n\nWyndham commented that it will \"carefully review and evaluate the offer to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interests of Wyndham and its shareholders.\"\n\nBoth hotel companies target budget-minded travelers, with the duo owning a number of well-known brands. Choice also owns Econo Lodge, Sleep Inn and Rodeway Inn amounting to about 7,000 hotels worldwide. Wyndham owns several brands including its namesake hotel brand as well as Days Inn and Super 8, amounting to about 9,000 hotels globally.\n\nIf a deal is reached, the merger still needs regulatory approval. A combined company could help it compete against its larger rivals, like Hilton and Marriott.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "Trump signs executive orders on school choice and school funding, and combatting antisemitism\n\nFollow:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed two executive orders on school funding Wednesday that fulfill promises he made on the campaign trail, including on school choice and ending funding for schools that support what the White House calls \"radical indoctrination.\"\n\nIn the week and a half since he's been in office, Trump has signed a flurry of executive actions as he's sought to remake the federal government and enact his sweeping \"America First\" agenda, with a particular target on so-called diversity, equity and inclusion programs .\n\nAlso on Wednesday, he signed an executive order combating antisemitism.\n\nThe order on school choice - an issue that Trump has been pushing for eight years - could be a huge win for conservative activists and politicians who have been advocating for decades to make it easier for families to spend taxpayer funds on private education.\n\nThe order involves multiple agencies in the effort to provide taxpayer funds to parents to pay for private schools.\n\nAmong its directives, the Department of Education - which Trump has vowed to shut down - is ordered to issue guidance on using federal funding to support scholarship programs for grade school students. The Department of Defense is ordered to submit a plan to Trump directly on how military families can use DOD funds to send children to their preferred school. The secretary of interior is ordered to submit a plan to Trump on how families with students attending Bureau of Indian Education schools can use federal money to attend the school of their choice. And the Health and Human Services Department must issue guidance on how states can use HHS funds to attend private or faith-based schools.\n\nVarious red states across the country have already passed universal or near-universal school choice policies on the state level - either vouchers that directly send public dollars to private schools or \"education savings account\" programs that give parents more flexibility on where to spend the money. The Trump administration's move to allow federal tax dollars to be directed to school choice could supercharge the movement.\n\nBut public school advocates and public school teachers' unions have long been against redirecting taxpayer dollars from public schools to private schools, saying it would harm poorer public schools. Districts have already been dealing with budget shortfalls, in addition to a dramatic reduction in the public school population, which is often a factor in determining how much funding a school district will receive. Public school advocates believe eventually school choice will mean the end of public schools and an increase in education inequity.\n\nAs CNN has reported, some of Trump's education proposals - like eliminating the Department of Education and slashing federal funding for public schools - could hit areas that voted for him the hardest. A CNN analysis found that all of the 15 states that relied most heavily on federal support for their public schools in 2022 voted for Trump, while all but two of the 15 states that received the least federal dollars as a percentage of their overall revenue voted for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBut one source with a teachers' union expressed some skepticism on the overall impact this order would have, pointing to how unpopular school choice has been with some voters who have rejected these policies on a state level.\n\nThe additional school-related executive order is about protecting parental rights and ending discrimination.\n\n\"My Administration will enforce the law to ensure that recipients of Federal funds providing K-12 education comply with all applicable laws prohibiting discrimination in various contexts and protecting parental rights,\" the order reads.\n\nIt calls for government agencies to come up with a plan to end funding \"for illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.\"\n\nTrump is also calling on the federal government to cancel student visas for what he called \"Hamas sympathizers\" on college campuses, according to a White House fact sheet.\n\nHe later signed an executive order calling on government agencies to submit a report within 60 days to identify civil and criminal authorities to combat antisemitism and \"containing an inventory and analysis of all pending administrative complaints, as of the date of the report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations related to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump railed against pro-Palestinian student protests, which broke out in response to Israel's military response in Gaza after Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\n\nThe Republican National Convention's 2024 platform pledged to \"Deport Pro-Hamas radicals and make our college campuses safe and patriotic again,\" sparking uncertainty about the future among international students.\n\nThis story has been updated with Trump signing executive orders.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

The red carpet was also an atypical affair, with organizers earlier announcing the cancelation of the customary televised pre-awards live show.\n\nAttendees showed up in style, nonetheless. As at last weekend's Grammys, there were plenty of demure, dark-colored gowns and restrained styling choices. Cynthia Erivo (in a shiny leather Armani Privé look) and Naomi Watts (in a structured satin Prada dress) were among numerous attendees opting for all-black looks.\n\nThe men got in on the trend too, with the likes of Randall Park and Ewan McGregor wearing black T-shirts under dark formal jackets.\n\nBut guests also brought pops of color and sparkle. Lupita Nyong'o's custom Chanel gown featured a bright floral bustier visible through otherwise somber black tulle. Elsewhere, both Zoe Saldaña and \"Shōgun\" star Moeka Hoshi stunned in elegant red gowns, while Angelina Jolie and Ariana Grande impressed in nude dresses by Elie Saab and Dior, respectively.\n\nSee below for some of the red carpet's best looks.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "'Your body, my choice': Attacks on women surge on social media following election\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFollow:\n\nSexist and abusive attacks on women, like \"your body, my choice\" and \"get back to the kitchen,\" have surged across social media since Donald Trump's reelection, according to an analysis from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.\n\nAn X post from White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes last Tuesday night saying, \"Your body, my choice. Forever,\" has been viewed more than 90 million times and reposted more than 35,000 times. Between Thursday and Friday, the ISD recorded a 4,600% increase in mentions of the phrase on X. And a number of women on TikTok posted videos saying their comments had been filled with users posting the phrase.\n\n\"Nick Fuentes\" was still trending on X and TikTok on Monday. The phrase \"we own your body\" was also trending on TikTok, although many of the videos featured women pushing back on the trend.\n\n\"Your body, my choice\" is an apparent subversion the phrase \"my body, my choice,\" which was used by women as a rallying cry in support of reproductive rights.\n\nThe rise in harassment signals that far-right online trolls and extremists feel emboldened by the outcome of an election that many had viewed as a referendum on women's reproductive rights . On the campaign trail, Trump himself came under fire for comments about women, including that he would protect women whether \"they like it or not.\" Vice President-elect JD Vance also took heat for comments about women, including deriding \"childless cat ladies\" and calling Vice President Kamala Harris \"trash.\"\n\nMany of those trolls are part of the so-called \"manosphere,\" which the ISD describes as online \"misogynistic communities that vary from anti-feminism to more explicit, violent rhetoric towards women.\"\n\nRelated article Authorities work to find the source of racist texts sent to Black people nationwide after the election. Here's what we know\n\nAnd as with many types of online provocations, experts worry that this type of harassment could spill over into the offline world.\n\nAlready, the ISD said, \"Young girls and parents have used social media to share instances of offline harassment\" involving the phrase \"your body, my choice.\"\n\n\"They include the phrase being directed at them within schools or chanted by young boys in classes,\" according to the report, published Friday.\n\nAt least one American school district sent a warning to parents this week, informing them that students had used the phrase to target girls at school.\n\n\"In the days after the election, we have received reports of some students using the phrase, 'Your body, my choice,' often directed at female students,\" Cory Hirsbrunner, the superintendent of Stevens Point School District in Wisconsin, said in a e-mail to parents Monday that was shared with CNN. \"It is simply unacceptable for students to use any language that is threatening in nature. Any students found to have violated school district policy will be subject to disciplinary action.\"\n\nIn some cases, X and TikTok users responded to posts saying \"your body, my choice\" with vague threats of retaliatory violence.\n\nOther, similar posts have also gone viral on X in recent days, including one from Jon Miller, a former contributor to conservative media outlet TheBlaze, saying , \"women threatening sex strikes like LMAO as if you have a say,\" which received 85 million views. (The post appeared to refer to conversations among young liberal women across TikTok and Instagram about South Korean feminist movement in which straight women refuse to marry , have children, date or have sex with men.)\n\nPosts calling for the repeal of the 19th Amendment, which gives women the right to vote, also surged 663% on X last week, compared to the prior week, the ISD reported.\n\nX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The platform's harassment policy generally prohibits only targeted abuse of specific individuals.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said \"your body, my choice\" violates the platform's community guidelines and that content with mentions of the phrase would be removed unless it is explicitly speaking out against such language. TikTok removed three videos identified by CNN that appeared to suggest threats of retaliatory violence.\n\nThe ratcheting up of violent online rhetoric also comes as Black people across the country last week received anonymous, racist text messages referencing slavery and telling them they were \"selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation,\" raising further concerns about violence in the wake of the election. Federal and state authorities are working to find the origins of the messages.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated the number of reposts of an X post by Nick Fuentes. It is more than 35,000.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes. All times are ET.

      "text": "Maximizing Benefits with Choice Privileges Rewards: A Complete Guide\n\nWith more than 7,500 properties worldwide including brands like Cambria Hotels, Econo Lodge, and the Ascend Hotel Collection, Choice Hotels offers something for every traveler and budget.\n\nPresent in more than 40 countries, Choice Hotels also partners with Penn Entertainment, Inc., Preferred Hotels & Resorts, and Strawberry. This makes redemption options even more interesting, with the addition of casino hotels and upscale resorts to the mix.\n\nChoice Privileges points are underrated yet valuable in the world of travel rewards currencies. It's easy to understand the program's appeal given its range of redemption options, including free hotel nights and the chance to exchange them for airline miles, Amtrak tickets, and gift cards.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about earning, redeeming, and maximizing your Choice Privileges points.\n\nThe Choice Privileges program may seem straightforward, but many little rules define what counts as a qualifying points-earning stay.\n\nFor starters, you must book directly with the hotel by phone or via the Choice Hotels website or app. You won't earn Choice Privileges points on third-party bookings, free stays (from award nights or otherwise), nights booked with Points Plus Cash, through a travel agent or as part of a group booking, rates booked through certain promotions or employee discounts - or if rates are under $40 a night.\n\nYou'll also need to pay attention to where you can earn points - within the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region (except China and Japan), and Europe (except countries covered by Strawberry). Here's how to get started earning.\n\nEarn 10 points per dollar on stays at participating Choice Hotels® properties. Earn 5 points per dollar on purchases at gas stations, grocery stores, home improvement stores and on phone plan services. Plus earn 1 point per dollar on other purchases.\n\n$95\n\nN/A\n\n19.99%, 24.24%, or 29.24% Variable\n\nEarn 60,000 points\n\nGood to Excellent\n\nWells Fargo has two Choice Hotels credit cards, and the Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® is the most rewarding of the pair with automatic elite status, and points on your card anniversary.\n\nThe fastest way to accrue Choice Privileges points is to open one of the two Choice Privileges credit cards available: The Choice Privileges® Mastercard® or the Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard®.\n\nThe no-annual-fee Choice Privileges® Mastercard® offers new cardholders a decent welcome bonus for a relatively low spending requirement: 60,000 bonus points when you spend $1,000 in purchases within the first three months. Ongoing earnings include 5 points per dollar on Choice Hotels; 3 points per dollar on gas, groceries, home improvement, and phone plans, and 1 point per dollar on everything else.\n\nCardholders also enjoy modest Choice Privileges perks: Gold elite status and cellphone protection .\n\nThe premium Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® costs cardholders $95  a year in annual fees. In exchange, you can earn a welcome bonus of 60,000 bonus points when you spend $3,000 in purchases within the first three months from account opening. You'll also earn up to 10 points per dollar on Choice Hotels; 5 points per dollar on gas, groceries, home improvement, and phone plans; and 1 point per dollar on everything else.\n\nFinally, cardholders get Choice Privileges Platinum elite status, 30,000 points per card anniversary, a Global Entry/TSA PreCheck® application fee credit once every four years, and cellphone protection.\n\nChoice Hotels partners with several major transferable points programs including American Express Membership Rewards , Capital One Rewards, and Citi ThankYou Rewards .\n\nWhen you have cards like American Express® Gold Card, Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card, or Citi Strata PremierSM Card , you can transfer points to Choice Hotels, but the ratio varies by program.\n\nYou'll get a 1:1 ratio when you transfer American Express points or Capital One miles to Choice, while the transfer ratio is 1:1.5 or 1:2 (depending on the card you have) on transfers from Citi .\n\nThe most straightforward way to earn Choice Privileges Rewards is by staying in select Choice hotels on paid bookings.\n\nIt's free to sign up for a Choice Privileges account, which offers savings through members-only rates.\n\nThe program previously had complicated qualifications for earning rates at different hotel brands. But now, Choice Privileges program members can earn 10 points per dollar spent at all brands in the U.S., Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Mexico, Central American, Caribbean, Asia-Pac (including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and Fiji).\n\nPoints cannot be earned in Denmark, Estonia, Ecuador, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, or Sweden.\n\nWhile all Choice Privileges members save with exclusive member rates and receive Your Extras perks, those with Gold, Platinum, or Diamond elite status have access to extra perks like elite gift cards, early check-in and late checkout, preferred parking, a dedicated customer service hotline, and an elite welcome gift at check-in.\n\nChoice Privileges® Mastercard® cardholders automatically earn Gold status, which gets you a 10% elite points bonus and up to nine rollover nights.\n\nChoice Privileges® Select Mastercard® cardholders get Platinum status, which gets you a 25% elite points bonus and up to 19 rollover nights.\n\nFinally, Diamond status gets you a 50% points bonus and up to 39 rollover nights.\n\nPlatinum and Diamond members also receive Avis Preferred Plus membership for car rentals. Status matches are available if you're an elite member of another hotel loyalty program.\n\nYou'll need to stay 10, 20, and 40 nights, respectively, to earn Choice elite status. Elite members can keep their accounts active by completing qualifying activities every 18 months; otherwise, they will lose their status and earned points .\n\nQualifying activities include earning or redeeming Choice Privileges points, using the Choice Privileges® Mastercard® and Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard®, or transferring flexible points to Choice.\n\nHotel members with Choice Privileges elite status can earn benefits such as 250 bonus points, preferred parking, and late checkout and early check-in.\n\nIf you're an elite member of another hotel loyalty program, you can also earn Diamond elite status with Choice Privileges after staying at least one night at a Cambria Hotels property, thanks to the Diamond elite status jump perk.\n\nIf you're booking a points-eligible stay on a weekday - Sunday through Thursday - select a Your Extras perk in your account before you go. You can choose from 400 Choice Privileges points, 100 airline miles, $2.50 Amazon credit, or a $5 coffee card.\n\nWhile you can change your choice for each stay, you must make your selection prior to check-in. Make sure to include your member number when you make your reservation.\n\nWoodSpring Suites properties do not participate in the Your Extras program.\n\nActive duty, reserve, and retired military personnel automatically receive limited-time Gold elite status by signing up for a free Choice Privileges account.\n\nCheck the Choice Privileges website to stay on top of bonus points promos. In the past, there have been promotions to earn 2x points on qualifying stays, and be sure to check for bonus points packages that let you pay a little more each night for an extra 1,000 or 2,000 Choice Privileges points.\n\nIf you don't plan on redeeming points for hotel stays, opt to earn points toward airline miles - just enter your frequent flyer info and set your points-earning preference to airline miles. Note that airline miles cannot be earned by staying at all-inclusive resorts through the Ascend Hotel Collection or casino hotels through Penn Entertainment, Inc.\n\nWhile rates are subject to change, you'll earn 600 Qantas Frequent Flyer points or 600 Virgin Australia Velocity Frequent Flyer points per qualifying stay at participating hotels.\n\nYou can earn 5 points per dollar by booking qualifying rooms with more than 20 cruise lines through Choice Privileges Cruises, giving you access to perks like onboard spending allowances, instant savings, and discounts for additional guests.\n\nYou can also earn Choice Privileges points by booking car rentals with Avis and Budget (1,000 points per rental, plus 25% off rates).\n\nAn easy way to earn points is through the Choice Privileges Online Mall shopping portal, which lets you earn bonus points at Macy's, Bed Bath & Beyond, and more.\n\nGroups booking meetings and qualifying events (at least 10 rooms booked on one night) can earn 3 points per dollar (up to 150,000 points per event) on conference rooms, hotel accommodations, and on-property catering at participating Cambria hotels as part of the Planner Rewards program.\n\nCompleting your first survey within 90 days of signing up for a free E-Rewards account will earn you bonus points.\n\nYou can buy up to 250,000 Choice Privileges points for yourself - or up to 180,000 Choice Privileges points for friends and family members - per calendar year. Rates start at $12.10 per 1,000 points (you must buy them in 1,000-point increments) and go all the way up to $1,782 for 180,000 points.\n\nNote that this is the only way to gift points to family and friends, as the Choice Privileges program does not allow points pooling and transfers between members.\n\nEarn rewards for referring friends to Choice Privileges\n\nIt's a win-win when you refer a friend to join the Choice Privileges Program and they complete their first eligible stay. You'll each earn 500 Choice points, which also counts as a qualifying event to keep your account active.\n\nChoice points are worth, on average, 0.7 cents apiece based on Business Insider's latest points and miles valuations . The exact value you'll get depends on where and when you redeem your rewards.\n\nYou have multiple options for maximizing rewards such as booking free nights at Choice Hotels, taking advantage of travel perks like airline miles and car rentals, and even redeeming them for gift cards and shopping credit. We'll explore the best options in the sections below.\n\nWhether you're planning a romantic getaway, family vacation, dream honeymoon, or an epic solo trip, you can use Choice Privileges points to book everything from extended stays and roadside motels to luxury casino hotels and resorts on the beach.\n\nThanks to Choice Hotels' partnerships with Preferred Hotels & Resorts and Penn Entertainment, Inc., you'll also be able to redeem points for stays at a number of independent, boutique properties and casino hotels.\n\nChoice Hotels redemptions start at 8,000 points per night and can go up to 35,000 or 75,000 points per night in some locales like the Asia Pacific region, or when redeeming for Preferred Hotels & Resorts. Since redemption rates vary by hotel and date, you may end up with a great deal, especially if you value convenience over luxury.\n\nBe aware that you can only reserve award stays with a check-out date within 100 days of your trip. Unlike other loyalty programs, there's no award chart and no categories, so you'll have to go through each hotel's website to see exactly how many points are needed for a free night.\n\nUse the Points Plus Cash perk, available to Choice Privileges members with at least 6,000 points in their account, to pay with the points you have while essentially purchasing enough points to make up the difference. Select \"Reward Points\" under the special rate menu while searching for your hotel, choose the Points Plus Cash tab, then pay a set combination of points and cash, which will vary by hotel and date.\n\nWhile these bookings won't earn you any points, you'll be refunded solely in Choice points if there's a cancellation.\n\nTo redeem Choice Privileges points for flights, use the Choice Hotels Rewards Exchange to transfer them to airline partners at the following rates:\n\nYou may need to call Customer Service at (888) 770-6800 and provide them with your frequent flyer number to complete your airline redemption.\n\nYou can convert your Choice points to donations to organizations including Sleeping Children Around the World and True Patriot Love.\n\nWhen you cash in points for plastic (not digital) gift cards from all your favorite retail stores, gas stations, restaurants, and movie theaters, redemptions start at 8,000 points for $25 gift cards, 16,000 points for $50 gift cards, and 32,000 points for $100 gift cards. Note that you're limited to two gift card transactions within a 48-hour period and they'll arrive in 2-4 weeks.\n\nYou can earn Choice Privilege points through booking hotel stays at Choice Hotels properties, leveraging partner promotions and partnerships, using a Choice Privileges credit card, and taking advantage of elite member benefits.\n\nChoice Privileges Rewards can be used to book free nights at Choice Hotels, converted to airline miles, used as credit toward car rentals, or redeemed for gift cards and shopping credit.\n\nThe Choice Privileges loyalty program spans three tiers of elite status: Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. Each tier offers increasing benefits such as bonus points on stays, complimentary early check-ins, and free late check-out privileges.\n\nYou can maximize your rewards by booking hotel stays during promotional periods, utilizing the Choice Privileges credit card for everyday purchases, and staying loyal to Choice Hotels when traveling so you can quickly earn elite status.\n\nFocus on staying at Choice Hotels as often as possible, especially during bonus point events, and use the Choice Privileges credit card to accumulate points on daily spending.\n\nEditorial Note: Any opinions, analyses, reviews, or recommendations expressed in this article are the author's alone, and have not been reviewed, approved, or otherwise endorsed by any card issuer.

It's offering 60,000 bonus points when you spend $3,000 in purchases within the first three months from account opening. There's an annual fee of $95 . You'll also get a points boost on your card anniversary, bonus elite night credits, and automatic Choice Privileges hotel loyalty status.\n\nEarn 10 points per dollar on stays at participating Choice Hotels® properties. Earn 5 points per dollar on purchases at gas stations, grocery stores, home improvement stores and on phone plan services. Plus earn 1 point per dollar on other purchases.\n\n$95\n\nN/A\n\n19.99%, 24.24%, or 29.24% Variable\n\nEarn 60,000 points\n\nGood to Excellent\n\nWells Fargo has two Choice Hotels credit cards, and the Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® is the most rewarding of the pair with automatic elite status, and points on your card anniversary.\n\nThe Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® is the more premium version of the two Choice Hotels credit cards, with a bigger welcome bonus, higher earning rates, and more benefits.\n\nCardholders earn 10 points on stays at participating Choice Hotels® properties, 5 points on purchases at gas stations, grocery stores, home improvement stores and on phone plan services, and 1 point on other purchases. They also get a decent range of perks, including Platinum elite status, 30,000 points per card anniversary, a Global Entry/TSA PreCheck® application fee credit, and cell phone protection.\n\nIf you don't stay with Choice that often (but still want a way to earn Choice points), another option is to open a card that earns transferable points . American Express Membership Rewards , Citi ThankYou , and Capital One all partner with Choice Privileges, so you can move points over whenever you need to top up your account.\n\nThe welcome bonus offer on the Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® is quite impressive for a mid-tier hotel card. Cardholders can earn 60,000 bonus points when you spend $3,000 in purchases within the first three months from account opening.\n\nThat's worth around $420 in hotel stays, based on Business Insider's points and miles valuations , which peg Choice points as worth 0.7 cents apiece, on average.\n\nLooking at it a different way, because Choice award prices start at 8,000 points per night, this bonus is worth up to 7 reward nights at Choice Hotels®.\n\nYou'll earn the most points from the card when you use it at Choice Hotels®, but there are other bonus categories that can make it a rewarding card to use for other spending. You'll earn:\n\nChoice Privileges is the loyalty program of Choice Hotels, with nearly 7,500 properties across 13 brands in 47 countries. You'll find Choice hotels just about anywhere, and they're particularly handy if you travel to smaller towns and cities that don't have a lot of big-chain hotels. If you're a road-tripper, you've probably seen plenty of Choice brand properties in your travels!\n\nAward nights at Choice Hotels start at 8,000 points and go up to 35,000 points (with a few exceptions that can cost 75,000 points or more). For example, you could use the card's welcome bonus for:\n\nThere's also a option for redeeming Choice points. Choice Hotels recently completed its acquisition of Radisson Hotels Americas, adding 600 more hotels across the US, Canada, the Caribbean, and Latin America. While you can't yet use Choice points to book these hotels directly, you can transfer Choice points to Radisson Hotels Americas at a 1:2 ratio to book stays at the following brands:\n\nChoice also partners with Penn Entertainment, which runs over 20 casino hotels where you can redeem Choice points for reward stays.\n\nYou'll almost always get the most value from your points when you redeem them for reward nights, but there are other ways to cash them in that might suit you better, including:\n\nThe Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® isn't packed with as many travel and purchase protections as some of the best travel credit cards . But it still comes with a good selection of benefits that can save you money and make your travels more comfortable.\n\nCardholders automatically receive 20 elite night credits each year, which is enough to qualify for Choice Platinum elite status. That's Choice Privileges' middle elite tier, and it comes with fairly standard perks, including:\n\nEach year on your card anniversary, you'll receive 30,000 Choice points (worth around $210 in stays based on our valuations, or up to three reward nights). While most of the best hotel credit cards offer an anniversary reward night, earning points instead is much more flexible. You can choose to redeem your anniversary points however you want - you could spend them all in one go at an upscale hotel, or stretch them out for more stays at budget-friendly brands.\n\nOnce every four years, cardholders can receive a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck® credit when they use the card to pay the application fee for one of these trusted traveler programs. If you've already enrolled, you can always use the card to pay for a loved one's application fee and still receive the credit.\n\nLike other Wells Fargo credit cards , the Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® includes built-in cell phone protection. When you use the card to pay your monthly wireless bill, you can be covered for up to $800 per claim (with a $25 deductible) and a maximum of two claims per 12-month period.\n\nThis makes the card a solid choice for paying your cell phone bill, since it also earns 5x Choice points on phone plans.\n\nBecause it's a World Elite Mastercard, the Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® includes access to additional discounts and perks, including:\n\nThe Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® has an annual fee of $95 . A 19.99%, 24.24%, or 29.24% Variable APR applies to any balance you carry, so it's best to pay off your card in full every month.\n\nThere are no foreign transaction fees , so this is a good card to bring if you're traveling abroad.\n\nOther fees that may apply include:\n\nThe Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® has some serious competition in the hotel co-cobranded cards space. Here are two apples-to-apples comparisons that may help you evaluate your options.\n\nThe Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Card has a $95 annual fee.

It's offering 60,000 bonus points when you spend $3,000 in purchases within the first three months from account opening. There's an annual fee of $95 . You'll also get a points boost on your card anniversary, bonus elite night credits, and automatic Choice Privileges hotel loyalty status.\n\nEarn 10 points per dollar on stays at participating Choice Hotels® properties. Earn 5 points per dollar on purchases at gas stations, grocery stores, home improvement stores and on phone plan services. Plus earn 1 point per dollar on other purchases.\n\n$95\n\nN/A\n\n19.99%, 24.24%, or 29.24% Variable\n\nEarn 60,000 points\n\nGood to Excellent\n\nWells Fargo has two Choice Hotels credit cards, and the Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® is the most rewarding of the pair with automatic elite status, and points on your card anniversary.\n\nThe Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® is the more premium version of the two Choice Hotels credit cards, with a bigger welcome bonus, higher earning rates, and more benefits.\n\nCardholders earn 10 points on stays at participating Choice Hotels® properties, 5 points on purchases at gas stations, grocery stores, home improvement stores and on phone plan services, and 1 point on other purchases. They also get a decent range of perks, including Platinum elite status, 30,000 points per card anniversary, a Global Entry/TSA PreCheck® application fee credit, and cell phone protection.\n\nIf you don't stay with Choice that often (but still want a way to earn Choice points), another option is to open a card that earns transferable points . American Express Membership Rewards , Citi ThankYou , and Capital One all partner with Choice Privileges, so you can move points over whenever you need to top up your account.\n\nThe welcome bonus offer on the Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® is quite impressive for a mid-tier hotel card. Cardholders can earn 60,000 bonus points when you spend $3,000 in purchases within the first three months from account opening.\n\nThat's worth around $420 in hotel stays, based on Business Insider's points and miles valuations , which peg Choice points as worth 0.7 cents apiece, on average.\n\nLooking at it a different way, because Choice award prices start at 8,000 points per night, this bonus is worth up to 7 reward nights at Choice Hotels®.\n\nYou'll earn the most points from the card when you use it at Choice Hotels®, but there are other bonus categories that can make it a rewarding card to use for other spending. You'll earn:\n\nChoice Privileges is the loyalty program of Choice Hotels, with nearly 7,500 properties across 13 brands in 47 countries. You'll find Choice hotels just about anywhere, and they're particularly handy if you travel to smaller towns and cities that don't have a lot of big-chain hotels. If you're a road-tripper, you've probably seen plenty of Choice brand properties in your travels!\n\nAward nights at Choice Hotels start at 8,000 points and go up to 35,000 points (with a few exceptions that can cost 75,000 points or more). For example, you could use the card's welcome bonus for:\n\nThere's also a option for redeeming Choice points. Choice Hotels recently completed its acquisition of Radisson Hotels Americas, adding 600 more hotels across the US, Canada, the Caribbean, and Latin America. While you can't yet use Choice points to book these hotels directly, you can transfer Choice points to Radisson Hotels Americas at a 1:2 ratio to book stays at the following brands:\n\nChoice also partners with Penn Entertainment, which runs over 20 casino hotels where you can redeem Choice points for reward stays.\n\nYou'll almost always get the most value from your points when you redeem them for reward nights, but there are other ways to cash them in that might suit you better, including:\n\nThe Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® isn't packed with as many travel and purchase protections as some of the best travel credit cards . But it still comes with a good selection of benefits that can save you money and make your travels more comfortable.\n\nCardholders automatically receive 20 elite night credits each year, which is enough to qualify for Choice Platinum elite status. That's Choice Privileges' middle elite tier, and it comes with fairly standard perks, including:\n\nEach year on your card anniversary, you'll receive 30,000 Choice points (worth around $210 in stays based on our valuations, or up to three reward nights). While most of the best hotel credit cards offer an anniversary reward night, earning points instead is much more flexible. You can choose to redeem your anniversary points however you want - you could spend them all in one go at an upscale hotel, or stretch them out for more stays at budget-friendly brands.\n\nOnce every four years, cardholders can receive a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck® credit when they use the card to pay the application fee for one of these trusted traveler programs. If you've already enrolled, you can always use the card to pay for a loved one's application fee and still receive the credit.\n\nLike other Wells Fargo credit cards , the Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® includes built-in cell phone protection. When you use the card to pay your monthly wireless bill, you can be covered for up to $800 per claim (with a $25 deductible) and a maximum of two claims per 12-month period.\n\nThis makes the card a solid choice for paying your cell phone bill, since it also earns 5x Choice points on phone plans.\n\nBecause it's a World Elite Mastercard, the Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® includes access to additional discounts and perks, including:\n\nThe Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® has an annual fee of $95 . A 19.99%, 24.24%, or 29.24% Variable APR applies to any balance you carry, so it's best to pay off your card in full every month.\n\nThere are no foreign transaction fees , so this is a good card to bring if you're traveling abroad.\n\nOther fees that may apply include:\n\nThe Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® has some serious competition in the hotel co-cobranded cards space. Here are two apples-to-apples comparisons that may help you evaluate your options.\n\nThe Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Card has a $95 annual fee. In exchange, cardholders can earn a welcome bonus of 3 Free Night Awards, each valued up to 50,000 points, after spending $3,000 on purchases in your first three months from account opening, plus earn 50,000 bonus points after spending $6,000 on eligible purchases within six months of account opening.\n\nThis card earns 6x on eligible purchases at participating Marriott Bonvoy hotels, 3x at grocery stores, gas stations, and on dining (on up to $6,000 in combined purchases per year), and 2x on everything else.\n\nCardholders also get the following benefits:\n\nRead more in our Marriott Bonvoy Boundless credit card review .\n\nThe IHG One Rewards Premier Credit Card has an annual fee of $99.

      "text": "Why you find it hard to pick your lunch or a Netflix show, according to new research\n\nAbout 20 years ago, researchers decided to study how we react to having too much choice. They set up a table full of jams in a grocery store , some with 24 samples, and some with just six.\n\nAlthough shoppers were more likely to stop and peruse when there was a larger selection, they were also less likely to buy anything.\n\nIn a new study, published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour , researchers at Caltech looked further into why a choice overload makes us behave this way.\n\nThe researchers gave volunteers a selection of pictures of scenic landscapes they could have printed on a souvenir like a coffee mug. They were shown either six, 12, or 24 pictures in total. Then, they were asked to make a decision while lying in an MRI machine, so the researchers could measure their brain activity.\n\nAs a control, they were shown all the images again, but a computer randomly selected which one they would get.\n\nResults of the scan revealed brain activity in two regions of the brain while participants were making their choices - the anterior cingulate cortex, where you weigh up costs and benefits, and the striatum, where you determine value. Brain activity was highest when the subjects had 12 options to pick from, rather than six or 24, suggesting around 12 is the sweet spot for optimum decision making.\n\nYou might relate to how it feels when you're trying to pick what sandwich to get at lunchtime, or struggling to choose a new Netflix show to watch. How many times have you scrolled through films, only to pick something you've seen before? How many times have you gone back to the same lunch spot, despite there being plenty of other places you want to try?\n\nWhen there are fewer options though, somehow, it seems easier to make a decision. But when there are too few, you feel cheated.\n\n\"The idea is that the best out of 12 is probably rather good, while the jump to the best out of 24 is not a big improvement,\" said Colin Camerer, a professor of behavioural economics at Caltech and author of the study.\n\n\"Essentially, our eyes are bigger than our stomachs... When we think about how many choices we want, we may not be mentally representing the frustrations of making the decision.\"\n\nHe said the ideal number of options is probably somewhere between 8 and 15, depending on the reward, and your personality. And although we may feel freer and in control when we have lots to choose from, this actually ends up distressing us when it comes to making the decision.\n\nToo much choice is arguably a bad thing anyway. While dating, people can fall into the trap of the \" paradox of choice ,\" where they obsess over little things they don't like about their partner, and constantly feel there's someone out there who's better. Essentially, it's the \"grass is always greener\" mindset. But if you're always looking out for someone more perfect, you're likely to miss out on something great.\n\nSo we might be better off with fewer options in life, or at least realising that more choice isn't always superior. Otherwise, we might end up never falling in love , never choosing a souvenir, or unable to even pick up a small jar or jam.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Where to watch the Critics Choice Awards: Live stream the 2025 ceremony anywhere\n\nWith the awards season now well underway, the 2025 Critics Choice Awards ceremony is finally here. We've provided a breakdown of everything you need to know about where to watch the Critics Choice Awards, which movies and TV shows are nominated, and some of the big names attending the 2025 ceremony.\n\nThis year marks the 30th Critics Choice Awards ceremony after originally being presented in 1996 (for 1995 films). The awards honor the achievements of movies and TV shows from 2024 in categories voted on by members of the Critics Choice Association. Among the leading movies with the most nominations in 2025 are \"Conclave\" and \"Wicked\" at 11 nominations each, with \"Shogun\" leading the TV shows at six nominations. Additionally, some of the stars with acting nominations include Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, Timothée Chalamet, Demi Moore, and Denzel Washington.\n\nOriginally, the ceremony was scheduled to take place on January 12, but was delayed in response to the wildfires in the Los Angeles and San Diego areas. The event will also be hosted by comedian Chelsea Handler for the third year in a row.\n\nHere's our breakdown of everything you need to know about the 2025 Critics Choice Awards, including where to watch the ceremony and who will be at the event. We'll recommend live TV streaming services for those without cable.\n\nUS (live): E!\n\nUS (next-day):\n\nThe 2025 Critics Choice Awards will be broadcast live on E! on Friday, February 7, starting at 7 p.m. ET. The ceremony typically lasts about three hours, so the broadcast should be over by 10 p.m. ET.\n\nIn the US, the cheapest option for streaming the 2025 Critics Choice Awards live on the E! channel is through Sling TV . E! is only available through Sling TV's Blue plan, which includes 40+ total channels with at least 16 exclusive news and entertainment channels. Sling TV's Blue plan subscription price is $46/month. Currently, the platform is offering a deal where first-time subscribers can get half-off of their first month at $23. E! is also available in the combined Sling TV Blue and Orange plan, which includes even more channels at $61/month, with half-off your first month at $30.50.\n\nAccess 40+ channels for just $23 a month for your first month as a part of a special offer right now on Sling Blue where you can get 50% off. The best part about Sling is that you only pay for what you want and you're not tied to a long-term contract\n\nAnother option for streaming the 2025 Critics Choice Awards live on E! in the US is through a subscription to DirecTV Stream . Prices for DirecTV Stream tiers that include E! start at $87/month with the Entertainment Plan, which comes with over 90 channels, after a five-day free trial.\n\nPreviously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n\nAnother way to watch the 2025 Critics Choice Awards live is with a subscription to Fubo . The Essential Plan price starts at $60 for the first month after a seven-day free trial, then is bumped up to $85/month thereafter. Including E!, this subscription tier comes with 150+ channels and the ability to watch on up to ten screens.\n\nFubo's most essential tier features most of the same offerings as its Pro plan (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, ESPN, etc.), but it lacks regional sports networks that show NBA, NHL, and MLB games. This will remove any applicable extra RSN fees from your monthly bill.\n\nThe 2025 Critics Choice Awards will also be available to watch the following day with a subscription to Peacock . While the ceremony will not be airing live on the streaming service, it will become available on Peacock on-demand on February 8. The cheapest Peacock subscription plan needed to watch the Critics Choice Awards is the ad-supported Premium Plan, which costs $8/month. Peacock is also offering a limited-time special offer for the annual Premium Plan, bringing the price down by 63% from $80/year to $30/year.\n\nPeacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming.\n\nIf you're traveling outside the US, you can also use a VPN to access the awards show on the above streaming services. A VPN, which stands for virtual private network, allows users to change their virtual geographic location so that their streaming services, websites, and apps still function the same as they would back in the US. VPNs are also useful for enhancing privacy and cybersecurity on the web. The services we've highlighted require US payment methods, so this will work best for Americans who are simply abroad.\n\nWe recommend using ExpressVPN for users who don't have a VPN yet, which is our best-tested VPN service. ExpressVPN also offers a 30-day money-back guarantee for users who aren't satisfied. Another perk of the app is that it has fast servers globally and works on various web and mobile devices. For more information about what the service offers, check out our review of ExpressVPN .\n\nWith its consistent performance, reliable security, and expansive global streaming features, ExpressVPN is the best VPN out there, excelling in every spec and offering many advanced features that make it exceptional. Better yet, you can save more than 60% right now and get up to four months free.\n\nWhile the ceremony boasted that over 200 stars would be in attendance, the Critics Choice Awards waited until the day before to reveal who exactly will be presenting the awards this year. David Harbour, Ewan McGregor, Jackie Chan, Jesse Eisenberg, Jimmy O. Yang, Kate Hudson, Kathryn Hahn, Keri Russell, Kristen Bell, Lupita Nyong'o, Michelle Yeoh, and Sarah Michelle Gellar are among some of the major stars scheduled to appear.\n\nThe 2025 Critics Choice Awards was postponed not once, but twice prior to landing on its final February 7 air date. The show was originally scheduled to occur on January 12, but was postponed to January 26 due to the series of wildfires affecting Southern California, as the ceremony takes place at the Santa Monica Airport. A few days after its initial postponement, the Critics Choice Awards were rescheduled again from January 26 to February 7 due to the continued impact of the LA wildfires .\n\nNote: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services.

      "text": "11 ways having too many options is screwing us up\n\nIn Barry Schwartz's seminal book, \" The Paradox of Choice ,\" we learn that while choice is a vital part of autonomy and fundamental to our well-being, too much choice has a cost, and our obsession with it contributes to bad decisions, anxiety, stress, dissatisfaction, paralysis, and even depression.\n\nFrom choosing the best tacos to finding the ideal mate, today's perils of choice come from every direction. Almost every part of daily life requires us to choose, compelling many to waste a ton of time and energy on research for fear that the wrong decision might get made.\n\nHere are some of the ways too many options mess with us, according to psychological research:\n\nOne of the problems with having too many options before us is that each one comes with its trade-offs, Schwartz says, and trade-offs have psychological consequences.\n\nWhen there are lots of alternatives to consider, it's easy to imagine the attractive features of the alternatives you reject.\n\n\"The necessity of making trade-offs alters how we feel about the decisions we face; more important, it affects the level of satisfaction we experience from the decisions we ultimately make,\" he writes.\n\nWhen there are multiple alternatives, Schwartz says, it's also easy for us to imagine alternatives that don't actually exist and are a combination of the attractive features of the alternatives that do exist. We've essentially created greater expectations than we could possibly meet.\n\n\"To the extent that we engage our imaginations in this way, we will be even less satisfied with the alternative we end up choosing,\" he writes. Greater variety in this way actually makes us feel worse off.\n\nEven if you've made a good decision, Schwartz says, when your choice isn't perfect, knowing there were alternatives out there makes it easy to imagine you could have made a better choice.\n\nThis leads you to regret the decision you made, which leads to dissatisfaction, even if it was a good decision.\n\nThe emotional cost of potential trade-offs also interferes with the quality of decisions we make, Schwartz says. When we feel bad about choosing, we begin to lose focus and instead of examining all aspects of a decision, we home in on a couple of aspects, some that might not be that important.\n\nOur negative emotions associated with having to choose can also distract us from the decision itself, Schwartz says, which impairs our decision-making abilities.\n\nPeople tend to resist making decisions when there are so many trade-offs, which can lead to postponing or avoiding making the decision, Schwartz says.\n\nThis may not be so serious when you're choosing which new smartphone to buy or what to eat for lunch, but it can have detrimental affects on your future, like when choosing which retirement savings plan to settle on.\n\nSchwartz points to numerous studies that found when there are two options with a clear winner, most people made a decision - but when people are presented with options involving trade-offs that create conflict, all choices begin to look unappealing, and people are less likely to make a decision.\n\n\"Nobody has the time or cognitive resources to be completely thorough and accurate with every decision, and as more decisions are required and more options are available, the challenge of doing the decision making correctly becomes ever more difficult to meet,\" Schwartz writes.\n\nSchwartz says preparing for, making, reevaluating, and perhaps regretting the vastly greater number of choices we have today eats up one of our most valuable resources: time.\n\n\"Time spent dealing with choice is time taken away from being a good friend, a good spouse, a good parent, and a good congregant,\" he says.\n\nIn Schwartz 's study of people who always look for the best option, whom he calls maximizers, compared with people who are OK settling for something that's good enough, whom he calls satisficers, he found maximizers experienced less satisfaction with life, were less happy, were less optimistic, and were more depressed than satisficers.\n\nWhile Schwartz notes that the study finding does not mean being a maximizer causes unhappiness, he personally believes that being a maximizer plays a causal role in people's unhappiness.\n\nSome psychologists believe that making a number of small decisions like what to wear and what to eat wears out your brain and saps the mental power that you could be using for more pressing matters, which is often referred to as decision fatigue.\n\nThey posit that your pool of decision-making energy is limited, and eventually, as your willpower depletes with each new decision you make, you're more likely to either act impulsively or do nothing.\n\nIt's why the likes of President Barack Obama and Steve Jobs limited their clothing options - making too many trivial decisions would waste their ability to make other, more pressing decisions down the road.\n\nAs Obama explained during a 2012 interview with Vanity Fair when he revealed why he only wears gray or blue suits:\n\nI'm trying to pare down decisions. I don't want to make decisions about what I'm eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.\n\n\"It seems to me that the most striking trend is the appearance of social media,\" Schwartz told Pacific Mag last year . \"My suspicion is that it and dating sites have created just the thing I talk about in connection with consumer goods: Nobody's good enough and you're always worried you're missing out.\"\n\nThough the concept behind FOMO is fundamental to the paradox of choice, and indeed our human existence, the term itself is a millennial invention brought about by social media.\n\n\"Nobody makes plans because something better might turn up, and the result is that nobody ever does anything,\" Schwartz says.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "I'm childless by choice. I learned from my family that not everyone needs to become a parent.\n\nOne afternoon in my mid-30s, I was in the office of a worried-looking endocrinologist. \"I have to talk to you about your family plans,\" he said. \"There's no easy way to say this.\"\n\nHe told me my thyroid didn't work properly, and that my options for having a child would be complicated, expensive, and possibly fruitless. All the while, he scanned my face for signs of an impending breakdown that never arrived.\n\nI found the diagnosis comforting. I've always known I didn't want children, and I've always been told that I'd change my mind - that I just had to meet the right person, that it was something I'd regret one day.\n\nSome people accused me of being selfish; some even suggested that I should have a baby and trust that my mothering instincts would kick in.\n\nThe news from the endocrinologist was an affirmation. It turned out that \"I can't\" was the retort I didn't know I needed.\n\nI'm the last in a line of women who didn't want to be mothers. Even my own mother would agree that having children wasn't part of her original life plan. \"I never wanted kids,\" she often said. \"But I guess I'll keep you!\"\n\nShe'd laugh when she said it, but that didn't mean it wasn't true. There were three reasons she agreed to have kids. Two of them were because my father promised they'd both keep their jobs and that they'd be a team.\n\nHer mother hated having kids. She was abusive and generally terrible at it, and I remember my father's mother being mostly indifferent. Ultimately, my father wasn't much for parenting either. He left when I was about 5 years old.\n\nSome people become parents not because they want to, but because they have to.\n\nMy grandmothers had children because that was just what was done. My mother, a brilliant computer programmer, got stuck with it. When my father left, she tried to make the best of it and hired people to help until we couldn't afford it anymore. I was 9 years old when I learned to do grocery shopping. I always knew I wanted a different kind of life, and I chose accordingly.\n\nMy mother made choices, too. Before she had children, she chose to have an abortion. She'll tell anyone who'll listen that she's never regretted it, and that being able to choose when to have children was the third reason she agreed to do it at all. While her mid-1960s abortion was illegal in the US, the availability of abortions has always been about where and who you are.\n\nIt's now 2021, and people are trying to take away access to abortion care. There's SB 8 in Texas and more than a dozen laws-in-progress in other states, as well as the looming threat of a Roe v. Wade reversal. Like it always has, this legislation will mostly affect people already critically underserved by healthcare.\n\nNone of it will stop people from choosing not to have children. People have been doing that for as long as they've been getting pregnant.\n\nI'm child-free because I chose to be, and my life is wonderfully full of all the things I hoped I'd have. I want that choice to be there for everyone. Maybe being child-free is a rest stop, or maybe it's your destination. Either way, parenting isn't for everyone, and it shouldn't have to be.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "School choice is gaining momentum, and it's on the ballot in 3 states. We want to hear what you think.\n\nSchool choice is a hotly debated issue - and it's on the ballot in a few states.\n\nColorado, Kentucky, and Nebraska are allowing residents to vote on school choice, which allows families to use public funds to cover costs if they choose to send their kids to a school outside their local district, including charter and private schools.\n\nAdvocates have said it allows families to choose the school that best fits their child's needs, giving parents more freedom to decide among the educational options their community provides. Critics have said that school choice puts public education at risk by diverting funds away from public schools and that some school choice initiatives have disproportionately helped wealthier families .\n\nSome voters will have a say on the issue. Colorado's Amendment 80 establishes a constitutionally protected right to school choice for children from kindergarten through 12th grade. If the amendment passes, families in the state will be able to secure funds to choose between public schools, private schools, charter schools, and homeschooling.\n\nThe Kentucky ballot initiative - Amendment 2 - would allow the state to fund education costs for students from kindergarten through 12th grade who are outside the public school system. The Kentucky Center for Economic Policy estimated the initiative would cost the state $1.19 billion annually. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said the proposal would put public school budgets at risk, while Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican, said it would support parents who want to have a say in their kids' educations.\n\nNebraska's Referendum 435 gives voters the opportunity to decide whether they want to retain or repeal an existing state law that allocates $10 million a year for parents to send their kids to private schools. If the law is repealed, it would get rid of the state's school choice program.\n\nIf the state ballot initiatives pass, they would build on the existing school choice programs across the country. Over the past few years, some states, like Ohio and Arkansas, have expanded their school voucher programs to allow most parents to receive funding to send their children to private schools. Arizona added to the momentum by creating the first universal voucher program in 2022, and nearly 30 states have some form of a school choice program.\n\nSchool choice remains a partisan issue, and experts and lawmakers have debated the merits of boosting funding for public education and allowing parents to choose where their children go to school.\n\nJump to"

I, and I am sure many other advocates at the state level, look forward to seeing the recommendations put forth on this uniquely popular issue.\"\n\nThe Education Department announced Sunday that it was recognizing this week as National School Choice Week , highlighting \"education freedom\" by sharing options for students and families, including public schools, charter schools, private schools and home-schooling.\n\n\"School choice empowers parents and guardians to pursue the best learning environment for their children,\" the department said in a release. \"It allows for innovative schooling models and methods that meet the unique needs of students across the nation.\"\n\nCritics of school choice, which provides vouchers allowing families to pick schools for their children, argue that it hurts public schools.\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said at the union's annual convention last year that research shows vouchers \"negatively affect achievement.\"\n\n\"Today, vouchers subsidize wealthy families who already send their kids to private and religious schools,\" she said. \"Privatizers fund those giveaways by defunding and destabilizing public schools.\"\n\nTrump campaigned on expanding school choice programs, and during the transition period, his spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, said he believed that \" school choice is the civil rights issue of our time \" and that it would \"ensure all families have access to a great education, no matter their ZIP code.\"\n\nThe White House on Wednesday also announced that Trump signed an executive order aimed at \"ending radical indoctrination in K-12 schooling.\"\n\nThe order directs several Cabinet members within 90 days to \"provide an Ending Indoctrination Strategy to the President\" that includes eliminating funding for \"illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools.\"\n\nThe order also references the 1776 Commission, an initiative from Trump's first term that his administration argued would reintroduce patriotism into school curricula.\n\nThe Senate has not yet confirmed Trump's nominee for education secretary, Linda McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO who was head of the Small Business Administration during Trump's first administration.\n\nYamiche Alcindor and Rebecca Shabad reported from Washington.

In his state, Hansford worries that a proposed private school tuition support bill wouldn't help local families who are unable to drive to reach those schools and may not find the special education services they rely on once they get there.\n\n\"How is it 'choice' when there's no transportation or special education services provided?\" Hansford wrote recently on Facebook about the Mississippi bill. \"School choice with no transportation for families without a car is no choice at all.\"\n\nLast month, Trump signed an executive order directing the Education Department to identify ways federal funding could support students attending private and faith-based schools. On social media, he has urged legislators in Texas and Idaho to pass proposals to create private school vouchers or similar programs, and Linda McMahon, his nominee for education secretary, has backed the programs, as well .\n\nIdaho's bill, which would provide up to $5,000 in tax credits for many students attending private school, \"has my complete and total support, MUST PASS!\" Trump posted Sunday on Truth Social .\n\nIdaho's Senate did just that Wednesday , and is now set to join the more than two dozen other states that have some form of public funding for private schools, according to EdWeek . The Texas bill appears likely to succeed , as well .\n\nBut Republicans in some states where Trump has won by wide margins, including Mississippi and South Dakota, this year chose not to advance bills that would expand financial support for private schools.\n\nIt's one of the few visible chasms in a party that has widely supported Trump 's agenda . Some conservatives see sending public money to private schools as antithetical to the philosophy of less government and less spending, while Trump has framed it as a way to give parents more control over their children's education. A White House spokesperson said Trump's executive order aims to allow families to choose schools that \"fit\" their children's needs.\n\nTo Patrick Wolf, a professor studying education policy at the University of Arkansas, the debate shows a looming battle in the Republican Party \"between pushing national policies that they think are good everywhere and respecting their commitment to federalism,\" he said, referring to the idea of sharing power between local and federal governments.\n\nThe stakes for those who don't comply with the national party's view are rising.\n\n\"It's become a litmus test,\" Wolf said. \"Republicans who voted against school choice do have a target on their backs. It certainly leaves them vulnerable to being primaried.\"\n\nThat's what happened in Texas, where at least nine Republicans who rejected previous voucher bills were ousted in primaries last year .\n\n\"Politics in Texas is a blood sport,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston.\n\nThis is the first session since those primaries, and voucher proponents are excited about a bill the Senate has passed t o give families $10,000 - or more if their child ren ha ve disabilit ies - for private school tuition .\n\n\"I think this push from President Trump is kind of what the proponents needed in the final 500 yards,\" Rottinghaus said. \"It's an accelerant for the last and hardest push.\"\n\nThe Texas bill also drew strong support from Gov. Greg Abbott, who has crisscrossed the state promoting voucher legislation, appearing this week with a San Antonio legislator who ousted an anti-voucher Republican. The legislation is now before the House, where , Speaker Dustin Burrows said Monday, \"the votes are there.\"\n\nIn Idaho, too, legislators have faced primaries for opposing vouchers. At least four Republican lawmakers who had blocked bills previously lost their seats in the most recent elections. Two of them faced opposition from the American Federation for Children , a conservative nonprofit group, whose Idaho affiliate spent more than $500,000 in Idaho's elections last year. A Democratic incumbent the group opposed was also unseated. \"Politicians should fear losing their seats if they ignore their constituents on this issue,\" Tommy Schultz, the group's CEO, said in a statement.\n\nBetween those electoral challenges and Trump's recent post, \"you see why there might be pressure to compromise,\" said Jaclyn Kettler, a political science professor at Boise State University.\n\nHowever, in South Dakota, which Trump won by 29 points last fall, three \"school choice\" bills have failed this year .\n\nKyle Schoenfish, a Republican who chairs the Senate Education Committee, said he worried that a proposal to siphon off property taxes to help fund private school scholarships could harm public school districts. That could lead communities to raise property taxes, in contrast with the conservative aim to \"look for ways to lower them,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not opposition to school choice necessarily, just the question of what should government pay for and what's more fiscally conservative or responsible,\" Schoenfish said.\n\nIn Mississippi, where Republicans hold all statewide offices and control both legislative chambers, lawmakers quickly aligned themselves with Trump's crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives by passing bills this session to ban such programs in public schools and universities.\n\nBut a House proposal to allow children from academically struggling districts to receive state-funded scholarships to private schools died without the chamber's taking a vote.\n\nGrant Callen, the founder and CEO of Empower Mississippi, which promotes \"school choice,\" attributed the failure to lobbying from local school officials.\n\nFor some legislators, he said, \"you're more concerned about what your superintendent thinks than what your president thinks.\"\n\nHansford, the Union superintendent, agreed. While Trump's messaging on the economy and \"America First\" resonates, he said, \"when it gets to the minutiae of it, it's more about what's personal to people.\" And in his town, that's the Union Yellow Jackets .\n\nBracey Harris is a national reporter for NBC News, based in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

That was true in 2004, when John Kerry tried to make the presidential campaign all about George W. Bush's leadership of the economy and the war. The Bush campaign was determined to fight the Kerry campaign's construction and wanted to disqualify Kerry, making wavering swing voters think twice about simply using their votes to express displeasure with the incumbent.\n\nA similar phenomenon took place in 2012, with the party roles reversed. Mitt Romney got the most traction whenever the campaign narrative became more of a referendum on Barack Obama's handling of the economy specifically and Washington generally. But, like Bush's, the Obama team was determined to make the election a choice between two competing visions. One line from that campaign stands out to me as quite illustrative of this successful shift by Obama: The incumbent played off the old Ronald Reagan question from 1980 - \"are you better off now than you were four years ago?\" - and asked voters \"are you going to be better off four years from now\" under Obama policies or Romney policies.\n\nIn 2016, we saw one of the great misinterpretations of a campaign in a long time. Both parties were convinced their best path to victory rested solely on turning the campaign into a character referendum on the other nominee. The campaigns of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump messaged their campaigns accordingly. And swing voters waffled at times, it seemed, on whether they were voting for their candidate or voting against the opponent.\n\nWhile many Washington elites and the professional media class believed the final votes would ultimately come down to a character-based referendum on Trump, it turned out that these folks were half-right: It did come down to a \"character-based referendum\" - but on Clinton.\n\nThe cleanest examples of \"anti-incumbent\" campaigns were in 2008 and 2020, one a referendum on a party (the GOP in 2008) and the other a referendum on a person (Trump in 2020).\n\nAnd that brings us to 2024 and the battle between the two likely major party nominees to make this campaign a referendum on the other guy.\n\nRight now, as our latest poll has indicated, many swing voters view this election as a referendum more on Biden than on Trump - for now. The simple fact that more voters believe age is a bigger concern for Biden than the legal issues are for Trump shows the potential for this campaign to turn more into a negative referendum on Biden.\n\nOf course, Biden does have one giant advantage in terms of avoiding a referendum solely on him: Trump's erratic behavior.\n\nThis weekend was the latest example of Trump's caring more about airing and defending a grievance than he does actually winning an election. In Campaign 101, they teach you that when your opponent is in the midst of a negative feeding frenzy, simply get out of the way. But Trump, as he has demonstrated numerous times, appears to be incapable of self-control, so he went on an anti-NATO rant that would have found common cause with Russia's own English-language propaganda arm, RT. Trump has made it clear: He really doesn't care if Ukraine ends up a part of Russia. And that lack of conviction scares the living you-know-what out of our allies in Europe.\n\nIn fact, many semi-alarmed Washington Democrats comfort themselves about Biden's current standing because Trump is the opponent. That's why, despite the primal scream from voters  (including half of Democrats) demanding a different option, there are so few members of the Democratic establishment elite who feel comfortable going public in agreeing with that sentiment, for fear of being attacked for offering aid and comfort to Trump.\n\nThis brings me to the question of whether Biden wants a \"choice\" election or not.\n\nObviously, the campaign wants to avoid the election becoming a referendum on Biden and his ability to function in the job. And if Democrats want it to be a choice election, do they want it to be a choice based on character or on policy? I think the obvious answer is that, despite how tempting the character argument looks, it's probably smarter (and safer) to attempt to make this a choice election based on policy.\n\nThat's because if there's one enduring lesson of the last 30 years, it's that character rarely counts with voters. We preach that it does, but voters usually vote on character only when they feel they have the luxury - meaning their own lives are going well both culturally and financially. Character-focused campaigns failed against Bill Clinton twice, they failed against Trump in 2016, and they failed in the primaries against Trump this election cycle because even if the voters didn't like the behavior of the men, they did like what they were saying or promising.\n\nNow, I'm not saying ignore Trump's bad character. But I'd basically use the character argument in only a few ways, including how his behavior impedes the opportunity to find consensus on thorny issues - which was the hallmark of Trump's unsuccessful first term. He let so many opportunities for bipartisan wins go out the door simply because he couldn't help himself. He is always his own worst enemy. It's a defining characteristic of his failures in business and politics, many of which could have been avoided simply by his behaving less erratically.\n\nBut the character argument really works only for that small slice of college-educated voters who may philosophically lean right on fiscal and cultural issues but can't stomach voting for him - basically, the folks at the likes of The Bulwark and the Lincoln Project!\n\nIf character is out, then clearly the Biden team has to ground its \"choice\" argument more in policy. So what does the second term's agenda look like, you ask? Good question, because so far, most of the rhetoric about a second term from either Biden or the White House generally is some form of \"finish what we started\" or \"preserve and enact what we've already done.\"\n\nPerhaps Biden will use his State of the Union address in March - just two days after Super Tuesday and most likely the unofficial end of the primary season - as the place to lay out what he wants to get done in a second term. Whenever he does it, he needs to start doing it soon. I think the lack of an agenda his campaign can rally around only makes the other concerns of the Biden base more acute, including the president's physical limitations.\n\nI think part of the lack of enthusiasm of the Biden base is due to the missing agenda piece. Whatever one thinks of Trump, his vision for a second term is quite vivid. In fact, I'd argue the nonactivist media has spent a lot more time focusing on what a second Trump term could mean than it has on what a second Biden term would mean. And a big reason for that is that Biden hasn't really offered up much about what more he wants to do.\n\nThat doesn't mean Biden should campaign on unrealistic things, like canceling all student debt, but he needs to outline an agenda that's both aspirational and realistic. And at some point, he needs to address the voters who aren't happy with his tenure but still might vote for him because they can't stand Trump.\n\nHow is he going to promise that Washington, under his watch during a second term, will become less dysfunctional than it was during his first term? Because I think he does need to promise that to the exhausted, depressed middle of the electorate. Obama used to use the construction \"the fever will break\" in the GOP if he got a second term. It turns out he wasn't right, but it was something that seemed realistic enough to promise the moody moderates.\n\nPerhaps Biden makes a similar promise, even though his assurance early in the 2020 campaign that a Biden win would cause a gridlock-breaking GOP \"epiphany\" proved false. Perhaps Biden argues that a second defeat of Trump would really break the fever in the GOP and push it to be more forward-looking, rather than simply be a party defined more by what it doesn't like in America. But the point is, Biden needs to start campaigning for something more than just \"not Trump\" if he has any hope of building enthusiasm among his own voters.\n\nOf course, there could be another explanation for why the Biden team has been reluctant to talk up a second-term agenda: fear of dividing its own base.\n\nThis fear of dividing the Democratic Party is something Matthew Yglesias offers up in his influential Substack this week as an alternative theory for why the Biden White House is so protective of his public appearances.\n\n\"His staff have an incorrect theory of American politics,\" Yglesias writes , arguing that the Biden campaign apparatus and White House operatives all subscribe to a base mobilization strategy that calls for avoiding any issues that could disrupt or annoy the Democratic base. And he also believes Biden's staff and the activists who make up the various identity and issue factions of the Democratic Party are, essentially, much more progressive and secular than Biden himself is.\n\nSo if you believe the best way to win an election is to simply mobilize your core supporters and you work for a president of another generation, you may fear putting him out there and contradicting a belief or a talking point that would make one of your base groups angry. Yglesias notes the example of Biden, in the early aftermath of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, getting attacked by certain factions on the left because he continued to express a personal position on abortion through the prism of his Catholic faith. That is, that he's personally conflicted even if he's not politically conflicted.\n\nAll of this goes back to the debate inside the Democratic Party about which direction it should take to win general elections. The progressive wing is definitely on the rise, and progressive adherents are now running most parts of the Democratic Party's formal and informal structure. In fact, I'd argue that Biden is most likely personally to the right of most of his most vocal supporters.\n\nYglesias concludes: \"We have a clear public record that it is Team Biden's considered opinion that Joe Biden's pre-2016 record in politics is cringe and bad and that they need to craft a different, more progressive persona for him. If you think that strategy is correct, then it follows that unscripted events are dangerous. Not because he might accidentally say Mexico when he clearly meant Egypt, but because he might accidentally say he has religious objections to abortion when he does, in fact, have religious objections to abortion.\"\n\nMany progressives don't accept the premise that primary voters chose Biden in 2020 because they thought most of his primary opponents were too liberal to win. They believe he got the nomination simply because Covid short-circuited the primary debate and forced a quick consolidation.\n\nBut is it also possible that Biden was seen as the acceptable alternative by many Democrats and non-Trump Republicans simply because he was more moderate than the base of the Democratic Party? What Biden's staff treats like a bug in dealing with the key interest groups that make up the Democratic coalition is most likely a feature for many middle-of-the-road voters. And unscripted Biden is more likely to sound like a moderate than scripted Biden. And let's not forget, when voters themselves are asked to self-identify their ideologies, \"moderate\" and \"conservative\" are always first or second in some order. \"Liberal\" is always third.\n\nNATO has more than a Trump problem. NATO has a Republican Party problem.\n\nThe issue of NATO, of course, all depends on your own point of view. But I'd be careful being too dismissive of the growing isolationist viewpoint inside the GOP as something that's just a product of Trump's rhetoric. Many families in rural America, where isolationist sentiment has gotten the most traction, saw many of their sons and daughters sign up for service to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan - two wars that many Americans now aren't convinced were worth it. Sure, we got 9/11 terrorist attacks' mastermind Osama bin Laden and helped Iraq start a fledgling democracy, but was the price in line with the result?\n\nIt's that recent experience that has many hawkish Republican elected officials starting to rethink their stances on these issues if they want to get re-elected in this iteration of the GOP.\n\nTo put it another way, answer this question: Would it better position a Republican candidate to win a primary by being for more aid to Ukraine or less? I'd argue that in most areas of this country, it's easier to navigate a GOP primary without Ukraine on the agenda.\n\nSo, yes, Patti Davis , we are a long way from the GOP of your father, Ronald Reagan, when it comes to \"peace through strength.\" In fact, we are much closer to the Republican Party of the Calvin Coolidge era than we are to the Reagan era.\n\nI've promised myself (and my editors) that I wouldn't turn this column into a place to debate the role of the media in our politics. But the amount of lazy and sloppy analysis of the media that exists these days is truly astonishing. So for those in the content creation business who think media-bashing is the best way to grift people into giving them their clicks and attention, try a little accuracy.\n\nHere's my basic answer on media bias: All humans are born with \"original bias,\" so trying to disprove bias is, well, inhuman. Most well-funded newsrooms - and by \"well-funded,\" I mean newsrooms that care as much about editors as they do reporters - care more about fairness and accuracy than they do balance. How does one \"balance\" the truth? That's why \"fair and balanced\" is a right-wing dog whistle and not a mainstream journalistic ethos.\n\nThe largest group of media entities these days is not the well-funded newsrooms but the small specialty shops that promise to be biased in their coverage - biased either by an issue, toward a person or for a point of view. And it's this group of \"media\" that gives the \"fairness and accuracy\" crowd its bad name. Many in this second group of media entities have premised their business model on creating the narrative that the larger news organizations are biased against them in some way. This creates the echo chamber effect about \"media distrust,\" with a whole slew of mom-and-pop \"media\" outlets/newsletters searching for any large media mistake to amplify as a way to build up their own fledgling followings.\n\nOf course, when these smaller media entities make factual errors or are intentionally biased, they don't get any scrutiny. In fact, I'd argue the pursuit and fact-checking of the bad-faith media actors has driven some journalists and well-meaning media outlets into a bad place on press freedom and freedom of thought in general.\n\nBottom line: Believe what you want about any specific media outlet, but just try to realize \"the media\" these days has never been this diverse ideologically and this \"diverse\" factually. So be careful conflating honest brokers with the dishonest grifters whose sole source of income is outrage clicks.\n\nChuck Todd is NBC News' chief political analyst and the former moderator of \" Meet The Press .\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The past year saw not only an expansion in the use of ranked-choice systems but also increased interest in instituting it more widely. And in 2023, legislatures in at least 14 states will consider bills that would move them to this increasingly popular model.\n\nIn ranked-choice elections, voters identify their first choices on their ballots, then rank the other candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes on the first count, the election moves to an instant runoff. The candidate with the fewest votes gets eliminated, and ballots cast for that candidate are recast for voters' second choices. The process repeats itself until a candidate reaches a majority.\n\nAdvocates of ranked-choice voting have long said the setup benefits moderate candidates who don't play to either party's fringe and work instead to appeal to the broadest number of people.\n\nState lawmakers in both major parties seem to be listening to that argument.\n\nJust two weeks into 2023, lawmakers in 14 states have introduced, filed and prefiled 27 bills that propose various iterations of ranked-choice voting, according to an NBC News review.\n\nSome bills propose implementing the system for statewide and federal elections; others propose limiting its use to primary elections. Bills in some states propose ranked-choice voting only for local elections, while others offer a temporary pilot system that would test the use of ranked-choice voting for a fixed number of years.\n\nThe variety and quantity underscore a growing trend in elections across the country: ranked-choice voting is clearly on the rise.\n\n\"This year we're already seeing a lot of state legislation, and we're going to see a lot more,\" said Rob Richie, the president and CEO of FairVote, a national nonpartisan group that has for decades worked to advance the use of ranked-choice voting in the U.S. \"Some of it will pass.\"\n\nIn Virginia, for example, four state lawmakers from both major parties last week introduced bills that would advance ranked-choice voting in the state. Two would allow it for presidential primaries, starting in 2024, one would allow it for any primary elections and one would expand the state's current ranked-choice pilot program for use in all local elections.\n\nIn 2020, Virginia lawmakers enacted a pilot program for ranked-choice voting in local elections through 2031; a handful of localities have so far used the system. The state GOP used a ranked-choice voting system at its state convention in 2021 to select a gubernatorial nominee. Supporters of the system say it more easily allows a candidate with broad crossover appeal to advance; the winner, Glenn Youngkin, went on to win the general election.\n\n\"Advocates all over the country use the GOP nominating contest in Virginia as a prominent successful test case. And that's important because sometimes it gets painted as a progressive issue, and it's really not. It really benefits both parties, and that's such a good example of it being used on the right,\" said Liz White, the executive director of UpVote Virginia, a nonpartisan election reform organization that supports ranked-choice voting.\n\n\"It really appears that both parties in Virginia are moving steadily down a road toward accepting RCV on a wider scale,\" White said.\n\nIn Connecticut, state Rep. Keith Denning, a Democrat, introduced a bill that would establish a ranked-choice voting system for all state and federal elections, and Rep. David Michel, also a Democrat, introduced a bill that would allow ranked-choice voting in all local and municipal elections.\n\nLawmakers in Oklahoma and Montana introduced bills that would allow officials to enact ranked-choice voting in all elections, and Wyoming legislators proposed creating a pilot program for its use in local and municipal elections in the state.\n\nBills in Maryland and Massachusetts would allow specific towns and cities to use ranked-choice voting in their elections, while bills in Missouri and New Hampshire would create rules for ranked-choice voting, possibly setting the stage for future legislation that would authorize use of the system.\n\nA bill in Oregon proposes using ranked-choice voting in federal and state elections, a bill in New Jersey proposes using it in all elections in the state, and a New York bill would change all nonpartisan primary elections to a ranked-choice voting system.\n\nIn addition, local ballot measures have already been placed and scheduled to occur in 2023 that would allow voters direct say over whether to enact ranked-choice voting in their local elections. Those are in Redondo Beach, California, and Burlington, Vermont. Both ballot measures are scheduled to be voted on in March.\n\nDiscussions are also underway among policymakers in Arizona, who are looking at ranked-choice voting as a possible way of curbing extremism .\n\n\"This is going to be a year of progress,\" FairVote's Richie said.\n\nRanked-choice voting advocates like Richie say they're amped about that progress and continue to argue that the system changes politics for the better by incentivizing candidates to avoid pandering to their bases and going negative. They say that's because those candidates must continue to appeal to voters as a second, third or even fourth choice in elections given the way most ranked-choice voting models function.\n\n\"It's very simple where the virtues come from. If you're limited to a single choice, your overt engagement with a field of candidates is limited to that single choice. If you become aligned with that single choice you stop thinking. But when you're given the opportunity to consider multiple candidates, you're expanding the number of reasons for engagement to happen, for conversations to happen.\"\n\nThe latest raft of proposed legislation follows a year of notable and growing enthusiasm for ranked-choice voting. In 2022, lawmakers in 25 states introduced legislation advancing or expanding ranked-choice voting, with bills enacted in six states, according to FairVote. Voters in eight jurisdictions passed ballot measures adopting ranked-choice voting. That included Nevada, where voters approved a citizen-led constitutional amendment to institute ranked-choice voting in all statewide general elections except the presidential election. Under Nevada law, the measure must pass again in 2024 to take effect.\n\nIn 2022, Alaska became the second state to use ranked-choice voting in state and federal elections (Maine has used the system in state and federal elections since 2018 ), and the number of cities and towns that switched to ranked-choice voting grew to more than 50 .\n\nIn many states, some of the purported strengths of the system promised by supporters - such as a rejection of polarizing candidates - came to fruition. In Alaska, for example, where ranked-choice voting was used for the first time in the state's Senate and congressional races, voters chose incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Mary Peltola for those offices over more extreme candidates.\n\n\"Ranked-choice voting forces candidates to build coalitions and appeal to people they're not used to appealing to,\" said White, of UpVote Virginia. \"And it forces voters to do the same with candidates they may not have otherwise taken a look at.\"\n\nAdam Edelman is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

A pack of noodles could increase by at least a dollar. The cost of takeout containers could hike up delivery prices.\n\nOverall, businesses in Chinatown neighborhoods nationwide, which are particularly import-heavy, are looking at a potential 8% increase in prices.\n\nBut tariff fears are not just about financial concerns. In Chinatowns across the country, people worry about the loss of cultural traditions and the already high rates of poverty in these largely immigrant communities. In New York City, for example, 28% of Chinatown residents live below the poverty line.\n\nChinatowns contends with a unique crisis because many of the items sold there aren't often available on mainstream platforms like Amazon. And there's simply not enough demand for them for companies to build factories in the U.S.\n\nTrump added a 10% tariff on all imports from China this week on top of a previous 10% tariff he had imposed on Chinese goods last month. These are in addition to tariffs of up to 25% Trump imposed during his first term. He said the import taxes, which he also imposed on Canada and Mexico before temporarily pausing them, will be in place until China takes action to reduce the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nChina has retaliated by imposing tariffs of its own on the U.S., adding up to 15% on some U.S. goods.\n\n\"The Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said during a Tuesday briefing.\n\nMany of the stores in Chinatowns across the U.S. source the majority of their items from China. Wing On Wo & Co. in New York City, for example, gets 90% of its goods from the country. Lining the shelves are porcelain and ceramic wares, from ornate patterned serving trays to incense holders shaped like bok choy leaves. Fifth-generation store owner Mei Lum said much about the store's business strategy, particularly during its busy season around Lunar New Year and Christmas, is now uncertain.\n\nNBC News spoke to more than half a dozen shop and restaurant owners who said these communities, as they have done in the past, are intent on finding a way to endure.\n\n\"Something that I'm holding on to is that folks in Chinatown are really resourceful. They're really innovative,\" Lum said. \"They figure out ways to support each other.\"\n\nKenny Li, who has run the Asian home goods shop K.K. Discount Store in Manhattan's Chinatown for over 30 years, said that alongside rising rent and overhead costs, tariffs add to a long list of issues that have made it difficult for mom-and-pop shops around the neighborhood to stick around. It's no wonder, he said, that stores like his are disappearing.\n\n\"Right now, this kind of store, they don't have more than two,\" Li said. \"So many people who were open 20, 30 years ago have retired. ... They say they cannot lose money.\"\n\nJust a few minutes' walk from K.K. Discount is Yùnhóng Chopsticks, a small gift shop that gets most of its products from China. Bing Lü, who runs the business with his family, said they've had to add a 3% credit card fee on purchases just to help cover expenses, and they expect to raise prices a bit more due to tariffs.\n\nChris Tang, a professor at UCLA's Anderson School of Management whose area of expertise is global supply chain management, explained that when it comes to Chinatowns, people often rely on the enclaves for products that aren't easily accessible elsewhere. While some supporters think tariffs encourage domestic production, that isn't the case with many cultural items, Tang said.\n\n\"The volume is too small, and it's really only this Chinese population who will buy them. So there's no way for them to create factories to make it in the U.S. The scale is not big enough,\" Tang said. \"So it's certainly the case that they have to import. There's no way out.\"\n\nTang added that consumers likely won't feel the full impact of the tariffs immediately, as it takes a few weeks for the taxes to reach the retail level.\n\nLum's store, which opened in 1925 and remains the longest-operating establishment in Manhattan's Chinatown, sources most of its goods from Jingdezhen, a city in southern China widely known for its porcelain. She said she's already seeing some of the effects of the tariffs, having received a retroactive invoice this week that likely includes tariff-related fees for a shipment from last month. And there's a lot of confusion around how these fees are calculated.\n\n\"Our working-class community here in Chinatown is definitely, in these circumstances, always being hit the hardest,\" Lum said of the neighborhood's small business owners. \"And a lot of them have told me that their solution to mitigating these circumstances has been to eat those costs and only raise those prices by a smidgen, just to make sure they're affordable for the people that frequent their establishments. ... How long can they sustain that?\"\n\nThe comparatively low prices in Chinatowns across the country are largely meant to serve lower-income and working-class families, locals pointed out. In New York City, the neighborhood's median income of $35,805 is significantly lower than that of Manhattan as a whole, at $86,553. A few hours away, in Philadelphia's Chinatown, the poverty rate hovers around 32%.\n\nXu Lin, owner of the restaurant Bubblefish in Philadelphia's Chinatown, said the tariffs could force the enclaves to change their historically low-price image. Takeout containers and other goods that are central to everyday operations are sourced from China, Lin said. Consumers' pivot to delivery apps has already forced restaurants to fork over sizable fees to these companies, cutting into profits, he said. Rising prices have resulted in an almost immediate drop in sales, he said. But he may have no choice but to raise them further with the tariffs.\n\n\"Years and years after Covid, a big portion of our sales still come from delivery sales,\" Lin said. \"If our takeout containers continue to increase, then we'll be forced to increase our delivery.\"\n\nAcross the country in San Francisco's Chinatown, Shelby Wu, who grew up there and now runs the newly opened cafe Fruitful Dreams, said many immigrants in the area have already made financial sacrifices and the tariffs are sure to compound the strain.\n\n\"Most of us, including myself, my family, come from a very low-income background. ... And we do actually rely on affordable and good products in Chinatown,\" Li said. \"People just don't feel the same way anymore. They feel like they lost that type of resource that they used to have.\"\n\nMany Chinatown business owners also voiced concerns about the preservation of culture. Lucas Li's family runs Lion Trading in San Francisco's Chinatown, which sells imported feng shui products and Buddhist and other spiritual supplies. He said age-old practices that involve imported goods could change. His store, for example, sells joss papers and other ceremonial items that are burned during funeral rituals or other occasions to honor ancestors. Younger generations are already shifting away from these practices, and tariffs could mean more loss.\n\n\"When they get expensive, it makes it harder for Chinese people, for their families to maintain those traditions and do it at the proper steps,\" Li said of these ceremonial items. \"When customers shop at local businesses and small businesses, they're not just buying a product, they're basically investing in the community and supporting families and protecting our traditions.\"\n\nUnfortunately, he said, several stores in the area have made the decision to shutter within the next two years, doubtful they can outlast the Trump tariffs.\n\nWu, whose store sells candied fruit skewers known as \"tanghulu\" that require special pots and equipment from China to cook, also said authenticity is at stake.\n\n\"Most of the businesses here will have to rely on American resources, which could be a little bit different than what we can get from China,\" Wu said. \"We might have to change a bit of the way we usually make our traditional foods.\"\n\nGiven the Trump administration's \"America First\" policies, Tang said, it will be an uncertain undertaking to celebrate and honor the diverse cultures across the U.S. - and it will be up to Chinese Americans to fight for their communities.\n\n\"If this is how he's defined what America is, then the question is: Within this framework, would it be possible for different ethnic groups to preserve some of the identity for the historical perspective, for cultural perspective?\" Tang said. \"That remains to be seen, but I think we need more grassroots movement to protect that.\"\n\nLum said that she has no doubt the community will come through.\n\n\"Chinatown has a really strong cultural fabric. We have been, for many generations, stewarding and growing and building upon what our ancestors, who founded Chinatown in the 1890s, have brought over,\" Lum said. \"We have to be creative, and I think that Chinatown and the folks here have proven that they can be in times of oppression.\"\n\nKimmy Yam is a reporter for NBC Asian America.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Photo courtesy of Daniel Flanagan hide caption\n\nDaniel Flanagan lives in Redford, Mich., with his wife and son, Blake (in photo), and daughter, Gabby.  He builds sheds and garages for a living.  Flanagan wrote this essay for an English 101 class at a local community college where he is studying sociology.\n\nI don't know why I came to the decision to become a loser, but I know I made the choice at a young age. Sometime in the middle of fourth grade, I stopped trying.  By the time I was in seventh grade, I was your typical degenerate: lazy, rebellious, disrespectful.  I had lost all social graces.  I was terminally hip and fatally cool.\n\nIt wasn't long after that I dropped out of school and continued my downward spiral.  Hard physical labor was the consequence for the choices I made as an adolescent.  At the age of 21, I was hopelessly lost, and using drugs as a way to deal with the fact that I was illiterate and stuck in a dead-end job carrying roof shingles up a ladder all day.\n\nBut now I believe in do-overs, in the chance to do it all again.  And I believe that do-overs can be made at any point in your life, if you have the right motivation.  Mine came from a surprising source.\n\nIt was September 21, 2002, when my son Blake was born.  It's funny that after a life of avoiding responsibility, now I was in charge of something so fragile.  Over the years, as I grew into the title of Dad, I began to learn something about myself. In a way, Blake and I were both learning to walk, talk, work and play for the first time.  I began my do-over.\n\nIt took me almost three years to learn how to read.  I started with my son's books. Over and over, I practiced reading books to him until I remembered all the words in every one of them.  I began to wonder if it were possible for me to go back to school.  I knew I wanted to be a good role model, so after a year-and-a-half and a lot of hard work, I passed my GED test on my son's fourth birthday.  This may not sound like much, and I'm surely not trying to get praise for doing something that should have been done in the first place, but all things considered it was one of the best days in my life.  Today, I'm a full-time college student, studying to become a sociologist.\n\nIt's funny, growing up I always heard these great turn-around stories of triumph over shortcomings.  But I never thought they applied to me.  Now I believe it's a choice anyone can make:  to do it all over again.\n\nIndependently produced for Weekend Edition Sunday by Jay Allison and Dan Gediman with John Gregory and Viki Merrick.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Here's what you should know about it\n\nMiles Parks\n\nA clerk hands a ballot to a voter on Election Day, Nov. 8, 2022, in Lewiston, Maine. The state is one of 50 American voting jurisdictions to have moved to a ranked choice voting system, and more places may follow next year. Robert F. Bukaty/AP hide caption\n\nA clerk hands a ballot to a voter on Election Day, Nov. 8, 2022, in Lewiston, Maine. The state is one of 50 American voting jurisdictions to have moved to a ranked choice voting system, and more places may follow next year.\n\nMost Americans are worried about the state of U.S. democracy.\n\nPolls over the past year have consistently found 80% or more of Americans are concerned or feel there's a threat to the U.S. democratic system.\n\nThat has many people searching for a solution. And lately one proposed reform seems to be rising to the top.\n\n\"Ranked choice voting is the hot reform,\" said Larry Jacobs, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota. \"It's being driven by deep, almost existential panic about the demise of American democracy. People are looking around what's going to respond to this. And ranked choice voting is the ' it ' reform at this moment.\"\n\nRoughly 50 American voting jurisdictions - from small cities to states - have now moved to a ranked choice voting system, according to tracking by the advocacy group FairVote, and it's shaping up to be one of the political subplots of 2024.\n\nAdvocates say ranked choice voting could help take some of the toxicity out of American politics while giving voters access to a broader swath of ideas. Skeptics worry it makes voting more confusing, which could especially harm voters from marginalized communities.\n\nHere are answers to some commonly asked questions about ranked choice voting:\n\nIn an election that features more than two candidates, most voters are used to picking their favorite and moving on.\n\nBut in a ranked choice system , the voter has the opportunity to instead rank the candidates on the ballot from favorite to least favorite.\n\nIf one candidate has more than half of the first place votes, the election is over and that candidate wins.\n\nIf not, then the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and that candidate's voters are moved to their second choice.\n\nThat keeps going until someone gets majority support.\n\nAdvocates argue that the system incentivizes politicians to find middle ground in their districts, to try to be voters' second and third choices even if they initially like someone more. That should, in theory, lead to less ideologically extreme lawmakers.\n\n\"A lot of voters are frustrated with the status quo in politics, and this method is not a huge change,\" said Deb Otis, who oversees research and policy at FairVote. \"But in the places that use it, it has brought positive impacts.\"\n\nIn Alaska last year, Otis says, the system worked.\n\nVoters there approved a move to a ranked choice voting system in 2020, and the state used it in 2022 for its statewide races. Voters reelected Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who voted to impeach former President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\n\"While similar Republicans - Republicans who maybe bucked their party or appeared bipartisan or moderate like Liz Cheney - were getting knocked out in primaries,\" Otis said. \"[Alaska voters] also elected Mary Peltola to the House, who is considered one of the most moderate Democrats in the House in a race that included a couple of real hardliners who would not be considered moderate by any definition.\"\n\nAnother benefit to ranked choice is allowing voters to voice their true preferences, as opposed to settling.\n\nTake the presidential race. Generally there's a Democratic and a Republican, and whenever someone notable considers running as a third-party candidate, there's a huge amount of hand-wringing over whether it'll have the unintended consequence of helping one candidate or the other by siphoning off votes.\n\nBut in a ranked choice system, theoretically it should allow more candidates to run who represent a wider swath of viewpoints, since voters can feel free to support them without fear of inadvertently helping a candidate they definitely don't want to win.\n\nIn Alaska and Maine, currently the only states that will use ranked choice voting next year in 2024, even if there's a third-party challenger, Otis says voters will be able to just vote for who they want to be president, without trying to game the system.\n\n\"Neighbors won't be telling their neighbors, 'Oh, you're wasting your vote if you vote for so-and-so,' \" Otis said. \"If a legitimate third-party challenge happens this year, all of the other voters in all the other states are going to have a really hard time with that, trying to navigate what to do, trying to play the strategist and figure out how to make our votes most impactful without harming our own side.\"\n\nAdvocates also say ranked choice voting can replace costly and complicated runoff voting systems, like the ones in Georgia among other places, because a ranked choice system is its own form of contained runoff election.\n\nAlaska and Maine are currently the only states to use ranked choice voting in statewide races, but more could soon join them.\n\nVoters in Nevada will vote in 2024 on whether to approve a constitutional amendment that would bring the voting method to the state's congressional and state elections, after clearing the first hurdle to passage in last year's midterms. In Oregon, the legislature this year passed a law to bring the question of ranked choice voting to voters next year too. Ballot measures have also been proposed in other states .\n\nClose to four dozen cities, notably including New York City, have now moved to the voting system for local races as well.\n\nAnd while momentum toward ranked choice has heated up recently, it's not actually new. Cambridge, Mass., adopted the voting method for its city council elections in 1941, and San Francisco has been voting that way since the early 2000s.\n\n\"It tends to start around one or two cities and then a lot of other cities in that region opt in,\" Otis said. \"The Bay Area of California is one of those where they've had new adoptions on the heels of success in San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland. Minnesota is another area. Minneapolis and Saint Paul have had it for years, and then several new Minnesota cities have opted in just over the last four years.\"\n\nBut changing how elections work always brings pushback too.\n\nFive states, all controlled by Republicans, have now banned ranked choice voting in the last two years: Tennessee, Florida, Idaho, Montana and South Dakota.\n\nResistance to the reform hasn't been strictly along party lines, Otis says, but lately conservatives have started to push back more forcefully.\n\n\"It's really regional,\" Otis said. \"In Virginia, the Virginia Republican Party is leading the way on ranked choice voting. But then in Alaska, Republicans have come out against it. In Nevada, both parties opposed their ballot measure [in 2022]. In other places, we've had both parties supporting it.\"\n\nGenerally, ranked choice voting is thought to somewhat dilute the power of the two major political parties in the U.S.\n\nAlaska Division of Elections officials are shown during an Aug. 31, 2022, livestream of the results of a U.S. House special election. The contest won by Democrat Mary Peltola was the first statewide ranked choice vote election in Alaska under an initiative passed by voters in 2020. Becky Bohrer/AP hide caption\n\nConservative groups like the Heritage Foundation and the Honest Elections Project argue that ranked choice voting is a way to \"manipulate elections outcomes\" as a way to \"ensure left-leaning politicians get elected to office.\"\n\nThere's no evidence the voting system actually favors candidates from one political party over the other, however.\n\nBut Jason Snead, of the Honest Elections Project, also told NPR that ranked choice makes voting more confusing, which isn't what the U.S. needs at a time when many voters are already sitting out of the democratic process.\n\n\"I think that we need to be careful about trying to address problems like divisiveness in politics by simply changing the system that we use to elect candidates,\" Snead said. \"Many of the issues that we are experiencing, the bitterness and the division in our politics, are symptoms of other problems. And I don't know that we have to solve something at some sort of system level.\"\n\nEven some experts who are more open-minded to the reform are skeptical it can bring about the sort of transformational change advocates promise.\n\nJacobs, of the University of Minnesota, co-wrote a paper poking holes in a number of claims ranked choice advocates have made about the voting system.\n\nMost notably, he says, there isn't much evidence at this point that it decreases polarization. He does concede, though, it's possible the system just hasn't been in place long enough for the politics to change around it.\n\n\"We need some caution, because in America, we have a tendency going back a century or more to latch on to the new kind of quick fix to what ails us in our democracy,\" he said. \"Some of those things have not worked out well.\"\n\nHe pointed to primary elections , which when they were first implemented were seen by advocates as a change to include more people in the decision-making process. They would take power away from party elites and put it into the hands of voters.\n\n\"Instead, what we see is, it tends to be a fairly small number [of voters participating],\" Jacobs said. \"They tend to be quite ideological, and not representative of the people.\"\n\nWith ranked choice voting, \"there's a logic to it that makes it almost irrefutable,\" Jacobs said.\n\nBut in practice, research has found that the voters who actually take advantage of the ranking opportunities tend to be white voters, and affluent voters with more education.\n\n\"So it's kind of continuing and appearing to multiply the disparities in our current democracy,\" Jacobs said. \"We need to be clear when we say 'democracy' that we mean a system in which there is equal participation.\"\n\nAndrea Benjamin, an expert on race and voting behavior at the University of Oklahoma, agrees. She's optimistic about the potential of ranked choice voting to improve representation in the U.S., but at the end of the day, any real transformative change to the political system will only come from higher voter turnout. You can change vote-tallying methods all you want, she said, but it's still just a snapshot of the most motivated sliver of the population.\n\n\"The only accountability mechanism is that we agree to turn out and that we agree to chime in,\" Benjamin said. \"When we're talking about primaries [that have] 15, 12% turnout ... we are not keeping our end of the bargain.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

In one way, they're advertisements for why Americans should vote for each party's candidates, from president all the way down the ticket.\n\nBut this year, voters in five states will see another question on their ballot: whether to use a different method to elect their representatives.\n\nThe system is known broadly as ranked choice voting. There are different flavors of it. In some cases, it's called \"instant runoff voting\" or \"final five voting.\"\n\nIn all cases, they describe a way of electing candidates that's different from what most Americans are used to. As a voter, you get to rank your preferred candidates. So, you don't just choose one name. You may have a first, second, and third preference for who represents you.\n\nWhen voting is over, a process of elimination takes place. The lowest vote-getter in the first round is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to higher vote-getters, according to how voters ranked the other candidates. The process continues until you end up with a winner. Ranked choice voting systems are already in place for some races in Alaska, Maine, and cities like Minneapolis and New York City.\n\nWhat's driving reformers to push for these ranked choice voting systems in more states?

      "text": "The Mechanics of Choice: More Isn't Always Better\n\nBy\n\nAlix Spiegel\n\nHow does the very American activity of considering as many different choices as possible affect our satisfaction when we finally make a decision?  Does more choice make us happier? Columbia University professor Sheena Iyengar is challenging the assumption that more is better; she argues that the more choices we have, the less happy we are.\n\nMADELEINE BRAND, host: This is DAY TO DAY. I'm Madeleine Brand. ALEX CHADWICK, host: And I'm Alex Chadwick. A recent paper in the journal Psychological Science begins by quoting a proverb: \"Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.\" BRAND: That lesson is examined in the Psychological Science paper, which is all about the psychology of choice. As NPR's Alix Spiegel reports, social scientists are unraveling the way we make choices, and then how we live with them. ALIX SPIEGEL reporting: Most people in our society like to have lots of choices. But in Bara Sapir's(ph) quest for excellence, she leaves no stone unturned. Ms. BARA SAPIR: You know, maybe most people will consider the top ten choices. I might look at the top fifty. SPIEGEL: While Sapir's conscientious about even the trivial choices in her life, it's fair to say that she's especially vigilant about the big ticket items: her college, her work, and now the very important question of who to choose as a life partner. Ms. SAPIR: Dating is a part-time job. It could be fun, but it's a part-time job. SPIEGEL: At 36 years old, Bara Sapir has spent a number of years at this work, dutifully dating and weighing the relative merits of potential mates. Ms. SAPIR: It's like okay, well this guy, this guy isn't Jewish, but he's got all these traits and I feel really great with him. This guy is Jewish, and I feel really good, but I don't know if I feel good enough, and I don't really know if he's on the same page as I am. SPIEGEL: And while this process has yet to yield concrete results, Sapir's pretty confident about her approach. Ms. SAPIR: I like knowing what's out there. Mr. JASON BOOZY(ph): Oh, yeah. Definitely. I've dated a lot of different women in my life. SPIEGEL: Like Bara Sapir, 35-year-old Jason Boozy(ph) has spent a lot of time trying to find someone to spend his life with. And through most of his twenties, Boozy, like Sapir, was convinced that dating a lot of people was the best way to insure that his ultimate decision would last. It helped him, he says, clarify what he did and didn't like. But recently, Boozy has had second thoughts. Mr. BOOZY: I'm not really sure that it's really the best way. But I kind of feel like there's no way I can get out of that, because that's the way it works. And I don't know how to step out of that system. SPIEGEL: In their new study, doing better but feeling worse, psychologist Sheena Iyengar, Rachel Wells, and Barry Schwartz make the case that people like Boozy and Sapir, people who feel compelled to consider a wide range of options usually derive less pleasure from their ultimate choice than people who are satisfied looking at a more limited set of options. The study's lead author, Sheena Iyengar of Columbia University, has literally made a career of studying choice. Her interest in the subject began in graduate school when an upscale grocery store opened near her home and quickly became the talk of the town. Professor SHEENA IYENGAR (Columbia University): I mean, it had something like--well, it had over 300 different types of jams, and 250 different types of mustards. SPIEGEL: For every product on the shelf, there was just an explosion of options. And Iyengar found the store incredibly exciting to visit. Despite this attraction, she rarely bought anything, which puzzled her. Prof. IYENGAR: Kind of made me think, you know, there's more to this notion of choice than what psychology used to think of. SPIEGEL: See, for much of the 20th century, American psychology considered the existence of choice a pre-condition of human happiness and emotional health. In study after study, the value of being able to exercise choice was clear. For example, the study which proved that when old people were given even minor choices, like whether or not they would take care of a plant, they experienced clear benefits. Sheena Iyengar. Prof. IYENGAR: They found that giving these elderly patients these trivial choices created better health. So much so that they, on average, lived about six months longer. SPIEGEL: For psychology then, choice was an absolute good. Choice meant control, and control was critical to well being. That was the story, anyway, until Iyengar. In the late 1990s, Iyengar essentially began an assault on the sacred cow of American culture, an assault which has demonstrated that there are clear limits to the benefits of choice, and fundamentally changed the way that psychologists and economists look at the issue. The recent study in Psychological Science is her latest attack. Its focus is how different choice making strategies effect a person's experience of their ultimate decision. To do the study, Iyengar and her collaborator, Barry Schwartz of Swarthmart, looked at college students who were in the process of job searching. The first thing they did with the students was to give them a test to figure out how they made decisions. Students who routinely considered a wide range of possibilities were labeled maximizers. Students who preferred to look at only a small number of options were called satisficers. The students were then followed until they landed jobs, and the difference between how well these two groups did in terms of average salary--author Barry Schwartz says--was substantial. Professor BARRY SCHWARTZ (Social Theory and Social Action, Swarthmore College): Maximizers got starting salaries at $7,500 more than satisficers, which is a lot. You know, it's a 20-25 percent difference. SPIEGEL: Good news, right? There was just one problem. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Every measure we could take of their psychological states indicated that they felt worse. SPIEGEL: Maximizers felt more depressed, more anxious, more stressed, but why? Schwartz, Wells, and Iyengar believe that it is the very act of considering options that ultimately undermines happiness. Again, Barry Schwartz. Prof. SCHWARTZ: When you consider lots of possibilities, and this is true of jobs, but it can be true of anything, there're going to be a variety of possibilities that you reject that are nonetheless attractive in some way. Normally, there's one alternative's going to be better in some respects, but worse in others. So you're going to be faced with the fact that to choose X, you have to give up something you like about Y. And under those conditions, the more Y's there are, the worse you feel about your choice. SPIEGEL: According to their research, even after making a decision, maximizers appeared to be haunted by the possibility that somewhere out there there was a better option, a perfect solution. And this notion of an elusive best seemed to poison their experience. This result has led Barry Schwartz, at least, to a very controversial conclusion. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Happiness of everybody would be increased if they deliberately limited the number of choices they considered. SPIEGEL: Even if you believed that merely limiting your choices will produce more happiness, as Sheena Iyengar points out, it's probably an impractical solution. Choice is just too much a part of our society. Prof. IYENGAR: I think the real problem is the market place, right? I mean, regardless of whether you want one choice or just a few choices, whatever domain you pick up has a ton of choices. SPIEGEL: Which is an incredibly difficult thing to do. Choice is tempting. The ideology of choice: too powerful. Consider Bara Sapir, the 36 old woman who's searching for a partner. She says that despite the possibility that her process is making her unhappy, she can't imagine giving it up. Nor can she imagine settling for less than the partner she has always envisioned. Ms. SAPIR: No, no. I won't settle. If I decide I want to have children and I am not in a...I'm not in a partnership, then I would do what I would need to do in order to have that child. You know, we have choices now. I have choices now, and there's no, there's no reason for me to settle for anything. SPIEGEL: Alix Spiegel, NPR News. Copyright © 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A recent paper in the journal Psychological Science begins by quoting a proverb: \"Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.\" BRAND: That lesson is examined in the Psychological Science paper, which is all about the psychology of choice. As NPR's Alix Spiegel reports, social scientists are unraveling the way we make choices, and then how we live with them. ALIX SPIEGEL reporting: Most people in our society like to have lots of choices. But in Bara Sapir's(ph) quest for excellence, she leaves no stone unturned. Ms. BARA SAPIR: You know, maybe most people will consider the top ten choices. I might look at the top fifty. SPIEGEL: While Sapir's conscientious about even the trivial choices in her life, it's fair to say that she's especially vigilant about the big ticket items: her college, her work, and now the very important question of who to choose as a life partner. Ms. SAPIR: Dating is a part-time job. It could be fun, but it's a part-time job. SPIEGEL: At 36 years old, Bara Sapir has spent a number of years at this work, dutifully dating and weighing the relative merits of potential mates. Ms. SAPIR: It's like okay, well this guy, this guy isn't Jewish, but he's got all these traits and I feel really great with him. This guy is Jewish, and I feel really good, but I don't know if I feel good enough, and I don't really know if he's on the same page as I am. SPIEGEL: And while this process has yet to yield concrete results, Sapir's pretty confident about her approach. Ms. SAPIR: I like knowing what's out there. Mr. JASON BOOZY(ph): Oh, yeah. Definitely. I've dated a lot of different women in my life. SPIEGEL: Like Bara Sapir, 35-year-old Jason Boozy(ph) has spent a lot of time trying to find someone to spend his life with. And through most of his twenties, Boozy, like Sapir, was convinced that dating a lot of people was the best way to insure that his ultimate decision would last. It helped him, he says, clarify what he did and didn't like. But recently, Boozy has had second thoughts. Mr. BOOZY: I'm not really sure that it's really the best way. But I kind of feel like there's no way I can get out of that, because that's the way it works. And I don't know how to step out of that system. SPIEGEL: In their new study, doing better but feeling worse, psychologist Sheena Iyengar, Rachel Wells, and Barry Schwartz make the case that people like Boozy and Sapir, people who feel compelled to consider a wide range of options usually derive less pleasure from their ultimate choice than people who are satisfied looking at a more limited set of options. The study's lead author, Sheena Iyengar of Columbia University, has literally made a career of studying choice. Her interest in the subject began in graduate school when an upscale grocery store opened near her home and quickly became the talk of the town. Professor SHEENA IYENGAR (Columbia University): I mean, it had something like--well, it had over 300 different types of jams, and 250 different types of mustards. SPIEGEL: For every product on the shelf, there was just an explosion of options. And Iyengar found the store incredibly exciting to visit. Despite this attraction, she rarely bought anything, which puzzled her. Prof. IYENGAR: Kind of made me think, you know, there's more to this notion of choice than what psychology used to think of.

In the late 1990s, Iyengar essentially began an assault on the sacred cow of American culture, an assault which has demonstrated that there are clear limits to the benefits of choice, and fundamentally changed the way that psychologists and economists look at the issue. The recent study in Psychological Science is her latest attack. Its focus is how different choice making strategies effect a person's experience of their ultimate decision. To do the study, Iyengar and her collaborator, Barry Schwartz of Swarthmart, looked at college students who were in the process of job searching. The first thing they did with the students was to give them a test to figure out how they made decisions. Students who routinely considered a wide range of possibilities were labeled maximizers. Students who preferred to look at only a small number of options were called satisficers. The students were then followed until they landed jobs, and the difference between how well these two groups did in terms of average salary--author Barry Schwartz says--was substantial. Professor BARRY SCHWARTZ (Social Theory and Social Action, Swarthmore College): Maximizers got starting salaries at $7,500 more than satisficers, which is a lot. You know, it's a 20-25 percent difference. SPIEGEL: Good news, right? There was just one problem. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Every measure we could take of their psychological states indicated that they felt worse. SPIEGEL: Maximizers felt more depressed, more anxious, more stressed, but why? Schwartz, Wells, and Iyengar believe that it is the very act of considering options that ultimately undermines happiness. Again, Barry Schwartz. Prof. SCHWARTZ: When you consider lots of possibilities, and this is true of jobs, but it can be true of anything, there're going to be a variety of possibilities that you reject that are nonetheless attractive in some way. Normally, there's one alternative's going to be better in some respects, but worse in others. So you're going to be faced with the fact that to choose X, you have to give up something you like about Y. And under those conditions, the more Y's there are, the worse you feel about your choice. SPIEGEL: According to their research, even after making a decision, maximizers appeared to be haunted by the possibility that somewhere out there there was a better option, a perfect solution. And this notion of an elusive best seemed to poison their experience. This result has led Barry Schwartz, at least, to a very controversial conclusion. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Happiness of everybody would be increased if they deliberately limited the number of choices they considered. SPIEGEL: Even if you believed that merely limiting your choices will produce more happiness, as Sheena Iyengar points out, it's probably an impractical solution. Choice is just too much a part of our society. Prof. IYENGAR: I think the real problem is the market place, right? I mean, regardless of whether you want one choice or just a few choices, whatever domain you pick up has a ton of choices. SPIEGEL: Which is an incredibly difficult thing to do. Choice is tempting. The ideology of choice: too powerful. Consider Bara Sapir, the 36 old woman who's searching for a partner. She says that despite the possibility that her process is making her unhappy, she can't imagine giving it up. Nor can she imagine settling for less than the partner she has always envisioned. Ms. SAPIR: No, no. I won't settle. If I decide I want to have children and I am not in a...I'm not in a partnership, then I would do what I would need to do in order to have that child. You know, we have choices now. I have choices now, and there's no, there's no reason for me to settle for anything. SPIEGEL: Alix Spiegel, NPR News. Copyright © 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A recent paper in the journal Psychological Science begins by quoting a proverb: \"Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.\" BRAND: That lesson is examined in the Psychological Science paper, which is all about the psychology of choice. As NPR's Alix Spiegel reports, social scientists are unraveling the way we make choices, and then how we live with them. ALIX SPIEGEL reporting: Most people in our society like to have lots of choices. But in Bara Sapir's(ph) quest for excellence, she leaves no stone unturned. Ms. BARA SAPIR: You know, maybe most people will consider the top ten choices. I might look at the top fifty. SPIEGEL: While Sapir's conscientious about even the trivial choices in her life, it's fair to say that she's especially vigilant about the big ticket items: her college, her work, and now the very important question of who to choose as a life partner. Ms. SAPIR: Dating is a part-time job. It could be fun, but it's a part-time job. SPIEGEL: At 36 years old, Bara Sapir has spent a number of years at this work, dutifully dating and weighing the relative merits of potential mates. Ms. SAPIR: It's like okay, well this guy, this guy isn't Jewish, but he's got all these traits and I feel really great with him. This guy is Jewish, and I feel really good, but I don't know if I feel good enough, and I don't really know if he's on the same page as I am. SPIEGEL: And while this process has yet to yield concrete results, Sapir's pretty confident about her approach. Ms. SAPIR: I like knowing what's out there. Mr. JASON BOOZY(ph): Oh, yeah. Definitely. I've dated a lot of different women in my life. SPIEGEL: Like Bara Sapir, 35-year-old Jason Boozy(ph) has spent a lot of time trying to find someone to spend his life with. And through most of his twenties, Boozy, like Sapir, was convinced that dating a lot of people was the best way to insure that his ultimate decision would last. It helped him, he says, clarify what he did and didn't like. But recently, Boozy has had second thoughts. Mr. BOOZY: I'm not really sure that it's really the best way. But I kind of feel like there's no way I can get out of that, because that's the way it works. And I don't know how to step out of that system. SPIEGEL: In their new study, doing better but feeling worse, psychologist Sheena Iyengar, Rachel Wells, and Barry Schwartz make the case that people like Boozy and Sapir, people who feel compelled to consider a wide range of options usually derive less pleasure from their ultimate choice than people who are satisfied looking at a more limited set of options. The study's lead author, Sheena Iyengar of Columbia University, has literally made a career of studying choice. Her interest in the subject began in graduate school when an upscale grocery store opened near her home and quickly became the talk of the town. Professor SHEENA IYENGAR (Columbia University): I mean, it had something like--well, it had over 300 different types of jams, and 250 different types of mustards. SPIEGEL: For every product on the shelf, there was just an explosion of options. And Iyengar found the store incredibly exciting to visit. Despite this attraction, she rarely bought anything, which puzzled her. Prof. IYENGAR: Kind of made me think, you know, there's more to this notion of choice than what psychology used to think of. SPIEGEL: See, for much of the 20th century, American psychology considered the existence of choice a pre-condition of human happiness and emotional health. In study after study, the value of being able to exercise choice was clear. For example, the study which proved that when old people were given even minor choices, like whether or not they would take care of a plant, they experienced clear benefits. Sheena Iyengar. Prof. IYENGAR: They found that giving these elderly patients these trivial choices created better health. So much so that they, on average, lived about six months longer.

The students were then followed until they landed jobs, and the difference between how well these two groups did in terms of average salary--author Barry Schwartz says--was substantial. Professor BARRY SCHWARTZ (Social Theory and Social Action, Swarthmore College): Maximizers got starting salaries at $7,500 more than satisficers, which is a lot. You know, it's a 20-25 percent difference. SPIEGEL: Good news, right? There was just one problem. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Every measure we could take of their psychological states indicated that they felt worse. SPIEGEL: Maximizers felt more depressed, more anxious, more stressed, but why? Schwartz, Wells, and Iyengar believe that it is the very act of considering options that ultimately undermines happiness. Again, Barry Schwartz. Prof. SCHWARTZ: When you consider lots of possibilities, and this is true of jobs, but it can be true of anything, there're going to be a variety of possibilities that you reject that are nonetheless attractive in some way. Normally, there's one alternative's going to be better in some respects, but worse in others. So you're going to be faced with the fact that to choose X, you have to give up something you like about Y. And under those conditions, the more Y's there are, the worse you feel about your choice. SPIEGEL: According to their research, even after making a decision, maximizers appeared to be haunted by the possibility that somewhere out there there was a better option, a perfect solution. And this notion of an elusive best seemed to poison their experience. This result has led Barry Schwartz, at least, to a very controversial conclusion. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Happiness of everybody would be increased if they deliberately limited the number of choices they considered. SPIEGEL: Even if you believed that merely limiting your choices will produce more happiness, as Sheena Iyengar points out, it's probably an impractical solution. Choice is just too much a part of our society. Prof. IYENGAR: I think the real problem is the market place, right? I mean, regardless of whether you want one choice or just a few choices, whatever domain you pick up has a ton of choices. SPIEGEL: Which is an incredibly difficult thing to do. Choice is tempting. The ideology of choice: too powerful. Consider Bara Sapir, the 36 old woman who's searching for a partner. She says that despite the possibility that her process is making her unhappy, she can't imagine giving it up. Nor can she imagine settling for less than the partner she has always envisioned. Ms. SAPIR: No, no. I won't settle. If I decide I want to have children and I am not in a...I'm not in a partnership, then I would do what I would need to do in order to have that child. You know, we have choices now. I have choices now, and there's no, there's no reason for me to settle for anything. SPIEGEL: Alix Spiegel, NPR News. Copyright © 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

As NPR's Alix Spiegel reports, social scientists are unraveling the way we make choices, and then how we live with them. ALIX SPIEGEL reporting: Most people in our society like to have lots of choices. But in Bara Sapir's(ph) quest for excellence, she leaves no stone unturned. Ms. BARA SAPIR: You know, maybe most people will consider the top ten choices. I might look at the top fifty. SPIEGEL: While Sapir's conscientious about even the trivial choices in her life, it's fair to say that she's especially vigilant about the big ticket items: her college, her work, and now the very important question of who to choose as a life partner. Ms. SAPIR: Dating is a part-time job. It could be fun, but it's a part-time job. SPIEGEL: At 36 years old, Bara Sapir has spent a number of years at this work, dutifully dating and weighing the relative merits of potential mates. Ms. SAPIR: It's like okay, well this guy, this guy isn't Jewish, but he's got all these traits and I feel really great with him. This guy is Jewish, and I feel really good, but I don't know if I feel good enough, and I don't really know if he's on the same page as I am. SPIEGEL: And while this process has yet to yield concrete results, Sapir's pretty confident about her approach. Ms. SAPIR: I like knowing what's out there. Mr. JASON BOOZY(ph): Oh, yeah. Definitely. I've dated a lot of different women in my life. SPIEGEL: Like Bara Sapir, 35-year-old Jason Boozy(ph) has spent a lot of time trying to find someone to spend his life with. And through most of his twenties, Boozy, like Sapir, was convinced that dating a lot of people was the best way to insure that his ultimate decision would last. It helped him, he says, clarify what he did and didn't like. But recently, Boozy has had second thoughts. Mr. BOOZY: I'm not really sure that it's really the best way. But I kind of feel like there's no way I can get out of that, because that's the way it works. And I don't know how to step out of that system. SPIEGEL: In their new study, doing better but feeling worse, psychologist Sheena Iyengar, Rachel Wells, and Barry Schwartz make the case that people like Boozy and Sapir, people who feel compelled to consider a wide range of options usually derive less pleasure from their ultimate choice than people who are satisfied looking at a more limited set of options. The study's lead author, Sheena Iyengar of Columbia University, has literally made a career of studying choice. Her interest in the subject began in graduate school when an upscale grocery store opened near her home and quickly became the talk of the town. Professor SHEENA IYENGAR (Columbia University): I mean, it had something like--well, it had over 300 different types of jams, and 250 different types of mustards. SPIEGEL: For every product on the shelf, there was just an explosion of options. And Iyengar found the store incredibly exciting to visit. Despite this attraction, she rarely bought anything, which puzzled her. Prof. IYENGAR: Kind of made me think, you know, there's more to this notion of choice than what psychology used to think of. SPIEGEL: See, for much of the 20th century, American psychology considered the existence of choice a pre-condition of human happiness and emotional health. In study after study, the value of being able to exercise choice was clear. For example, the study which proved that when old people were given even minor choices, like whether or not they would take care of a plant, they experienced clear benefits. Sheena Iyengar. Prof. IYENGAR: They found that giving these elderly patients these trivial choices created better health. So much so that they, on average, lived about six months longer. SPIEGEL: For psychology then, choice was an absolute good. Choice meant control, and control was critical to well being. That was the story, anyway, until Iyengar. In the late 1990s, Iyengar essentially began an assault on the sacred cow of American culture, an assault which has demonstrated that there are clear limits to the benefits of choice, and fundamentally changed the way that psychologists and economists look at the issue. The recent study in Psychological Science is her latest attack. Its focus is how different choice making strategies effect a person's experience of their ultimate decision. To do the study, Iyengar and her collaborator, Barry Schwartz of Swarthmart, looked at college students who were in the process of job searching. The first thing they did with the students was to give them a test to figure out how they made decisions. Students who routinely considered a wide range of possibilities were labeled maximizers. Students who preferred to look at only a small number of options were called satisficers.

I mean, regardless of whether you want one choice or just a few choices, whatever domain you pick up has a ton of choices. SPIEGEL: Which is an incredibly difficult thing to do. Choice is tempting. The ideology of choice: too powerful. Consider Bara Sapir, the 36 old woman who's searching for a partner. She says that despite the possibility that her process is making her unhappy, she can't imagine giving it up. Nor can she imagine settling for less than the partner she has always envisioned. Ms. SAPIR: No, no. I won't settle. If I decide I want to have children and I am not in a...I'm not in a partnership, then I would do what I would need to do in order to have that child. You know, we have choices now. I have choices now, and there's no, there's no reason for me to settle for anything. SPIEGEL: Alix Spiegel, NPR News. Copyright © 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But in Bara Sapir's(ph) quest for excellence, she leaves no stone unturned. Ms. BARA SAPIR: You know, maybe most people will consider the top ten choices. I might look at the top fifty. SPIEGEL: While Sapir's conscientious about even the trivial choices in her life, it's fair to say that she's especially vigilant about the big ticket items: her college, her work, and now the very important question of who to choose as a life partner. Ms. SAPIR: Dating is a part-time job. It could be fun, but it's a part-time job. SPIEGEL: At 36 years old, Bara Sapir has spent a number of years at this work, dutifully dating and weighing the relative merits of potential mates. Ms. SAPIR: It's like okay, well this guy, this guy isn't Jewish, but he's got all these traits and I feel really great with him. This guy is Jewish, and I feel really good, but I don't know if I feel good enough, and I don't really know if he's on the same page as I am. SPIEGEL: And while this process has yet to yield concrete results, Sapir's pretty confident about her approach. Ms. SAPIR: I like knowing what's out there. Mr. JASON BOOZY(ph): Oh, yeah. Definitely. I've dated a lot of different women in my life. SPIEGEL: Like Bara Sapir, 35-year-old Jason Boozy(ph) has spent a lot of time trying to find someone to spend his life with. And through most of his twenties, Boozy, like Sapir, was convinced that dating a lot of people was the best way to insure that his ultimate decision would last. It helped him, he says, clarify what he did and didn't like. But recently, Boozy has had second thoughts. Mr. BOOZY: I'm not really sure that it's really the best way. But I kind of feel like there's no way I can get out of that, because that's the way it works. And I don't know how to step out of that system. SPIEGEL: In their new study, doing better but feeling worse, psychologist Sheena Iyengar, Rachel Wells, and Barry Schwartz make the case that people like Boozy and Sapir, people who feel compelled to consider a wide range of options usually derive less pleasure from their ultimate choice than people who are satisfied looking at a more limited set of options. The study's lead author, Sheena Iyengar of Columbia University, has literally made a career of studying choice. Her interest in the subject began in graduate school when an upscale grocery store opened near her home and quickly became the talk of the town. Professor SHEENA IYENGAR (Columbia University): I mean, it had something like--well, it had over 300 different types of jams, and 250 different types of mustards. SPIEGEL: For every product on the shelf, there was just an explosion of options. And Iyengar found the store incredibly exciting to visit. Despite this attraction, she rarely bought anything, which puzzled her. Prof. IYENGAR: Kind of made me think, you know, there's more to this notion of choice than what psychology used to think of. SPIEGEL: See, for much of the 20th century, American psychology considered the existence of choice a pre-condition of human happiness and emotional health. In study after study, the value of being able to exercise choice was clear. For example, the study which proved that when old people were given even minor choices, like whether or not they would take care of a plant, they experienced clear benefits. Sheena Iyengar. Prof. IYENGAR: They found that giving these elderly patients these trivial choices created better health. So much so that they, on average, lived about six months longer. SPIEGEL: For psychology then, choice was an absolute good. Choice meant control, and control was critical to well being. That was the story, anyway, until Iyengar. In the late 1990s, Iyengar essentially began an assault on the sacred cow of American culture, an assault which has demonstrated that there are clear limits to the benefits of choice, and fundamentally changed the way that psychologists and economists look at the issue. The recent study in Psychological Science is her latest attack. Its focus is how different choice making strategies effect a person's experience of their ultimate decision. To do the study, Iyengar and her collaborator, Barry Schwartz of Swarthmart, looked at college students who were in the process of job searching. The first thing they did with the students was to give them a test to figure out how they made decisions. Students who routinely considered a wide range of possibilities were labeled maximizers. Students who preferred to look at only a small number of options were called satisficers. The students were then followed until they landed jobs, and the difference between how well these two groups did in terms of average salary--author Barry Schwartz says--was substantial. Professor BARRY SCHWARTZ (Social Theory and Social Action, Swarthmore College): Maximizers got starting salaries at $7,500 more than satisficers, which is a lot. You know, it's a 20-25 percent difference. SPIEGEL: Good news, right? There was just one problem. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Every measure we could take of their psychological states indicated that they felt worse. SPIEGEL: Maximizers felt more depressed, more anxious, more stressed, but why? Schwartz, Wells, and Iyengar believe that it is the very act of considering options that ultimately undermines happiness. Again, Barry Schwartz. Prof. SCHWARTZ: When you consider lots of possibilities, and this is true of jobs, but it can be true of anything, there're going to be a variety of possibilities that you reject that are nonetheless attractive in some way. Normally, there's one alternative's going to be better in some respects, but worse in others. So you're going to be faced with the fact that to choose X, you have to give up something you like about Y. And under those conditions, the more Y's there are, the worse you feel about your choice. SPIEGEL: According to their research, even after making a decision, maximizers appeared to be haunted by the possibility that somewhere out there there was a better option, a perfect solution. And this notion of an elusive best seemed to poison their experience. This result has led Barry Schwartz, at least, to a very controversial conclusion. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Happiness of everybody would be increased if they deliberately limited the number of choices they considered. SPIEGEL: Even if you believed that merely limiting your choices will produce more happiness, as Sheena Iyengar points out, it's probably an impractical solution. Choice is just too much a part of our society. Prof. IYENGAR: I think the real problem is the market place, right?

It helped him, he says, clarify what he did and didn't like. But recently, Boozy has had second thoughts. Mr. BOOZY: I'm not really sure that it's really the best way. But I kind of feel like there's no way I can get out of that, because that's the way it works. And I don't know how to step out of that system. SPIEGEL: In their new study, doing better but feeling worse, psychologist Sheena Iyengar, Rachel Wells, and Barry Schwartz make the case that people like Boozy and Sapir, people who feel compelled to consider a wide range of options usually derive less pleasure from their ultimate choice than people who are satisfied looking at a more limited set of options. The study's lead author, Sheena Iyengar of Columbia University, has literally made a career of studying choice. Her interest in the subject began in graduate school when an upscale grocery store opened near her home and quickly became the talk of the town. Professor SHEENA IYENGAR (Columbia University): I mean, it had something like--well, it had over 300 different types of jams, and 250 different types of mustards. SPIEGEL: For every product on the shelf, there was just an explosion of options. And Iyengar found the store incredibly exciting to visit. Despite this attraction, she rarely bought anything, which puzzled her. Prof. IYENGAR: Kind of made me think, you know, there's more to this notion of choice than what psychology used to think of. SPIEGEL: See, for much of the 20th century, American psychology considered the existence of choice a pre-condition of human happiness and emotional health. In study after study, the value of being able to exercise choice was clear. For example, the study which proved that when old people were given even minor choices, like whether or not they would take care of a plant, they experienced clear benefits. Sheena Iyengar. Prof. IYENGAR: They found that giving these elderly patients these trivial choices created better health. So much so that they, on average, lived about six months longer. SPIEGEL: For psychology then, choice was an absolute good. Choice meant control, and control was critical to well being. That was the story, anyway, until Iyengar. In the late 1990s, Iyengar essentially began an assault on the sacred cow of American culture, an assault which has demonstrated that there are clear limits to the benefits of choice, and fundamentally changed the way that psychologists and economists look at the issue. The recent study in Psychological Science is her latest attack. Its focus is how different choice making strategies effect a person's experience of their ultimate decision. To do the study, Iyengar and her collaborator, Barry Schwartz of Swarthmart, looked at college students who were in the process of job searching. The first thing they did with the students was to give them a test to figure out how they made decisions. Students who routinely considered a wide range of possibilities were labeled maximizers. Students who preferred to look at only a small number of options were called satisficers. The students were then followed until they landed jobs, and the difference between how well these two groups did in terms of average salary--author Barry Schwartz says--was substantial. Professor BARRY SCHWARTZ (Social Theory and Social Action, Swarthmore College): Maximizers got starting salaries at $7,500 more than satisficers, which is a lot. You know, it's a 20-25 percent difference. SPIEGEL: Good news, right? There was just one problem. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Every measure we could take of their psychological states indicated that they felt worse. SPIEGEL: Maximizers felt more depressed, more anxious, more stressed, but why? Schwartz, Wells, and Iyengar believe that it is the very act of considering options that ultimately undermines happiness. Again, Barry Schwartz. Prof. SCHWARTZ: When you consider lots of possibilities, and this is true of jobs, but it can be true of anything, there're going to be a variety of possibilities that you reject that are nonetheless attractive in some way. Normally, there's one alternative's going to be better in some respects, but worse in others. So you're going to be faced with the fact that to choose X, you have to give up something you like about Y. And under those conditions, the more Y's there are, the worse you feel about your choice. SPIEGEL: According to their research, even after making a decision, maximizers appeared to be haunted by the possibility that somewhere out there there was a better option, a perfect solution. And this notion of an elusive best seemed to poison their experience. This result has led Barry Schwartz, at least, to a very controversial conclusion. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Happiness of everybody would be increased if they deliberately limited the number of choices they considered. SPIEGEL: Even if you believed that merely limiting your choices will produce more happiness, as Sheena Iyengar points out, it's probably an impractical solution. Choice is just too much a part of our society. Prof. IYENGAR: I think the real problem is the market place, right? I mean, regardless of whether you want one choice or just a few choices, whatever domain you pick up has a ton of choices. SPIEGEL: Which is an incredibly difficult thing to do. Choice is tempting. The ideology of choice: too powerful. Consider Bara Sapir, the 36 old woman who's searching for a partner. She says that despite the possibility that her process is making her unhappy, she can't imagine giving it up. Nor can she imagine settling for less than the partner she has always envisioned. Ms. SAPIR: No, no. I won't settle. If I decide I want to have children and I am not in a...I'm not in a partnership, then I would do what I would need to do in order to have that child. You know, we have choices now. I have choices now, and there's no, there's no reason for me to settle for anything. SPIEGEL: Alix Spiegel, NPR News. Copyright © 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

SPIEGEL: At 36 years old, Bara Sapir has spent a number of years at this work, dutifully dating and weighing the relative merits of potential mates. Ms. SAPIR: It's like okay, well this guy, this guy isn't Jewish, but he's got all these traits and I feel really great with him. This guy is Jewish, and I feel really good, but I don't know if I feel good enough, and I don't really know if he's on the same page as I am.

SPIEGEL: Even if you believed that merely limiting your choices will produce more happiness, as Sheena Iyengar points out, it's probably an impractical solution. Choice is just too much a part of our society. Prof. IYENGAR: I think the real problem is the market place, right? I mean, regardless of whether you want one choice or just a few choices, whatever domain you pick up has a ton of choices. SPIEGEL: Which is an incredibly difficult thing to do. Choice is tempting. The ideology of choice: too powerful. Consider Bara Sapir, the 36 old woman who's searching for a partner. She says that despite the possibility that her process is making her unhappy, she can't imagine giving it up. Nor can she imagine settling for less than the partner she has always envisioned. Ms. SAPIR: No, no. I won't settle. If I decide I want to have children and I am not in a...I'm not in a partnership, then I would do what I would need to do in order to have that child. You know, we have choices now. I have choices now, and there's no, there's no reason for me to settle for anything. SPIEGEL: Alix Spiegel, NPR News. Copyright © 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

This guy is Jewish, and I feel really good, but I don't know if I feel good enough, and I don't really know if he's on the same page as I am. SPIEGEL: And while this process has yet to yield concrete results, Sapir's pretty confident about her approach. Ms. SAPIR: I like knowing what's out there. Mr. JASON BOOZY(ph): Oh, yeah. Definitely. I've dated a lot of different women in my life. SPIEGEL: Like Bara Sapir, 35-year-old Jason Boozy(ph) has spent a lot of time trying to find someone to spend his life with. And through most of his twenties, Boozy, like Sapir, was convinced that dating a lot of people was the best way to insure that his ultimate decision would last. It helped him, he says, clarify what he did and didn't like. But recently, Boozy has had second thoughts. Mr. BOOZY: I'm not really sure that it's really the best way. But I kind of feel like there's no way I can get out of that, because that's the way it works. And I don't know how to step out of that system. SPIEGEL: In their new study, doing better but feeling worse, psychologist Sheena Iyengar, Rachel Wells, and Barry Schwartz make the case that people like Boozy and Sapir, people who feel compelled to consider a wide range of options usually derive less pleasure from their ultimate choice than people who are satisfied looking at a more limited set of options. The study's lead author, Sheena Iyengar of Columbia University, has literally made a career of studying choice. Her interest in the subject began in graduate school when an upscale grocery store opened near her home and quickly became the talk of the town. Professor SHEENA IYENGAR (Columbia University): I mean, it had something like--well, it had over 300 different types of jams, and 250 different types of mustards. SPIEGEL: For every product on the shelf, there was just an explosion of options. And Iyengar found the store incredibly exciting to visit. Despite this attraction, she rarely bought anything, which puzzled her. Prof. IYENGAR: Kind of made me think, you know, there's more to this notion of choice than what psychology used to think of. SPIEGEL: See, for much of the 20th century, American psychology considered the existence of choice a pre-condition of human happiness and emotional health. In study after study, the value of being able to exercise choice was clear. For example, the study which proved that when old people were given even minor choices, like whether or not they would take care of a plant, they experienced clear benefits. Sheena Iyengar. Prof. IYENGAR: They found that giving these elderly patients these trivial choices created better health. So much so that they, on average, lived about six months longer. SPIEGEL: For psychology then, choice was an absolute good. Choice meant control, and control was critical to well being. That was the story, anyway, until Iyengar. In the late 1990s, Iyengar essentially began an assault on the sacred cow of American culture, an assault which has demonstrated that there are clear limits to the benefits of choice, and fundamentally changed the way that psychologists and economists look at the issue. The recent study in Psychological Science is her latest attack. Its focus is how different choice making strategies effect a person's experience of their ultimate decision. To do the study, Iyengar and her collaborator, Barry Schwartz of Swarthmart, looked at college students who were in the process of job searching. The first thing they did with the students was to give them a test to figure out how they made decisions. Students who routinely considered a wide range of possibilities were labeled maximizers. Students who preferred to look at only a small number of options were called satisficers. The students were then followed until they landed jobs, and the difference between how well these two groups did in terms of average salary--author Barry Schwartz says--was substantial. Professor BARRY SCHWARTZ (Social Theory and Social Action, Swarthmore College): Maximizers got starting salaries at $7,500 more than satisficers, which is a lot. You know, it's a 20-25 percent difference. SPIEGEL: Good news, right? There was just one problem. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Every measure we could take of their psychological states indicated that they felt worse. SPIEGEL: Maximizers felt more depressed, more anxious, more stressed, but why? Schwartz, Wells, and Iyengar believe that it is the very act of considering options that ultimately undermines happiness. Again, Barry Schwartz. Prof. SCHWARTZ: When you consider lots of possibilities, and this is true of jobs, but it can be true of anything, there're going to be a variety of possibilities that you reject that are nonetheless attractive in some way. Normally, there's one alternative's going to be better in some respects, but worse in others. So you're going to be faced with the fact that to choose X, you have to give up something you like about Y. And under those conditions, the more Y's there are, the worse you feel about your choice. SPIEGEL: According to their research, even after making a decision, maximizers appeared to be haunted by the possibility that somewhere out there there was a better option, a perfect solution. And this notion of an elusive best seemed to poison their experience. This result has led Barry Schwartz, at least, to a very controversial conclusion. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Happiness of everybody would be increased if they deliberately limited the number of choices they considered.

SPIEGEL: According to their research, even after making a decision, maximizers appeared to be haunted by the possibility that somewhere out there there was a better option, a perfect solution. And this notion of an elusive best seemed to poison their experience. This result has led Barry Schwartz, at least, to a very controversial conclusion. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Happiness of everybody would be increased if they deliberately limited the number of choices they considered. SPIEGEL: Even if you believed that merely limiting your choices will produce more happiness, as Sheena Iyengar points out, it's probably an impractical solution. Choice is just too much a part of our society. Prof. IYENGAR: I think the real problem is the market place, right? I mean, regardless of whether you want one choice or just a few choices, whatever domain you pick up has a ton of choices. SPIEGEL: Which is an incredibly difficult thing to do. Choice is tempting. The ideology of choice: too powerful. Consider Bara Sapir, the 36 old woman who's searching for a partner. She says that despite the possibility that her process is making her unhappy, she can't imagine giving it up. Nor can she imagine settling for less than the partner she has always envisioned. Ms. SAPIR: No, no. I won't settle. If I decide I want to have children and I am not in a...I'm not in a partnership, then I would do what I would need to do in order to have that child. You know, we have choices now. I have choices now, and there's no, there's no reason for me to settle for anything. SPIEGEL: Alix Spiegel, NPR News. Copyright © 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I've dated a lot of different women in my life. SPIEGEL: Like Bara Sapir, 35-year-old Jason Boozy(ph) has spent a lot of time trying to find someone to spend his life with. And through most of his twenties, Boozy, like Sapir, was convinced that dating a lot of people was the best way to insure that his ultimate decision would last. It helped him, he says, clarify what he did and didn't like. But recently, Boozy has had second thoughts. Mr. BOOZY: I'm not really sure that it's really the best way. But I kind of feel like there's no way I can get out of that, because that's the way it works. And I don't know how to step out of that system. SPIEGEL: In their new study, doing better but feeling worse, psychologist Sheena Iyengar, Rachel Wells, and Barry Schwartz make the case that people like Boozy and Sapir, people who feel compelled to consider a wide range of options usually derive less pleasure from their ultimate choice than people who are satisfied looking at a more limited set of options. The study's lead author, Sheena Iyengar of Columbia University, has literally made a career of studying choice. Her interest in the subject began in graduate school when an upscale grocery store opened near her home and quickly became the talk of the town. Professor SHEENA IYENGAR (Columbia University): I mean, it had something like--well, it had over 300 different types of jams, and 250 different types of mustards. SPIEGEL: For every product on the shelf, there was just an explosion of options. And Iyengar found the store incredibly exciting to visit. Despite this attraction, she rarely bought anything, which puzzled her. Prof. IYENGAR: Kind of made me think, you know, there's more to this notion of choice than what psychology used to think of. SPIEGEL: See, for much of the 20th century, American psychology considered the existence of choice a pre-condition of human happiness and emotional health. In study after study, the value of being able to exercise choice was clear. For example, the study which proved that when old people were given even minor choices, like whether or not they would take care of a plant, they experienced clear benefits. Sheena Iyengar. Prof. IYENGAR: They found that giving these elderly patients these trivial choices created better health. So much so that they, on average, lived about six months longer. SPIEGEL: For psychology then, choice was an absolute good. Choice meant control, and control was critical to well being. That was the story, anyway, until Iyengar. In the late 1990s, Iyengar essentially began an assault on the sacred cow of American culture, an assault which has demonstrated that there are clear limits to the benefits of choice, and fundamentally changed the way that psychologists and economists look at the issue. The recent study in Psychological Science is her latest attack. Its focus is how different choice making strategies effect a person's experience of their ultimate decision. To do the study, Iyengar and her collaborator, Barry Schwartz of Swarthmart, looked at college students who were in the process of job searching. The first thing they did with the students was to give them a test to figure out how they made decisions. Students who routinely considered a wide range of possibilities were labeled maximizers. Students who preferred to look at only a small number of options were called satisficers. The students were then followed until they landed jobs, and the difference between how well these two groups did in terms of average salary--author Barry Schwartz says--was substantial. Professor BARRY SCHWARTZ (Social Theory and Social Action, Swarthmore College): Maximizers got starting salaries at $7,500 more than satisficers, which is a lot. You know, it's a 20-25 percent difference. SPIEGEL: Good news, right? There was just one problem. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Every measure we could take of their psychological states indicated that they felt worse. SPIEGEL: Maximizers felt more depressed, more anxious, more stressed, but why? Schwartz, Wells, and Iyengar believe that it is the very act of considering options that ultimately undermines happiness. Again, Barry Schwartz. Prof. SCHWARTZ: When you consider lots of possibilities, and this is true of jobs, but it can be true of anything, there're going to be a variety of possibilities that you reject that are nonetheless attractive in some way. Normally, there's one alternative's going to be better in some respects, but worse in others. So you're going to be faced with the fact that to choose X, you have to give up something you like about Y. And under those conditions, the more Y's there are, the worse you feel about your choice.

Ms. SAPIR: No, no. I won't settle. If I decide I want to have children and I am not in a...I'm not in a partnership, then I would do what I would need to do in order to have that child. You know, we have choices now. I have choices now, and there's no, there's no reason for me to settle for anything. SPIEGEL: Alix Spiegel, NPR News. Copyright © 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But I kind of feel like there's no way I can get out of that, because that's the way it works. And I don't know how to step out of that system. SPIEGEL: In their new study, doing better but feeling worse, psychologist Sheena Iyengar, Rachel Wells, and Barry Schwartz make the case that people like Boozy and Sapir, people who feel compelled to consider a wide range of options usually derive less pleasure from their ultimate choice than people who are satisfied looking at a more limited set of options. The study's lead author, Sheena Iyengar of Columbia University, has literally made a career of studying choice. Her interest in the subject began in graduate school when an upscale grocery store opened near her home and quickly became the talk of the town. Professor SHEENA IYENGAR (Columbia University): I mean, it had something like--well, it had over 300 different types of jams, and 250 different types of mustards. SPIEGEL: For every product on the shelf, there was just an explosion of options. And Iyengar found the store incredibly exciting to visit. Despite this attraction, she rarely bought anything, which puzzled her. Prof. IYENGAR: Kind of made me think, you know, there's more to this notion of choice than what psychology used to think of. SPIEGEL: See, for much of the 20th century, American psychology considered the existence of choice a pre-condition of human happiness and emotional health. In study after study, the value of being able to exercise choice was clear. For example, the study which proved that when old people were given even minor choices, like whether or not they would take care of a plant, they experienced clear benefits. Sheena Iyengar. Prof. IYENGAR: They found that giving these elderly patients these trivial choices created better health. So much so that they, on average, lived about six months longer. SPIEGEL: For psychology then, choice was an absolute good. Choice meant control, and control was critical to well being. That was the story, anyway, until Iyengar. In the late 1990s, Iyengar essentially began an assault on the sacred cow of American culture, an assault which has demonstrated that there are clear limits to the benefits of choice, and fundamentally changed the way that psychologists and economists look at the issue. The recent study in Psychological Science is her latest attack. Its focus is how different choice making strategies effect a person's experience of their ultimate decision. To do the study, Iyengar and her collaborator, Barry Schwartz of Swarthmart, looked at college students who were in the process of job searching. The first thing they did with the students was to give them a test to figure out how they made decisions. Students who routinely considered a wide range of possibilities were labeled maximizers. Students who preferred to look at only a small number of options were called satisficers. The students were then followed until they landed jobs, and the difference between how well these two groups did in terms of average salary--author Barry Schwartz says--was substantial. Professor BARRY SCHWARTZ (Social Theory and Social Action, Swarthmore College): Maximizers got starting salaries at $7,500 more than satisficers, which is a lot. You know, it's a 20-25 percent difference. SPIEGEL: Good news, right? There was just one problem. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Every measure we could take of their psychological states indicated that they felt worse. SPIEGEL: Maximizers felt more depressed, more anxious, more stressed, but why? Schwartz, Wells, and Iyengar believe that it is the very act of considering options that ultimately undermines happiness. Again, Barry Schwartz. Prof. SCHWARTZ: When you consider lots of possibilities, and this is true of jobs, but it can be true of anything, there're going to be a variety of possibilities that you reject that are nonetheless attractive in some way. Normally, there's one alternative's going to be better in some respects, but worse in others. So you're going to be faced with the fact that to choose X, you have to give up something you like about Y. And under those conditions, the more Y's there are, the worse you feel about your choice. SPIEGEL: According to their research, even after making a decision, maximizers appeared to be haunted by the possibility that somewhere out there there was a better option, a perfect solution. And this notion of an elusive best seemed to poison their experience. This result has led Barry Schwartz, at least, to a very controversial conclusion. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Happiness of everybody would be increased if they deliberately limited the number of choices they considered. SPIEGEL: Even if you believed that merely limiting your choices will produce more happiness, as Sheena Iyengar points out, it's probably an impractical solution. Choice is just too much a part of our society. Prof. IYENGAR: I think the real problem is the market place, right? I mean, regardless of whether you want one choice or just a few choices, whatever domain you pick up has a ton of choices. SPIEGEL: Which is an incredibly difficult thing to do. Choice is tempting.

She says that despite the possibility that her process is making her unhappy, she can't imagine giving it up. Nor can she imagine settling for less than the partner she has always envisioned.

She says that despite the possibility that her process is making her unhappy, she can't imagine giving it up. Nor can she imagine settling for less than the partner she has always envisioned.

And Iyengar found the store incredibly exciting to visit. Despite this attraction, she rarely bought anything, which puzzled her. Prof. IYENGAR: Kind of made me think, you know, there's more to this notion of choice than what psychology used to think of. SPIEGEL: See, for much of the 20th century, American psychology considered the existence of choice a pre-condition of human happiness and emotional health. In study after study, the value of being able to exercise choice was clear. For example, the study which proved that when old people were given even minor choices, like whether or not they would take care of a plant, they experienced clear benefits. Sheena Iyengar. Prof. IYENGAR: They found that giving these elderly patients these trivial choices created better health. So much so that they, on average, lived about six months longer. SPIEGEL: For psychology then, choice was an absolute good. Choice meant control, and control was critical to well being. That was the story, anyway, until Iyengar. In the late 1990s, Iyengar essentially began an assault on the sacred cow of American culture, an assault which has demonstrated that there are clear limits to the benefits of choice, and fundamentally changed the way that psychologists and economists look at the issue. The recent study in Psychological Science is her latest attack. Its focus is how different choice making strategies effect a person's experience of their ultimate decision. To do the study, Iyengar and her collaborator, Barry Schwartz of Swarthmart, looked at college students who were in the process of job searching. The first thing they did with the students was to give them a test to figure out how they made decisions. Students who routinely considered a wide range of possibilities were labeled maximizers. Students who preferred to look at only a small number of options were called satisficers. The students were then followed until they landed jobs, and the difference between how well these two groups did in terms of average salary--author Barry Schwartz says--was substantial. Professor BARRY SCHWARTZ (Social Theory and Social Action, Swarthmore College): Maximizers got starting salaries at $7,500 more than satisficers, which is a lot. You know, it's a 20-25 percent difference. SPIEGEL: Good news, right? There was just one problem. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Every measure we could take of their psychological states indicated that they felt worse. SPIEGEL: Maximizers felt more depressed, more anxious, more stressed, but why? Schwartz, Wells, and Iyengar believe that it is the very act of considering options that ultimately undermines happiness. Again, Barry Schwartz. Prof. SCHWARTZ: When you consider lots of possibilities, and this is true of jobs, but it can be true of anything, there're going to be a variety of possibilities that you reject that are nonetheless attractive in some way. Normally, there's one alternative's going to be better in some respects, but worse in others. So you're going to be faced with the fact that to choose X, you have to give up something you like about Y. And under those conditions, the more Y's there are, the worse you feel about your choice. SPIEGEL: According to their research, even after making a decision, maximizers appeared to be haunted by the possibility that somewhere out there there was a better option, a perfect solution. And this notion of an elusive best seemed to poison their experience. This result has led Barry Schwartz, at least, to a very controversial conclusion. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Happiness of everybody would be increased if they deliberately limited the number of choices they considered. SPIEGEL: Even if you believed that merely limiting your choices will produce more happiness, as Sheena Iyengar points out, it's probably an impractical solution. Choice is just too much a part of our society. Prof. IYENGAR: I think the real problem is the market place, right?

You know, we have choices now. I have choices now, and there's no, there's no reason for me to settle for anything. SPIEGEL: Alix Spiegel, NPR News. Copyright © 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

So much so that they, on average, lived about six months longer. SPIEGEL: For psychology then, choice was an absolute good. Choice meant control, and control was critical to well being. That was the story, anyway, until Iyengar. In the late 1990s, Iyengar essentially began an assault on the sacred cow of American culture, an assault which has demonstrated that there are clear limits to the benefits of choice, and fundamentally changed the way that psychologists and economists look at the issue. The recent study in Psychological Science is her latest attack. Its focus is how different choice making strategies effect a person's experience of their ultimate decision. To do the study, Iyengar and her collaborator, Barry Schwartz of Swarthmart, looked at college students who were in the process of job searching. The first thing they did with the students was to give them a test to figure out how they made decisions. Students who routinely considered a wide range of possibilities were labeled maximizers. Students who preferred to look at only a small number of options were called satisficers. The students were then followed until they landed jobs, and the difference between how well these two groups did in terms of average salary--author Barry Schwartz says--was substantial. Professor BARRY SCHWARTZ (Social Theory and Social Action, Swarthmore College): Maximizers got starting salaries at $7,500 more than satisficers, which is a lot. You know, it's a 20-25 percent difference. SPIEGEL: Good news, right? There was just one problem. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Every measure we could take of their psychological states indicated that they felt worse. SPIEGEL: Maximizers felt more depressed, more anxious, more stressed, but why? Schwartz, Wells, and Iyengar believe that it is the very act of considering options that ultimately undermines happiness. Again, Barry Schwartz. Prof. SCHWARTZ: When you consider lots of possibilities, and this is true of jobs, but it can be true of anything, there're going to be a variety of possibilities that you reject that are nonetheless attractive in some way. Normally, there's one alternative's going to be better in some respects, but worse in others. So you're going to be faced with the fact that to choose X, you have to give up something you like about Y. And under those conditions, the more Y's there are, the worse you feel about your choice. SPIEGEL: According to their research, even after making a decision, maximizers appeared to be haunted by the possibility that somewhere out there there was a better option, a perfect solution. And this notion of an elusive best seemed to poison their experience. This result has led Barry Schwartz, at least, to a very controversial conclusion. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Happiness of everybody would be increased if they deliberately limited the number of choices they considered. SPIEGEL: Even if you believed that merely limiting your choices will produce more happiness, as Sheena Iyengar points out, it's probably an impractical solution. Choice is just too much a part of our society. Prof. IYENGAR: I think the real problem is the market place, right? I mean, regardless of whether you want one choice or just a few choices, whatever domain you pick up has a ton of choices. SPIEGEL: Which is an incredibly difficult thing to do. Choice is tempting. The ideology of choice: too powerful. Consider Bara Sapir, the 36 old woman who's searching for a partner. She says that despite the possibility that her process is making her unhappy, she can't imagine giving it up. Nor can she imagine settling for less than the partner she has always envisioned. Ms. SAPIR: No, no. I won't settle. If I decide I want to have children and I am not in a...I'm not in a partnership, then I would do what I would need to do in order to have that child.

The ideology of choice: too powerful. Consider Bara Sapir, the 36 old woman who's searching for a partner. She says that despite the possibility that her process is making her unhappy, she can't imagine giving it up. Nor can she imagine settling for less than the partner she has always envisioned. Ms. SAPIR: No, no. I won't settle. If I decide I want to have children and I am not in a...I'm not in a partnership, then I would do what I would need to do in order to have that child. You know, we have choices now. I have choices now, and there's no, there's no reason for me to settle for anything. SPIEGEL: Alix Spiegel, NPR News. Copyright © 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

SPIEGEL: Maximizers felt more depressed, more anxious, more stressed, but why? Schwartz, Wells, and Iyengar believe that it is the very act of considering options that ultimately undermines happiness. Again, Barry Schwartz. Prof. SCHWARTZ: When you consider lots of possibilities, and this is true of jobs, but it can be true of anything, there're going to be a variety of possibilities that you reject that are nonetheless attractive in some way. Normally, there's one alternative's going to be better in some respects, but worse in others. So you're going to be faced with the fact that to choose X, you have to give up something you like about Y. And under those conditions, the more Y's there are, the worse you feel about your choice. SPIEGEL: According to their research, even after making a decision, maximizers appeared to be haunted by the possibility that somewhere out there there was a better option, a perfect solution. And this notion of an elusive best seemed to poison their experience. This result has led Barry Schwartz, at least, to a very controversial conclusion. Prof. SCHWARTZ: Happiness of everybody would be increased if they deliberately limited the number of choices they considered. SPIEGEL: Even if you believed that merely limiting your choices will produce more happiness, as Sheena Iyengar points out, it's probably an impractical solution.

      "text": "Viking's Choice\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nI, for one, welcome the Gin Blossom-ing of emo (e.g. Camp Trash , Broken Record ). It's not only a specific sound (jangly twang by way of '90s power-pop) but songwriting built around melodies that circle in on each other. The San Jose, Calif., band awakebutstillinbed has had poppy inclinations before, but nothing quite like this.\n\nAs one of two singles that announce chaos takes the wheel and i am but a passenger , out Oct. 20, \"airport\" is the happy-go-lucky-but-actually-crying pop-rocker to the screaming, bleeding heart of \" redlight .\" Shannon Taylor, the band's primary songwriter, clearly understands the assignment of the former: Give us a sweet-and-sour sensation of movement that sticks around a few chords and tricky slights of hand, but punctuate every damning self-reflection with a hook to remember. There are even requisite doot doot doo 's, followed by a descending chord progression into the climactic bridge that earns her signature scream. It's in the coda where Taylor reminds us that this is very much an emo band: lonely, strumming a guitar and wondering about her disconnection from the world.\n\n◈ Stream \"airport\" by awakebutstillinbed\n\n◈ Follow the Viking's Choice playlist\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nMemorrhage is the nu-metal project of musician Garry Brents. Courtesy of the artist hide caption\n\nMemorrhage is the nu-metal project of musician Garry Brents.\n\nThe first coming of nu metal, as much a subgenre as a suburban raison d'être, both overpromised and overdelivered on its hostile id. The riffs? Sloppy and sloshy. The bass? No less than five strings of wobble. The drums? Thoroughly thwacked. The vocals? When rapped: pitchy; when screamed: puffed. The angst? Petty at best; violently misogynistic at worst. These were the features, not bugs, of nu metal as it overtook what remained of commercial rock radio. As a quiet teenager seeking a scene in those years, I found the positive reinforcement I craved through punk and hardcore. Nu metal appeared to be isolationist in its anger - the salve for pain was pain - and that didn't feel particularly productive. Even Korn was too whiny for me ... and I was an emo kid raised on guitar twinkle and nasal pining. (Of course, emo and punk weren't that much better; just read Jessica Hopper's necessary \" Where the Girls Aren't \" essay.)\n\nIn the last few years, younger metal musicians have been cribbing the nu style. Code Orange , Tallah, Vein.fm, Cheem and Tetrarch are not only scene leaders, but have stretched the sound by expanding perceptions of who makes this music; even pop singers like Rina Sawayama have gone all-in on songs like \"STFU!\" (I'm not made of stone: These bands inspired me to reconsider the likes of Papa Roach, Coal Chamber, Filter, Snot and Slipknot, not to mention rekindle my love for P.O.D. and Deftones .) That recombined nostalgia can sometimes have a disingenuous halo effect on how we remember, but it's also a crucial lesson in what we take away from music.\n\nBy his own admission, nu metal was Garry Brents' first love. Last summer, Brents - who makes an absurd amount of extreme metal music under several names including Cara Neir , Gonemage, Homeskin and Sallow Moth -  found himself in a black hole of nostalgia, fueled by Korn's live performance in a Woodstock '99 documentary and the endlessly entertaining \" Crazy Ass Moments in Nu Metal History \" Twitter account, and decided to forge some freaky ground. His project Memorrhage , unabashedly a subgenre exercise, manages to both reclaim and reshape nu metal with a portmanteau'd moniker that also acts as a thesis on how a memory can flow uncontrollably once unblocked.\n\nEverything on Memorrhage's self-titled debut is executed with mech-warrior ferocity and precision. In the opening seconds, harmonics are pinched in a swirl of creepy sustain before the bass slaps away a torrent of crunchy riffs and mathy breakdowns, as if the polyrhythmic chaos of Slipknot got caught in a Converge chokehold. \"Memory Leak,\" performed entirely by Brents (as is the majority of the album), is a good introduction to his science fiction-inspired world building: A cybernetic organism awakens to a world not only drenched in but defined by violence and injustice, and like the replicants in Blade Runner , finds itself at odds with human existence. Brents delights in nu-metal's sonic tropes, but experiments with the lyrical lens through which he unleashes his fury.\n\n\"Exit\" and \"Reek\" make compelling cases for Godflesh 's tangential influence on the scene, pitting industrial clang and hip-hop beats against caustic riffs and an unmistakable bark indebted to Justin Broadrick. Lest you worry about the project's bona fides, nary a turntable is left unscratched: Two DJs split the duties, acting as lead instruments and syncopated ornamentation. Mr. Rager gives the demented \"Knurl\" - and the album, quite frankly - a much-needed moment of melodic respite, spinning Incubus-cool webs behind frenzied breakbeats.\n\nSeveral guest vocalists appear, including Fire-Toolz and Aki McCullough (A Constant Knowledge of Death), but the most satisfying collaboration comes from Ilya Mirosh, a Minsk-based musician who posts vocal covers on YouTube. \"Lunge\" would have been voted most likely to succeed as a hit back in the '90s:  Guitars squeal octaves, riffs do what the song title suggests with channel-panning glee, vinyl scribbles maniacally and the call-and-response chorus between Brents' harsh growl and Mirosh's melodic howl is instantly memorable. \"Utility\" breaks character and nods at a Memorrhage multiverse, one where nu-metal is played with a pretty-boy post-hardcore sheen and sung with post-grunge grit, featuring EDM breakdowns. It's the kind of genre perversity at which Brents has long excelled, especially in Cara Neir, taken to a secret new level.\n\nMemorrhage is not only an exercise in genre but a meditation on perspective. In these songs, a downtuned dumbness scratches a '90s itch, for sure, but also imagines another path. For Brents and so many others, nu metal's angst-ridden viscera was the draw - primal screams, chugging riffs, maybe a funky rhythm section masquerading as metal. The lyrical style, too, offered a vehicle to vent frustration - an unfiltered expression with nothing left to lose. Brents still channels the genre's requisite misanthropy, just through a \" dystopian escapism \" that points its robotic fingers at our inhumanity: \"I found a god and it's not you.\"\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nWolf Eyes is charged with a perverse curiosity. If you have experienced even a fraction of the band's hundreds of albums, EPs, collaborations and splits across every format imaginable over the last 25 years, you know the Toxic Avenger that emerges from the gurgling detritus: hideous, heroic and beloved by weirdos. You can divide the group's career into several eras with different lineups, from the crypt-keeping dub of Dread (2001) and blackened metallic clang of Burned Mind (2004) to the warped jazz skronk of No Answer: Lower Floors (2013) and so, so much between, below and beyond. Across all of it is the pursuit of noise, not just for its own sake, but hypnagogic blocks of sound that mirror the absurdity of existence and possibly - hopefully? - mutate reality further.\n\nA quarter of a century in, Wolf Eyes has trimmed down to the core duo of Nate Young and Johnny Olson. In doing so, they've expanded and contracted the idea of Wolf Eyes: first, as a series of diverse collaborations made over the pandemic, collected as Difficult Messages earlier this year; now on Dreams in Splattered Lines , out May 26. The omnivorous spirit of the former informs the latter, a duo record that still challenges, but also titillates with shrieking delight.\n\nOn Dreams in Splattered Lines, the tracks are shorter and marked by mangled melodies, disjointed beats and bloated blues; where previous Wolf Eyes might have sprawled or burst from the chest, these mostly simmer on a surreal, grease-streaked mood. \"Plus Warning,\" with synths dredged from the Silver Apples basement, sounds like ceremonial space music, complete with apocalyptic proselytization. Steam hisses and throbbing bass backs Olson's descending sax on \"Engaged Withdrawal,\" as if to dub Scott Walker 's \"Fat Mama Kick\" into an industrial locked groove. \"In Society\" conjures a county fair where John Carpenter loops the Joker's laugh into a terrifying tilt-a-whirl. Young's spoken word takes on a dead-eyed, Kim Gordon cadence when \"My Whole Life\" intones a shadowy obsession: \"The other day I thought was through / But now I can't stop loving you.\"\n\nWolf Eyes has played with conventional forms before, offering stabs of memorable - if squelching and squealing - hooks made for pounding tables and tallboys. What Dreams in Splattered Lines does, however, is refine Wolf Eyes' approach to cinematic horror: still gross and grueling, but painted in thicker strokes of neon gloom.\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nFor Those Who Like: screaming as catharsis, ugly pretty music, feedback\n\nIn the late '90s, Jeromes Dream came up with the likes of pg. 99 , Orchid and Usurp Synapse, chaotic hardcore bands that could quickly turn unsettlingly quiet. For better or worse, the kids called it screamo - bassist Jeff Smith would literally scream atop short bursts of sonic destruction during live shows without a microphone, so perhaps the coinage wasn't without merit. Several split 7-inches, a debut album and a stylistic 180 toward shouty math-rock later, the band broke up in 2001.\n\nUpon its reunion in 2018, Jeromes Dream picked up where it left off with 2019's LP , swaggering more toward rock than complex music equations - a welcome return, if a bit sleek in its presentation. The Gray In Between , however, recaptures and reinforces a shredded tension. Across 10 tracks in 25 minutes, you can feel the crushing effects of the world upon humanity, yet the album captures glimpses of beauty through Smith's vivid imagery.\n\n\"I once knew a guy who lit himself on fire / He took his pain and the pain of the world / and lit a match,\" Smith screams over grinding blast beats and blackgazey guitar via \"On Holiday with Infinity.\" Loma Prieta's Sean Leary, at first an addition who soon became the band's sole guitarist, keenly understands how Smith and drummer Erik Ratensperger write; he riffs furiously, but wisely decorates their percussion-forward dynamic with scraped harmonics and Johnny Marr -like sweeps.\n\nFeedback turns out to be an apt metaphor for pain: That squealing noise erupts when an amplified signal feeds back into the instrument that produced it, continuously looping until the signal is cut. So ... we suffer endlessly until we die! But hardcore frequently knits feedback into its tangled seams as a form of catharsis; The Gray In Between , while not exactly hopeful or despairing, empathetically injects split-second shrieks as punctuation marks between ruptured riffs and the ache of existence.\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nTen years have passed since a teenaged Hayden Pedigo released a cassette of John Fahey -indebted fingerstyle guitar. As much as Pedigo's skill and songcraft have changed, his tender smirk behind each pluck and strum remains. \"Elsewhere,\" from the forthcoming album The Happiest Times I Ever Ignored , is subtle in its movement. The inquisitive melody slows and picks up speed like an old truck bucking along a gravel road - music that shares the same cinematic awe of Popol Vuh crafting a Werner Herzog soundtrack. And, in fact, \"Elsewhere\" functions in three distinct acts: first, the uplifting quest; second, a struggle felt tugged on by Luke Schneider 's pedal steel; the last, the return and resolution of the melody, brighter yet colored by shades of past doubt.\n\n◈ Stream \"Elsewhere\" by Hayden Pedigo\n\n◈ Follow the Viking's Choice playlist\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nLimbo District has always felt like a myth hidden in plain sight. In the early '80s, the band delighted and terrified Athens, Ga., with its provocative avant-garde post-punk performance art. Limbo District's roster fluctuated with Southern bohemians - plus a French exchange student - but its most visible member was drummer Jerry Ayers, who co-wrote The B-52s ' \"52 Girls\" and R.E.M. 's \"Old Man Kensey\" and was part of Andy Warhol's Factory. Ask anyone from that Athens era and they speak of Limbo District as a Vaudevillian unicorn.\n\nBut the group's only known recordings were featured in Carnival , a short film by Jim Herbert - snippets were featured in the Athens, GA: Inside/Out documentary. And, as time has gone by, memories and information about the band have faded - members have died or their whereabouts are unknown - leaving those still curious to follow trails of poor YouTube rips and brief mentions in Grace Elizabeth Hale's book Cool Town .\n\nBut thanks to art director, producer and archivist Henry Owings, Limbo District lives again. \"Encased\" is the first of a few known studio sessions that will surface over the year. \"It's like finding Joy Division 40 years later in tape boxes,\" Owings tells me. There is a back-to-basics vibe very much line with what was happening in Athens at the time, but where The B-52s played up the party and Oh-OK brought New Wave to the doo-wop, Limbo District reverse-engineered punk's primitive roots to piece together a circus-like surrealism. On \"Encased,\" the parts are easy to identify - howled vocals, thwacked drums, droning organ, spindly guitar, menacingly grooved bass - but the song seems to be in a state of constant spontaneous combustion.\n\n◈ Stream \"Encased\" by Limbo District\n\n◈ Read an interview with Pylon\n\n◈ Follow the Viking's Choice playlist\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nThis #NowPlaying pick appears on today's episode of All Songs Considered .\n\nThe year is 1997. Chokers and knee socks are in, but so are capri pants. There are not one, but two volcano disaster movies ( Dante's Peak and, uh, Volcano ) in theaters. Daria and Buffy are on TV. You turn to the lower end of the dial to find The Sundays and Saint Etienne on college radio, then click up a few notches to find Natalie Imbruglia, The Cardigans and Everything But the Girl. We were living in 1997.\n\nDaisies ' \"Is It Any Wonder?\" - the first single from its forthcoming record Great Big Open Sky , out May 12 - lives in the terrestrial bleedthrough between '90s twee and Top 40, and makes apologies for neither. The song is one of those pop music magic tricks that could only exist with that decade in the rearview: A coffee-shop bop subtly morphs into a countrified singalong before a '60s retro-chic takes us back to a Mellotron melody and a full-on hippie jam. It's a vintage '90s patchwork dress in pop song form, especially when Chris McDonnell's (CCFX, CC DUST, The County Liners ) production so brilliantly mimics the era's proclivities, but Valerie Warren's lilting, hiccuping vocal delivery sells the song's bittersweet ennui with a sweet-and-sappy sophistication.\n\n◈ Stream \" It Is Any Wonder?\" by Daisies\n\n◈ Follow the Viking's Choice playlist\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nMatthew Sage - who records as M. Sage - not only layers sound but reshapes the passage of time. In listening, you get the sense that stories, sounds, emotions and motions overlap not with a clash but a surprising ease.\n\nWater, then, is a sympathetic metaphor for his music - it's ever-moving, yet ever-present. \"Crick Dynamo,\" from Paradise Crick (out May 26), shimmers like sunlight off a small stream. Much like his contributions to the ambient jazz quartet Fuubutsushi , Sage centers this song's melody around cool, Bill Evans -inspired piano chords, but breaks everything apart with a tender touch: Synths gurgle, glide and pop playfully as dial-up noise swims through underwater guitar and lightly popped bass. Previously, he'd let those disparate sounds hang in the ether, but here, a flickering, glitching motion - not unlike Insen , Alva Noto and Ryuichi Sakamoto 's brilliant 2005 collaboration - nudges everything forward toward an overwhelming, euphoric resolve.\n\n◈ Stream \"Crick Dynamo\" by M.

Original copies are scant and previous reissues go for silly amounts of money. But when you hear these songs, it's like the British Invasion hit New Jersey in 1979: chiming guitars, cheerful vocal harmonies and clean-cut drumming with a touch of punk spunk... all played by one person, Tommy Marolda, who has since written scores for movies like Staying Alive and Days of Thunder .\n\n\"Other Boys Do\" is just one of many gems on an expanded reissue due March 10 via Feel It Records. What begins as a Beatles-inspired mop-top romp replete with handclaps quickly becomes a musical tête-à-tête. As Marolda sweetly (but cheekily) sings his I'm-not-like-other-boys sales pitch, the guitar seems to personify the object of his affection - and they're not having it. \"I don't see no point in us being here together,\" he sings. \"If all you wanna do is have me treat you like the other boys do.\" The guitar responds with a flirtatious five-note figure, as if to say, Well, come and show me. Strummed chords lag and linger, teasing him. Spurts of choppy riffs and licks ratchet up to a twin lead guitar climax, toying with a will-they-or-won't-they tension. It's a deliciously clever soap opera delivered in three minutes.\n\n◈ Stream \"Other Boys Do\" by The TOMS\n\n◈ Follow the Viking's Choice playlist\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nTo paraphrase Heraclitus: No person strums the same guitar twice, for it's not the same guitar and they're not the same person. Bill Orcutt 's journey as a musician has taken him from decades of noise to a restless-yet-beautiful guitar style all his own. But after years of electric-guitar excursions, not to mention a challenging run of electronic music, it's been a minute since Orcutt has picked up an acoustic for solo exploration.\n\n\"The Life of Jesus\" begins with a gently fingerpicked melody that welcomes you closer to listen and take in its story. Orcutt has a reliable tendency to break apart his themes texturally, not just in dizzying variations but with a wild force robusto - you feel the strings scrape and bend, the wood creak. It's physical music that moves you. That certainly happens here, but you also get the sense that Orcutt is curious, perhaps even empathetic; he responds to the quietude and complexity of his subject with bursts of compassion and even confusion. It seems that Jump On It , out April 28, might offer yet another subtle self-reinvention for Orcutt.\n\n◈ Stream \"The Life of Jesus\" by Bill Orcutt\n\n◈ Follow the Viking's Choice playlist\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nOn Sunday night, I got socked in the jaw, groin and eyeball, in that order - plus, my elbow started bleeding at some point. No, I didn't get in a fight; I'd come out of pit retirement to push and shove my way through Gel's ferociously fun set and left absolutely exhilarated.\n\n\"Attainable\" typifies the New Jersey band's refinement over a series of 7-inch singles and last year's split with Cold Brats: groove-heavy, reverb-laden hardcore that swaggers as much as it smiles. Sami Kaiser's bark is fierce, but oddly friendly. Even without arms swung within inches of your face, you can feel the heat coming off this rager as it heaves from a pacing chug to a quickened prowl - there's not so much a guitar solo as chiming ornamentation woven into the knuckle-dragged riffs. In the same way all punk shows should be short and rowdy, Gel's debut full-length is a brisk 17 minutes - Only Constant , out March 31, is sure to be one of the year's most satisfyingly bruising hardcore records.\n\n◈ Stream \"Attainable\" by Gel\n\n◈ Follow the Viking's Choice playlist\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nSometimes the beauty of simplicity is the ease in which something is presumably understood, only to be surprised. That's long been the case for North Americans , the nom de plume of guitarist Patrick McDermott, a project which, in recent years, has included pedal steel player Barry Walker. This is drift music, sustained by dusky drones and quiet fingerstyle.\n\n\"Classic Water,\" from Long Cool World out April 7, reassesses the duo's musical relationship. Gone are the guests that filled out the edges of previous albums and, with it, a wallpapering sense of ambient layering. Instead, McDermott's fingerpicking bucks along at a low hum as Walker's pedal steel ornaments dots of melody. Everything's as gentle as a sunkissed stream, but the synths gurgling ominously just below the surface tint the go-easy atmosphere. The pathways that once felt free and clear now sport an uneasy shade, yet the guitar picks on.\n\n◈ Stream \"Classic Water\" by North Americans\n\n◈ Read a story on the endless potential of the pedal steel guitar\n\n◈ Follow the #NowPlaying playlist\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nCollege radio lives in its own world. When I was a music director at WUOG in Athens, Ga., we paid attention to and sent in charts, kept up with blogs and read magazines, but for the most part we made our own proclamations about what music we'd play. Beauty Pill 's The Unsustainable Lifestyle hit heavy rotation in 2004 and didn't really leave our airwaves. To our DJs, Beauty Pill was on to something fiercely, intricately unique: punkish indie-rock invested in unconventional hooks, slanted electronics and Brian Eno -level production.\n\nSo imagine my shock when, years later, I discovered not everyone felt the same way. The Unsustainable Lifestyle was panned by high-level publications; primary songwriter Chad Clark says people told him the album \" was a mistake .\" He wouldn't release another until 2015's remarkable Describes Things As They Are .\n\nBlue Period - which collects The Unsustainable Lifestyle , the You Are Right to Be Afraid EP and unreleased outtakes and demos - feels like justice for Beauty Pill. \"Such Large Portions!\" appeared on that debut album and was, by far, WUOG's most played song for months. It's not hard to hear why: Nothing's obvious, yet every sound sticks out. That whammy-bar riff - reminiscent of My Bloody Valentine , minus the noise - presaged the pedal-board revival by a good decade. Bouncing off a wash of aqueous dub, the drumming stutters and breathes in the verses. In a bossa nova sotto voce, Rachel Burke smirks as she sings Clark's darkly funny turns of phrase (\"The food is poison here, you can't eat it / But in such large portions!\"). A light touch of Fender Rhodes adds some electric Miles cool. Nothing sounded like it then, or since.\n\n◈ Stream \"Such Large Portions!\" by Beauty Pill\n\n▶ Watch Beauty Pill's Tiny Desk concert\n\n◈ Follow the #NowPlaying playlist\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nWheatie Mattiasich's dreamy, eerie music could fill a forest cathedral. Old Glow - her new album made with collaborator Stephen Santillan - drenches dulcimer, guitar, keyboard and harmonium in cotton clouds of cozy reverb. It's not quite shoegaze or dreamy pop, but weaves its ballads similarly, through cable-knit stitches of sound.\n\n\"This Way,\" in particular, is a wispy waltz that somehow balances hymn-like awe with a slow, spectral dance; there's an unusual beauty to everything - ambient guitar borealis, strummed dulcimer and what sounds like a tack piano in space - but especially Mattiasich's voice. Landing somewhere between Josephine Foster and Jean Ritchie , Mattiasich swoops syllables and stretches phrases in unexpected ways that make our understanding of the words moot - we're in her strange glow.\n\n◈ Stream \"This Way\" by Wheatie Mattiasich\n\n◈ Follow the Viking's Choice playlist\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nEliza Bagg has always been of two worlds: as Lisel , an electro-pop alien taken by the wonders of auto-tune, and as an opera singer who's performed the works of Meredith Monk , Caroline Shaw and John Zorn . On \"One At A Time,\" Lisel bridges her own gap and makes four simple words an Escher-esque puzzle.\n\nHere, built on loops and layers of her voice, single syllables delay in stately polyphony - an update on the Renaissance and Medieval styles familiar to Bagg.

Early member Jamie Myers returns to the mic as the band, an ever-shifting orb of metallic influence, picks up where the smashed-and-reconfigured thrash of the broken-up Vhol left off. \"Overthrower,\" featuring a dueling guest vocal from Slough Feg's Mike Scalzi - yet another former Hammers of Misfortune member -  takes King Crimson to the pit. There's hyperactive fury here, of course, but also a brainy blur of blink-and-you-missed-it harmonies and counterpoints that play off every instrument, including an operatic tête-à-tête between Myers and Scalzi, who alternate punk spit and anthemic wails.

Joe Andrews and Tom Halstead initially formed the group a decade ago as an outlet apart from their drone-y electronic group Raime, then rounded out the London trio with percussionist Valentina Magaletti (Tomaga, Vanishing Twin) in recent years. And very quickly, Moin has uncovered the upside-down of an overly mined era of rock skronk.\n\nIf 2021's Moot! was Moin's take on piercing, hi-def post-punk à la Shellac and Unwound, then Paste manipulates and muddies the waters with muted moods. There's an uncertainty about authorship throughout: Are the riffs recycled and reshuffled via software? Are the drums sampled live and then looped? Like The Books' carefully edited collages, it's a musical sleight of hand that thrills in its quiet motions, especially on \"Hung Up.\" Based around Magaletti's hi-hat breakbeat and a harmonic riff that recalls early Mogwai, a woman monologues about a phone call gone wrong. But over minimalist-inspired repetition and variation, a second guitar begins to spiral and sputter, electronics glitch and the cymbal sound reverses in a way that tears apart the simple fabric of the song.\n\n◈ Stream \"Hung Up\" by Moin\n\n◈ Follow the Viking's Choice playlist\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nWhen The HIRS Collective calls, the punk community responds.

But more importantly, the track honors the band's foremost purpose: not only the survival, but the extremely loud joy and visibility of trans and queer outcasts. \"This collective, a version of therapy,\" the vocalist screams, \"for ourselves and anyone who feels the need to scream their lungs out for one more day of living.\" Joining them again after providing spoken word for 2018's Friends.

Love has always been central to Fever Ray in some shape or form, but it is often haunted or obliterated sweetly by neon-blasted synths. There's no one way to love; Dreijer has been essential to its inside-out-but-genuine meaning.\n\nWith that in mind, Fever Ray's first original song since 2017's Plunge , \"What They Call Us,\" is surprisingly subdued, but perhaps even stranger in its restraint. Squiggly synths, jumpy techno beats and Caribbean-inspired percussion call back to earlier work (the song was co-produced with Olof Dreijer, their brother and former partner in The Knife ). But as Karin Dreijer has gone on their own shapeshifting quest, it's now even harder to tell if they've manipulated their voice. That, too, tracks in lyrics that read oblique, but sound a feeling that burns and yearns: \"Cinnamon bun in the oven / There's a fire in my hand.\" (The cinnamon bun becomes microwaved bullar - the perfect pastry, says this son of a Swedish immigrant - in the office-party-gone-awry video directed by Martin Falck.) In \"What They Call Us,\" there's an urgent sense that Dreijer, since their queer awakening, must protect that love.\n\n◈ Stream \"What They Call Us\" by Fever Ray\n\n◈ Read an essay about Karin Dreijer from NPR Music's Turning the Tables series\n\n◈ Follow the #NowPlaying playlist\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nIt takes time to shake off stasis. If you spent the last couple years watching the world's unstable state with constant horror, everything and everyone can feel fraught and uncaring. So when \"This Is Why\" takes 15 seconds to adjust as a synth punctuates a snare hit and a guitar slashes, slides and surfs around a cymbal ride - there's an empathetic but exasperated sigh that accompanies the motorik post-punk funk that follows.\n\nParamore on a Can -type beat and jagged Gang of Four riffage is a helluva motion - don't call it a mood; a mood doesn't move. The band gave emo an arena-sized stage, but also flexed more musical muscles with 2017's After Laughter and Hayley Williams ' pair of solo albums since. \"This Is Why\" is somehow aqueous and taut, as Williams coos the verses with a sneer (\"If you have an opinion, maybe you should shove it\") and convulses at the lean yet explosive chorus. Guitarist Taylor York and drummer Zac Farro have never sounded more in step with each other, careening off barbed riffs and snapped snares in rapturous force. And while Paramore doesn't meet the totally made up (but generally accepted) definition, it's working as a power trio here: a singer, drummer and guitarist barreling ahead at the most thrilling heights of their musicianship.\n\n◈ Stream \"This Is Why\" by Paramore\n\n▶ Watch Paramore's Tiny Desk concert\n\n◈ Follow the #NowPlaying playlist\n\nby Lars Gotrich\n\nInitially inspired by the Cocteau Twins and A.R.

      "text": "Missouri joins other red states in trying to stamp out ranked choice voting\n\nFrom\n\nBy\n\nJason Rosenbaum\n\nFive Republican-led states have banned ranked choice voting in recent months. Voters in other states, including Missouri, could ban the system later this year. Here, anti-ranked choice voting buttons are seen in Alaska. Mark Thiessen/AP hide caption\n\nST. LOUIS - Five states have banned ranked choice voting in the last two months, bringing the total number of Republican-leaning states now prohibiting the voting method to 10.\n\nMissouri could soon join them.\n\nIf approved by voters, a GOP-backed measure set for the state ballot this fall would amend Missouri's constitution to ban ranked choice voting .\n\nRanked choice voting allows voters to rank candidates and ensures the winner gains majority support, as compared to the vast majority of elections, where someone can win with a plurality of votes.\n\n\"We believe in the one person, one vote system of elections that our country was founded upon,\" Missouri state Sen. Ben Brown, the ballot measure's sponsor, said in an interview.\n\nIn the 2022 election cycle, a group of Republicans and Democrats unsuccessfully sought to advance a ranked choice voting proposal in Missouri. That would have instituted nonpartisan primaries for statewide, congressional and state legislative elections. The top four candidates would advance to the general election, where voters could then rank candidates from favorite to least favorite.\n\nIf someone gets a majority of initial votes, they win. If no one gets a majority, the fourth place contender would be eliminated. And voters who ranked that candidate first would have their vote go to their second choice. This process would continue until a candidate gets a majority.\n\nBrown and other critics of ranked choice voting contend the system is confusing, and he said there are numerous instances in which voters didn't end up ranking their choices .\n\n\"Proponents of rank choice voting claim for it to be a modern solution to electoral dilemmas or lack of confidence in our system of elections,\" Brown said. \"But the more I looked into it, the more I realized that the evidence and experience had illuminated a starkly different reality.\"\n\nMany conservative lawmakers have pushed back against the voting method - and other experts have also warned about \"treating it as a one-size-fits all solution.\"\n\nIf Missourians approve the ranked choice voting ban, the state will join Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Kentucky in barring the voting system this year. Alaska, where voters approved ranked choice voting in 2020, could see the practice repealed .\n\nMeanwhile in other states, including Nevada and Oregon, voters will decide whether to adopt ranked choice voting later this year.\n\nLoading...\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Eric Woods called Brown's proposal \"just wholly unnecessary.\" Backers of the 2022 initiative contended that ranked choice voting provides incentives for candidates to reach out to a more ideologically diverse set of voters - and, in turn, govern in a more moderate and collaborative way.\n\n\"To say that the only way to give confidence [in elections] is to do exactly what we've been doing and enshrine exactly what people are starting to question into the constitution forever does not make any sense,\" Woods said.\n\nOne of the quirks of the Missouri ballot measure is that it provides a carveout for the city of St. Louis, which adopted something called approval voting in 2022 . That's somewhat different from ranked choice voting: In that system, St. Louisans can vote for as many candidates for mayor or aldermen as they want in a nonpartisan primary. The top two vote-getters then advance to a general election, where voters can only select one candidate.\n\nState Rep. Ben Baker, who sponsored the ranked choice voting ban in the House, said exempting St. Louis' approval voting system was part of a compromise to move the ballot item through the legislative process.\n\n\"I'm not OK with it. But this is where we're at with this language of what we can get done in the body,\" Baker said last month during the final day of the Missouri General Assembly session. \"And I think it's still a big step in the right direction.\"\n\nThe ballot item also includes a provision that would ban noncitizens from voting, which is already illegal under federal and state law. Brown said that while there aren't any examples now of municipalities in Missouri that allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, the provision would guarantee that doesn't happen in the future.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

A Department of Defense initiative would make it difficult for most of them to remain in the military, although multiple federal judges have blocked enforcement of the policy. Steve Walsh with WHRO in Norfolk reports this has left troops with a difficult choice. STEVE WALSH, BYLINE: Jo Ellis understands more than most how charged the moment has become for transgender service members. A Black Hawk pilot, Ellis was falsely accused of causing the D.C. crash between an airliner and a military helicopter in January. JO ELLIS: It was really interesting to see the hate come my way. Even though I know it exists, it wasn't a surprise. It's kind of the reality of being someone who's open about being trans. But it was just a lot to have focused towards me. WALSH: Ellis grew up in Norfolk. She transitioned 18 months ago as a member of the Virginia National Guard. She posted about the experience a few days before the crash. ELLIS: What's interesting is me as a target, it didn't really fit their narrative at all because I grew up in a conservative house. I voted red more than blue in my entire voting record. I've served in the military for 15 years. I'm a veteran, combat veteran. WALSH: Ellis says her Guard unit has supported her through her transition and the negative publicity. ELLIS: I know these people so well. My entire Army career, I've been with these people, and we've all kind of risen up through the ranks together. So it really is a family, and it's hard to feel like you're being kicked out of your family. WALSH: The Department of Defense issued a memo in February targeting transgender service members. So far, three lawsuits challenging the policies are in the pipeline. A judge's order is blocking the policy from taking effect. Still, Ellis, like all other transgender troops, faces a choice. ELLIS: I have no intentions of surrendering and leaving. I want to stay and be in as long as they'll let me. I'm in a very fortunate position where I'm not active duty. I'm not tied to my Guard employment for my livelihood, so I can actually wait it out. WALSH: Alleria Stanley is a 20-year Army veteran who is now with the Transgender American Veterans Association. She came out publicly as transgender during the Obama administration in 2016, when it became legal to serve openly. She held on through Trump 1 when recruiting was stopped, but troops already serving could stay at least through their enlistment. Under Biden, she became one of the first openly transgender troops to retire with full benefits. The Pentagon has been offering incentives to trans people to leave voluntarily. Stanley says she understands the mindset of some who have already taken the separation package and left, even with the court challenges still underway. ALLERIA STANLEY: Combat service doesn't matter. I do my job. Look at all these decorations and awards and promotions. Doesn't matter. It's incredibly disheartening to be told that, no matter how good you work, none of it matters, you have to get out. We don't want you here. WALSH: A Rand study found transgender troops serving openly had little impact on the readiness of a unit or a person's ability to serve. Not everyone who is transgender experiences gender dysphoria, but Stanley worries that fears of being diagnosed with the condition will make troops even more reluctant to seek mental healthcare. STANLEY: If you say something, it gets entered into your record, and so you might risk losing it all. It's not just your career, but if you have dependents, you lose their healthcare. You lose your educational benefits. You lose housing - everything. WALSH: On social media, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has declared that the Pentagon will continue to fight to implement the policy, one that advocates believe would drive most transgender troops out of the military.

Not everyone who is transgender experiences gender dysphoria, but Stanley worries that fears of being diagnosed with the condition will make troops even more reluctant to seek mental healthcare. STANLEY: If you say something, it gets entered into your record, and so you might risk losing it all. It's not just your career, but if you have dependents, you lose their healthcare. You lose your educational benefits. You lose housing - everything. WALSH: On social media, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has declared that the Pentagon will continue to fight to implement the policy, one that advocates believe would drive most transgender troops out of the military.

It's kind of the reality of being someone who's open about being trans. But it was just a lot to have focused towards me. WALSH: Ellis grew up in Norfolk. She transitioned 18 months ago as a member of the Virginia National Guard. She posted about the experience a few days before the crash. ELLIS: What's interesting is me as a target, it didn't really fit their narrative at all because I grew up in a conservative house. I voted red more than blue in my entire voting record. I've served in the military for 15 years. I'm a veteran, combat veteran. WALSH: Ellis says her Guard unit has supported her through her transition and the negative publicity. ELLIS: I know these people so well. My entire Army career, I've been with these people, and we've all kind of risen up through the ranks together. So it really is a family, and it's hard to feel like you're being kicked out of your family. WALSH: The Department of Defense issued a memo in February targeting transgender service members. So far, three lawsuits challenging the policies are in the pipeline. A judge's order is blocking the policy from taking effect. Still, Ellis, like all other transgender troops, faces a choice. ELLIS: I have no intentions of surrendering and leaving. I want to stay and be in as long as they'll let me. I'm in a very fortunate position where I'm not active duty. I'm not tied to my Guard employment for my livelihood, so I can actually wait it out. WALSH: Alleria Stanley is a 20-year Army veteran who is now with the Transgender American Veterans Association. She came out publicly as transgender during the Obama administration in 2016, when it became legal to serve openly. She held on through Trump 1 when recruiting was stopped, but troops already serving could stay at least through their enlistment. Under Biden, she became one of the first openly transgender troops to retire with full benefits. The Pentagon has been offering incentives to trans people to leave voluntarily. Stanley says she understands the mindset of some who have already taken the separation package and left, even with the court challenges still underway. ALLERIA STANLEY: Combat service doesn't matter. I do my job. Look at all these decorations and awards and promotions. Doesn't matter. It's incredibly disheartening to be told that, no matter how good you work, none of it matters, you have to get out. We don't want you here.

      "text": "In a State With School Vouchers for All, Low-Income Families Aren't Choosing to Use Them\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nAlma Nuñez, a longtime South Phoenix restaurant cashier with three kids, attended a community event a few years ago at which a speaker gave a presentation about Arizona's school voucher program. She was intrigued.\n\nAngelica Zavala, a West Phoenix home cleaner and mother of two, first heard of vouchers when former Gov. Doug Ducey was talking about them on the news. He was saying that the state was giving parents money that they could then spend on private school tuition or homeschooling supplies. The goal was to ensure that all students, no matter their socioeconomic background, would have access to whatever kind of education best fit them. Zavala thought: This sounds great. Maybe it will benefit my family.\n\nAnd Fabiola Velasquez, also a mother of three, was watching TV with her husband last year when she saw one of the many ads for vouchers that have blanketed media outlets across metropolitan Phoenix of late. She turned to him and asked, \"Have you heard about this?\"\n\nWorking-class parents like Nuñez, Zavala and Velasquez have often said in surveys and interviews that they're at least initially interested in school vouchers, which in Arizona are called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts. Many across the Phoenix area told ProPublica that they liked the idea of getting some financial help from the state so that they could send their children to the best, safest private schools - the kind that rich kids get to attend.\n\nYet when it comes to lower-income families actually choosing to use vouchers here in the nation's school choice capital , the numbers tell a very different story. A ProPublica analysis of Arizona Department of Education data for Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, reveals that the poorer the ZIP code, the less often vouchers are being used. The richer, the more.\n\nIn one West Phoenix ZIP code where the median household income is $46,700 a year, for example, ProPublica estimates that only a single voucher is being used per 100 school-age children. There are about 12,000 kids in this ZIP code, with only 150 receiving vouchers.\n\nConversely, in a Paradise Valley ZIP code with a median household income of $173,000, there are an estimated 28 vouchers being used per 100 school-age children.\n\nPoorer Neighborhoods in Maricopa County Used Fewer Vouchers\n\nFind Out How Often Vouchers Are Estimated to be Used in Your ZIP Code\n\nThe question is, if there's interest in school vouchers among lower-income families, why isn't that translating into use, as conservative advocates have long promised would happen?\n\nIn our interviews, several families said that they simply didn't know about the program. Some mentioned that they didn't have the social contacts - or the time, given their jobs - to investigate whether vouchers would be a better option for their kids than public school, which is generally simpler to enroll in and navigate.\n\nBut others, like Nuñez, Zavala and Velasquez, said that they knew plenty about Empowerment Scholarship Accounts. Still, they had come to understand that the ESA program was not designed for them, not in a day-to-day sense. Logistical obstacles would make using vouchers to attend private school practically impossible for them and their children.\n\nIt starts with geography. The high-quality private schools are not near their neighborhoods.\n\nProPublica compiled a list of more than 200 private schools in the Phoenix metro area using a survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, as well as a Maricopa County listing and other sources. We found that these schools are disproportionately located to the north and east of downtown - in Midtown, Arcadia, Scottsdale, Paradise Valley and the suburbs - rather than to the south and west, the historically segregated areas where Nuñez, Zavala and Velasquez live.\n\nOnly six of all of these private schools are in Census tracts where families earn less than 50% of the county's median income of $87,000.\n\nSo even if lower-income families were able to secure spots at a decent private school and could use vouchers to pay the tuition, they would still have to figure out how to get their children there. After all, while public schools generally provide free transportation via school buses, private schools rarely do.\n\nWould they send their kids on $30-plus Uber rides each way every day? Or on city bus trips that might take up to two hours in each direction, because the routes aren't designed for students the way that school bus routes are? This might require their little ones to make multiple transfers, on their own, at busy intersections.\n\nZavala used an app that showed the private schools near her home; there weren't many, but she did know of one, St. Matthew Catholic School, that served students her daughters' age and was in the vicinity. It also had sports and a dual-language program, which not many private schools provide.\n\nThere Is Only One Private Elementary School Within 3 Miles of Angelica Zavala's Home\n\nSt. Matthew Catholic School\n\nPhoenix\n\n3 miles\n\nZavala's\n\nhome\n\nPrivate elementary schools\n\nShe filled out all the forms to apply for her daughters to attend St. Matthew using vouchers, before deciding that the stress of transportation - there wouldn't be a school bus - wasn't worth it. (Zavala also said she realized that the academics wouldn't necessarily offer an improvement over public school.)\n\nThen there's tuition. Zavala, as well as Nuñez and Velasquez, learned that a voucher might not even cover the full price of a private school.\n\nA typical voucher from Arizona's ESA program is worth between $7,000 and $8,000 a year, while private schools in the Phoenix area often charge more than $10,000 annually in tuition and fees, ProPublica found. The price tag at Phoenix Country Day School, one of the best private schools around, ranges from $30,000 to $35,000 depending on the age of the student. (The Hechinger Report has also found that private schools often raise their tuition when parents have vouchers.)\n\n\"Just because you gave me a 50%-off coupon at Saks Fifth Avenue doesn't mean I can afford to shop at Saks Fifth Avenue,\" said Curt Cardine, a longtime school superintendent, principal and teacher who is now a fellow at the Grand Canyon Institute, a left-leaning public policy think tank in Phoenix.\n\nListen to a WBUR/ProPublica Report on Arizona School Vouchers\n\nNext add the cost of food: breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack. These are provided by public schools to students from lower-income families, but at private schools, parents typically have to pay for them.\n\nAnd throw in a supply of uniforms with the private school's logo - hundreds of dollars more.\n\nPlus there is pressure to spend money at auctions, raffles and other fundraisers. (It's Christian to do so, many religious private school websites say.)\n\nConsider the choices available to Nuñez. For 17 years, she was a cashier at a restaurant, working 10 or more hours a day. Now she is raising three children, two of whom have autism. Private schools have some appeal to her in part because they might have smaller class sizes and more support for her son in third grade, whom she describes as \"an earthquake.\"\n\nZIP codes where more than 20% of households are in poverty\n\nOne of those private schools charges about $4,000 more than Arizona's standard voucher amount would cover, so she can't afford to send her son there.*\n\n*Nuñez's son may qualify for additional funding because of his disability, but she doesn't know how much more or how to apply for it.\n\nFor all of these reasons, Nuñez, Zavala and Velasquez - despite their initial interest - chose not to use Arizona's voucher program. Instead, they have each decided to start volunteering at the neighborhood public schools that their kids attend and to organize other busy parents to help make those schools better. They meet with their school administrators regularly. They lend a hand at drop-off and pick-up. They've organized \"cafecitos\": an informal sort of PTA coffee hour.\n\n\"I'm committed to the idea of public school for my and my neighbors' children,\" Velasquez said. \"I have zero regrets about not using ESA.\"\n\nThis school year, ProPublica is examining Arizona's first-in-the-nation \"universal\" school voucher program: available to all families, no matter their income. We are doing so because more than a dozen other states have enacted, or are attempting to enact, voucher initiatives largely or partly modeled after this one .\n\nArizona's experience holds lessons for the rest of the country amid an election season in which the future of education is at stake , even as issues like immigration and inflation grab more headlines.\n\nAs they were initially conceived, school vouchers were targeted at helping families in lower-income areas. The first such programs, in cities like Milwaukee and Cleveland, provided money specifically to poor parents who had children in struggling, underfunded public schools, to help them pay tuition at a hopefully better private school.\n\nConservative advocacy groups still say that this is the purpose of vouchers. \"School choice provides options for low-income families\" by breaking \"the arbitrary link between a child's housing and the school he or she can attend,\" the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank with deep ties to former President Donald Trump , said in 2019. \"At the core of the school choice movement is the aspiration that every family obtain the freedom to pursue educational excellence for their children - regardless of their geographic location or socioeconomic background,\" the Goldwater Institute , the Phoenix-based conservative think tank that pioneered and helped enact Arizona's ESA law, has asserted.\n\nBut now that groups like these have successfully pushed for vouchers to be made universal in several states, the programs are disproportionately being used by middle- and upper-income parents .\n\n\"Arizona is the school choice capital of the U.S. - great, but if it's not quality schools within a reasonable distance, then it's not meaningful choice for our families,\" said Stephanie Parra, CEO of ALL In Education, a pro-public-education Latino advocacy group that Nuñez, Zavala and Velasquez have been working with.\n\nMichael J. Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a pro-charter-school and school voucher education reform think tank, told ProPublica that Arizona's version of vouchers \"is not well-designed to achieve the goal of providing more choice for low-income and working-class families.\" He said that \"if you were going to design a program that really wanted to unlock private school choice for those families, you would design it very differently than Arizona did.\"\n\nPetrilli said that this would at least include means-testing the program: in other words, making larger vouchers available to lower-income parents, rather than giving the same amount to the very wealthy, who do not need the help. (Some states with near-universal voucher programs, he noted, give priority to lower-income families, unlike Arizona.) This would help poor parents cover the cost of transportation, among other things.\n\nArizona's program does allow parents to use their ESA money on transportation costs, but those who've already spent their voucher on tuition don't have anything left for a year's worth of Uber rides, city bus fares or gas. ESAs can also be used for homeschooling supplies, but most working parents can't homeschool.\n\nSome private schools provide additional scholarships or financial aid to students from lower-income backgrounds, though the process can be complicated to navigate. In some instances, ProPublica found, private school application systems even require a nonrefundable fee to apply for need-based aid.\n\nAdvocates for vouchers argue that many of these inequities already exist and are just as bad in the public school system. They note that poor families are often practically limited to the public schools nearest to them; it's not as though the government provides transportation if parents want to send their kids to a better public school across town. (At least not since the end of the desegregation-era practice of busing Black children to mostly white schools. Busing helped to desegregate the public schools and improved academic outcomes for Black students , but it was broadly unpopular.)\n\nMichael McShane, director of national research for the pro-voucher advocacy and research organization EdChoice, said that it's still \"early days\" for universal programs like Arizona's, and that \"there is an adoption curve anytime any new innovation takes place.\"\n\nAsked why these efforts haven't yet clearly helped lower-income families, McShane said that the \"first movers\" in a newly reformed system \"tend to be more risk-takers, which sort of comes with affluence.\" For lower-income parents whose children have long just been assigned to a public school, he said, school choice is \"a muscle that has to be learned.\"\n\nHe acknowledged, though, that more still needs to be done to help students from less-affluent areas access private schools, especially in a sprawling state like Arizona. This could include providing larger vouchers based on students' socioeconomic circumstances as well as working on the \"supply side\" of the system - developing new private schools in places where there aren't many.\n\nBut the question remains whether quality private schools, interested in making a profit, will have any reason to build new locations in South or West Phoenix, where most parents can't pay tuition beyond their $7,000 voucher. So far, in these areas of the city, the free market has mostly just provided strip-mall, storefront private schools as well as what are called microschools , with little on their websites that working parents can use to judge their curricula, quality or cost. (Private schools in Arizona aren't obligated to make public any information about their performance.)\n\nThese schools might not be accredited. Their teachers might not be certified. They might close soon. They are certainly not the large, established, elite private schools of the American imagination.\n\nWhile lower-income families are struggling to access or even learn about ways to use vouchers, wealthier parents enjoy a smoother path.\n\nAffluent parents in the Phoenix area whose kids were already attending private school, for example, told ProPublica that they are now being sent webinars and other emailed advice - from the private school administrators to whom they are already paying tuition - on how to apply for vouchers to subsidize that tuition.\n\nErin Rotheram-Fuller, a mom in South Scottsdale who is sending her daughter to a private school using the ESA program, is also an Arizona State University associate professor of education. She said that the program has largely worked for her family, in part because she lives in an upper-middle-class area and there are quality schools serving her daughter's needs that are relatively nearby. Moreover, she has been able to rely on word of mouth and help from her social circle, asking other ESA parents for advice about navigating logistical issues, like which documents to submit during the application process.\n\n\"As a parent, I'm grateful for it,\" Rotheram-Fuller said of the program. \"But there are several layers of barriers.\"\n\n\"Parents near us can make so many more choices than other families who really need it,\" she said.\n\nThe moms in South Phoenix agree.\n\nZavala said that another reason that she didn't ultimately submit those forms to send her daughters to private school using vouchers was that what she could provide materially was less than what she predicted the other kids at the private school would have. She worried that her little girls, if not equipped with the latest cellphone, laptop and other indicators of wealth, would feel left out or be bullied.\n\nVelasquez, meanwhile, wondered if she would be received in the same way at a private school as she is as a public school parent leader.\n\n\"Yes, there might be a nicer playground and basketball court, but would I be able to advocate for them?\" she asked, referring to her children.\n\nDani Portillo, superintendent of the Roosevelt School District in South Phoenix, which these three mothers all send their children to, told ProPublica that ultimately \"parents will speak by choosing our schools.\" She said, \"The idea that if they don't go to a private school, they're not giving their child the best - no, that's false.\"\n\nRead More\n\nThese parents made a clear school choice of their own, Nuñez, Zavala and Velasquez said: to say no to vouchers.\n\nMollie Simon contributed research.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI'm a ProPublica reporter who writes about issues affecting poor and working-class people across the country.\n\nI'm interested in hearing from current and former insiders at federal agencies that administer anti-poverty programs, as well as working-class people of all stripes about how their lives are changing.\n\nLucas Waldron is a graphics editor at ProPublica.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "School Vouchers Were Supposed to Save Taxpayer Money. Instead They Blew a Massive Hole in Arizona's Budget.\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nIn 2022, Arizona pioneered the largest school voucher program in the history of education. Under a new law, any parent in the state, no matter how affluent, could get a taxpayer-funded voucher worth up to tens of thousands of dollars to spend on private school tuition, extracurricular programs or homeschooling supplies.\n\nIn just the past two years, nearly a dozen states have enacted sweeping voucher programs similar to Arizona's Empowerment Scholarship Account system, with many using it as a model.\n\nYet in a lesson for these other states, Arizona's voucher experiment has since precipitated a budget meltdown. The state this year faced a $1.4 billion budget shortfall , much of which was a result of the new voucher spending , according to the Grand Canyon Institute, a local nonpartisan fiscal and economic policy think tank. Last fiscal year alone, the price tag of universal vouchers in Arizona skyrocketed from an original official estimate of just under $65 million to roughly $332 million, the Grand Canyon analysis found; another $429 million in costs is expected this year.\n\nAs a result of all this unexpected spending, alongside some recent revenue losses , Arizona is now having to make deep cuts to a wide swath of critical state programs and projects, the pain of which will be felt by average Arizonans who may or may not have school-aged children.\n\nAmong the funding slashed: $333 million for water infrastructure projects, in a state where water scarcity will shape the future , and tens of millions of dollars for highway expansions and repairs in congested areas of one of the nation's fastest-growing metropolises - Phoenix and its suburbs. Also nixed were improvements to the air conditioning in state prisons, where temperatures can soar above 100 degrees. Arizona's community colleges, too, are seeing their budgets cut by $54 million .\n\nStill, Arizona-style universal school voucher programs - available to all, including the wealthiest parents - continue to sweep the nation , from Florida to Utah.\n\nA weekly newsletter about wrongdoing in America\n\nThanks for signing up. If you like our stories, mind sharing this with a friend?\n\nFor more ways to keep up, be sure to check out the rest of our newsletters.\n\nDefend the facts. Support independent journalism by donating to ProPublica.\n\nIn Florida, one lawmaker pointed out last year that Arizona's program seemed to be having a negative budgetary impact. \"This is what Arizona did not anticipate,\" said Florida Democratic Rep. Robin Bartleman, during a floor debate. \"What is our backup plan to fill that budget hole?\"\n\nHer concern was minimized by her Republican colleagues, and Florida's transformational voucher legislation soon passed .\n\nAdvocates for Arizona's universal voucher initiative had originally said that it wouldn't cost the public - and might even save taxpayers money. The Goldwater Institute, a conservative think tank that helped craft the state's 2022 voucher bill, claimed in its promotional materials at the time that the vouchers would \"save taxpayers thousands per student, millions statewide.\" Families that received the new cash, the institute said, would be educating their kids \"for less than it would cost taxpayers if they were in the public school system.\"\n\nBut as it turns out, the parents most likely to apply for these vouchers are the ones who were already sending their kids to private school or homeschooling. They use the dollars to subsidize what they were already paying for .\n\nThe result is new money coming out of the state budget. After all, the public wasn't paying for private school kids' tuition before.\n\nChris Kotterman, director of governmental relations for the Arizona School Boards Association, says that Arizona making vouchers available to children who had never gone to public school before wasn't realistically going to save the state money.\n\n\"Say that my parents had been gladly paying my private school tuition, because that's what was important to them - that I get a religious education. That's completely fine,\" Kotterman said. \"But then the state said, 'Oh, we'll help you pay for that.'\"\n\n\"There's just no disputing that that costs the state more money,\" he said, critiquing the claims of the Goldwater Institute and others who'd averred that this program and ones like it around the country would not be costly. \"That's not how a budget works.\"\n\nHeading into this fall, which will bring both a new school year and an election that stands to remake American education , ProPublica is going to be examining the complexities, lessons and failures of the nation's first universal school voucher program as a model for where the whole system seems headed. Arizona's program \"set the standard nationally\" and \"inspired a national movement,\" according to leading voucher advocacy groups; it is \"the nation's school-choice leader,\" per the longtime conservative columnist George Will.\n\nFor decades, voucher initiatives, including in Arizona, had only served small subsets of students. Often, eligibility was limited to certain poor students from failing public schools, whose families could use a voucher to switch them into a potentially better private school.\n\nIn Arizona, for example, vouchers as of 2011 were available solely to students with disabilities, to make sure that their families could afford a range of personalized education options. The program was then expanded to students who had lived in foster care and to Native American students before, gradually, the money started going disproportionately to wealthier households .\n\nBecause these measures were initially narrow in scope, some studies found that they had no negative impact on state and local budgets - studies that voucher advocates continued to cite even as states started considering providing vouchers to every parent who wanted one, which is a far more costly undertaking.\n\nUniversal voucher efforts, beginning with Arizona's universal Empowerment Scholarship Account program in 2022, allow parents to spend public money not just on private school tuition but also on recreational programs for their kids like ninja warrior training, trampoline park outings and ski passes , or on toys and home goods that they say they need for homeschooling purposes. (The average ESA award is roughly $7,000.)\n\nIn a statement to ProPublica, a spokesperson for Arizona's former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, who signed the universal voucher program into law, said that \"not only does Gov. Ducey have no regrets about ESA expansion, he considers it one of his finest achievements and a legacy accomplishment. And what he's most thrilled about is that Arizona's ESA expansion was followed by 11 other states doing essentially the same thing. Arizona helped set off an earthquake.\"\n\nVoucher proponents have long pointed out that private school parents have a right to and could be sending their children to public school at taxpayers' expense. So providing them with what is often a smaller amount of taxpayer money in the form of a voucher to help them pay their private school tuition is, the argument goes, a net savings for the public.\n\nThis is similar to arguing that the public should help pay for car drivers' gas because if they didn't drive, they might use public transportation instead, which would be a cost to taxpayers.\n\nDucey's spokesperson, Daniel Scarpinato, did not acknowledge that the net cost of universal vouchers has been far higher than voucher supporters originally promised. Instead, he reiterated that \"universal ESA costs are basically revenue neutral.\" The reasoning: Overall enrollment in Arizona public schools has been slightly down - ever since many parents withdrew their kids during the pandemic - creating some savings in the education budget that could be seen as offsetting the new voucher spending.\n\nDucey, as well as Matt Beienburg, the Goldwater Institute's director of education policy, blamed Arizona's budget crisis on current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, pointing out that she signed a 2023 budget that spent down what was then a surplus instead of keeping the money in reserve for a possible moment like this. (The 2023 budget was passed with bipartisan support.) Ducey did not answer a question about whether he'd had a long-term plan to pay for ballooning voucher spending, beyond relying on that one-time surplus.\n\nIn an email, Beienburg maintained that Arizona's current budget mess wasn't caused by vouchers; he blamed, among other issues, state revenue recently being lower than anticipated. (The Goldwater Institute in 2021 collaborated with Ducey to write and pass a tax cut that reduced income taxes on the wealthiest Arizonans to 2.5% , the same rate that the poorest people in the state pay, which is the leading cause of the decline in revenue .)\n\nDave Wells, research director at the Grand Canyon Institute, said that none of the competing budget trends that Ducey and the Goldwater Institute pointed to mean that Arizona can actually afford universal vouchers, at least not without making severe, harmful budget cuts.\n\n\"They chose to make ESAs universal and that has made the budget situation much worse,\" he said. \"We still had a budget shortfall and budget cuts. The cost is still the cost.\"\n\nNow that vouchers in Arizona are available even to private school kids who have never attended a public school, there are no longer any constraints on the size of the program. What's more, as the initiative enters its third year, there are no legislative fixes on the table to contain costs, despite Hobbs' efforts to implement some reforms . \"I have not heard them agree to anything that is a financial reform of the program at all,\" said Sen. Mitzi Epstein, the Democratic minority leader of the state Senate, referring to her Republican colleagues.\n\nArizona doesn't have a comprehensive tally of how many private schoolers and homeschoolers are out there, so it remains an open question how much higher the cost of vouchers could go and therefore how much cash should be kept on hand to fund them. The director of the state's nonpartisan Joint Legislative Budget Committee told lawmakers that \"we've never really faced that circumstance before where you've got this requirement\" - that anyone can get a voucher - \"but it isn't funded.\"\n\nRead More\n\nMost importantly, said Beth Lewis, executive director of the public-school-advocacy group Save Our Schools Arizona, only a small amount of the new spending on private schools and homeschooling is going toward poor children , which means that already-extreme educational inequality in Arizona is being exacerbated. The state is 49th in the country in per-pupil public school funding, and as a result, year after year, district schools in lower-income areas are plagued by some of the nation's worst staffing ratios and largest class sizes.\n\nSpending hundreds of millions of dollars on vouchers to help kids who are already going to private school keep going to private school won't just sink the budget, Lewis said. It's funding that's not going to the public schools, keeping them from becoming what they could and should be.\n\nHelp ProPublica Report on Education\n\nProPublica is building a network of educators, students, parents and other experts to help guide our reporting about education.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nDrive an hour south of Nashville into the rolling countryside of Marshall County, Tennessee - past horse farms, mobile homes and McMansions - and you will arrive in Chapel Hill, population 1,796. It's the birthplace of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, who helped found the Ku Klux Klan. And it's the home of Todd Warner, one of the most unlikely and important defenders of America's besieged public schools.\n\nWarner is the gregarious 53-year-old owner of PCS of TN, a 30-person company that does site grading for shopping centers and other construction projects. The second-term Republican state representative \"absolutely\" supports Donald Trump, who won Marshall County by 50 points in 2020. Warner likes to talk of the threats posed by culture-war bogeymen, such as critical race theory; diversity, equity and inclusion; and Shariah law.\n\nAnd yet, one May afternoon in his office, under a TV playing Fox News and a mounted buck that he'd bagged in Alabama, he told me about his effort to halt Republican Gov. Bill Lee's push for private school vouchers in Tennessee. Warner's objections are rooted in the reality of his district: It contains not a single private school, so to Warner, taxpayer money for the new vouchers would clearly be flowing elsewhere, mostly to well-off families in metro Nashville, Memphis and other cities whose kids are already enrolled in private schools. Why should his small-town constituents be subsidizing the private education of metropolitan rich kids? \"I'm for less government, but it's government's role to provide a good public education,\" he said. \"If you want to send your kid to private school, then you should pay for it.\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic provided a major boost to supporters of school vouchers, who argued that extended public school closures - and the on-screen glimpses they afforded parents of what was being taught to their kids - underscored the need to give parents greater choice in where to send their children. Eleven states, led by Florida and Arizona, now have universal or near-universal vouchers, meaning that even affluent families can receive thousands of dollars toward their kids' private school tuition.\n\nThe beneficiaries in these states are mostly families whose kids were already enrolled in private schools, not families using the vouchers to escape struggling public schools. In larger states, the annual taxpayer tab for the vouchers is close to $1 billion, leaving less money for public schools at a time when they already face the loss of federal pandemic aid.\n\nVoucher advocates, backed by a handful of billionaire funders, are on the march to bring more red and purple states into the fold for \"school choice,\" their preferred terminology for vouchers. And again and again, they are running up against rural Republicans like Warner, who are joining forces with Democratic lawmakers in a rare bipartisan alliance. That is, it's the reddest regions of these red and purple states that are putting up some of the strongest resistance to the conservative assault on public schools.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThanks for signing up.

Support independent journalism by donating to ProPublica.\n\nConservative orthodoxy at the national level holds that parents must be given an out from a failing public education system that force-feeds children progressive fads. But many rural Republican lawmakers have trouble reconciling this with the reality in their districts, where many public schools are not only the sole educational option, but also the largest employer and the hub of the community - where everyone goes for holiday concerts, Friday night football and basketball. Unlike schools in blue metro areas, rural schools mostly reopened for in-person instruction in the fall of 2020, and they are far less likely to be courting controversy on issues involving race and gender.\n\nDemonizing public education in the abstract is one thing. But it's quite another when the target is the school where you went, where your kids went. For Todd Warner, that was Forrest High School in Chapel Hill. \"My three kids graduated from public schools, and they turned out just fine,\" he said. \"Ninety-five percent of our students, our future business owners, our future leaders, are going to the public schools. They're not going to private. Why take it away from them?\"\n\nThe response from voucher proponents to the resistance from fellow Republicans has taken several forms, all of which implicitly grant the critics' case that voucher programs currently offer little benefit to rural areas. In some states, funding for vouchers is being paired with more money for public schools, to offer support for rural districts. In Ohio, voucher advocates are proposing to fund the construction of new private schools in rural areas where none exist, giving families places to use vouchers.\n\nBut the overriding Republican response to rural skeptics has been a political threat: Get with the program on vouchers, or else.\n\nThat's what played out this year in Ohio's 83rd District, in the state's rural northwest. Last summer, Ohio adopted universal private school vouchers, with middle- and working-class families eligible for up to $8,407 per high school student and even the very wealthiest families eligible for almost $1,000 per child. Private school leaders urged already enrolled families to seek the money, and more than 140,000 families applied for vouchers. The cost has exceeded estimates, approaching $1 billion, with most of it going to the parochial schools that dominate the state's private school landscape. Voucher advocates are now pushing to create educational savings accounts to cover tuition at unchartered private schools that are not eligible for the vouchers.\n\nSchool leaders in Hardin County - with its cornfields, solar panel installations and what was once one of the largest dairy farms east of the Mississippi - are deeply worried that vouchers stand to hurt county residents. Only a single small private school is within reach, one county to the south, which means that virtually no local taxpayers would see any of that voucher money themselves - it would be going to private school families in Columbus, Cincinnati and other large population centers. (And under Ohio law, the very public schools that are losing students must pay to transport any students who attend private institutions within a half-hour drive of the public school.)\n\nCraig Hurley, the superintendent for Hardin's Upper Scioto Valley District, is a solidly built 52-year-old who calls himself a staunch conservative. He attended the district's schools and has worked in them for 30 years. He knows that they provide meals to 400 students, nearly two-thirds of whom qualify for free and reduced lunch. Even though the high school can muster only 20 players for football - basketball fares better - the fans come out to cheer. \"Our district is our community,\" he told me. \"The more you separate that, the less of a community we're going to be.\"\n\nHurley has calculated that local schools are receiving less state funding per student than what private schools now receive for the maximum possible voucher amount. Yet private schools face almost none of the accountability that public schools do regarding how the money is spent and what outcomes it achieves. \"We have fiscal responsibility on all of it, on every dime, every penny we spend,\" he said. \"There's no audit for them.\" Not to mention, he added, \"a private school doesn't have to accept all students, right? They pick who they want.\"\n\nThirteen miles east, Chad Thrush, the school superintendent in Kenton, the county seat, noted that his school system is the second-largest employer in town, after Graphic Packaging, which makes plastic cups for vending machines. He worries that the rising cost of the voucher program will erode state funding for public schools, and he worries about what would happen to his district if a new private school opened in town. Thrush understands the appeal of vouchers for parents who want a leg up for their kid. But, he told me, \"we need to be looking at how we're preparing all students to be successful, not just my student.\"\n\nAs it happens, the two superintendents have a crucial ally in Columbus: their state representative, Jon Cross. Like Warner in Tennessee, Cross is an ardent pro-Trump conservative and deeply opposed to private school vouchers. At a legislative hearing last year, he cut loose at a lobbyist for Americans for Prosperity - the conservative advocacy group founded by the industrialist Koch brothers - who was testifying for vouchers, one of the organization's long-standing causes. \"Wouldn't we be better off taking some money in our budget to fix the schools?\" Cross said. \"I tell you what, I really like my public schools. I'm really proud that Carson and Connor, my sons, go to Kenton City Schools and get an education from there just like I did.\"\n\nCross' resistance to vouchers earned him the animus of the state Senate president, Matt Huffman, an avid voucher proponent. Huffman encouraged a primary challenge of Cross. So greatly did local school officials value Cross' support that shortly before the March 19 primary, they held a public meeting to explain the threat vouchers posed, with Cross in attendance. \"If the economy goes bad, are we going to pull $1 billion out for private schools?\" Thrush said. Or, he continued, would the public schools be left with less money?\n\nThe schools in Hardin and Marshall counties are majority white. But some rural Republican legislators in other states have been willing to buck their party leaders on vouchers even in more racially diverse districts. In Georgia, of the 15 Republican state representatives who blocked a voucher proposal last year, more than half came from rural areas with substantial Black populations. One of them was Gerald Greene, who spent more than three decades as a high school social studies teacher and has managed to survive as a Republican in his majority-Black district in the state's southwestern corner after switching parties in 2010.\n\nGreene believes vouchers will harm his district. It has a couple of small private schools in it or just outside it - with student bodies that are starkly more white than the district's public schools - but the majority of his constituents rely on the public schools, and he worries that vouchers will leave less money for them. \"I just felt like we were abandoning our public schools,\" he told me. \"I'm not against private schools at all, but I just did not see how these vouchers would help southwestern Georgia.\"\n\nAfter failing to pass a voucher program last year, the state's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, and proponents in the legislature tried again this year, and this time they succeeded, albeit with vouchers more constrained than elsewhere: They can be used only by students in school districts that are ranked in the bottom quartile and whose families make less than 400% of the poverty level ($120,000 for a family of four), and their total cost can't exceed 1% of the state's total education budget, which caps them now at $140 million.\n\nPartisan pressures simply became too strong for some skeptical Republicans, including Greene's counterpart in the Senate, Sam Watson. Seminole County Superintendent Mark Earnest told me about the conversation in which Watson let him know that he was going to have to support the limited vouchers. \"They have turned this into a caucus priority. It's getting very political,\" Watson said. \"Thanks for letting me know,\" Earnest replied, \"but all vouchers are bad for public education.\" Watson's response: \"I know, but I couldn't go with the Democrats. Sorry.\" (Watson did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe highest-profile rural Republican resistance to vouchers has come in Texas, the land of Friday Night Lights and far-flung oil country settlements where the public schools anchor communities. Late last year, the Texas House voted 84-63 to strip vouchers out of a broad education bill. In response, Gov. Greg Abbott launched a purge of anti-voucher Republicans in this year's primaries, backed by millions of dollars from the Pennsylvania megadonor Jeff Yass, a finance billionaire.\n\nAmong those targeted was Drew Darby, who represents a sprawling 10-county district in West Texas and who frames the issue in starkly regional terms: The state's metro areas depend on his constituents to provide \"food, fiber and hide,\" to \"tend the oil wells and wind turbines to provide electricity to people who want to be just a little cooler in the cities.\" But without good public schools, these rural areas will wither. \"Robert Lee, Winters, Sterling, Blackwell,\" he said, listing some hamlets - \"these communities exist because they have strong public schools. They would literally not exist without a good public school system.\"\n\nDarby, a fiscal conservative, is also opposed to a new entitlement for private school families that is projected to soon cost $2 billion a year. \"In rural Texas, there's not a whole lot of private school options, and we want our schools to get every dollar they can. This doesn't add $1, and it's not good for rural Texas.\"\n\nDarby managed to stave off his primary challenge, but 11 of the 15 voucher resisters targeted by Abbott lost, several in races so close that they went to a runoff. Abbott is unapologetic: \"Congratulations to all of tonight's winners,\" he said after the runoff. \"Together, we will ensure the best future for our children.\" Also succumbing to his primary challenger was Jon Cross, in western Ohio. His opponent, Ty Mathews, managed to make the campaign about more than just vouchers, taking sides in a bitter leadership split within the GOP caucus.\n\nAnd for all the concerns that local school leaders have about the effect of vouchers, the threat remained abstract to many voters. \"I'm not worried about it, because we don't have the revenue here anyways in this town for anything to be taken from us to be given to a bigger town,\" one 60-year-old woman told me after casting her vote for Mathews. A younger woman asked simply: \"What exactly are the vouchers?\"\n\nBut in Tennessee, Todd Warner and his allies staved off the threat again this year. To overcome rural resistance, voucher proponents in the Tennessee House felt the need to constrain them and pair them with hundreds of millions of dollars in additional funding for public schools, but this was at odds with the state Senate's more straightforward voucher legislation. The two chambers were unable to come to an agreement before the session's end in April, by which point the House bill had not even made it to the floor for a vote.\n\nFor Democratic voucher opponents in the state, the alliance with Warner and other rural Republicans was as helpful as it was unusual. \"It was strange,\" Rep. Sam McKenzie, a Black Democrat from Knoxville, told me. McKenzie compared it to \"Twins,\" a movie in which Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito played unlikely fraternal twins: \"Representative Warner and I were in lockstep opposition to this voucher scam.\"\n\nOne voucher supporter, Rep. Scott Cepicky, told me he was confident that his side would eventually prevail. \"We'll work on this again next year,\" he said. \"The governor is committed that we're going to run on school choice again.\" And Americans for Prosperity has made clear that it's coming after voucher opponents. Its Tennessee state director, Tori Venable, told Warner during the legislative session that \"I can't protect you if you ain't on the right side of this.\"\n\nRead More\n\nAnother conservative group, the American Federation for Children, sent out a text message in March attacking Warner for his opposition to \"parental rights,\" without using the term vouchers. And a retired teacher in Marshall County, Gwen Warren, told me she and her husband recently got a visit from an Americans for Prosperity canvasser citing Warner's opposition to vouchers. \"She said: 'We're going around the neighborhood trying to talk to people about vouchers. We feel like Tennesseans really want the voucher system.'\" To which, Warren said, her husband replied: \"You're very much mistaken, lady. We don't want vouchers in this county, and you need to go away.\"\n\nWarner remains unfazed by all this. He is pretty sure that his voucher opposition in fact helped him win his seat in 2020, after the incumbent Republican voted for a pilot voucher system limited to Nashville and Memphis. And he notes that no one has registered to challenge him in the state's Aug. 1 primary. \"They tried to find a primary opponent but couldn't,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I was born and raised here all my life. My family's been here since the 18th century. I won't say I can't be beat, but bring your big-boy pants and come on, let's go.\"\n\nHelp ProPublica Report on Education\n\nProPublica is building a network of educators, students, parents and other experts to help guide our reporting about education.

      "text": "Despite Trump's Win, School Vouchers Were Again Rejected by Majorities of Voters\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nIn 2018, Arizona voters overwhelmingly rejected school vouchers. On the ballot that year was a measure that would have allowed all parents - even the wealthiest ones - to receive taxpayer money to send their kids to private, typically religious schools.\n\nArizonans voted no, and it wasn't close. Even in a right-leaning state, with powerful Republican leaders supporting the initiative, the vote against it was 65% to 35%.\n\nComing into this week's election, Donald Trump and Republicans had hoped to reverse that sort of popular opposition to \" school choice \" with new voucher ballot measures in several states.\n\nBut despite Trump's big win in the presidential race, vouchers were again soundly rejected by significant majorities of Americans. In Kentucky , a ballot initiative that would have allowed public money to go toward private schooling was defeated roughly 65% to 35% - the same margin as in Arizona in 2018 and the inverse of the margin by which Trump won Kentucky. In Nebraska , nearly all 93 counties voted to repeal an existing voucher program; even its reddest county, where 95% of voters supported Trump, said no to vouchers. And in Colorado , voters defeated an effort to add a \"right to school choice\" to the state constitution, language that might have allowed parents to send their kids to private schools on the public dime.\n\nExpansions of school vouchers, despite backing from wealthy conservatives , have never won when put to voters. Instead, they lose by margins not often seen in such a polarized country.\n\nCandidates of both parties would be wise \"to make strong public education a big part of their political platforms, because vouchers just aren't popular,\" said Tim Royers, president of the Nebraska State Education Association, a teachers union. Royers pointed to an emerging coalition in his state and others, including both progressive Democrats and rural Republicans, that opposes these sweeping \"school choice\" efforts. (Small-town Trump voters oppose such measures because their local public school is often an important community institution, and also because there aren't that many or any private schools around.)\n\nYet voucher efforts have been more successful when they aren't put to a public vote. In recent years, nearly a dozen states have enacted or expanded major voucher or \"education savings account\" programs, which provide taxpayer money even to affluent families who were already able to afford private school.\n\nThat includes Arizona, where in 2022 the conservative Goldwater Institute teamed up with Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and the GOP majority in the Legislature to enact the very same \"universal\" education savings account initiative that had been so soundly repudiated by voters just a few years before.\n\nAnother way that Republican governors and interest groups have circumvented the popular will on this issue is by identifying anti-voucher members of their own party and supporting pro-voucher candidates who challenge those members in primary elections. This way, they can build legislative majorities to enact voucher laws no matter what conservative voters want.\n\nIn Iowa , several Republicans were standing in the way of a major new voucher program as of 2022. Gov. Kim Reynolds helped push them out of office - despite their being incumbents in her own party - for the purposes of securing a majority to pass the measure.\n\nA similar dynamic has developed in Tennessee and in a dramatic way in Texas, the ultimate prize for voucher advocates. There, pro-voucher candidates for the state Legislature won enough seats this Tuesday to pass a voucher program during the legislative session that starts in January, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has said.\n\nThe day after the election, Abbott, who has made vouchers his top legislative priority, framed the result as a resounding signal that Texans have now shown a \"tidal wave of support\" for pro-voucher lawmakers. But in reality, the issue was conspicuously missing from the campaigns of many of the new Republicans whom he helped win, amid polling numbers that showed Texans hold complicated views on school choice. (A University of Houston poll taken this summer found that two-thirds of Texans supported voucher legislation, but that an equal number also believe that vouchers funnel money away from \"already struggling public schools.\")\n\nIn the half dozen competitive Texas legislative races targeted in this election by Abbott and the pro-voucher American Federation for Children, backed by former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , Republican candidates did not make vouchers a central plank of their platforms. Most left the issue off of their campaign websites, instead listing stances like \" Standing with Public Schools \" and \" Increased Funding for Local Schools .\"\n\nCorpus Christi-area Republican Denise Villalobos pledged on her website that if elected she would \"fight for increased funding for our teachers and local schools\"; she did not emphasize her pro-voucher views . At least one ad paid for by the American Federation for Children's affiliated PAC attacked her opponent, Democrat Solomon Ortiz Jr., not for his opposition to vouchers but for what it claimed were his \"progressive open-border policies that flood our communities with violent crime and fentanyl.\" (Villalobos defeated Ortiz by 10 points.)\n\nMatthew Wilson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University, said that this strategy reflects a belief among voucher advocates that compared to the border and culture wars, vouchers are not in fact a \"slam-dunk winning issue.\"\n\nIn the wake of Tuesday's results in the presidential election, NBC News chief political analyst Chuck Todd said that Democrats had overlooked school choice as a policy that might be popular among working-class people, including Latinos, in places like Texas. But the concrete results of ballot initiatives around the nation show that it is in fact Trump, DeVos and other voucher proponents who are out of step with the American people on this particular issue.\n\nThey continue to advocate for vouchers, though, for multiple reasons: a sense that public schools are places where children develop liberal values, an ideological belief that the free market and private institutions can do things better and more efficiently than public ones, and a long-term goal of more religious education in this country.\n\nRead More\n\nAnd they know that popular sentiment can be and has been overridden by the efforts of powerful governors and moneyed interest groups, said Josh Cowen, a senior fellow at the Education Law Center who recently published a history of billionaire-led voucher efforts nationwide.\n\nThe Supreme Court could also aid the voucher movement in coming years, he said.\n\n\"They're not going to stop,\" Cowen said, \"just because voters have rejected this.\"\n\nHelp ProPublica Report on Education\n\nProPublica is building a network of educators, students, parents and other experts to help guide our reporting about education.

      "text": "In the Wild West of School Voucher Expansions, States Rely on Untested Companies, With Mixed Results\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nLast April, West Virginia awarded a nearly $10 million contract to a company called Student First Technologies to manage the state's Hope Scholarship program, which gives families about $4,900 per child to spend on private-school tuition and homeschooling expenses. The company's founder, Mark Duran, reacted with delight. \"We are very excited to serve your great State,\" he wrote.\n\nBut problems soon emerged , as reflected in emails obtained by a ProPublica public-information request. Some private schools were so late in receiving their voucher payments from families that they were having trouble meeting payroll. In late August, a state official wrote to Duran with a list of invoices that needed to be paid promptly, including three from a school, Beth Haven Christian in Chauncey, that had \"called and indicated they are experiencing significant cash flow issues.\" The email continued, \"We need to make sure they have their funds early in the day if at all possible.\"\n\nThe school eventually got its funds. But the episode highlights the challenge that states are facing with their rapidly expanding school-choice programs: making sure the taxpayer money they are allowing families to spend on behalf of their kids is being processed efficiently and properly. To do so, they are relying on a small group of fledgling companies that have seized the opportunity to serve as middlemen for this fast-growing market. The work can be lucrative, but it has also proven so daunting that in several states, the companies that carry it out have ended up losing contracts to their rivals - sometimes less than a year after winning them - as questions arise and audits and lawsuits pile up.\n\nAn idea sold on the basis of its simplicity - give parents money to spend on their kids' education as they see fit - has turned out to be anything but simple in practice. And this complexity comes at a cost: paying companies to run the programs.\n\nThere are now a dozen states in the country that offer universal private-school vouchers , making them available to families of any income level. The largest of those programs, in Florida, is now costing taxpayers nearly $3 billion a year, with the programs in Arizona and Ohio each drawing around $1 billion a year from taxpayer funds.\n\nIn some of the states, the money comes to parents in the form of \"education savings accounts,\" which can be used on education-related expenses other than tuition. These programs are especially complex to implement, since some form of oversight is needed to make sure families are spending the money in ways that comply with the rules.\n\nAngling for the task of managing this spending are four companies. The largest is ClassWallet, which is based in Hollywood, Florida. Its founder, Jamie Rosenberg, initially offered its online procurement technology to teachers and administrators to reduce the amount of paperwork involved in school expenditures. But the company has shifted to capitalize on the school-choice market. With backers including Lazard Family Office Partners, a global investment firm, ClassWallet has more than 200 employees and contracts in more than 10 states, among them Florida and Arizona, the latter of which has faced headlines about some parents using state education aid for questionable purchases as the cost of its program has swelled far beyond projections .\n\nThe smallest is Student First, based in Bloomington, Indiana, with 14 full-time employees. Both its founder, Duran, and its chief technology officer were educated in alternative settings, including homeschooling and so-called learning pods - kids from multiple families clustered together - and say they view the company as part of the larger cause of promoting school choice. Duran, 30, previously worked for his family's homebuilding company in northern Michigan, served as lifestyle assistant and boat captain for an executive couple and their family, and helped deliver a yacht on a 4,000-mile journey from northern Michigan to Key Largo, Florida, via Nova Scotia, Canada, and Nantucket, Massachusetts.\n\nThe other two companies fall in between in scale. Odyssey, based in lower Manhattan, was founded by Joseph Connor, 37, a former teacher and lawyer who had previously created a company called SchoolHouse, which connected teachers with the learning pods that sprouted up during the pandemic. Odyssey, with about 40 employees, has received investor funding from Andreessen Horowitz and Tusk Venture Partners, among others. It works with Iowa and Wyoming and recently won contracts for the newly expanding voucher programs in Georgia and Louisiana.\n\nThe fourth, Merit International, is based in Silicon Valley, and it likewise has considerable venture-capital backing, including from Andreessen Horowitz; its contracts include programs in Ohio and Kansas. The 100-person company also manages payments for government programs outside of education. One of its co-founders, Jacob Orrin, said in an interview that he, too, was drawn to the school-choice business by his background: He struggled in school when he was young, and he says he would have greatly benefited from having had more educational options. \"We're mission-driven - but we make a profit,\" he said.\n\nCompetition among the companies often gets fierce as they face off in state after state. They dispatch lobbyists to cast aspersions on their rivals with legislators and state officials. They try to influence the legislation creating the voucher programs to tailor them to their company's offerings. They feed whisper campaigns among parents about problems arising in states where their rivals are in charge.\n\nIn Iowa, after Odyssey won that state's contract in 2023, Student First and an Iowa organization it was partnering with brought a legal challenge, alleging \"substantial material misrepresentations\" by Odyssey; an administrative judge dismissed the suit .\n\nIn Arkansas, the state had selected ClassWallet in 2023 to manage its Education Freedom Accounts, which give families about $7,000 per student. But last spring, the state considered switching to Student First to save money. A lobbyist for ClassWallet paid visits to state legislators, warning them that this was a bad idea. \"They sent someone to talk to me,\" recalled state Sen. Bart Hester, a Republican from Cave Spring. The lobbyist for ClassWallet explained that the company has three times the number of employees as Student First. \"'There's no way they can do it,'\" the lobbyist said, according to Hester.\n\nStudent First won the contract, worth about $15 million over seven years. But by October, state officials had decided to switch back to ClassWallet, saying that Student First had missed deadlines to set up the program, was late in processing payments, and owed the state $563,000 in fees as a result of the delays. \"Student First Technologies is proud of our work to empower Arkansas families,\" Duran wrote in a response to questions from ProPublica. (Of Student First's experience in West Virginia, he said the company has been making \"month-on-month improvements, and this will never stop.\")\n\nClassWallet previously became embroiled in difficulties one state over, in Oklahoma. A 2022 investigation by The Frontier and Oklahoma Watch found widespread questionable spending under a program in which Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, provided $18 million in federal pandemic-relief funds for families to use for private-school vouchers or educational materials, to be overseen by ClassWallet. Some used the state aid to buy Christmas trees, gaming consoles, electric fireplaces, outdoor grills, dishwashers, pressure washers, car stereo equipment, coffee makers, exercise gear, smartwatches and at least 548 TVs.\n\nThe 2022 article quoted Rosenberg, the ClassWallet CEO, praising the program at a 2020 panel discussion: \"They were literally able to deploy $18 million without having to engage any human capital from the government agency, and for it to be almost hands-free and incredibly, incredibly streamlined.\" But a subsequent federal audit reported that ClassWallet had blamed Oklahoma for the abuses, saying that the company had offered to limit purchases to items preapproved by the state, but that a teacher who helped arrange the contract - Ryan Walters, now Oklahoma's education secretary - had declined this option. (Walters did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe problems with the program sparked an odd three-way legal fight, with Stitt attempting to sue ClassWallet and Oklahoma's own attorney general opposing the governor and blaming problems on poor state oversight. (The Stitt administration is still pursuing the case, now using outside lawyers. ClassWallet has said the claims are \"wholly without merit.\") The company declined to respond to specific questions, but spokesperson Jason Hart provided a statement saying \"ClassWallet is the country's most trusted citizen digital wallet technology platform.\"\n\nIn Idaho, ClassWallet had the contract to administer an early-pandemic initiative that evolved into what is now called Empowering Parents, a $30 million state program that gives families up to $3,000 each for supplemental educational expenses. The current system could be a possible prelude to a full voucher program, which is up for debate now in the Legislature. Odyssey won the contract in 2022, for $1.5 million per year. A year later, the state ordered an audit after receiving reports of spending on clothes, TVs, smartwatches and other noneducational items. The audit found that only a tiny sliver of purchases were inappropriate, but it ordered Odyssey to pay back the state for $478,656.22 in interest it had collected from unspent federal funding for the program.\n\nMeanwhile, parents and business owners were reporting other issues with the program under Odyssey's oversight, as reflected in emails obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request filed by ProPublica. Last February, Tina Stevens, the owner of a music store and academy in Coeur d'Alene that is one of the program's biggest vendors, wrote to her state senator saying that she had lost $10,000 because families were unable to access their funds to pay for music classes. She also wrote that Odyssey's requirement to ship all purchases to families was wasting money. (Odyssey said the shipping requirement was imposed by the state.) The system, Stevens wrote, is \"rife with more fraud than we ever saw last year and super easy to cheat.\" Stevens elaborated in an interview, saying that in one instance, she was required to ship a digital piano via a freight truck, at a cost of $423, even though the family it went to had come in person to select it. And it took her 1,000 hours, she said, to list and update her products on Odyssey's online marketplace for the program.\n\nStill, she said, the difficulties had not undermined her support for the program. \"Parents and kids need musical products and a lot of kids can't afford it,\" she said. \"I've had mothers coming in the door crying, saying 'I never thought I could get a musical instrument, and now my kid can have something I never thought they could have.'\"\n\nIn September, the director of the Idaho State Board of Education, Joshua Whitworth, wrote to Odyssey's CEO, Connor, listing problems, including \"ongoing customer service concerns,\" sales taxes charged in error, and vendors being owed payments since January 2024. Connor replied with a lengthy email defending the company, saying that the company had an above-average customer satisfaction rating in Idaho and paid out the \"vast majority\" of orders within a week. But days later, Idaho said it was switching back to ClassWallet .\n\nEmails show ClassWallet executives and lobbyists celebrating their victory and collaborating with state officials over how to word the announcement. \"The tone of this one was markedly more vicious,\" said one of the participants in the Idaho competition, describing the latest round. \"It's like two heavyweights exchanging blows.\"\n\nIn response to questions about the loss of the Idaho contract and the problems that preceded it, a company spokesperson said, \"Odyssey's bid was undercut on price and the decision to rebid had nothing to do with performance.\"\n\nRead More\n\nIn an interview, Orrin, the Merit co-founder, said the programs' problems were due partly to states coming under pressure to limit costs and expecting companies to operate them at thin margins. \"At a certain level, as states continue to squeeze on these budgets, it will be hard for anyone to deliver successfully,\" he said. Some companies were contributing to this by making unrealistically low bids and were then having trouble delivering. \"Some of the companies in this space are trying hard to chase the dragon,\" he said.\n\nVanessa Grossl, who worked for ClassWallet before being elected last fall as a Republican state representative in Kentucky, calls the new mode of spending \"Venmo government\" and predicts it will improve with time. The novelty of the programs has \"gotten some of them in trouble,\" she said. \"But you have to uncover those bugs in any new system. It's worth the price of innovation and discovery for working through the bugs.\"\n\nHelp ProPublica Report on Education\n\nProPublica is building a network of educators, students, parents and other experts to help guide our reporting about education.

      "text": "Biden EPA Rejects Plastics Industry's Fuzzy Math That Misleads Customers About Recycled Content\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has taken the first ever federal action against a system that misleads consumers about the recycled content in plastic products.\n\nA ProPublica investigation in June showed how the plastics industry uses a controversial accounting method called mass balance to advertise plastic products as 20% or 30% recycled even if they physically contain less than 1% recycled content.\n\nIt involves a number shuffle, done only on paper, that inflates the advertised recycledness of one product by reducing the advertised recycledness of another, often less lucrative, product. Done purely for marketing, it has been criticized by environmentalists as a greenwashing tactic.\n\nAccording to an EPA policy released this month, companies that want the federal government's stamp of approval for their sustainable products can no longer use such convoluted math.\n\nThe EPA's Safer Choice standard is a voluntary program that allows manufacturers to affix a \"Safer Choice\" label to their dish soap, laundry detergent and other products. The roughly 1,800 products that have earned that distinction include household cleaners sold in grocery stores and more niche products like industrial carpet stain removers. Until now, the program's criteria have focused on encouraging brands to reduce their use of toxic chemicals. But the updated standard , released on Aug. 8, strengthens requirements for sustainable packaging as well; plastic packaging must contain at least 15% postconsumer recycled content.\n\nA key requirement: The content must be determined \"by weight,\" effectively forbidding the mathematical sleight of hand.\n\n\"This is the turning point\" that will allow us to start killing the \"hoax\" of mass balance, said Jan Dell, a chemical engineer who founded The Last Beach Cleanup, a nonprofit fighting plastic pollution.\n\nIt's the latest of several Biden administration actions to tackle the plastic crisis, which is smothering communities, oceans and even our bodies with toxic material that doesn't break down in nature. Last month, the White House announced that the federal government - the world's largest buyer of consumer products - would stop purchasing single-use plastic by 2035. Reuters also reported that U.S. negotiators would support global limits on plastic production in ongoing talks for a United Nations plastics treaty.\n\nThis EPA decision shows that President Joe Biden's team is adopting more aggressive policies to curb plastic, said Anthony Schiavo, senior director at Lux Research. Schiavo's company analyzes global trends in emerging petrochemical and plastics technologies.\n\nThe new requirement effectively shuts out of the program any product made through a much-heralded chemical recycling technology called pyrolysis, which ProPublica's investigation revealed to be so inefficient that it cannot yield more than 10% recycled content. In practice, it yields far less. Mass balance has been key to marketing those products and the technology.\n\nA prominent plastics industry trade group defended mass balance and cited its use in other products like paper and fair-trade chocolate. \"Mass balance is a widely accepted accounting tool used by a variety of industries that would encourage more recycled content in the overall economy,\" Adam Peer, the American Chemistry Council's senior director of plastics sustainability, said in an email.\n\nThe EPA gives annual awards to participants that have done particularly well in its program. Those recognized in 2023 , for instance, included The Clorox Co., Rust-Oleum, Ecos and Seventh Generation, which grew their inventories of less-toxic cleaning products and educated consumers about the Safer Choice program.\n\nProPublica asked these four companies whether it would be difficult to transition to plastic packaging that meets the 15% threshold. None responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe EPA did not comment directly on the policy's implications for pyrolysis or mass balance. The agency instead referred ProPublica to comments it made last year to the Federal Trade Commission about mass balance, calling it deceptive and advising against promoting it. \"It would be clearer to focus on calculations that involve the actual amount of material used,\" the agency told the FTC.\n\nAfter an earlier version of the EPA policy, posted in November , left the door open for the use of mass balance, activists including Dell warned the agency about the accounting method's flaws. And a group of state and local officials, including the attorneys general of 11 states, shared similar reservations on how the EPA should define recycled content .\n\nIn response to those comments, the EPA wrote that the final policy was written to \"respect this consumer expectation\" that \"products with labels indicating use of recycled content contain post-consumer recycled content.\"\n\nRead More\n\n\"Common sense has prevailed here,\" said Peter Blair, who co-wrote the activists' comments with Dell. Blair, policy and advocacy director at the environmental group Just Zero, said he was thrilled that the EPA's final decision prioritized \"truthful, accurate\" labeling of recycled content for a program that's not explicitly about plastic.\n\nThe activists' campaign reflects the mounting pressure to scrutinize and regulate how plastic - especially plastic recycled via newer technologies - is marketed. European regulators have banned the most extreme version of mass balance. And the FTC is updating the Green Guides, which spell out how companies can advertise recycled content in sustainable products. Those officials, too, are considering whether to allow mass balance.\n\nBlair hopes the EPA decision sets a precedent for where the federal government will stand.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI report on the EPA and related agencies that oversee the environment, climate change and science.\n\nI'm interested in talking to people who work at the EPA, NOAA, USGS and similar agencies.

      "text": "On a Mission From God: Inside the Movement to Redirect Billions of Taxpayer Dollars to Private Religious Schools\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis story is exempt from our Creative Commons license until March 14.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nOn a Thursday morning last May, about a hundred people gathered in the atrium of the Ohio Capitol building to join in Christian worship. The \"Prayer at the Statehouse\" was organized by an advocacy group called the Center for Christian Virtue, whose growing influence was symbolized by its new headquarters, directly across from the capitol. It was also manifest in the officials who came to take part in the event: three state legislators and the ambitious lieutenant governor, Jon Husted.\n\nAfter some prayer and singing, the center's Christian Engagement Ambassador introduced Husted, asking him to \"share with us about faith and intersecting faith with government.\" Husted, a youthful 57-year-old, spoke intently about the prayer meetings that he leads in the governor's office each month. \"We bring appointed officials and elected officials together to talk about our faith in our work, in our service, and how it can strengthen us and make us better,\" he said. The power of prayer, Husted suggested, could even supply political victories: \"When we do that, great things happen - like advancing school choice so that every child in Ohio has a chance to go to the school of their choice.\" The audience started applauding before he finished his sentence.\n\nThe center had played a key role in bringing about one of the most dramatic expansions of private school vouchers in the country, making it possible for all Ohio families - even the richest among them - to receive public money to pay for their children's tuition. In the mid-1990s, Ohio became the second state to offer vouchers, but in those days they were available only in Cleveland and were billed as a way for disadvantaged children to escape struggling schools. Now the benefits extend to more than 150,000 students across the state, costing taxpayers nearly $1 billion, the vast majority of which goes to the Catholic and evangelical institutions that dominate the private school landscape there.\n\nWhat happened in Ohio was a stark illustration of a development that has often gone unnoticed, perhaps because it is largely taking place away from blue state media hubs. In the past few years, school vouchers have become universal in a dozen states, including Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. Proponents are pushing to add Texas, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and others - and, with Donald Trump returning to the White House, they will likely have federal support.\n\nThe risks of universal vouchers are quickly coming to light. An initiative that was promoted for years as a civil ­rights cause - helping poor kids in troubled schools - is threatening to become a nationwide money grab. Many private schools are raising tuition rates to take advantage of the new funding, and new schools are being founded to capitalize on it. With private schools urging all their students' families to apply , the money is flowing mostly to parents who are already able to afford tuition and to kids who are already enrolled in private schools. When vouchers do draw students away from public districts, they threaten to exacerbate declining enrollment, forcing underpopulated schools to close . More immediately, the cost of the programs is soaring, putting pressure on public school finances even as private schools prosper. In Arizona, voucher expenditures are hundreds of millions of dollars more than predicted, leaving an enormous shortfall in the state budget . States that provide funds to families for homeschooling or education-related expenses are contending with reports that the money is being used to cover such unusual purchases as kayaks, video game consoles and horseback-­riding lessons.\n\nThe voucher movement has been aided by a handful of billionaire advocates; it was also enabled, during the pandemic, by the backlash to extended school closures. (Private schools often reopened considerably faster than public schools.) Yet much of the public, even in conservative states, remains ambivalent about vouchers: Voters in Nebraska and Kentucky just rejected them in ballot referendums .\n\nHow, then, has the movement managed to triumph? The campaign in Ohio provides an object lesson - a model that voucher advocates have deployed elsewhere. Its details are recorded in a trove of private correspondence, much of it previously unpublished, that the movement's leaders in Ohio sent to one another. The letters reveal a strategy to start with targeted programs that placed needy kids in parochial schools, then fight to expand the benefits to far richer families - a decadeslong effort by a network of politicians, church officials and activists, all united by a conviction that the separation of church and state is illegitimate. As one of the movement's progenitors put it, \"Government does a lousy job of substituting for religion.\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, Ohio's Catholic bishops faced a problem. For more than a century, religious education had been deeply entrenched in the state; in Cleveland, the parochial system was one of the largest in the country. For decades, though, the Church's urban schools had been losing students to suburban flight. To keep up enrollment, many were admitting more Black students, often from non-­Catholic families. But these families typically could not afford to pay much, which put a strain on church budgets.\n\nCatholic leaders elsewhere faced the same challenge, but Ohio's bishops had an advantage. The new Republican governor, George Voinovich, was a devout Catholic who went to Mass multiple times a week, an expression of a faith that was inherited from his Slovenian American mother and deepened by the loss of his 9-year-old daughter, who was struck by a van that ran a red light. An unpretentious Midwesterner who loved fishing in Lake Erie, Voinovich had worked his way up from state legislator to mayor of Cleveland before becoming governor in 1991.\n\nIn office, Voinovich corresponded frequently with the state's most prominent bishops, in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. Their letters, which are collected in Voinovich's papers at Ohio University, show a close and collaborative relationship. The bishops wrote to thank Voinovich for the regular donations that he and his wife made to the church, which ranged as high as $2,000. They traded get-well wishes and condolence notes. \"The last two times I've seen you you looked a little tired,\" Voinovich once wrote to Anthony Pilla, the bishop of Cleveland. \"Please take care of yourself.\"\n\nMost of all, they strategized about increasing state funding for Catholic schools. As a legislator, Voinovich had worked to launch a set of programs that helped private schools pay for administration, special education, transportation and other services. His support for these expenditures, which by the early '90s amounted to more than $100 million, stood in contrast with his aggressive efforts to cut the rest of the budget. At one point, he banned peanuts and other snacks from official state flights. Legislators passed around a story about seeing him pluck a penny out of a urinal.\n\nBut Voinovich saw spending on parochial schools as fundamentally different, driven by his belief in the value of a Catholic upbringing. \"If we could reconstitute the family and get everyone into Church, about 60% of the problems we are confronted with would go away,\" he wrote to James Griffin, the bishop of Columbus. \"I can assure you that the money you spend to deal with all the problems confronting the community is much better spent than the way government would spend it.\"\n\nSoon after Voinovich became governor, he and the bishops began discussing another way to fund Catholic schools: vouchers. The notion of publicly funded subsidies for private schools wasn't totally new. After courts ordered school integration in the South, in the 1950s, some municipalities helped finance \" segregation academies \" for white students. At around the same time, the economist Milton Friedman argued that education should be subject to market forces, in part by paying parents to send their children to a school of their choosing. But no city or state had funded a true voucher initiative.\n\nFor the state government, there was an obvious risk to funding Catholic schools; the Ohio Constitution says that \"no preference shall be given, by law, to any religious society.\" Voinovich and his aides worried not only about political repercussions but also about the potential for legal challenges from groups like the ACLU. In April 1991, Voinovich intimated to Pilla that he was recruiting proxies who could obscure their alliance. \"We are quietly lining up 'heavy hitters' in the business community and are trying to identify someone in the legislature who would be willing to become our advocate,\" he wrote.\n\nVoinovich had an ideal partner in David Brennan, a well-connected local businessman. A towering presence at 6-feet-5 (not counting his customary cowboy hat), Brennan had attended Catholic school in Akron before earning degrees in accounting and law, and made a fortune forming corporations for doctors seeking tax benefits. When Voinovich ran for governor, Brennan was a major fundraiser for the campaign. Now he started cultivating allies, donating heavily to a Republican from the Cincinnati suburbs who was a promising sponsor of voucher legislation, as reported by the Akron Beacon Journal, which covered the early voucher push .\n\nIn May 1991, Voinovich and Brennan met to discuss creating a commission on school choice, which Brennan would chair. Soon afterward, the bishops provided 18 suggestions for possible members. Six of them ended up on the commission - with no mention of the fact that they had been selected by the church.\n\nAs word of the commission spread, it raised concerns. The following spring, an executive at Procter & Gamble, one of the state's largest employers, urged Voinovich to couch \"this sensitive issue\" in a broader effort at school reform. \"Vouchers on their own could lead to unnecessary divisiveness,\" he wrote. The head of the Ohio teachers' union warned that unilateral action \"could explode any chance at building a statewide consensus.\" Voinovich responded that he was prepared for discord: \"I am confident that whatever recommendations they come back with, it will be difficult for the Ohio Federation of Teachers to support.\"\n\nThe commission was moving fast. Brennan \"is doing an outstanding job,\" Voinovich wrote to Pilla. \"He is on a mission from God.\" Voinovich and Brennan took care to disarm political objections. One briefing document argued that any plan the commission produced \"must be substantially tilted in favor of low income ­parents and children\" and must require private schools to administer the same ­proficiency tests as public schools. By year's end, the commission produced its recommendation: Ohio should create a voucher pilot program.\n\nRepresentative C.J. Prentiss monitored the commission's work with foreboding. Elected to the Ohio House in 1991, Prentiss had distinguished herself as a leading defender of public education and was steeped in the struggle for school integration. Her father had belonged to the Congress of Racial Equality, and after Prentiss graduated from Cleveland's Marshall High School - where she was one of six Black students - she attended the 1963 March on Washington. Later, she joined local battles against school segregation, during which she met Michael Charney, a white teacher and union activist who became her third husband. She taught for a while in the Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights and served on the State Board of Education. In 1993, she and other Black officials in Cleveland condemned Voinovich's plan. \"It is difficult to see how subsidizing private schools will improve public education,\" she said. \"Private schools have selective entrance requirements, serve only private purposes, and are not accountable to the public.\"\n\nBrennan deflected the criticism, noting that the plan was still provisional: \"We believe when the education choice bill reaches the final stages, these fine legislators will feel differently than they do today.\" In fact, he and Voinovich knew that it would be tough to secure backing for a stand-alone voucher bill; school board members, teachers and administrators were already sending letters to legislators to object. In May 1994, Voinovich contacted Brennan to strategize about how to slip a voucher pilot into the next state budget. \"We are going to have to crawl before we walk,\" he wrote. \"I believe if we can really get it underway in one or two districts during my second term, we will have accomplished more than what [has] been accomplished thus far.\"\n\nA few weeks later, Voinovich's assistant for education policy, Tom Needles, sent him a strategy brief on a forthcoming lunch with the bishops. \"The Catholic Conference will continue to maintain a low profile in terms of its formal position on voucher legislation,\" Needles wrote. \"At the same time, the Conference recognizes that parent organizations in each diocese will play a very active role in lobbying for its passage.\" On the last day of January 1995, voucher proponents paid for six buses to carry some 300 children and parents from Cleveland to the Capitol in order to lobby legislators. As parents walked from office to office in the Statehouse, one declared, \"The public schools are preparing Black children for prison, the welfare office or the graveyard. As a Black parent, that's unacceptable.\"\n\nPrentiss and a state senator from Cleve­land decided to address the throng. With the parents visibly angry, she knew better than to dismiss concerns about their children's schooling. \"There is a crisis,\" she acknowledged. \"The question before us is, how do we improve the public schools?\"\n\nThe bishops, though, were far more organized, with efforts unfolding parish by parish across the state; a list in Voinovich's papers records hundreds of phone calls and letters to legislators, making the case for vouchers and inviting them to visit local parish schools. Voinovich urged them to do still more. \"I really need your help and would appreciate being kept informed as to what is being done so I can convey that to the leadership in both the House and Senate,\" he wrote to Daniel Pilarczyk, the archbishop of Cincinnati, in February 1995. The next month, Pilarczyk responded with another list of the church's actions, including some 20,000 letters sent to ­legislators.\n\nTwo weeks later, Voinovich let Pilarczyk know that the House had not only increased funding for Catholic schools but also authorized a \"limited scholarship program in the City of Cleveland.\" The program would start small, with several thousand vouchers worth about $2,200 apiece. Yet Voinovich recognized that it was a \"significant pilot project.\" At the time, the only other city that allowed private ­school vouchers was Milwaukee, and the initiative there had initially barred religious schools from participating. Cleveland's program, in contrast, had been designed from the start to benefit Catholic schools.\n\nIn June, the budget won final approval. Six bishops wrote Voinovich to express their gratitude. \"Everything we asked you to do was included in your budget,\" they told him. \"Without your leadership and gentle nudging of legislative leaders, none of this would have been possible.\"\n\nPrentiss and Charney quickly grasped the pilot's import. \"This is the beginning of the end for public education,\" he told her, only half joking. Prentiss resolved to monitor the program to make sure that the money was spent as intended. After one voucher recipient, an Islamic school, was found to have housed students in unsafe buildings, she successfully sponsored a bill requiring schools that received vouchers to meet the same minimum standards as public schools.\n\nMeanwhile, Prentiss kept pushing for public school reforms: all-day kindergarten, smaller classes, mentorships for at-risk boys. She and Charney were encouraged by test results showing that kids in public schools were performing at least as well as those with vouchers at Catholic schools.\n\nIn 1998, Voinovich was elected to the United States Senate; Needles, his aide, went to work as a lobbyist for Brennan. And the push for vouchers entered a new phase, as an aggressive generation of proponents took up a battle in the courts.\n\nIn both Ohio and Wisconsin, opponents, led by teachers' unions, were challenging the programs on the grounds that they violated the separation of church and state. The Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld vouchers; a federal appeals court in Ohio ruled against them.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court took up a First Amendment challenge to vouchers, based on one of the Ohio cases, in February 2002. Robert Chanin, a lawyer for the National Education Association, told the court, \"Under the Cleveland voucher program, millions of dollars in unrestricted public funds are transferred each year from the state treasury into the general coffers of sectarian private schools, and the money is used by those schools to provide an educational program in which the sectarian and the secular are interwoven.\" Chanin noted that ­virtually all the students in the voucher program were attending religious schools, rather than secular private schools.\n\nBut Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the likely swing vote in the case, interrupted to pick up on a point made by a state attorney who'd defended the vouchers. In evaluating Cleveland's choice program, shouldn't the court consider not only private schools but also other options available to students, such as public magnet schools and charter schools?\n\nThe question caught Chanin off guard. The issue was the constitutionality of private school vouchers, yet O'Connor was evoking public school options. The state pressed its advantage, with its lawyer stressing the limited scope of the pilot: \"It didn't take too much money away from the public schools, but gave enough for a limited program that is targeted to the most needy, to the poorest of the poor.\"\n\nOn June 27, 2002, the Court announced that it had ruled, 5-4, in favor of the Ohio program , arguing that it was \"part of a broader undertaking by the State to enhance the educational options of Cleveland's school children.\" Clint Bolick, a leading lawyer on the pro-voucher side, declared on the Supreme Court plaza, \"This was the Super Bowl of school choice, and the children won.\" Later, he and others gathered at the office of the Institute for Justice, a conservative organization, and toasted with Dom ­Pérignon.\n\nPrentiss was on vacation with Charney in Washington state when she got word of the ruling. \"PBS NewsHour\" invited her to come to a studio in Vancouver and record a response, but she was too upset to think about what she would say on camera. \"I'm not going to be the one,\" she told Charney. \"Let them get a lawyer.\"\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, the momentum in seeking alternatives to traditional public schools shifted to charter schools - publicly funded institutions that are administered separately from school districts. Many Democrats had championed charters in the '90s as a more palatable way to offer school choice, and Republicans had adopted the idea, too; Brennan, the chairman of Voinovich's school choice commission, launched a for-profit charter ­school venture.\n\nIn 2005, with charters threatening to cut into parochial school enrollment, Ohio's Catholic bishops secured a crucial expansion of vouchers beyond Cleveland: a new statewide program called EdChoice, which offered vouchers to students assigned to schools that were judged to be failing, many of them in Columbus and Cincinnati.\n\nPrentiss stayed in the legislature until 2006, becoming the second Black woman to serve as Senate minority leader. Up until the end, she led the resistance to vouchers. As she left the legislature, though, an impassioned advocate for vouchers came in: a Republican representative named Matt Huffman.\n\nHuffman was a lawyer from Lima, a small industrial city in western Ohio. Like Prentiss, he had grown up among activists, but with different political aims. His father, a lawyer and a county prosecutor, took a case against a local cinema that was showing \"obscene\" movies all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court; his mother co-founded one of the state's first pregnancy ­crisis centers after abortion was legalized.\n\nHuffman was the fifth of nine children, all of whom went to Catholic schools. This was possible, he said later, because the parish schools were so affordable in those days. But, as tuition climbed (partly to cover the salaries of lay teachers who replaced nuns), the student body skewed wealthier. \"The middle class was pretty much shut out of alternatives in education,\" he told the Columbus Dispatch in 2022.\n\nOne of Huffman's brothers became the principal of a Catholic elementary school. Huffman, after following his ­father into law, served as a fundraiser for Lima Central Catholic High. He also got involved in local politics, rising to president of the City Council. In 2000, he endorsed a young former Ohio State wrestling coach named Jim Jordan as he ran for the state Senate. Jordan, who is now one of the most stridently conservative members of the U.S. House of ­Representatives, later returned the favor by backing Huffman's campaign for the state legislature.\n\nBy this point, school choice was becoming Huffman's overriding priority. In Lima, he participated in a standing gin rummy game with the Rev. David Ross, a local Catholic priest, and Leo Hawk, the owner of a metal-forming company, who, in Ross' recollection, repeatedly pressed Huffman on the issue. \"Leo Hawk was very influential in terms of trying to inculcate him with 'Let the parents decide where to spend their tax dollars,'\" Ross told me. \"Leo was very forceful in those gatherings.\" (Hawk could not be reached for comment.)\n\nDuring Huffman's first four years in the legislature, the governor was a Democrat, and the focus was on protecting existing vouchers. But after the Republican John Kasich took office, in 2011, Huffman proposed a significant expansion: making vouchers available to middle-­class Ohio families, too, regardless of whether they were in a failing district. \"This is starting down the path of looking at funding education in a fundamentally different way,\" he said.\n\nThe proposal met with impassioned resistance. Opponents pointed to a ­report in the Plain Dealer that showed voucher students had performed worse than students at the public schools that they would have attended. Among the critics were public school administrators in Lima, where hundreds of students were already receiving vouchers because a few local schools were rated as failing. The exodus of students resulted in a loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars in state revenue. As Lima's school superintendent at the time, Karel Oxley, explained to me: Even if a class lost students, the school still had to pay for their classroom and teacher. To complicate matters, the students who left tended to be motivated kids from stable families, while special-needs students stayed. This made it harder for public schools to improve their poor test scores. \"You have to have your A-team to help the school be as good as possible, but the A-team moves over to the other school,\" Oxley, who also served as president of the state superintendents' association, said. \"It's almost impossible to catch up.\"\n\nOxley is herself Catholic, and consults for a Catholic school in retirement, but she testified against vouchers at a committee hearing around this time. She recalled that Huffman was adamant. \"There was nothing I could have said that would have allowed him to see that he might be stripping resources from the greater community,\" she told me. \"He said, 'You pay taxes, I pay taxes. Why can't my taxes go toward my children's school?' I said, 'Because you chose that private school.' He said, 'That doesn't make sense, Karel. My taxes should pay for my child's education.'\" (Huffman did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nHuffman settled for a partial victory: In 2013, the state allowed EdChoice vouchers for families with incomes up to twice the poverty line in any district. It was a step forward, but Huffman wanted the program to be available to wealthier families, and it would take another ally to help him realize his full ambition.\n\nPhil Burress was always candid about what had brought him to Citizens for Community Values: He was a former pornography addict. Burress had fought the addiction from the age of 14, until he finally swore it off, at 38. \"I became a Christian that day,\" he told me. From then on, he said, he was a \"better father and husband\" and \"started speaking out about things that are wrong.\" His background gave him insight into the enemy. \"You have to look at your communities through the eyes of a pornographer and stay ahead of them,\" he once told reporters.\n\nBurress, a former organizer with the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks, joined Citizens for Community Values in 1983. By then, the organization, which started as a Cincinnati prayer group, had devoted itself to fighting pornography and strip clubs, including various enterprises belonging to Larry Flynt, who launched his Hustler brand in Ohio. In 1990, it gained national prominence by leading the opposition to an exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs at Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center. Not long afterward, Burress took over as president. \"We are not some radical, right-wing, fundamental bunch of Bible-­thumping nuts out there yelling and screaming,\" Burress said at the time. \"We do our homework.\"\n\nThe group grew under Burress - by 1997, it claimed to have 25,000 supporters - and started taking on nationwide causes, such as pressuring hotels to stop offering pay-per-view porn. In 2004, it led a successful petition drive for an amendment banning same-sex marriage in Ohio, a factor in George W. Bush's narrow win over John Kerry there. \"I was thinking, No way we can get that many signatures,\" Lori Viars, a conservative activist in the Cincinnati exurbs, told me. \"But we ended up doing it.\"\n\nThe victory attracted more funding, which the group used to hire full-time lobbyists in Columbus. Its top issues were abortion, same-sex marriage, gay rights and, increasingly, school choice. Though the members were mostly evangelical, not Catholic, they shared the conviction that the public should pay for kids to attend religious schools. Still, Burress told me, the group struggled to persuade legislators to expand voucher access. \"We could not get any traction whatsoever,\" he said. What changed matters was \"electing the right people to office.\"\n\nIn 2017, Matt Huffman arrived in the state Senate. He had served the maximum eight years in the House and, like many other Ohio legislators, simply ran for the other chamber. In the Senate, school choice remained his primary cause. That year, he sponsored a bill to expand eligibility for vouchers to families that made as much as four times the poverty level. Catholic leaders were thrilled. \"I don't think I've ever seen a legislator who did more for school choice,\" a former employee of the Catholic Conference of Ohio, the church's public policy arm, said. \"He's just been a rock.\"\n\nHuffman still faced resistance from public school officials, but he now had influential assistance from Citizens for Community Values. In 2016, Burress was succeeded by a new director, Aaron Baer, who signaled a more expansive mission. Baer was a 29-year-old graduate of Ohio University, a hip-hop enthusiast raised by a single parent. \"This is a Christian conservative movement for the next generation,\" he told the Dispatch. \"We talk about poverty, human ­trafficking, opioids, while still talking about ­marriage.\" The organization moved its headquarters to Columbus and gave itself a forthright new name: the Center for Christian Virtue. Burress welcomed the change. \"I was glad to see them admit that without God we're nothing,\" he told me.\n\nBaer and Huffman were unlikely ­allies. Huffman liked to do impersonations and had a profane streak; he was once forced to apologize for making an ­off-color joke at an office party. But on vouchers they were effective partners, with Baer far more willing to advocate in public than the bishops were. In the next couple of years, Baer fought to get the state to define \"failing\" schools as broadly as possible, and called out suburban districts, many of which opposed vouchers, when they resisted accepting students from struggling city schools.\n\nBy early 2020, Huffman was still trying to make the case for a major voucher expansion. That January, he met with a few dozen public school officials in western Ohio. Craig Kupferberg, the superintendent for Allen County, which includes Lima, told me that he'd raised his hand and asked Huffman, \"Have you put anything in the bill to stop the David Dukes of the world from starting up their own private schools and having our tax dollars fund their hateful ideology?\" Kupferberg recalled that Huffman had looked at him \"like I was from outer space\" and said, \"What stops homeschooling parents from doing any of that?\" (Never mind that vouchers weren't going to home­schooling families.) Then Huffman embarked on a lengthy complaint about how many people viewed Catholicism as a cult.\n\nHuffman's proposal stalled again that term. But, two months later, the pandemic arrived and schools closed. After nearly a year, about a third of Ohio's 609 districts still hadn't returned to full in-person instruction. The holdouts included many of the largest districts, Cleveland and Columbus among them.\n\nThe state's parochial schools, in contrast, had mostly reopened after a few months. The Catholic Conference of Ohio highlighted students' educational gains in the legislature. \"A lot of legislators appreciated what we did for children, because a lot of legislators were frustrated, too,\" the former conference employee said. \"We were sort of a beacon in the COVID era.\" It helped proponents that many legislators had their own children in Catholic schools. Although Catholics account for only about 17% of the state's population, they constitute more than half of the Senate and a third of the House.\n\nAs the pandemic wore on, school closures inspired similar outrage in other states. They \"sparked a parent revolution, because families saw that school systems didn't care about them all that much,\" Corey DeAngelis, a leading voucher proponent, said on \"The Megyn Kelly Show,\" last May. \"This is the silver lining of the pandemic.\"\n\nMany parents were alarmed by virtual instruction. It was not just that lessons conducted by Zoom seemed frustratingly inadequate; they also offered a glimpse of what their children were being taught, which in some families caused consternation over a perceived progressive agenda. Viars, the Cincinnati-area activist, noticed a surge of interest in Christian schools. \"The books being pushed on these little kids were so objectionable,\" she said. \"It was really sexually explicit material for little kids. We heard that a lot: 'No, these kids should not be seeing any of this.'\"\n\nIn May 2021, two Republican representatives in Ohio introduced a \"backpack bill,\" which would give every ­family voucher money to spend as they saw fit: $7,500 for each high school student and $5,500 for each younger one. At a press conference announcing the bill , Baer stood beside its sponsors. \"In the pandemic, we saw the need to have innovative and different learning environments,\" he said. \"You had some families who, because their local public schools decided not to open for in-person education, they were forced into an online environment that wasn't ideal for them.\"\n\nThe bill went a step further than Huffman had before; whereas he had pushed for vouchers for all but the wealthiest families, the backpack bill included everyone. It was a bold move, but proponents had a new advantage: earlier that year, Huffman's Republican colleagues had elected him president of the Senate. In that role, not only was he able to push for vouchers - he could also block efforts to reform Ohio's redistricting system, which had produced maps heavily slanted toward the GOP. By 2022, the Senate had 25 Republicans and eight Democrats; the House was split 64 to 35. \"We can kind of do what we want,\" Huffman told the Dispatch.\n\nYet Huffman and his allies decided not to advance the backpack bill through regular legislative channels, which would require stand-alone votes in both chambers. Opposition lingered, even within their own party: Some rural Republicans were conscious that there were few private schools in their districts, and so their constituents' tax dollars would go toward vouchers used mostly by wealthy suburbanites. And, if more private schools did open in rural areas, that would drain enrollment from public schools that often served as centers of the community.\n\nInstead, Huffman and his counterparts used a maneuver that would have been familiar to George Voinovich: they slipped an expansion of vouchers into the budget, a 1,200-page document that they sent to Gov. Mike De­Wine just before the deadline. Families with incomes of up to 450% of the poverty level would qualify for full payments: $8,407 for high school students and $6,165 for younger ones. These sums came close to covering tuition at many Catholic schools, and far exceeded what many public districts received in per-capita funds from the state. Even families making more than that income threshold, which was $135,000 for a family of four, would qualify for some funding. \"Every student in Ohio will be eligible for a scholarship worth at least 10% of the maximum scholarship, regardless of income,\" Huffman's office said.\n\nMore than 30 years after Voinovich and the bishops proposed vouchers as a solution for underprivileged children in a single city, public subsidies for private ­school tuition were now universal in Ohio, covering tens of thousands of families. \"We're going to have the money to pay for it,\" Huffman said afterward. \"I hope more people take advantage of that if they want to.\"\n\nC.J. Prentiss died last April at 82. She had spent her retirement with Charney in a cottage on Lake Erie, in Ashtabula County. In her final years, declining health kept her from engaging much in the battle over public education. But she did have a confrontation with Huffman when she returned to Columbus for a Senate reunion in 2022. Several speakers had been chosen for the event, and when Prentiss saw that they were all white she asked Huffman about it. According to Charney, Huffman responded that he didn't have enough time to line up others. \"Don't lie to me,\" Prentiss said, and walked away.\n\nThat same year, a coalition of school districts, now numbering more than 200 , filed suit against the voucher expansion. The suit alleged that the program exacerbated racial segregation, by essentially allowing private schools to select their own students; 90% of the new voucher recipients are white, in a state where only about two-thirds of students are. The suit also alleged that the vouchers violated two principles of the state constitution: a bar against religious control of public school funds and a promise of an adequate education for all. A judge denied the state's motion to dismiss the case; a trial is expected in the coming months.\n\nAmong the districts that joined the suit is the one in Lima, Huffman's home town. Virtually all the students enrolled in Catholic schools there now receive vouchers. Enrollment at these and other parochial schools has not increased dramatically; as is true across the state, they have limited capacity, so they accept only those students they prefer. This undermines the narrative that vouchers allow families to escape their public school. But public schools still suffer. Kupferberg, the superintendent, estimates that in his county the voucher expansion is costing schools millions of dollars a year. Federal pandemic relief aid has helped mitigate the damage, but that is coming to an end. \"We're starting to feel the impact,\" Kupferberg said.\n\nMeanwhile, some private schools are raising tuition, knowing that vouchers allow families to pay more. In Centerville, south of Columbus, the principal of Incarnation Catholic School told parents last year that it would no longer offer a discount for families that had multiple students enrolled there. \"Our parishioner tuition rate is nowhere near the true cost to educate,\" she wrote. \"This increased revenue will allow us to increase teacher and staff salaries, address deferred maintenance, and hire additional staff.\"\n\nHuffman and his allies are pushing for more. Huffman (who has now moved back to the House, and was recently elected speaker) inserted funding for new construction at private schools into the last state budget, with an eye toward creating private school options in rural areas. Also on the table is legislation to create education-savings accounts for families with children in unregulated private schools that now can't receive vouchers.\n\nFor these coming fights, the Center for Christian Virtue is stronger than ever. The organization has assembled a network of dozens of religious schools, which pay the center $5 per enrolled student, up to $3,000 per school, to lobby on their behalf. In effect, the state's religious schools can now use some of the public money they receive to advocate for the flow of funding to increase.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2022, the center's revenue more than tripled, to $4.2 million. It used some of the money to purchase two buildings opposite the statehouse - one previously owned by the Dispatch - for a total of $2.35 million, giving it space to accommodate a staff that has grown to 20. (The Center for Christian Virtue did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nIn early October, the center held a policy conference, called the Essential Summit, at the Greater Columbus Convention Center. A main topic of discussion was Christian education, with sessions led by the executive director of the Center for Biblical Integration at Liberty University, the college founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. One session would address the question \"How should we plan for teaching knowing that humans are inherently corrupt?\" Another asked, \"Why do Christian educators have the most dignifying approach to all humans?\"\n\nRead More\n\nHuffman was slated to join a discussion with the president of Hillsdale College, a small Christian school in ­Michigan that has become a powerful incubator of conservatism. Also in attendance was Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, which produced the policy blueprint for the second Trump administration. The plan, called Project 2025, includes a strong endorsement of vouchers, and Roberts' presence was an affirmation of Ohio's role as a model for the school choice movement. In Florida, the number of voucher recipients approached half a million this school year, up 74%. (The state distributes the same voucher - about $8,000 - regardless of income.) In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott helped to defeat nearly a dozen anti-­voucher Republicans in state legislative primaries last year. He had $10 million in campaign funding from Jeff Yass, a Pennsylvania hedge fund billionaire who has made expanding vouchers his central policy goal.\n\nAt the convention center, conference staff turned me away, even though I had paid to register. I hung around as attendees emerged from the morning session, their tote bags filled with brochures for Christian schools, investing advice and health coverage. Many of the event's discussions were aimed at religious schools that were now supported with public funds. But, as I was about to approach Roberts, security guards blocked the path and told me to leave.\n\nHelp ProPublica Report on Education\n\nProPublica is building a network of educators, students, parents and other experts to help guide our reporting about education.

      "text": "\"This Was Not a Surprise\": How the Pro-Choice Movement Lost the Battle for Roe\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nAs all eyes were on the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday after a leaked draft majority opinion indicated it is planning to overturn Roe v. Wade, ProPublica spoke with journalist Joshua Prager, who spent 11 years dissecting the landmark case that guaranteed abortion rights for women across the country. For his acclaimed book \" The Family Roe: An American Story ,\" Prager interviewed upwards of 500 people including key figures on both sides of the case, most notably its plaintiff, Norma McCorvey, who was better known as Jane Roe. In delving into the untold story behind her life, those of the children she gave birth to and the monumental case, Prager unfurled the decadeslong history of the American war over abortion.\n\nPrager said indicators of the justices' leanings were clear while observing arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , a case challenging a 2018 Mississippi law prohibiting most abortions after 15 weeks' gestational age, which is the subject of the Supreme Court's draft opinion. Though the Court confirmed the authenticity of the document published this week by Politico, the final vote and decision are still pending. Prager discussed why he believed the road to this week's revelation was paved, in part, by decades of mistakes and missed opportunities made by the pro-choice movement. (In his book, Prager refers to those who support the right to abortion the way they refer to themselves, \"pro-choice,\" and those opposing abortion the way they refer to themselves, \"pro-life.\" We adhered to these conventions during our interview. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.)\n\nI absolutely did. Anyone who was a close follower of the issue could see that this was happening when we listened to the oral arguments in Dobbs. We knew where all of the justices stood pretty much, but there were two who we thought might go either way, Justice (Amy Coney) Barrett, Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh - two of Trump's three appointments. And to listen to them speak and question during oral arguments in Dobbs, we could see where they were going.\n\nKavanaugh, over and again, was speaking about precedents that the Supreme Court had previously overturned. Justice Barrett, meantime, was speaking about the fact that adoption is, as she put it, a viable alternative to abortion.\n\nWhat was so fascinating about this and tragic, if you're a person who believes that Roe ought not to be overturned, was that the Supreme Court did not need Justice (John) Roberts, the chief justice anymore; the conservative bloc now doesn't need him. They have the votes that they need 5 to 4 without him. He is an incrementalist. He is a person who respects precedent. He really cares about the image of the court, does not want it to be seen as simply a political body. And he was desperate to not actually have the headline that we had last night. He wanted to see Roe maintained, but sort of gutted. But he lost.\n\nSo this was not a surprise. If you step back further, when Roe was ruled upon in 1973 , it galvanized those opposed to it. And it gave (the pro-life movement) a very simple, clear target, a new raison d'etre: We want to overturn Roe. This is the culmination of 49 1/2 years of efforts and different approaches, novel approaches. And unfortunately, again, if you are a person who believes in reproductive choice, the pro-choice did not take a lot of that seriously for many years, and they are as much to, sort of, blame for this day as the pro-life will (take) credit for.\n\n(The pro-choice movement) did not foresee a war here. NARAL's executive director in 1973, when Roe was ruled upon, told her board after the ruling, \"The court has spoken and the case is closed.\" They saw this as, basically: It's over. We've won.\n\nThe very, very opposite is true of the pro-life, who said: OK, now we have to think about this strategically, how will we go about overturning Roe? As a result of that imbalance, the pro-choice were playing catch up really for 49 1/2 years, as the pro-life (movement has) over and over again come up with many different ways to chip away at Roe and has been remarkably successful. Just to give you a few examples:\n\nThe pro-life also used technology in a way that had never been used before by showing fetal photography. They used language that had never been used before, for example, coining the phrase \"partial-birth abortion.\"\n\nThey also used pseudoscience in a remarkable way. They came up with this very novel approach called \"post-abortion syndrome,\" saying that if a woman had an abortion, an enormous percentage of the time, she would suffer psychologically as a result of that. That's not true. In fact, the opposite is true. The majority of women who have abortions express relief as opposed to regret. If there is something that causes women grief, the studies show, it is relinquishing their child to adoption. These were all pro-life weapons in attacking Roe, and over and over again, you had the pro-choice movement outfoxed.\n\nRead More\n\nIn the early 2000s, one of the attacks on Roe was led by lawyer Allan Parker, who had represented Norma for a time. (The suit) said that Roe needed to become null and void because conditions had changed in the years since it had been filed. And the only way to file this suit was to have the original plaintiff file it. So he came to represent Norma and he filed this suit.\n\nWhat ended up happening was that the pro-choice basically ignored the suit. They said that it was a sad publicity stunt, and they did not file a single brief defending Roe in this case. And it ended up introducing into the judicial system these affidavits filed by women who said that abortion harmed them. And that idea ended up going right up to the Supreme Court. Justice (Anthony) Kennedy ended up citing them in 2007 in Gonzales v. Carhart. It was evident that Parker's lawsuit had been incredibly effective and powerful.\n\nIt shows all of the different ways in which the pro-choice have failed to meet the pro-life, have failed to repel their arguments and their strategies. And it speaks to a simple human reality that it's much easier to try to knock something down than to defend it. What we're going to see now is the very same problem that the pro-choice had, the pro-life now are going to have, because now you are going to see that this is going to galvanize the tens of millions of people who are horrified about what's happening now. They now will have as simple a marching order as the pro-life used to have to reinstate Roe or to come up with another way to ensure that abortion will be legal for women across the country.\n\nRoe was 1 day old in 1973 when Bella Abzug, who was a House representative from New York, urged Congress to codify Roe. She basically foresaw exactly where we are today, that there was the potential legislation to erode Roe. She introduced an act: The Abortion Rights Act, H.R. 254 , to bar states from creating new (laws) on abortion. Congress ignored her bill, and anyway, it was doomed to failure because Roe allowed for future legislation. It gave states the right to oppose regulations from the second trimester onward, but here we are now and people want to go back and do exactly what Bella Abzug was saying that we ought to do.\n\nIt's not only true, but something that, case in point, was embodied by Justice (Ruth Bader) Ginsburg's decision to not step down from the court in her 80s, during Obama's presidency. We would not be here had she done that. That is a simple fact. And that is a very painful fact, for she's obviously the greatest hero over the course of 50 years to the pro-choice movement, but whether it was hubris or it was an inability to see that Trump might be elected or just a very human, understandable desire to hold onto a job she loved, it was nonetheless a mistake with catastrophic consequences. And that, you can say, was the final nail in the coffin for Roe, but it was also the latest in a long line of missteps by the pro-choice of failing to properly address the situation in which they found themselves.\n\nAnd here we are, but again, it's now going to flip. If you're a person who cares about choice, that is the silver lining of this very dark, dark cloud that it is now going to galvanize in a way we have not seen in our lifetimes, those who believe in a right to choose.\n\nFiled under -\n\nAs a deputy managing editor, I lead teams of reporters and editors.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Arizona Regulators Closed a Failing Charter School. It Reopened as a Private Religious School Funded by Taxpayers.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nOne afternoon in September, parents started arriving for pickup at Title of Liberty Academy , a private Mormon K-8 school in Mesa, Arizona, on the eastern outskirts of Phoenix.\n\nIndividually, the moms and dads were called in to speak to the principal. That's when they were told that the school, still just a few months old, was closing due to financial problems.\n\nThere would be no more school at Title of Liberty.\n\nOver the course of that week, more parents were given the news, as well as their options for the remainder of the school year: They could transfer their children to another private or charter school, or they could put them in a microschool that the principal said she'd soon be setting up in her living room. Or there was always homeschooling. Or even public school.\n\nThese families had, until this moment, embodied Arizona's \"school choice\" ideal. Many of them had been disappointed by their local public schools, which some felt were indoctrinating kids in subjects like race and sex and, of course, were lacking in religious instruction. So they'd shopped for other educational options on the free market, eventually leading them to Title of Liberty.\n\nOne mom had even discovered the school by window shopping: It was in the same strip mall as her orthodontist's office, next to a China Palace, and she'd noticed the flags outside with Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints imagery. (The school was not formally affiliated with the church.)\n\nAn LDS member herself, she was soon ready to start paying tuition to the school from her son's Empowerment Scholarship Account - a type of school voucher pioneered in Arizona and now spreading in various forms to more than a dozen other states. ESAs give parents an average of over $7,000 a year in taxpayer funds, per child, to spend on any private school, tutoring service or other educational expense of their choice.\n\nYet Arizona's ESA program provides zero transparency as to private schools' financial sustainability or academic performance to help parents make informed school choices.\n\nFor instance, the state never informed parents who were new to Title of Liberty and were planning to spend their voucher money there that it had previously been a charter school called ARCHES Academy - which had had its charter revoked last school year due to severe financial issues. Nor that, as a charter, it had a record of dismal academic performance, with just 13% of its students proficient in English and 0% in math in 2023.\n\nWhen it was a charter (which is a type of public school), these things could be known. There was some oversight. The Arizona State Board for Charter Schools had monitored the school's finances and academics, unanimously coming to the conclusion that it should be shut down.\n\nYet just a month after the board's decision, ARCHES was re-creating itself as a renamed, newly religious private school, simply by pivoting to accept voucher dollars.\n\nIn other words, it was closed down by a public governing body but found a way to keep existing and being funded by the public anyway, just without the standards and accountability that would normally come with taxpayer money.\n\nArizona does no vetting of new voucher schools. Not even if the school or the online school \"provider\" has already failed, or was founded yesterday , or is operating out of a strip mall or a living room or a garage, or offers just a half hour of instruction per morning. (If you're an individual tutor in Arizona, all you need in order to register to start accepting voucher cash is a high school diploma.)\n\nThere is \"nothing\" required, said Michelle Edwards, the founder and principal of ARCHES and then of Title of Liberty, in an interview with ProPublica. It was \"shocking how little oversight\" the state was going to provide of her ESA-funded private school, Edwards said.\n\nAccording to charter board members as well as parents and family members of her former students, Edwards is a well-intentioned career educator who cares deeply about children. But she has repeatedly struggled to effectively or sustainably run a school.\n\nShe said that when she first transformed her charter school into a private school, she and her team called up \"every agency under the sun\" asking what standards the new school would have to meet, including in order to accept voucher funds. For example, what about special education students and other vulnerable children - would there be any oversight of how her school taught those kids? Or instructional time - any required number of minutes to spend on reading, writing, math, science?\n\nState agencies, she said, each responded with versions of a question: \"Why are you asking us? We don't do that for private schools.\"\n\n\"If you're gonna call yourself a school,\" Edwards told ProPublica, \"there should be at least some reporting that has to be done about your numbers, about how you're achieving. ... You love the freedom of it, but it was scary.\"\n\nThis school year, ProPublica has been examining Arizona's first-of-its-kind \"universal\" education savings account program. We are doing so both because other states have been modeling their own new ESA initiatives after this one, and also because President-elect Donald Trump has prioritized the issue, most recently by nominating for secretary of education someone whose top priority appears to be expanding school choice efforts nationwide. (And Betsy DeVos, his first education secretary, was and remains a leading school voucher proponent.)\n\nThese programs are where the U.S. education system is headed.\n\nIn our stories, we've reported that Arizona making vouchers available even to the wealthiest parents - many of whom were already paying tuition for their kids to go to private school and didn't need the government assistance - helped contribute to a state budget meltdown. We've also reported that low-income families in the Phoenix area, by contrast, are largely not being helped by vouchers , in part because high-quality private schools don't exist in their neighborhoods.\n\nBut the lack of any transparency or accountability measures in Arizona's ESA model is perhaps the most important issue for other states to consider as they follow this one's path, even some school choice supporters say.\n\n\"If you're a private school that gets most of its money now from the public, which has happened in Arizona, at that point there should be accountability for you as there is for public schools,\" said Michael J. Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a center-right and pro-voucher education reform think tank. \"If the public is paying your bills, I don't see what the argument is for there not to be.\"\n\nTo illustrate this double standard: Private school parents can speak at public school board meetings, and they vote in school board elections. But public school parents can't freely attend, let alone request the minutes of, a private school governing body's meetings, even if that school is now being funded with taxpayer dollars.\n\nArizona's School Transparency Rules Don't Apply to Private Schools, Even if They Get Public Funding\n\nPublic schools include regular neighborhood schools as well as charter schools.\n\nDefenders of universal voucher programs counter that the goal of American education should be a free market of educational options for families to choose from, unburdened by excessive state regulations and paperwork. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank associated with Trump , has maintained that in such a system, schools would have \"a strong incentive to meet the needs of their students since unsatisfied parents can take their children and education dollars elsewhere,\" which the group says would create \"direct accountability to parents.\"\n\nYet in a truly free market, opponents say, consumers would have information, including about vendors' past performance, to make purchasing decisions in their own best interests.\n\nAnd if the product fails and has had a history of similar problems - as Title of Liberty did - there would be recourse, as with \"lemon laws\" that protect consumers who've unknowingly bought a defective car.\n\nSeveral ESA parents across the Phoenix area said in interviews that they absolutely want educational choice and flexibility, but that they also want the sort of quality assurance that only government can provide. Most said that the Arizona Department of Education should provide at least some information as to the background and credentials of private schools and other educational providers that accept voucher money, and also that the department should do something to protect families from badly unqualified providers.\n\nRebekah Cross, a mother of five in the northwest Phoenix suburb of Peoria, said that the ESA program, overall, has been \"life-changing\" for her family; she is also an administrator of multiple Facebook groups of ESA parents. Still, she said, it's \"on you\" to check the credentials and the criminal history of every private school founder and provider to whom you're considering paying your ESA dollars, because in Arizona, \"anybody can start a private school, you have no idea.\" There are mostly \"just rumors to rely on,\" she said.\n\nCross pointed out that many local private schools and other educational vendors have started advertising on Facebook and elsewhere that they are \"ESA certified,\" even though there's no state \"certification\" beyond simply signing up to receive the voucher payments. \"There's no criteria; that's not a thing,\" she said.\n\n\"You're putting your kid in [a school], hoping it's going to work,\" Cross said. \"If it closes midyear, you're kind of screwed.\"\n\nDoug Nick, spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Education, responded that state law \"makes it clear that we have no authority to oversee private schools,\" even ones receiving public dollars.\n\nRegarding publicly funded private schools closing midyear, he said that parents \"have the wherewithal\" to find another schooling option \"regardless of the time of year,\" and that the law \"does not contemplate the department making recommendations to parents\" at all.\n\nAsked if the department knew how much public money had gone to Title of Liberty, Nick responded, \"We don't track that information since there's no business reason to do so.\"\n\nEdwards, the Title of Liberty founder, first had the idea for her own school more than a decade ago. She'd long been an educator; she even ran a tutoring business in high school, she told me. At the beginning of her career, she taught Head Start and kindergarten in public and charter schools.\n\nThrough that experience and also seeing her own six kids not always having their individual needs met in Arizona's K-12 system, she came to the conclusion that \"to try to teach every child the same is ridiculous.\"\n\nEdwards began pitching the state charter board on a concept for a school that would meld principles of hands-on learning, borrowed from the Boy Scouts of America, with a proposal that students be grouped by learning level - \"novice,\" \"apprentice\" and so on - rather than into standard grade levels.\n\nThe board ultimately allowed her to open this school, ARCHES, in 2018. But it kept a close eye on her finances, in no small part to try to prevent a damaging outcome for students like a midyear closure. While giving her room to innovate, which is a chief goal of charter schools, the board monitored her enrollment numbers and staffing.\n\nAs it turned out, Edwards had persistent problems not just with low state test scores but also with unsustainably low enrollment, which would later plague Title of Liberty.\n\nIn our interview, she attributed those issues to the transience of many students during the pandemic and post-pandemic period as well as her business managers not being as experienced \"as they probably should have been.\"\n\nThis March, the charter board issued a notice of its intent to revoke ARCHES' charter contract - a rare, serious move, according to ProPublica's interviews with board members. (Edwards later reached an agreement with the board to surrender the charter.)\n\nAt that hearing, one of the board members commented to Edwards that \"I love the fact that you have, you know, ideas and plans and things. ... [But] I'm concerned about the kids. I'm concerned about the staff. I'm concerned about the families.\"\n\nAnother added: \"Don't let that take away personally, on your end, the value of your intent.\"\n\nShe didn't. Edwards wanted to keep helping kids, she told me, including several ARCHES students whose families decided to stick with her.\n\nShe had the private school idea almost immediately. A post appeared on ARCHES' Facebook page: \"Hey parents! Interested in joining us next year at Title of Liberty Academy?\" This was accompanied by an invitation to an \"ESA workshop\" to help them fill out voucher applications.\n\nMeanwhile, Jason Mow , an ARCHES board member who was helping with its transition to Title of Liberty, tried to recruit new students: \"Get your kids out of the government run schools,\" he posted, adding, somewhat paradoxically: \"The state ESA program will pay for tuition!!!!\"\n\nAt one point, a parent asked him whether - if state money was going to be funding the school - it would be required to take part in state testing.\n\n\"As a private school using ESA, we have a great deal of latitude and not mandated to,\" Mow answered.\n\nHe also said, \"This is how we save the Republic.\"\n\nThis last comment was part of a larger move that Edwards' school was making: not just from charter to private and from some public accountability to none, but also from secular to religious with a right-wing bent, which was fully allowed even though it would be bankrolled by taxpayers.  So, where ARCHES had touted an \"American Revolutionary Classical Holistic Educational System,\" Title of Liberty would simply be a \"private faith-based school focused on the values of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Edwards had already been planning to move the school into a new space: a series of storefronts in a strip mall that another charter school had previously occupied.\n\nOver the summer, largely through sheer force of personality, she enrolled about two dozen students.\n\nBut Title of Liberty was ultimately even more disorganized than ARCHES had been. For one, Edwards told me, \"We didn't yet have [enough] students enrolled to be able to afford teachers. ... But we had to have teachers in order to be able to get students.\" She ended up hiring mostly her own family members, both for teaching positions and to do much of the school's financial paperwork.\n\nShe also blamed difficulties with the ESA process, like some parents being told that they hadn't submitted their email addresses or signatures in the right format. She made clear that none of this involved the state actually scrutinizing her school; still, she wasn't able to obtain ESA funding as quickly as she had expected to.\n\nThe landlord, waiting on unpaid rent, finally asked Edwards to pack up the school and leave. According to one of the property managers, \"She just left the space for us to deal with this shit,\" which he said amounted to six large dumpsters' worth.\n\nEdwards responded that she couldn't afford moving vehicles or storage space for all of those desks, bookshelves, books and files. She said that she'd provided the landlord with information about another school that could have moved in and used the furniture and supplies. (A representative of the owner of the building said that they were done with questionably funded schools by that point, and that they gave Edwards time to clear out.)\n\n\"It all depends on how you define success,\" Edwards told me. \"I feel like the time that our kids had with us was valuable and they learned a lot and took a lot with them from that.\"\n\n\"We did try to hold to a super high standard,\" she added, noting that there's no one at the state level checking on all the other private schools out there that might not care to meet that standard.\n\nCalls for school transparency and accountability used to be a feature of the center-right education reform movement. No Child Left Behind , one of President George W. Bush's signature legislative achievements, mandated that public school students in certain grades undergo standardized testing in core subjects, on the grounds that schools should have to prove that they're educating kids up to state standards and, if they're not, to improve or else risk losing funding.\n\nThat testing was often rote, providing incomplete information as to the varied lives of students and pressuring many teachers to \"teach to the test,\" critics alleged. But it did offer a window into school performance - which, in turn, gave the voucher movement ammunition to criticize failing public schools.\n\nStill, early voucher efforts too included basic transparency and accountability measures. When vouchers were first proposed in Arizona, for instance, a state task force said that \"private schools must also participate in the same accountability process as public schools in order to qualify for state funding.\" Louisiana's voucher program, similarly, required participating private schools to administer state student achievement tests just like public schools did.\n\nBut voucher advocates changed course between 2017 and 2020. By that time, several academic studies had found that larger voucher programs had produced severe declines in student performance, especially in math .\n\nAsked about a set of particularly negative findings out of Louisiana, DeVos, Trump's secretary of education, blamed the state's voucher program for being \"not very well conceived.\" Part of the problem was that it was overregulated, she and other advocates said.\n\nIn the years since, fully unregulated universal ESA programs have become the favored program design of many school choice supporters.\n\nThe result is a situation in which, on the one hand, the Arizona Department of Education annually publishes detailed report cards on all public schools in the state, including charter schools. You can look up any Arizona public school's overall letter grade (ARCHES had a D when it was still a charter school); the academic performance and progress of that school's students, including by demographic categories; the experience levels of its teachers, and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, Arizona private schools receiving public funding have to do no public reporting at all. If they want, they can self-report their enrollment and performance numbers to be published on websites like Niche.com , but they are free to exaggerate.\n\nIn other words, it's not that this newer ESA model has been a clear academic success or failure. It's just that the public, and more specifically parents, can't know.\n\nNot all states keep information as hidden as Arizona. At least five, for example, require schools that accept voucher money to be accredited or to provide evidence that they don't have financial troubles.\n\nYet even these minimal efforts at transparency and accountability have been opposed by big-money voucher supporters.\n\nWalmart heir Jim Walton, for instance, gave $500,000 this year to defeat a proposed Arkansas state constitutional amendment that would have required private schools receiving state funds to meet the same educational standards that public schools do. At the Ohio Legislature, provisions of a proposed bill that would've made voucher schools submit an annual report showing how they're using state funding were recently removed under pressure from voucher advocates.\n\nAnd in Arizona, Republicans in the Legislature have opposed every effort by Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs to increase oversight of private schools that receive ESA money - except for one reform: They decided that such schools must fingerprint their teachers.\n\nBut the new law doesn't require the ESA schools to run those fingerprints through any database or to use them in any way.\n\nAbout a month ago, I asked parents if they could still pay Title of Liberty from their taxpayer-funded voucher accounts. I was curious not because I thought Edwards was collecting voucher money for a closed school but because it remained listed in ClassWallet, the Arizona Department of Education's privately owned payment interface for ESA schools and vendors.\n\nOne mom sent me screenshots showing that she could indeed still pay the shuttered school from her ESA account, though she would need to produce an invoice.\n\nWhat's more, when she'd clicked on it in ClassWallet, \"ARCHES Academy\" was what had popped up - the name of the failed charter school that was repurposed into Title of Liberty.\n\nThe school, whatever it was called, was still open, as far as the state of Arizona was concerned. (It was only disabled in ClassWallet after recent inquiries from ProPublica.)\n\nWanting to make triple-sure that I wasn't missing something, I drove over to the strip mall a few weeks ago to see if anything was still going on there.\n\nWhat I found inside was a scene of school choice in its endstage.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nWhen the Walton Family Foundation announced in 2013 that it was donating $20 million to Teach For America to recruit and train nearly 4,000 teachers for low-income schools, its press release did not reveal the unusual terms for the grant.\n\nDocuments obtained by ProPublica show that the foundation, a staunch supporter of school choice and Teach For America's largest private funder, was paying $4,000 for every teacher placed in a traditional public school - and $6,000 for every one placed in a charter school. The two-year grant was directed at nine cities where charter schools were sprouting up, including New Orleans; Memphis, Tennessee; and Los Angeles.\n\nThe gift's purpose was far removed from Teach For America's original mission of alleviating teacher shortages in traditional public schools. It was intended to \"generate a longer-term leadership pipeline that advances the education movement, providing a source of talent for policy, advocacy and politics, as well as quality schools and new entrepreneurial ventures,\" according to internal grant documents.\n\nThe incentives corresponded to a shift in Teach For America's direction. Although only 7% of students go to charter schools, Teach For America sent almost 40% of its 6,736 teachers to them in 2018 - up from 34% in 2015 and 13% in 2008. In some large cities, charter schools employ the majority of TFA teachers: 54% in Houston, 58% in San Antonio and at least 70% in Los Angeles.\n\nEstablished nearly 30 years ago to tap idealistic graduates of elite universities to teach at traditional public schools in high-poverty areas, Teach For America has evolved into an informal but vital ally of the charter school movement. Not only does it place a disproportionate number of its teachers in charter schools, but the organization and its affiliated groups also have become reliant on the support of the Walton Foundation and other school choice advocates, including a daughter of billionaire Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor. As board members of Teach For America's offshoot leadership organization, which gives to the political campaigns of former TFA teachers, Emma Bloomberg and a Walton family member have supplemented the organization's contributions to charter school proponents with their own donations.\n\n\"There's no question that Teach For America as it evolved became joined at the hip to a large degree with the national education reform movement. I suspect that some of this was coordinated in part with funders who are active in the Teach For America funding and the charter and reform activities,\" said Jeffrey Henig, a professor at the Teachers College, Columbia University, and author of a book about education research and charter school policy. \"These billionaire school reformers and the foundations with which they are allied really have become much more sophisticated in the way they strategically use their funding.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nTeach For America cautioned its public school teachers against participating in recent teacher strikes in Oakland , California, and Los Angeles. Ava Marinelli, one of just 35 Teach For America teachers in the Los Angeles traditional public schools, joined the picket line anyway.\n\n\"With the level of divisiveness between charter and public schools, Teach For America has aligned with the charter school agenda,\" she said in a recent interview. \"This shows with their donors and who their partners are.\" Teach For America said that it took no stance on whether its teachers should strike, but that the terms of their AmeriCorps funding prohibited involvement with organized labor.\n\nTeach For America CEO Elisa Villanueva Beard said that donors don't sway its approach. \"We don't have any one funder that is more than 5% of our overall budget,\" Beard said. \"We are very focused on what are our objectives, what is our mission, what are our values and what are the needs of the community.\" She said that current grants to Teach For America from the Walton Foundation and other organizations don't favor charter schools over traditional public schools.\n\nShe said that the organization does not have a national placement strategy and that where corps members teach is determined by the needs of regional partners. \"Every last strategy question is answered locally,\" Beard said. \"Our interest is just to make sure that we are working to ensure that we meet our partners' needs, are serving the students who need us most and are able to advance the needle for opportunity for them.\"\n\nBoth push and pull factors have fostered Teach For America's shift in direction. Since 2016, school districts in San Francisco; Jacksonville, Florida; and Houston have decided to end their contracts with Teach For America, citing, among other reasons, its teachers' relatively low retention rate. At the same time, Teach For America and the charter school movement share a similar goal: promoting innovation by streamlining bureaucracy. Teach For America's alumni have started some of the nation's largest charter networks, including KIPP, Rocketship Education, IDEA and YES Prep.\n\nWhichever type of school they serve in, Teach For America's teachers devote their intelligence and energy to helping low-income and minority students and closing the nation's unrelenting achievement gap. But its metamorphosis reflects a broader trend: As nonunion charter schools have gained acceptance in the past 20 years, political support for traditional public schools and teacher unions has eroded.\n\nWhile both the Obama and Trump administrations have backed charter schools, the appointment of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who once called the traditional public education system a \"dead end,\" fractured the political consensus. The issue divides candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. Bernie Sanders has called for a moratorium on federal funding of charters until a national review of their growth is conducted. Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have criticized for-profit charter schools, with Sanders advocating an outright ban .\n\nOther candidates, such as Cory Booker and Beto O'Rourke, are sympathetic to charters. As Newark's mayor, Booker raised millions in private funds for education reforms, including the expansion of charter schools. O'Rourke, whose wife started a charter school, has called them a \"good idea\" for encouraging competition and innovation.\n\nAs a Princeton University senior in 1989, Wendy Kopp had a radical idea to curb the teacher shortages plaguing America's least resourced public school classrooms: Send them the country's brightest college graduates.\n\n\"We take all of these promising future leaders and have their first two years be teaching in low-income communities, instead of working in banks,\" Kopp said. \"I thought that would change everything. It would change the consciousness of the country.\"\n\nWithin a year, Kopp's idea became Teach For America, which recruits new graduates from top colleges, trains them for five weeks, places them in schools nationwide and mentors them during a two-year classroom commitment.\n\nFueled by Kopp's prolific fundraising, the nonprofit grew quickly. In 2000, it raised $25 million from private donors, government grants and foundations, which supported about 1,600 new corps members a year. By 2016, its contributions and grants rose to $245 million with an endowment of about $208 million, enough for 3,500 new members a year. Today, Teach For America ranks among the 100 largest nonprofits in the country.\n\nThe charter school movement, which arose soon after Teach For America's founding, was booming as well. Publicly funded but privately managed, and regarded by some proponents as a way to fix a failing education system weighed down by unions and bureaucracy, charter schools nearly tripled in enrollment from 2006 to 2016.\n\nWhile Teach For America has received more than $40 million annually in government grants, according to the recent tax filings , some of its largest private donors also bankroll charter schools. Over the years, these backers - including Greg Penner, Walmart's board chairman and a Walton family member by marriage; Arthur Rock, a retired Silicon Valley entrepreneur; and Eli Broad, a Los Angeles philanthropist - have cycled through Teach For America's board. Together, the three tycoons and their family foundations have doled out at least $200 million to Teach For America.\n\n\"There are only so many donors and Teach For America is probably going after all of them, certainly whether they have a charter agenda or not, but many of them are very supportive of charters,\" Kopp said.\n\nRock said in an email that he devotes almost all of his time and philanthropy to supporting K-12 education. \"I support those organizations which have a proven record of helping children,\" he said. Penner declined to comment, and Broad did not respond to questions related to his support of the organization.\n\nTeach For America has long maintained that it does not prefer charter schools. \"We believe in public education,\" the organization states on a webpage devoted to combating criticism. \"We're not concerned about whether kids (or teachers) go to traditional district schools or public charter schools or innovative magnet schools, and TFA takes no institutional position on school governance.\"\n\nMarc Sternberg, a former corps member, now runs K-12 education for the Walton Family Foundation, which has given more than $100 million to Teach For America over the years. He said the foundation has a \"bedrock partnership\" with Teach For America. To Sternberg, the missions of the two organizations are intertwined: expanding educational opportunity, and options, for children.\n\n\"I was placed in a school that was pretty dysfunctional,\" said Sternberg, reflecting on his Teach For America experience at a traditional public school in the South Bronx in the late 1990s. \"It lacked a leadership thesis that is necessary for organizational success. The entrepreneur walks into that environment, and sees all the great things, and develops an understanding of the problem statement and then wants to do something about it.\"\n\nWhile Sternberg said that the Walton foundation is \"agnostic\" about the types of schools it funds, the foundation has been one of the most generous supporters of charter schools, having spent more than $385 million to help launch and sustain about a quarter of the nation's charter schools since 1997. In 2016, the foundation announced that it would spend an additional $1 billion to support charter schools, expand school choice and develop \"pipelines of talent.\"\n\nThe foundation's 2013-15 grant paid more for placing TFA teachers in charter schools, Sternberg said in an email, because \"we wanted to ensure that the growing number of charter schools had access to high-quality educators given increased demand from communities.\" Its current grants to TFA provide equal funding for teachers at charter and traditional public schools, he said.\n\nToday, in most of the cities targeted by the 2013 grant, TFA partners with more charter schools than traditional public schools, according to AmeriCorps data. In Indianapolis and greater Los Angeles , about two-thirds of TFA's partner schools are charters. In New Orleans , where nearly all of the schools are charters, all of TFA's corps members are assigned to charter schools. In the past five years, the proportion of TFA teachers placed in charter schools has increased even as the raw numbers have gone down, reflecting an overall decrease in corps members.\n\nAnother major donor to both Teach For America and charter schools is the Doris & Donald Fisher Fund, created by the founders of The Gap. In 2009, the fund gave $10 million over five years \"to continue Teach For America's role as a pipeline of teachers and leaders in the charter school movement,\" according to an internal agreement .\n\nIn 1994, two Teach For America alumni founded the Knowledge is Power Program, now one of the nation's largest charter school networks. As chief executive of the KIPP Foundation, Kopp's husband, Richard Barth, has overseen the network's expansion.\n\n\"Leadership is critical, and so we have been very involved with Teach For America, which is an organization that has really given birth to KIPP and to many of the top charter school organizations around the country,\" the Fishers' son, John, said in a filmed 2012 interview . \"The human pipeline - the pipeline of top talent - has really been accelerated through the success of Teach For America.\"\n\nAs of 2012, a third of KIPP's teachers were Teach For America corps members and alumni. KIPP did not provide more recent figures. \"You look at the percentage of the principals and teachers at KIPP and it's clear that it's a pipeline,\" Kopp said.\n\nAs school superintendents and state education directors, TFA alumni have pushed to expand charters. In 2011, former corps member John White became superintendent of the state-run Recovery School District, which oversaw most of New Orleans' schools. He's now the state superintendent of education. Over the same period, charter schools in the city and across the state have proliferated . The last traditional public schools in New Orleans are set to close or begin a transition to charter control by the end of the year, and by 2022, all of the city's schools will be charters.\n\nCami Anderson, a Teach For America alum and former employee, was a key adviser to Cory Booker in his unsuccessful 2002 campaign for mayor of Newark, New Jersey. In 2011, when Booker was mayor, she became Newark's superintendent of schools. She reorganized the district, which led to mass layoffs of public school teachers and an increase in charter enrollment.\n\nUnder Teach For America alum Kevin Huffman, who served as Tennessee commissioner of education from 2011 to 2015, the number of charter schools there doubled . The state's current commissioner, Penny Schwinn, was also a TFA corps member. In Washington, D.C., two charter-friendly Teach For America alumni have led the district over the past decade: Michelle Rhee and Kaya Henderson.\n\nEric Guckian, a former Teach For America corps member, headed the organization's North Carolina chapter, and he later pushed for more charter schools as a senior adviser for education to the state's governor. He said propelling TFA alumni into positions of power was always the plan.\n\n\"The promise of Teach For America, when I was pitching it to potential donors, was that all these kids are going to turn into leaders and that has manifested itself,\" Guckian said.\n\nNot all of Teach For America's alumni leaders favor charter school expansion. After teaching for more than two decades in traditional public schools in Compton and Los Angeles, Alex Caputo-Pearl was elected to lead the local union, United Teachers Los Angeles.\n\n\"There are a lot of very good people who are attracted to the program and do good work,\" said Pearl, who joined Teach For America in 1990. \"I was in a classroom because nobody would be there if I wasn't there.\"\n\nBut, he said, Teach For America's agenda has shifted. In Los Angeles, where about a quarter of students are enrolled in charter schools, Teach For America has become the \"main contributor to the characterization and privatization of public schools, rather than helping to address the teacher shortage in public district schools,\" he said.\n\nAt ICEF Inglewood Middle Charter Academy, in a low-income and predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhood in Los Angeles, five of the school's eleven teachers are TFA members, including English teacher Joy McCreary. One morning in May, she peppered her seventh graders with questions about a passage they had read on the photographer Eadweard Muybridge.\n\n\"And what was Muybridge trying to find out by photographing a horse running?\" she asked a student in the second row of her classroom, which was decorated with white lights strung against curtained windows, student projects and motivational messages promoting humility and determination.\n\n\"If a horse could fly,\" the student responded. McCreary nodded.\n\nMcCreary grew up in the Los Angeles suburbs; both of her parents were teachers. In June 2018, she graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, with degrees in international development, political science and German studies, and joined Teach For America. Her five weeks of training included coursework and teaching at a summer school program. Unlike teachers at traditional public schools, who typically gain certification by completing a qualified prep program and passing a standardized test, charter school teachers and TFA corps members may not need traditional certification. Over the years, TFA has successfully lobbied state and federal legislators for a classroom fast track for its members.\n\n\"Teaching is very sink or swim,\" McCreary said. \"The best way to learn how to teach is just to teach.\"\n\nWhen McCreary joined Teach For America, she didn't care what kind of school she ended up in. Now she's glad it's a charter school.\n\n\"Charter schools place a much higher focus on teacher development,\" McCreary said. At traditional district schools in Los Angeles, she added, \"You get these old, battle-ax teachers that have been there forever and are doing the same things every year and are not necessarily trying out new things or being challenged to try new things.\"\n\nNatalie Kieffer, the principal, also participated in Teach For America. After three years of teaching at a traditional public school in Los Angeles, Kieffer was laid off during the financial crisis and moved to a charter school. Within a decade, she rose from teacher to principal.\n\n\"There were opportunities for growth that I wouldn't have been offered in [the Los Angeles Unified School District],\" Kieffer said. \"Being laid off was a blessing in disguise.\"\n\nThe Inglewood school district recently revoked the academy's charter due to low academic performance , forcing it to close at the end of the year. Kieffer, who did not respond to emailed questions about the closure, will become an assistant principal at a charter high school next year. McCreary will move to another Los Angeles charter chain, the Alliance College-Ready network.\n\nAnother Teach For America corps member in Los Angeles, Faisal Hirji, is equally loyal to his school - a traditional public high school. The veteran teachers whom McCreary perceives as battle-axes, Hirji praises for their hard-earned wisdom. Hirji, who teaches special education, said TFA's five-week training, plus a handful of online modules that it provided on how to teach children with special needs, weren't nearly enough.\n\n\"Our kids are being dramatically underserved compared to what an experienced teacher could do,\" he said. (Teach For America said that students of its teachers were at least as likely to pass state assessments as their peers.)\n\nLike Hirji, all of Teach For America's corps members in Los Angeles public schools were assigned to special education classrooms. \"We were thrown into the fire,\" he said. Teach For America said that aside from the summer institute, it provides \"coaching, collaboration with veteran teachers, and local professional development opportunities\" throughout a corps member's commitment, but Hirji said its support was not enough. Realizing that Hirji needed a mentor, the principal at his East Los Angeles school had him work alongside a veteran special education teacher for his first semester.\n\n\"I didn't learn anything from Teach For America,\" he said. \"I learned it all from my school.\"\n\nTypically, public school districts or charter schools pay Teach For America an annual finder's fee of $3,000 to $6,000 per teacher. From 2013 through 2017, Teach For America reaped more than $110 million in recruitment and placement fees, according to tax filings. The districts or charters also pay the teachers' salaries and benefits.\n\nOften, they're ponying up for short-timers. According to Teach For America, about 30% of its corps members leave teaching at the end of their two-year terms, and research has shown that only one-fourth stay in the classroom for more than five years, compared with about half of all new teachers.\n\nIn 2016, the San Francisco Unified School District cut ties with Teach For America, citing concerns about retention rates. The following year, Duval County, Florida, which includes Jacksonville, ended its contract, which allowed for up to $600,000 a year to Teach For America for the annual recruitment of at least 100 teaching candidates. About a third of TFA corps members stayed beyond two years in the district and only a tenth stayed for five years, a study from Teachers College, Columbia University found. In comparison, 60% of new teachers who weren't affiliated with Teach For America stayed more than two years, and 40% more than five years. Teach For America said that its retention rate in Duval County has since improved, and that almost 80% of those who started teaching in 2017 plan to stay for a third year.\n\n\"One of the biggest questions was the return on investment,\" said school board chair Lori Hershey. \"We could certainly recruit teachers at less expense and keep them longer than two years.\"\n\nIn 2018, Houston's district renewed its contract with Teach For America despite plans to lay off hundreds of teachers. Then, this May, its board discontinued the contract for the coming school year. Mika Rao, a managing director for regional communications and public affairs at Teach For America, called the decision \"a great loss for [Houston's] kids.\"\n\nSchool board trustee Elizabeth Santos, who has taught in Houston's traditional public schools for over a decade, voted to end the contract, calling TFA \"problematic.\" It \"deprofessionalizes teaching, increases turnover and undermines union organization,\" she said at the board meeting.\n\nTrustee Holly Maria Flynn Vilaseca, a former corps member who briefly worked as a program director for Teach For America, supported renewal. \"We tend to have a teacher shortage every year and this just allows principals to be able to have the opportunity to hire with this route,\" she said at a board meeting .\n\nAbout a third of Teach For America corps members in Texas are still teaching there after five years, compared with over three-quarters of non-TFA teachers, according to a recent study by the American Institutes for Research. Rao said TFA's retention rate in Texas school districts has improved 20% since 2010.\n\nIs there racial inequality at your school? Look up more than 96,000 individual public and charter schools and 17,000 school districts to see how they compare.\n\nMany of those who stay in education after their two-year stint in a traditional public school eventually shift to charter schools. While a quarter of corps members were placed in charter schools, about 40% of alumni who stayed in education later worked in them, according to a review of survey data from Teach For America alumni in Texas. TFA said this disparity is misleading because their data shows that alums who continue as teachers, instead of going into administration, switch from traditional public schools to charters at a lower rate than the other way around. About two-fifths of its alums in Texas are currently employed in administration or leadership, mostly in charter schools, according to the survey.\n\nTiffany Cuellar Needham, the executive director of Teach For America in Houston, said many alumni shuttle between both types of schools. \"We see our alums make very intentional decisions about, for example, starting in a traditional public school district and maybe going to a charter school to get a certain sort of professional development that they think they need and then going back to a traditional district,\" she said.\n\nBeard, TFA's chief executive, said the rejections by major school districts don't indicate a national trend. \"Every community has different dynamics and politics and budgets, and there's lots of nuance and complicated factors going in,\" she said.\n\nThis year, TFA's turnover prompted Cristina Garcia, a Democratic state assemblywoman in California and former math teacher, to propose requiring teachers from Teach For America and other trainee programs to stay in the classroom for at least five years. Because Teach For America only demands a two-year commitment, it would have to change its model to operate in the state.\n\nSupported by the California NAACP and the California Federation of Teachers, and opposed by the charter school lobby, the bill would also ban the finders' fees that Teach For America charges schools. \"Allowing Teach For America to come in, learn on the job, to experiment and create reform advocates is not creating people that are going to stay in the classroom,\" Garcia said. \"Is it really about creating a void because we have a teacher shortage, or is it about creating education reform advocates?\"\n\nRepublican state Assemblyman Kevin Kiley cast the only vote against the bill in the education committee. \"It's probably the most disgraceful piece of legislation I've seen,\" he said. It passed the appropriations committee in May, but it has been delayed until next January.\n\nKiley himself contributed to Teach For America's low retention rates. After graduating from Harvard in 2007, he joined Teach For America and taught at a traditional public school in Los Angeles, where he started a debate team. After his two-year stint, he attended Yale Law School and worked as a deputy California attorney general.\n\n\"Many [corps members] stay in the classroom, but others move on, and that's by design,\" he said.\n\nWhen Kiley ran for State Assembly in 2016, Leadership for Educational Equity, a \" dark money \" group that does not disclose its donors in its tax filings , advised him on strategy in regular phone calls. \"I was a first-time candidate, and I was seeking wisdom wherever I could find it,\" he said.\n\nLEE contributed $8,360 to his winning campaign, according to campaign finance filings. In addition, after he filled out an internal questionnaire that asked the charter school supporter about his views on education reform and other issues, his campaign received more than $33,000 from three LEE directors - Silicon Valley entrepreneur Arthur Rock, Emma Bloomberg and Steuart Walton - and some of their family members.\n\nLEE \"put me in touch with two or three donors, which is a small percentage of overall funding,\" Kiley said. \"You draw from all sources when you're running.\"\n\nKopp established LEE in 2006 to help Teach For America alumni gain power, including by giving to their political campaigns. Although the two organizations operate independently, they share office space, and Teach For America donates millions of dollars to LEE each year through an intermediary foundation. Only Teach For America alumni can be LEE \"members,\" entitling them to free training on leadership development, civic engagement and other topics.\n\nLEE, which received $29 million in contributions and grants in 2017, helped more than 150 alumni run in local and state races in 2018, according to an internal presentation obtained by ProPublica. (Leadership for Educational Equity said the presentation's figures were incomplete and unreliable.) Half of LEE members that ran for office were women, and almost half were people of color.\n\nThe group gives to TFA alums regardless of their views on education. But if candidates indicate on the internal questionnaire that they support school choice or charters, directors Walton, Bloomberg and Rock often add their own individual donations, according to three former employees.\n\n\"The survey that the team uses is to really help the candidates to articulate\" their positions and values, said Jason Llorenz, vice president of communication for LEE. \"Certainly where we can help to connect to other people that can support them, whether that be about choice or about gun control or any number of other things, we certainly do.\" Leadership for Educational Equity said it has contributed to several candidates who were supported by teacher unions.\n\nCarl Zaragoza, LEE vice president of elected leadership, also said his team teaches candidates to network. \"With money, the value added that we offer our folks is to how they will build relationships with folks that do have money who are aligned with their values,\" he said. \"That is part of the individual coaching we provide.\"\n\nBloomberg, who is also on the KIPP board , said that Leadership for Educational Equity \"supports a diverse set of leaders in communities across the country who believe deeply in the importance of high quality public education.\" In the past, at her request, LEE has recommended candidates for whom her contributions could make the biggest difference, according to her communications adviser. It's a coincidence that some of the candidates she funds favor education reform, because that's not one of her criteria, the adviser said. Walton declined to comment on his donations or work with LEE, and Rock didn't address questions about them.\n\nBeard, TFA's chief executive, is also on the LEE board. When asked about its work, she said it's \"a totally separate entity,\" which Teach For America's alumni choose to participate in. \"We believe leadership development is core to what we do. We believe that we should be supporting our alumni in pursuing all of their interests and helping them ensure that they are accelerating their own leadership.\"\n\nVilaseca, the Houston school board trustee who voted to renew Teach For America's contract, was a founding teacher at a KIPP charter school. Walton family members and Rock gave a total of $20,000 to her 2017 campaign, in addition to $6,000 from LEE. Vilaseca did not respond to emailed questions.\n\nAlso in 2017, two Teach For America alumni ran against each other for the Los Angeles school board. Nick Melvoin, a charter school advocate, challenged board president Steve Zimmer, who taught at a traditional public school and was backed by the union. LEE contributed $2,200 to Melvoin, and $1,100 to Zimmer. (LEE said it gave another $1,100 to Zimmer, but his campaign treasurer said it was never received.) Rock and the Bloomberg family added $5,400 for Melvoin, but nothing for his opponent. Melvoin won and has become the most vocal charter supporter on the board.\n\n\"My north star is anything that will help improve outcomes for kids is good, and charter schools are doing that,\" Melvoin said. This year, he was the only school board member to oppose a citywide moratorium on charters.\n\nWhen Ava Marinelli heard last fall that her fellow teachers at Los Angeles Unified School District were planning a strike, she wanted in.\n\n\"I know where my values lie, and they lie with the union,\" said the second-year Teach For America corps member, who graduated in 2017 from Boston University. \"I'm not crossing a picket line.\"\n\nBut her decision carried a financial risk. Through Teach For America, she and other corps members received scholarships from AmeriCorps, a federal program that prohibits assisting or promoting union organizing . The money helped pay for Marinelli's coursework toward a master's degree in education, a key teaching credential.\n\nTeach For America cautioned Marinelli and other corps members not to strike, or else they would lose their Americorps funding. As a strike loomed, they asked Lida Jennings, executive director of Teach For America in Los Angeles, if they could give up their AmeriCorps money. Jennings agreed, but she told them that to retain even partial funding, they would have to cite extenuating circumstances for striking, such as harassment, pressure or bullying from other teachers, according to three corps members who spoke with her.\n\nSchool officials nationwide dodge accountability ratings by steering low achievers to alternative programs.\n\nIn this era of so-called \"school choice,\" a pattern has emerged: Students don't choose their alternative schools. They're sentenced to them.\n\nJennings confirmed this position in an email to ProPublica. The teachers \"had a difficult process to navigate due to the federal regulations they have to follow,\" she wrote. \"Those choosing to exit would have to demonstrate and detail extenuating circumstances, such as challenges at their placement school or other impact.\"\n\nMarinelli followed this advice. She told Jennings in an email that she faced \"intimidation\" at her school - a falsehood that still haunts her. \"I lied to exercise my civil rights,\" she said. \"I was encouraging my colleagues to go on strike. No one intimidated me to do this.\" Teach For America agreed to replace the striking teachers' lost scholarship money with private funds. It has since arranged that, in the future, all teachers who choose to join a picket line will be suspended from AmeriCorps during the strike and then reinstated at the end, with no impact on their scholarships.\n\nAlongside her students, their parents and her fellow teachers, and wearing a bright red scarf wrapped around her neck, Marinelli picketed outside of her school as well as the district's headquarters, frequently leading chants with a megaphone, for all six school days until the strike was settled. The union extracted key concessions, including a board vote on whether to support a statewide cap on the number of charter schools.\n\n\"It felt so hypocritical to join Teach For America for the social justice lens and then not go on strike, compromising the values that brought me to Teach For America,\" Marinelli said. \"Even though they claim to be an apolitical organization, I really felt there was an agenda.\"\n\nAnnie Waldman\n\nAnnie Waldman is a reporter at ProPublica covering health care.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

Jim Banks launched an Anti-Woke Caucus in the House.\n\nWas this email forwarded to you? Sign up here!\n\nFlickr/Gage Skidmore\n\nTHE NEWS\n\nRepublicans in multiple states are trying to roll back or prevent the adoption of ranked-choice voting, after Alaskaâs 2022 election â the stateâs first under the new system â helped a moderate Democrat and moderate Republican defeat conservatives endorsed by Donald Trump.\n\nAlaska, which has sent just two Democrats to Washington since 1980, is one of two states with a form of ranked-choice voting in place. Maine voters passed their own version in 2016, which was upheld by a judge after a Republican congressman sued over his loss to Democratic Rep. Jared Golden. The Republican got more votes in the first round, but lost when supporters of a third party candidate made Golden their second choice.\n\nThat race, and the recent Alaska elections, were held up by advocates as proof that the system worked by elevating less-extreme and more consensus-oriented candidates. It also woke up the opposition, mostly among Republicans. Florida banned municipalities from holding ranked-choice elections last year; South Dakota has advanced legislation that would ban it there; and most GOP legislators in Arizona support a new bill that would prevent any election except one in which âthe person who receives the highest number of legal votesâ wins outright.\n\nâThese out-of-state outfits came up here and experimented on us,â said Art Mathias, the founder of Alaskans for Honest Elections, which will begin collecting signatures next week for a ballot measure to scrap RCV and bring back party primaries. âTheyâve spent millions trying to convince us Alaskans how good the November election was and how it was great and beautiful.â\n\nAlaska voters introduced the âtop fourâ ranked-choice system in 2020, approving a ballot measure by a single percentage point after advocates, who said that the new system would honor the stateâs âindependent streak,â outspent critics 10-1.\n\nWith the reform in place, instead of seeking party nominations, candidates competed on the same ballot for one of four spots in the general election. Voters had the right to rank the final four candidates â 1, 2, 3, 4 â and tabulators would add up their second, third, and fourth choices until one candidate won a majority. Under the system, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a moderate Republican, and Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola both won victories over hard right opponents.\n\nMathias and other conservatives argue that the system is too complicated, too slow â it took 15 days for Murkowski to pull ahead â and that it âdisenfranchisesâ voters who donât rank every candidate. After Peltolaâs win, Trump called the top-four system a ârigged deal,â an attitude thatâs traveled far in his party.\n\nFormer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who lost last yearâs special and November elections to Peltola, has endorsed the rollback campaign, and will speak at its launch on Thursday. Kelly Tshibaka, the MAGA Republican who lost to Murkowski last year, founded her own organization, Protect Democracy, to dismantle âtop fourâ voting.\n\nâThis is a very, very dangerous move and a threat to our democracy,â Tshibaka told donors at the groupâs first rally this week. âIf we do not act now, the entire U.S. election system is about to change.â\n\nLast month, Palin flew to California for the Republican National Committeeâs winter meeting, where she supported a resolution to âoppose ranked choice voting in every locality and level of government.â Republicans were on record: Theyâd defend Americaâs âhistoric political party systemâ against one that its own voters didnât trust.\n\nâThe grassroots activists of the Republican Party have made it abundantly clear that they do not trust new election procedures, outcomes, and further complications of modern systems that sow additional distrust in elections,â read the resolution, which passed unanimously. âWe need to keep voting simple and secure.â\n\nDAVIDâS VIEW\n\nThe best argument that ranked-choice advocates have is that their system makes it tougher for fringe candidates to win, but easier to run, since itâs impossible for their votes to âspoilâ a race. Virginia Republicans learned that in 2021, holding a ranked-choice party convention that produced their first winning statewide ticket in 12 years, led by Glenn Youngkin.\n\nBut there are plenty of places where the winner of a Republican primary is a lock to win the general election anyway, and watching two MAGA candidates fall on their faces fueled a backlash that was already in progress. Ranked-choice vote counting also takes time, and conservative voters (like Trump) increasingly associate long counts with election fraud. Weâre going to learn, very soon, what happens when the GOP gets more invested in stopping this.\n\nROOM FOR DISAGREEMENT\n\nRob Richie, the president of the pro-ranked-choice group FairVote, said that while grassroots conservatives were getting organized to fight them, Republicans should consider the upside of the system. The GOP is coming off a midterms in which the more traditional âfirst-past-the-postâ primaries produced numerous candidates with limited appeal outside their base who blew winnable contests.\n\nâTheyâre losing key races because they get weak, weak nominees coming out of plurality primaries,â said Richie. âThat really hurt them in some places last year, and there are some top Republicans that totally get that.â\n\nNOTABLE\n\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\nDemocrats took back the state House of Representatives on Tuesday, sweeping three special elections on safely blue turf and terminating a brief, chaotic , and mostly-accidental GOP majority. Matt Gergely, Abigail Salisbury, and Joe McAndrew filled vacancies that were created by the death of one western Pennsylvania Democrat and the resignations of two others, whoâd won higher office in November. Gov. Josh Shapiro carried all three seats easily in November, but interestingly, each Democrat beat his margin on Tuesday. Gergley won his McKeesport seat by 49 points, 12 points more than Shapiro; Salisbury won 87.8% of the vote, up from Shapiroâs 85.3%; McAndrew won 74.9% of the vote, up from Shapiroâs 70.6%.\n\nThe 77 Committee, âBrandon Johnson â Worse.â Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfootâs campaign has attacked Jesus âChuyâ Garcia in its TV ads but ignored the raceâs other leading progressive, Brandon Johnson. Enter this pro-Lightfoot group, which says what sheâs been saying in debates and interviews: Johnson would âdefund the policeâ and send more employers packing with tax increases.\n\nFriends of Sophia King, âPhone.â King, a Chicago alderwoman who represents neighborhoods just south of the Loop, has lagged Lightfoot and her top competitors in fundraising and polls. Her first ad suggests her as an alternative whoâd âreject false choicesâ and help Chicago have it all. Itâs light on specifics, but heavy on optimism. âWe can uplift our police and hold them accountable,â she says, which is how every leading candidate describes their plan for law enforcement.\n\nKelly Craft for Governor, âA Spot Missing.â A sad piano melody plays as people sit down for dinner, contemplating empty chairs and lives âstolenâ by drug addiction. âAs a mother, this is personal to me, because Iâve experienced that empty chair at my table,â says Craft, Donald Trumpâs second U.N. ambassador who is now running for Kentucky governor. Who was she talking about? Her daughter, who is not dead, but who Craft says had struggled with drug addiction. The ad confused some people, who assumed the âempty chairâ was a reference to death â an implication that Craftâs campaign called âinsensitive and malicious.â\n\nTrumpâs Republican critics, whoâve been wrong before, insist he can only command about a third of the GOP vote. Thatâs exactly what Trump and DeSantis get â 33% â if Monmouth asks Republican voters to pick from a full list of possible candidates. The wealthier and better educated that GOP voters are, the more they prefer DeSantis, who leads Trump by 34 points among college graduates but just 5 points among voters without college degrees.\n\nDemocrats, the Club for Growth, and Americans for Prosperity agree: Donald Trump starts any general election with more vulnerabilities than other Republican nominees. DeSantis leads the president outside the margin of era in one of the states Biden won most narrowly in 2020; Trump is effectively tied, thanks to voters who are undecided if DeSantis runs but against Trump if heâs the GOP nominee.\n\nLightfootâs own polling, released this week, put the mayorâs support at 24% and ex-schools chief Paul Vallas at 20%. Both were in position to make the April runoff as Garcia, who Lightfoot had run two corruption-focused ads against, tumbled out of contention. Garciaâs stronger in this poll, but heâs lost support as voters started to view him more negatively. The risk of a progressive shut-out â a runoff between Vallas and Lightfoot, with the mayor attacking him as a thinly-disguised Republican â may be increasing as the early vote gets cast.\n\nRon DeSantis faced a direct attack from Donald Trump this week, and a subtler one from Joe Biden. The first petered out quickly; the second is central to the Democratsâ 2024 strategy.\n\nTrump made his move on Truth Social, posting two links on Tuesday to a progressive websiteâs 2021 (highly unverified) photos and story about DeSantis, as a young high school teacher, allegedly partying with students. âThatâs not Ron, is it?â asked Trump.\n\nAsked about the post on Wednesday DeSantis didnât even use Trumpâs name. âI spend my time delivering results for the people of Florida and fighting against Joe Biden,â he told reporters in Ocala. âI donât spend my time trying to smear other Republicans.â\n\nBiden headed to Tampa on Thursday and mentioned DeSantis just once, saying that âover 1.1 million people in Florida would be eligible for Medicaidâ if the governor agreed to expand it under the Affordable Care Act. The speech was largely about defending Medicare and Social Security, keeping up the White House focus on Sen. Rick Scott and his idea of requiring new votes every five years to keep funding government programs.\n\nBut it was about DeSantis, too. Democrats, who are taking the governor more and more seriously as a 2024 rival, see the votes he cast for conservative budgets in the House â which would have voucherized Medicare and raised the retirement age on Social Security â as his most obvious vulnerabilities. Trumpâs rivals, a campaign spokesman told Semaforâs Shelby Talcott, âwill have to answer to past positions theyâve taken.â\n\nLast month, Indiana Rep. Jim Banks founded the Anti-Woke Caucus, calling for âa recorded vote on an amendment to defund wokenessâ on any bill that spends money on âleftist activities.â Days later, he launched a campaign for U.S. Senate, lining up conservative endorsements for a potential race against former Gov. Mitch Daniels, who later opted not to run. Banks, for now, has the Senate race to himself, giving him more time to build the caucus and fight to strip out âdiversity, equity, and inclusionâ from federal agencies.\n\nâWhy does every federal government agency have a taxpayer funded chief diversity officer?â Banks said in an interview with Semafor. âThis does feel like a game of Whack a Mole, but the more members of Congress I have to whack at the moles, the more effective weâre going to be in the committees.â\n\nAmericana: When did you decide that âwokenessâ was a problem for America?\n\nJim Banks: There was a slow burn of wokeness leading up to Jan. 20, 2021, and then it was everywhere. Joe Biden becomes president and signs an executive order for all government agencies to create an equity plan. The first directive from [Defense Sec.] Lloyd Austin is to tackle extremism in the military. Iâm on the Armed Services Committee, and I start hearing stories from people in uniform about what they were dealing with â they were just overwhelmed with getting woke training, versus military training.\n\nIt was demoralizing to people, especially if theyâd been in uniform for a long time, to recognize that they had become political pawns. College campuses have always been hotbeds of woke-ism, and that gets ramped up after Biden takes over, too.\n\nAmericana: Donald Trump had criticized it in 2020 and called for âpatriotic educationâ â so this was happening, but it wasnât really front of mind then?\n\nJim Banks: It was much more in our face. It was in every bill, whether it was the CHIPS bill creating a chief diversity officer at the National Science Foundation, or the infrastructure bill being filled with woke initiatives and DEI initiatives. A lot of Republicans were willing to go along with legislation on important issues, and maybe overlook that. But thereâs a growing number of us on the right who are recognizing that this is a cancer in the federal government and American culture. We need to identify it and uproot it.\n\nAmericana: Last week, Donald Trump proposed defining âmaleâ and âfemaleâ in biological terms if he won the presidency, and removing gender identity from government language. Do you support that?\n\nJim Banks: I believe that, after the 2024 election, weâll have a Republican president and majorities in the House and the Senate, and President Trumpâs political message over the last 10 days has been spot on. He was strong on these issues as president. As a candidate, he shows that he understands his issues better than anybody else. Heâs really providing a roadmap for the Anti-Woke Caucus, showing Republicans where we should go from here.\n\nAmericana: How did this play out last year? Ron DeSantis won, but in Michigan, Republicans ran on getting back to traditional gender roles, and they lost.\n\nJim Banks: A lot of dynamics were playing out in Michigan. In my state, my governor vetoed a bill that prevented boys from playing and girls sports, his veto was overridden by the state legislature, and we made gains. I wish my governor had half the backbone on these issues that Gov. DeSantis does, because you lean in against the political opposition, and take the hits, you come out of it stronger than ever.\n\nAmericana: What federal limits would you want to place on abortion? What should be the law whether youâre in California or Indiana?\n\nJim Banks: I hope that we, at the federal level, pass laws like the heartbeat bill or the pain capable bill. Right now, I donât have a lot of hope that the born alive bill will go anywhere in the Senate or be signed with President Biden, but itâs a good place to start â that, or banning abortions based on sex selection or abnormalities.\n\nAmericana: What role do you see for the federal government in encouraging family formation? Democrats have answers, like the child tax credit; there are libertarians who want to just roll the clock back to 1912, and see what happens.\n\nJim Banks: When we made corporate tax cuts permanent, but sunset the tax cuts for families, that was a backwards approach that I think was misguided for the Republican Party. I think it was the wrong message. I voted for it, and it was good for the economy, especially when we ended up facing a pandemic. But if we couldnât do both, we should have prioritized families.\n\nAmericana: What do you think of Rick Scottâs idea of sunsetting federal spending, getting to some kind of zero-based budgeting by having to vote on every program every five years?\n\nJim Banks: It seems like a lazy approach to talk about sunsets or across-the-board cuts. I think you can fix Americaâs fiscal health without affecting Social Security or Medicare benefits for anyone who relies on it today or tomorrow, while making reforms for future generations. Thatâs the right approach for America.\n\nIf youâre enjoying Semafor Americana and finding it useful, please share with your family, friends and colleagues.\n\nTo assure this email doesnât go to your junk folder, add david.weigel@semafor.com to your contacts.

Read it now .\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has claimed he has âno choiceâ but to back electric vehicles, because âElon [Musk] endorsed me very strongly.â Trump made the remarks at a rally over the weekend before returning to his usual criticism of the industry.\n\nThe richest man in the world and the person behind some of the USâ most influential companies, Musk endorsed Trump for president after he survived an assassination attempt in July.\n\nMusk is one of several high-profile tech leaders to endorse Trump this time around, but the apparent shift in the sectorâs loyalties shouldnât be overstated â Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans in Silicon Valley, and venture capitalists spend about twice as much on Democrat causes than they do Republican ones, Vox reported. Itâs a mistake to conflate the âmost vocal people on Twitterâ with the feelings of the industry overall, a tech and politics expert told the BBC. However, there is a cadre of people in the industry that favor small government âÂ and they may be betting a second Trump administration will be more hands-off on crypto and artificial intelligence , an advisor at the Foundation for American Innovation said.\n\nEV sales in the US â show a partisan trend ,â The Washington Post noted: 69% of Republicans surveyed by Gallup in March said they would not consider buying one, versus just 27% of Democrats. But the politicization of EVs may be becoming increasingly complex : The core Tesla customer base âÂ liberal leaning and well-to-do â have felt increasingly alienated by Musk, and particularly following his endorsement of Trump. Meanwhile, potential customers in red-leaning states are still hostile to EVs, Semaforâs Reed Albergotti noted. Itâs possibleTrump could try promoting a âworking class EVâ as a cheaper alternative to other forms of transportation, but Trump is avowedly against â everybody â owning one, so any proposals in that vein may be shallow.\n\nMuskâs endorsement is â unprecedented ,â but perhaps not unexpected given his embrace of other right-wing leaders, The Guardianâs tech reporter noted. Previously no fan of the former president, Musk has also undergone a kind of â midlife reinvention â from an idealistic Democrat in 2016 to a staunchly anti-progressive figure now, The New York Times noted. A former Trump administration official and GOP fundraiser who knows Musk told the Times that â[Musk] has had to walk the same road as Trump â silenced, targeted, canceledâ¦ and heâs decided itâs time to take action.â It is also possible Musk will be able to influence a second Trump administrationâs policies in a way he could not with the Biden administration, much to his public frustration , an expert told Axios.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

      "text": "Principals\n\nPDB: How the Biden administration botched its overhaul of college financial aid forms\n\nHarris visits Minnesota Planned Parenthood clinic â¦ Biden campaigns in Michigan â¦ FT : Secret Iran talks\n\nâ edited by Benjy Sarlin, Jordan Weissmann and Morgan Chalfant\n\nIt sailed through the House on Wednesday. But can Congressâ controversial new TikTok bill survive the Senate? At least one influential Democratic hopes so. âWe got to get something done,â Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who chairs the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, told Semaforâs Joseph Zeballos-Roig . âWeâre going into a 24-hour election cycle, where literally millions of Americans get a lot of their news from this site. And if that can be manipulated against American interests â I donât care whether youâre Democrat or Republican, that is not in Americaâs interest.â\n\nBut the legislation is facing a foggy future in the upper chamber. The bill would force TikTokâs Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app or face a U.S. ban. But despite a 352-65 House vote and a thumbs up from the White House, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer remained noncommittal about bringing it to the floor in a statement Wednesday. Another key Democrat, Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., sounded skeptical, saying she wanted âto find a path forward that is constitutional and protects civil liberties.â Sending the legislation to her committee, one of Schumerâs options, âis a euphemism for killing it,â Punchbowl notes . Warner, whose last effort to rein in TikTok fizzled in the face of both progressive and conservative grassroots opposition, didnât rule out amending the House bill, which he endorsed alongside his Intelligence Committee GOP counterpart, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\n\nThe flood of migrants at the southern border is a central political problem for President Biden. But it may also be powering his economy . A recent report from Brookings concludes that the big pool of new workers, including asylum-seekers, may be the reason businesses have been able to keep adding jobs at an unexpectedly fast pace over the past year without putting as much pressure on wages or inflation. The impact is large, too: The report suggests that payrolls can sustainably grow by 160,000 to 200,000 jobs a month, currently, up from an estimate of 60,000 to 100,000 without the immigration bump. The authors borrow estimates of recent migrant arrivals from the Congressional Budget Office, which recently concluded that the immigrant influx would add $7 trillion to the economy over a decade.\n\nâ Jordan Weissmann\n\nThe theme of Wednesdayâs House GOP retreat in West Virginia was âgrowing the majority.â But as Speaker Mike Johnson sat for an on-stage interview, he found himself talking instead about members who keep leaving for the door. âI hope and believe that thatâs the end of the exits,â he said after being asked about Rep. Ken Buckâs, R-Colo. early retirement announcement this week. The poorly attended event â fewer than half the GOP members even showed up â seemed to be haunted by the partyâs notorious morale issues. Semaforâs Kadia Goba asked the conferenceâs new vice chair, Rep. Blake Moore, R-Utah, if there was a strategy to improve the partyâs mood. âYou have to highlight the momentum that you have and build on it,â said Moore, who inherited Johnsonâs old job. âItâs being positive and optimistic.â He said Republicans should be proud of how theyâve âclenched down on all of [the] massive new spending proposals.â Moore also said heâs trying to bring a little more âUtah-esqueâ fun to the grind of Congress by dolling out gold, silver, or bronze medals to reward members with the most floor time.\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. will not leave Congress to run in a special election to replace fellow Republican Ken Buck. Buckâs surprise decision to leave next week put Boebert in a complicated bind â which in-state politicos speculated may have been the anti-MAGA Republicanâs intention . She was already abandoning her district to run in Buckâs redder one, but would have had to step down to participate in the special election. That contest is scheduled the same day as the primary for the general election, meaning voters might have been confused by her presence on only one of the ballots, damaging her chances. In a statement, Boebert condemned Buckâs decision to leave, as well as the byzantine election process left in his wake, but decided to stay put. âI will not further imperil the already very slim House Republican majority by resigning my current seat,â she said.\n\nCurrent and prospective students say theyâre less likely to attend schools in states where there are loose gun policies and strict abortion bans, according to new surveys from Gallup and the Lumina Foundation. Of those surveyed, 84% said theyâre more likely to enroll in schools with bans or tough restrictions on guns on campus, including 71% of Republican respondents. Meanwhile, 71% said state reproductive healthcare policy impacts their college choice â and 86% of Democrats and 63% of Republicans said they prefer states that offer more access. While college enrollment has dropped in recent years, itâs still not clear gun and abortion policies are driving many real-world student decisions. âWe havenât seen it in the data yet,â Courtney Brown, VP of impact and planning at the Lumina Foundation, told Semafor, noting that students were often drawn to the most affordable in-state options.\n\nEuropean pledges to support Ukraine were undermined by reports that a major announcement of military aid was largely repackaged funds.

Mike Waltz, Donald Trumpâs pick for national security adviser, has called for ending the war in Ukraine and voted against Ukraine aid in Congress, as has Rep. Elise Stefanik, Trumpâs choice for United Nations ambassador.\n\nSo too has Sen. Marco Rubio, who Trump is expected to name as secretary of state (although some Republicans have cautioned that nothing is set in stone until Trump makes an official announcement ).\n\nEven so, these choices have not sparked too much alarm in Kyiv or among its supporters , many of whom had feared Trump would appoint people to top posts far more skeptical of Ukraine.\n\nWaltz, who will be tasked with coordinating US foreign policy, has criticized the Biden administrationâs â blank check â approach to Ukraine, and called on European countries to carry more of the burden. Waltz has also defended the president-electâs Russia record, arguing that Trump was much tougher toward Moscow than his critics in Washington would suggest . In an interview with NPR, Waltz said the US should ramp up the pressure on Moscow to force them to the negotiating table, and has proposed strengthening energy sanctions and â taking the handcuffs off â Ukraine and letting them use American weapons to strike deeper into Russia. Rubio, meanwhile, has struck a pragmatic tone, saying that he is ânot on Russiaâs side,â but that the ârealityâ of the warâs progress means it will end in âa negotiated settlement.â\n\nSome Ukrainians hope the president-elect will prove more decisive than Joe Biden, whom many blame for delays in military aid and for limiting how Ukraine uses the weapons it receives. Kyiv was prepared for a Republican victory, crafting parts of Zelenskyyâs victory plan with Trump in mind , the Financial Times reported, and Ukraine has made various promises to beef up Europeâs defenses after the war is over in an appeal to Trump. Some experts believe it is âunlikelyâ Trump would want to be seen as weak by accepting a peace deal that overly debilitates Ukraine. âThe last thing that Trump is going to want there would be a chaotic collapse , a la Afghanistan 2.0,â a former US official told Vox.\n\nMarco Rubio, who is widely tipped to be Trumpâs top diplomat, has transformed his views on Ukraine in recent years. During his unsuccessful presidential bid in 2016, Rubio called Russiaâs illegal annexation of Crimea â a historic affront to the post-World War II global order ,â and promised tougher sanctions and more military aid to Ukraine. Since then, the Florida senator has staked out a position closer to Trump, criticizing the US for funding a stalemate in Ukraine . âRubio is a flexible and pragmatic politician who has accommodated himself to the rise of President Trump,â one expert told Al Jazeera. However, Rubio has been criticized for being too hawkish on foreign policy, and not fully embracing the âAmerica Firstâ restraint many other Trump supporters espouse.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

Read it now .\n\nA rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump looks increasingly inevitable this November, and the Chinese government is nervously anticipating the prospect of a U.S. presidential election with few possible upsides.\n\nBeijing has said it has no preference between the two likely candidates. While Trump is â unpredictable and aggressive ,â he âlikes to strike dealsâ and could end up undercutting alliances the Biden administration has painstakingly built up, Chinese officials told Bloomberg.\n\nâFor China, no matter who won the U.S. presidential election, they would be two â bowls of poison ,ââ Zhao Minghao, a professor of international relations at Fudan University, told the Associated Press.\n\nA second Biden term would likely see more opportunities for engagement between the two superpowers, Wang Hao, a professor at Fudan University wrote in the Sinification newsletter. But while a Biden reelection could prevent further deterioration in U.S.-China relations , a genuine turnaround would be unlikely, two analysts at the Intellisia Institute, a Chinese think tank, wrote in The Diplomat.\n\nMeanwhile, some Chinese analysts worry that a second Biden term would see the U.S. continue to strengthen its alliances in the Indo-Pacific. This has been a key focus for the Biden administration, which has made its partnerships in Asia â the deepest and most robust they have been in all their history ,â Derek Grossman wrote in Foreign Policy. The U.S.â2 network of alliances have allowed American forces to establish military bases or use existing ones in Japan, Singapore, Australia, and the Philippines, as well as a host of smaller island states, boosting U.S. efforts to overcome the â tyranny of distance â that would complicate U.S. military efforts in the region, the Financial Times reported.\n\nSome analysts think that a second Trump term would endanger the U.S. network of alliances, as Trumpâs desire to impose tariffs and his uncertain stance on NATO risks a rift with European states in particular. â Cementing distrust between the United States and Europe is the best way to prevent the emergence of trans-Atlantic policies detrimental to Chinese interests, such as joint export controls,â Agathe Demarais of the European Council on Foreign Relations wrote in Foreign Policy.\n\nBut that doesnât mean Trump would be better for Chinese interests on the world stage. His general unpredictability and his proposal to institute a 60% tariff on Chinese goods has won him few friends in Beijing. âWith Trump, there is no floor to U.S.-China relations , and Trump poses great risks and uncertainties, including the possibility of a military conflict,â Yun Sun, senior fellow at the Stimson Center, said to the Associated Press.\n\nLast July, Trump was asked whether he would protect Taiwan if the Chinese Communist Party attacked the self-governing island, which it considers a renegade province. âIf I answer that question, itâll put me in a very bad negotiating position ,â Trump replied. âThat being said, Taiwan did take all of our chip business.â\n\nThe comments raised questions about whether Trump would assist Taiwan if China were to invade. âThe U.S. will always pursue America first, and Taiwan can change from a chess piece to a discarded chess piece at any time,â a Chinese spokesperson said when asked about the comments late last month. Trumpâs indifference toward Taiwan was â one of the worst kept secrets in Washington ,â during his presidency, Evan Medeiros, former National Security Council senior dictator for Asia, told Nikkei Asia.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

Read it now .\n\nDonald Trump appointed Susie Wiles, one of his campaign co-managers, as his chief of staff âÂ the first-ever woman to serve the White House position â amid fevered speculation in Washington over his cabinet picks.\n\nTrumpâs transition team is already reviewing names for key posts , the BBC reported, and many who worked with the president-elect the first time round arenât expected to return.\n\nThe news has so far been dominated by those wonât serve: Sen. Tom Cotton, a hawkish conservative seen as a potential defense secretary, has told Trumpâs team he does not want an administration post , Axios reported, while Trumpâs son-in-law Jared Kushner may advise on Middle East policy but will not join the administration, according to the Financial Times. Chris LaCivita, another campaign manager who worked alongside Wiles, told CBS News he also wonât take a role, and will be â a defender of the team from outside .â\n\nThe choice of Susie Wiles indicates Trumpâs second term could be â more drama-free â than his first, Semaforâs Shelby Talcott noted. âSheâs seen as less ideologically driven than some of Trumpâs other confidants, which suggests sheâll be less inclined to steer Trump towards a preferred agenda,â Talcott wrote. Wilesâ hire was approved by Trumpworld, given her experience in managing his unpredictability and for her âwillingness to stay in the background,â CNN wrote. But sheâs still an â outsider â who has never had a government post, Politico argued, and could be challenged by âone of the most demanding and complex governing staff jobs anywhere.â\n\nThe next secretary of state will be critical in shaping the USâ relationship with Europe and NATO, as well as in determining whether Trump will follow through with his desire to pull the plug on military support for Ukraine, Politico wrote. Some of the most likely contenders, former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell and Sen. Bill Hagerty, are against more aid for Kyiv. Former National Security Adviser Robert OâBrien, who was seen as a more moderate pick that Europe would have likely welcomed, said he will not join the administration . Another contender, Sen. Marco Rubio, may be seen as âtoo weakâ for the position, despite some of his tougher foreign policy views, Politico reported.\n\nPreliminary lists of potential Trump cabinet and staff showed â mainly white, male, populist and loyal â candidates, Axios reported in July. Trump felt âburnedâ by disloyal cabinet members in his first administration, some of whom later turned into his vocal critics: âThis time, he wants people he can trust both to implement his policies and never block his will,â Axios wrote. To that end, Trump is expected to â place a premium â on selecting businesspeople and political outsiders over sitting lawmakers, NBC News reported: Insiders said Trump saw his first-term outsider picks as more loyal than Congressional members, and heâs wary that picking too many sitting lawmakers for his cabinet would hurt his âability to get things done in his first 100 days in office.â\n\nSign up for Semafor principals\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nDonald Trumpâs choice of Rep. Matt Gaetz as his attorney general nominee blindsided Republican senators on Wednesday, raising serious questions about whether the pugnacious congressman can be confirmed.\n\nTrumpâs selection of Gaetz, whoâs the subject of an ongoing House ethics committee investigation stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct and drug use, literally raised the eyebrows of stunned senators as they heard the news. But it wasnât the only unconventional nomination Trump rolled out in recent hours: The president-elect also tapped Fox News host and veteran Pete Hegseth to be his defense secretary and Tulsi Gabbard to be his national intelligence director.\n\nThe trio of choices, all of whom face notable confirmation challenges, point to a tough road ahead as Republican senators try to coordinate with Trump.\n\nSeveral GOP senators are already acknowledging their concerns with Gaetz, who orchestrated the ouster of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last year and was investigated for sex trafficking by the same Justice Department he now hopes to lead.\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said Gaetzâs plot to oust McCarthy âis concerning to meâ and noted that âFBI and background checks are pretty intense for an attorney general.â\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said that âIâm all about counting votes, and I would think heâs probably got his work cut out for him.â\n\nRepublicans had generally praised Trumpâs picks earlier this week, including Sen. Marco Rubio for the Secretary of State position and Rep. Elise Stefanik to be the ambassador to the United Nations. But Republicans were notably less effusive when asked about Hegseth, Gaetz and Gabbard; several appeared to be unaware that those nominations had been announced.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe Florida congressmanâs path will be initially determined by likely Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who did not give any thoughts on Gaetz specifically, nor did he say whether he knew the pick was coming. Several of Gaetzâs House GOP colleagues aired similar sentiments to Republican senators â and some were far more bluntly critical of Trumpâs pick. âRep. Matt Gaetz is under ethics investigations by the House Ethics Committee. He would be a compromised AG,â said Rep. John Duarte, R-Calif. âThere are better choices.â A person familiar with Trumpâs thinking said that the nomination of Gabbard, a former Democrat who campaigned with the president-elect, has been in the works for a while. Intelligence directors typically get large bipartisan Senate votes; Gabbard, who has taken a warm approach in the past toward Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, is very unlikely to achieve that.\n\nâOf course they can be confirmed, otherwise they wouldnât have been chosen,â the person familiar with Trumpâs thinking said of Gabbard and Gaetz. âWeâre always in touch with multiple elected officials.â\n\nAny nominee will need a simple majority to be confirmed, in committee and on the Senate floor. On partisan votes like Gaetzâs expected roll call, that will mean Republicans can lose three votes with a 53-seat majority.\n\nâThe presidentâs going to make bold decisions and appointments, and Iâm looking forward to the hearings,â said Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, who will take over as the GOP whip in January.\n\nRepublicans are unlikely to block too many of Trumpâs more controversial picks; doing so would invite a huge intraparty conflict right at the start of his administration.\n\nBut itâs also hard to see a world where he gets all of them through. Presidents usually lose at least one of their top nominees.\n\nAnd Trump still hasnât said where Robert F. Kennedy Jr. might land.\n\nShelby Talcott and Kadia Goba contributed.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nChinese state and social media have been closely following U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellenâs high-profile visit to Beijing, though much of the attention is on her culinary choices rather than economic discussions with her Chinese counterparts.\n\nYellenâs visit to a popular Beijing brewery, along with U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Burns, got a lot of media attention, with online users discussing the news using the hashtag #YellenDrankAFlyingFistIPAInSanlitun, referring to her choice of beer and the trendy neighborhood where the brewery is located.\n\nYellenâs warm reception in China signals that Beijing is ready to embrace stronger U.S. economic ties, experts said, as the countryâs post-COVID economy struggles with deflation and low consumption.\n\nYellen and Burnsâ choice of brewery and beers was significant: The Jing-A brewery, which is apparently popular with the expat community, including journalists, was co-founded by an American, and Yellenâs order of the Flying First IPA and Burnsâ Golden Pierson lager are both made with American hops , The New York Times reporter Alan Rappeport noted. âI can taste the American hops!â Burns told the bartender. While China remains the U.S.âs largest trade partner for agricultural goods, U.S. exports have decreased as China eyes other suppliers that offer cheaper products , Reuters reported. Brazil saw a 29% increase in its soy and corn shipments between 2022 and 2023, compared to an 18% decrease in the U.S.âs.\n\nYellenâs food choices in China have gotten a lot of attention since she admitted to feasting on psychedelic mushrooms last year . Her meals at Cantonese and Sichuanese restaurants during this visit have become hot topics on Chinese social media, with many praising her chopstick skills. Chinese media frequently used to focus on such details about foreign dignitariesâ visits â as a way for the general public to learn about the world ,â but the coverage âcooled offâ as China became more skeptical of American diplomatic missions, according to DeDeDe in the City, a WeChat social news blog. The renewed attention to Yellenâs dining choices suggests Beijing sees her âas perhaps its best hope for improving trade ties with Washington and helping its own ailing economy,â The Washington Post wrote.\n\nNot everyone in China warmed to Yellenâs culinary choices and chopstick prowess. Chinese state tabloid The Global Times argued that Yellenâs attempts to â project a friendly image â were not enough to stabilize relations, given her criticisms of Chinese overcapacity in green technology, particularly in electric vehicles and solar panels. The nationalist outlet framed her accusations as yet another instance of Washington targeting Chinese industries that are succeeding globally. âThe Chinese people welcome anyone from anywhere to come and enjoy our food, but that does not mean we wonât push back against groundless accusations and outright crackdowns,â The Global Times wrote.\n\nSign up for Semafor business\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

      "text": "MAGA vs. establishment: A rivalry emerges as Trump weighs FBI pick\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nRepublicans are waging their own internal fight over the next FBI director, a clash that pits a Donald Trump loyalist against a former congressional intelligence chairman whoâs well liked on Capitol Hill.\n\nAt the moment, the two leading choices to lead the FBI in Trumpâs second term are Kash Patel â a former Trump administration official whoâs talked openly about revenge on the president-electâs enemies â and former Rep. Mike Rogers, who just narrowly lost a Senate bid with Trumpâs endorsement. Their rivalry is a microcosm of the tension simmering within the GOP as Trump prepares to take office, between his loyalists and the partyâs more establishment-minded players.\n\nSome of Trumpâs cabinet picks are popular among party leaders, like Sen. Marco Rubioâs elevation as secretary of state, while others â like former Rep. Matt Gaetzâs nod to be attorney general â are rankling Republican senators who will have to vote on Trumpâs selections. In the case of the FBI, many Republicans are touting Rogers while saying they are unfamiliar with Patel.\n\nRogers âwould be outstanding,â Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., who campaigned with the Michigander and said she didnât know âanythingâ about Patel, told Semafor.\n\nPicking the former House intelligence committee chief âwould be bold,â Britt added, saying Rogers âwould get the FBI back on track, and I think he has the background and experience to really lead.â\n\nThe FBI director is a particularly sensitive position for Trump, who fired former Director James Comey and is expected to quickly try to replace Wray, Comeyâs successor, whose term does not expire until 2027. Trumpâs frustration with Wray and the bureau for perceived politicization of its investigations has not abated following the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in 2022, and the next FBI directorâs job will be extremely challenging given how closely Trump monitors the agency.\n\nRecognizing that reality, some senators were careful to boost Rogers while emphasizing that Wray remains on the job. Rogers met with the Trump transition team last week.\n\nâMike Rogers is a terrific guy. I donât know Kash Patel. But, is Christopher Wray going to resign? Thatâs a 10-year term, so it may be a little premature,â said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, whom Trump once considered to lead the bureau. (Cornyn made clear that âno,â heâs not interested this time around either.)\n\nThe MAGA wing of the party, like longtime Trump ally Roger Stone and his own son Donald Jr., are pushing for Patel. On the other side of the debate are more conventional Republicans, who are pushing for Rogers, two people close to the transition team said.\n\nâIf they arenât bloody, if they donât have scars from one of the get Trump âscandals,â then theyâre for Rogers,â said one of the people close to the transition. The second of the two said Patel has support from conservative media and people from the last Trump administration âwho fear being totally shut out.â\n\nIronically, Patel endorsed Rogersâ Senate campaign this year, describing him as someone âwho will hold the FBI and DOJ accountable.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe level of Senate support for Rogers might not matter in the end. People inside Trumpâs network have insisted that his picks will get confirmed regardless, arguing that his decisive electoral win has shown lawmakers that voters support his choices.\n\nAnd Patel has his own backers in the Senate. Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) said that heâd support the former Trump adviser, whose positions during the first term included chief of staff to the acting defense secretary.\n\nâHeâd be great. Smart, knows a lot about law enforcement. Heâs loyal to the president. And those are pretty much the top requirements,â said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who said Rogers âmight be goodâ too but that he wasnât as familiar with the former lawmaker.\n\nGiven the tough road facing picks like Gaetz and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Health and Human Services chief, however, itâs clear that Rogers would be an easier pick for Trump to get through the Senate.\n\nRogers completed a political 180-degree turn from his past criticism of Trump over the past year-plus, winning Trumpâs backing in this yearâs Senate primary and then nearly claiming the open seat won by Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich. As a former intelligence chair and FBI agent, Rogersâ credentials are obvious to his backers.\n\nâI am a big fan of Mike Rogers, and should there be an opening, he would be my choice,â said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.\n\nRepublicans donât need Democratic votes next year to confirm Trumpâs picks, but it doesnât hurt to have an FBI director with bipartisan buy-in â which Rogers might well win. The Senate might be able to confirm Rogers more quickly than Patel if Democrats eased his path to nomination.\n\nâI served with him and I think heâs a straight shooter. What I saw with Kash Patel is, he was on the 24/7 Trump messaging teamâ for an FBI director, said Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., a former House member who noted the value of âimpartialityâ in the role.\n\nThe FBI director position offers a clear decision tree for Trump. Down one path is a disruptive pick in Patel, who could cause a tough confirmation fight over installing an ally in a position of great interest to him. Down another path is a more traditional pick in Rogers who has bipartisan appeal in the Capitol and could be confirmed more easily.\n\nAnd Trump could go either way; look at his nominations of the stylistically opposed Rubio and Gaetz for equally important positions. If anything is clear about his tapestry of administration picks, though, itâs that he doesnât mind taking a harder road to get an outcome that he wants â in this case, an FBI director who is 100 percent in line with him.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

It Matters How Options Are Framed\n\nY ou might not know it, but when you gave your partner some choices for dinner after work this evening, you were a choice architect. You almost automatically thought about how may options to present, you presented them in a certain order, and you might have described them as heavy or light, meaty or vegetarian, or scrumptious or healthy. You might not have known this, but your presentation probably influenced their response.\n\nYou are not alone: every store, app, financial advisor, doctor, and parent practices choice architecture, and even though we all do it without a license, it matters. It affects everything from what kind of eggs we buy to where we choose to live. In fact, it touches on just about every decision we make.\n\nChoice architecture refers to the many aspects of how a choice is posed that can be manipulated, intentionally or inadvertently, to influence the decisions we make. The options may be the same, but the presentation can change your choice. Before you make a decision, someone has molded many of the characteristics of that choice for you, and these design decisions will in some way affect what you choose.\n\nMany people, when first introduced to the concept, are uncomfortable with or even afraid of it. They are afraid their choices might be influenced by something outside their control, without their awareness, and that they might be exploited. As designers, they worry about influencing others, unintentionally or in harmful ways.\n\nChoice architecture can seem threatening: it gives the designer some control over what we choose. By setting a default, the car dealership is affecting what trim package you choose for your new vehicle; by sorting wine on their site, the online wine merchant may be making cheap, low‐quality wine seem more attractive.\n\nIf people are unaware of the influence of choice architecture, maybe we can just tell them that they are going to be influenced. Warnings accompany all sorts of products, from vacuum cleaners to cigarettes, so why not choice architecture?\n\nUnfortunately, disclosing the presence and intent of choice architecture does not seem to work. Several studies have told people about what defaults do, in various ways, including saying that their goal is to change behavior. All that warning appears to do is to make the nudge seem more acceptable.\n\nThis is why neglecting choice architecture as a designer can lead to harm. Designers don't always know the power of the tools that are at their disposal. They might be harming choosers unintentionally, making haphazard selections of tools.\n\nConsider end‐of‐life decisions. When people are gravely ill, they can choose interventions that could extend their lives, but these therapies are intrusive and unpleasant, and the time added to your life often comes with the price of being put on a ventilator or having a feeding tube inserted. Grouped together, these treatments are called life-extension care. The alternative is called comfort care . The latter involves declining many invasive interventions and focusing on managing pain and ensuring comfort.\n\nIn a remarkable study by Scott Halpern and colleagues, patients with terminal illnesses made choices about end‐of‐life care that actually determined their treatment. The advance directive given to them by the researchers first asked what their goal for care was: life extension or comfort care. For a third of the patients, the directive had a comfort‐care default, indicated by a pre-checked box. A second group had no preselection, and the third group had the life‐extension goal already checked. Comfort care was selected 77 percent of the time when it was the default, 66 percent of them time when no option was preselected, and only 43 percent of the time when life extension was the default. This means that the default affected specific interventions, like having a feeding tube. It is remarkable that the default had such a large effect on such an important decision. But what happened next is even more informative.\n\nBeing ethical scientists, the investigators later explained to all the patients (at least those that were still living) that they had been randomly assigned to those defaults, told them about the influence of default effects, and most important, offered the respondents the chance to change their minds. If patients had preferences, this was their chance to express them. Yet, of the 132 terminal respondents, only 2 changed their choices. Even when they were told what the defaults were, that the defaults had been determined randomly, and the way defaults influence choice, the effect of defaults persisted.\n\nThis is strong evidence that many people do not have preexisting preferences for end-of-life care. This is an incredibly difficult and unfamiliar decision. Most patients have not experienced intubation, the insertion of a feeding tube, or dialysis before, and these aren't decisions anyone enjoys thinking about in advance. When the time comes, the primary decision‐maker may not be conscious, and the family members who inherit the decisions are overwhelmed.\n\nMaking sure that people have a choice is laudable, but overwhelmed decision makers are even more likely to take the default. This is a problem: there is a disconnect between what people say they want when they are forced to make a choice and what happens when they are not forced. Comfort care was selected by the majority of patients in the Halpern‐led study when there was no default. But if you don't make a choice, that is not what happens in reality. Unless the patient or their immediate family says otherwise, the patient will be treated as if they had chosen life extension. The design of most of the commonly used advance directives seems to bias people toward life extension. For example, \"I want to have life support\" is the first option on one commonly used document.\n\nAssuming patient autonomy and ignoring the influence of choice architecture has a significant impact on suffering, cost, and dignity. Doctors may be loath to influence end‐of-life care choices, but then patients also don't want to make these decisions. This reluctance increases the importance of defaults.\n\nEnd‐of‐life choice illustrates when choice architecture might have its largest effects. Most choices are mundane and repetitive, but some choices are both important and rare. When people make them, they often lack clear ideas of what they want or how to proceed. Choosing a school, buying a house, selecting a pension plan, and settling on a type of end‐of life care are all examples of infrequent decisions with big consequences. Particularly if the decision‐maker has conflicting goals, choice architecture will play a larger role.\n\nNot all bad choice architecture results from ignorance or naïveté. Some designers experiment to see what works-for example, in direct mail campaigns or by conducting A/B tests on the internet. These designers could use this knowledge to advance their interests instead of those of the choosers. The result may be malevolent choice architecture.\n\nChoosers are very sensitive to initial costs, in terms of both money and effort. Badly intentioned designers can exploit that. We have all made the decision to start or stop a subscription service-say, a newspaper or a streaming service like Spotify or Hulu. This can be used to construct a subscription trap, where the designer has made it is easy to start and hard to stop. Newspapers are a mild example. It is very easy to start a subscription with a few clicks on most newspapers' websites for a low initial rate, like $1 a week for fifty-two weeks. But once you have started, it is more difficult to stop-say, when the early rate increases to almost $5 a week. To cancel, you must call an 800 number.\n\nDesigners can use costs to inhibit choices and maintain the status quo. Several years ago, I was interviewed by National Public Radio's Marketplace . The interviewer and I sat together as he tried to change his privacy settings. By default, Verizon could track his phone calls and potentially sell that information. A Verizon representative had said opting out of tracking was very easy. The reality was different: after a long robotic message that suggested that the interviewer could \"restrict or change options to his telecommunications service information,\" he was given a long menu of options. After pressing 1, indicating that he wanted to change his privacy options, he was asked whether he wanted to place a restriction on his account. This seemed scary, like he would be giving up something rather than just changing his privacy settings. He was then asked to type in his ten‐digit telephone number as it appears on his bill, followed by pound. The robotic voice read it back, very slowly, digit by digit, and then asked him to enter it again. It then asked for the first thirteen digits of the account number from his bill, then asked him to speak his first and last name, remembering to press pound each time, speak his address, then his town, state, and zip code, and finally his first and last name again to confirm that he is the decision‐maker. I suspect the phone company already knew his phone number. Not surprisingly, Verizon reported that the number of people opting out was in the single digits.\n\nOf course, many privacy agreements have exactly this structure: we are presented with long and complex terms of service that seem designed to restrict comprehension. It's estimated that over 90 percent of website users do not read terms‐of‐service documentation. This can lead to bad decisions. In one study , 98 percent of users agreed to a privacy policy that explicitly said it would share all information with the National Security Agency and their employer, and required them to provide their first‐born child as payment. Fortunately, this was an experiment, but bad choice architecture does lead to mistakes in understanding what we are giving up.\n\nPerhaps the most egregious example of malicious choice architecture involves electronic health records (EHRs). That is the computer system doctors use to keep track of patients and to prescribe drugs.\n\nSmaller practices and individual doctors don't have the resources to develop and tune EHRs of their own. Many adopted a free system, provided by a successful start‐up called Practice Fusion. Heralded as \"the Facebook of health\" by TechCrunch , the company provided the EHRs funded by selling advertising targeted to the physicians.\n\nBut that is not all. Practice Fusion also received payments from pharmaceutical companies in return for changes in their EHR's choice architecture. One particularly nefarious example was an agreement between Practice Fusion and a company known in court as \"Pharma X.\" In exchange for $1 million, in 2016 Practice Fusion added an alert that reminded physicians to ask patients about their pain and then provided options. The alert was presented to doctors 230 million times in a three‐year period, and Pharma X estimated that the alert would add three thousand customers and as much as $11 million in sales. This was happening at the same time that concern was rising about overprescribing of pain medicines, specifically extended‐release opioids. The problem is that the prompts ignored the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines for opiate prescriptions encouraging non-pharmaceutical and non-opioid treatments. If the doctor thought opioids were required, they were advised to avoid time‐release drugs, since they were more likely to lead to long‐term use, and to limit the number of pills to a small supply. But Practice Fusion's EHR system included an option for extended‐use opioids, even where the guidelines warned against them.\n\nPharma X was Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, which in 2021 settled a suit for misleading marketing of opioids with fines and payments estimated to be $4.5 billion. Meanwhile, Practice Fusion admitted to the payments it had received to change the EHR choice architecture, settling the charges brought by the state of Vermont for $145 million. Practice Fusion and Purdue were the designers of a choice architecture that caused harm to patients by providing inappropriate options to doctors.\n\nChoice architecture can have an enormous impact on people's welfare. It can make it harder or easier to control our personal information. It can increase savings for retirement and help students find better schools. It can increase or decrease prescriptions for potentially addictive drugs. Choice design can make a difference, and ignoring it is not an option.\n\nThis is particularly true when we look at who is most affected by choice architecture. It has a greater impact, positive or negative, on the people who are the most vulnerable: those with lower incomes, less education, and challenging social circumstances. Put another way, choice architecture could be a particularly potent tool for addressing income disparity and social justice. On the flip side, this means that malevolent choice architecture, like the examples we have just discussed, are particularly harmful to those who are the most disadvantaged.\n\nWhile a deeper understanding of how choice architecture works may tempt some to manipulate others for their own ends, I hope they will be very much in the minority. Overall, a more widespread understanding of how our design choices affect others should result in more intentional and constructive choice architectures from which we can all benefit.\n\nDesigning choice architecture is like picking a path on a map. Many paths are possible, but some are much better for the chooser. Defaults can be selected in choosers' best interests. Good alternatives can be made easy to see, and not obscured by many bad or irrelevant options. Benefit programs can be made easy to access instead of more difficult. And when we do know what we want, a good choice architecture can make it either easy to find or difficult. But how you use your newfound skill is, of course, up to you.\n\nAdapted from THE ELEMENTS OF CHOICE by Eric J.

      "text": "New York City Voters Just Adopted Ranked-Choice Voting in Elections. Here's How It Works\n\nN ew York City voted on Tuesday to change the way it determines election winners. With approval from more than 73% of voters, the Big Apple joins Maine and countries including Australia and New Zealand in adopting what's known as ranked-choice voting.\n\nThis popular electoral system allows voters to rank candidates by preference, meaning they can submit ballots that list not only their first-choice candidate for a position, but also their second, third and so on.\n\nRanked-choice voting advocates, including Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang , who has championed it as a key policy initiative , say it could help prevent evermore polarized election campaigns, increase the number of women and minority candidates running for office, and reduce negative campaigning. Critics say that the new system could make elections much more complicated for voters and be abused by parties trying to game the system.\n\nIn addition to Maine, which has adopted the system statewide, several states are experimenting with ranked-choice voting. Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, and Wyoming plan to use ranked-choice for voters in the 2020 Democratic primaries, and Nevada plans to use it for early voters in their 2020 Democratic caucuses, according to FairVote , a nonpartisan group that advocates for election reform.\n\n\"We are really settling on ranked-choice voting as the most promising reform to democratize and depolarize our politics,\" says Larry Diamond, the former director of Stanford's Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law. \"I think it's not only here to stay but that it's gaining support across the country.\"\n\nHere's what to know about ranked-choice voting.\n\nRanked-choice voting is an electoral system that allows people to vote for multiple candidates, in order of preference. Instead of just choosing who you want to win, you fill out the ballot saying who is your first choice, second choice, or third choice (or more as needed) for each position.\n\nThe candidate with the majority (more than 50%) of first-choice votes wins outright. If no candidate gets a majority of first-choice votes, then it triggers a new counting process. The candidate who did the worst is eliminated, and that candidate's voters' ballots are redistributed to their second-choice pick. In other words, if you ranked a losing candidate as your first choice, and the candidate is eliminated, then your vote still counts: it just moves to your second-choice candidate. That process continues until there is a candidate who has the majority of votes.\n\nIn comparison, the U.S. federal government and most American states and cities currently use what's known as the plurality system: the candidate with the highest number of votes wins-period. It doesn't matter whether that candidate earned the majority of the vote.\n\nIn a ranked-choice voting system, it works differently . The winning candidate almost always ends up with a majority of votes-even if some portion of the electorate selected him or her as a second or third choice.\n\nRanked-choice voting works in a variety of contexts. New York City will join Maine in using instant-runoff voting .\n\nIf ranked-choice voting was adopted nationwide, it would fundamentally change how U.S. elections work.\n\nTake the last presidential election , for example. In 2016, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton received less than 50% of the total vote in 12 states, with the remainder going to third-party candidates. Under the current system, in each of those states, the candidate with the most votes was declared victorious. If the U.S. had a ranked-choice voting system, voters would have been asked to choose a second choice, third choice or more. (If Green Party candidate Jill Stein was a voter's first choice, for instance, she would have been given the option of choosing a different candidate-Clinton, Trump, etc.-as her second choice.)\n\nRanked-choice voting advocates argue that the plurality system doesn't always reflect the true will of the people. It can lead to vote-splitting among candidates with similar positions, resulting in a candidate who is less popular overall being elected, experts say. That's called the \"Nader\" effect or the \"spoiler\" effect.\n\nThe most notorious example of this is the 2000 presidential election , when nearly 3 million mostly left-leaning voters cast their ballots for third-party candidate Ralph Nader . If ranked-choice voting had been in place at the time, Democrat Al Gore may have prevailed in the key state of Florida, where neither Gore nor Republican George W. Bush won a majority of the vote, says Don Saari, author of Decisions and Elections . (Florida was the center of a vote-counting scandal , and Bush's narrow win there ensured his ascension to the White House, despite losing the popular vote nationwide.) \"Gore was the second-place choice of many of Ralph Nader's supporters, particularly in the states of Florida and New Hampshire, where Bush narrowly won,\" says Saari. \"A goal of Nader's Green Party was to reach a certain percentage of the total vote, which is a reason why many Nader voters did not want to vote for their second-ranked Gore.\"\n\nBecause it helps eliminate vote-splitting, a ranked-choice voting system can have the effect of encouraging more third-party and centrist candidates, advocates say. Michael Bloomberg, a centrist, third-party candidate, considered running in the 2016 presidential election but decided not to upon concluding that he might split the Democratic vote with Clinton, increasing the chances of Trump's victory. (Trump, of course, still won the election, though he lost the popular vote to Clinton.) Again, the 2016 election offers a good hypothetical example. If a ranked-choice voting system had been in place in Michigan, then Clinton, not Trump, may have won that state. Because neither candidate received a majority of the Michigan vote, ranked-choice voting would have come into play. And if we can assume that most Stein voters would have chosen Clinton as their second choice, the former Secretary of State would have won, according to Saari. Trump won Michigan by 10,700; Stein received more than 51,000 votes.\n\nAccording to FairVote , Maine is the only U.S. state to currently use a ranked-choice voting system. But 18 U.S. cities, including Minneapolis and San Francisco, already use a ranked-choice system, too. The Academy Awards and many student government elections also use ranked-choice voting, and several states plan to use it in their upcoming Democratic primaries or caucuses.\n\nAmong the countries that have implemented ranked-choice systems nationwide are Australia, New Zealand, Malta and Ireland.\n\nAustralia first introduced ranked-choice voting more than a century ago, and the system has helped the country avoid vote-splitting by allowing voters to still vote for less-popular and similar candidates that they like. \"Voters liked it because it gave them more choice so they didn't need to worry about wasting their vote if they wanted to vote for one of the smaller parties,\" says Benjamin Reilly, an electoral system design expert at the University of Western Australia, pointing out how ranked-choice systems allow voters to avoid guilt by giving them the option to express support for third-party candidates as well as candidates from bigger parties.\n\nAdditionally, it has proved to be a sort of \"prophylactic against extremism,\" helping to strengthen the political center, Reilly says.\n\nAustralia's ranked-choice system suits voters well enough that there is almost no discussion of alternative electoral systems, according to Reilly. \"Both voters and politicians are very used to the idea of rankings and would probably see a system which did not allow that as lacking something and maybe even illegitimate,\" Reilly explains.\n\nThough ranked-choice voting is currently gaining traction in the United States, several U.S. states and cities used ranked-choice voting in elections from the 1910s to the 1950s.\n\nRanked-choice voting can lead to less negative campaigning, says Richard DeLeon, who researches ranked-choice voting at San Francisco State University. Less divisive political environments can also have the effect of helping female, minority, centrist candidates, and third-party candidates.\n\n\"A lot of research shows that when you, as a candidate, go negative, you hurt public perceptions of yourself, but you do more damage to your opponent, and in plurality elections, this tradeoff can pay off,\" says Diamond, the Stanford researcher. But since candidates are forced to rely on second and third-place votes in ranked-choice elections, negative campaigning can open the way for a third candidate to gain support. \"It becomes much more costly to go negative since you risk losing your ability to pick up second-preference votes, and it actually does more harm than good,\" Diamond adds.\n\nA 2018 study showed that this created a slight percentage increase in female candidates running. This may be because women can be \"deterred from running for office if they have to campaign negatively to win,\" explains Sarah John, an author of the study and former director of research at FairVote. \"Over time we expect candidates to learn how to run an effective ranked-choice voting election campaign, which will less often include 'going negative.\"\n\nThe study also showed that women overall and minority women are more likely to win in ranked-choice voting systems. This is, in part, because of an unconscious ticket \"balancing\" that many voters tend to practice. \"When voters are asked to vote for or rank a whole field of candidates under proportional or ranked systems, they often tend to include female or minority candidates in the mix for balance,\" explains John.\n\nAccording to experts, ranked-choice systems also tend to favor centrist candidates, since the system allows voters to express preference for one-sided, partisan candidates of their choice, as well as moderate candidates, who have broader appeal. Partisan candidates have a narrower appeal, so they are less likely to be the second and third-choice for voters than a centrist candidate would be. This can also motivate partisan candidates to avoid taking extremes as well as give third-party, centrist candidates more incentive to run.\n\nThough there was no organized effort against the ranked-choice measure in New York, Maine's Republican party has opposed ranked-choice voting. The Maine Heritage Policy Center, a leading conservative public policy nonprofit in Maine, released a recent study finding significant flaws with ranked-choice voting.\n\nMatthew Gagnon, CEO of the Maine Heritage Policy Center, explains how ranked-choice voting can complicate elections for voters. Ranked-choice ballots can require voters to read up on more candidates and require more time in the voting booth, which can lead to voters making mistakes during voting.\n\n\"Our belief is that Maine voters do not know how to maximize their influence in ranked-choice elections by ranking all the candidates, which is compounded when political parties tell voters to rank only one candidate,\" says Gagnon.\n\nThere is also fear that ranked-choice voting can be used by interested parties to game the system. Since candidates often win with the aid of lower-preference rankings, ranked-choice elections can incentivize parties to look for third-party candidates to insert into a race for their own benefit.\n\nLess negative campaigning can also be a bad thing, some argue. When less dirt gets dug up about candidates, candidates get a free pass with regards to their pasts.\n\nIn 2018, U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Maine's ranked-choice voting system, but the suit was eventually rejected by a federal judge. According to The Portland (Maine) Press Herald , U.S. District Court Judge Lance Walker wrote in his ruling that the plaintiffs are free to \"call into question the wisdom of using [ranked-choice voting],\" but that the \"criticism falls short of constitutional impropriety,\" ruling that the Constitution allows states their autonomy in choosing how to run elections. \"A majority of Maine voters have rejected that criticism and Article I does not empower this Court to second guess the considered judgment of the polity on the basis of the tautological observation that [ranked-choice voting] may suffer from problems, as all voting systems do,\" wrote Walker.\n\nCorrection, Nov. 8\n\nThe original version of this story mischaracterized some of the terms describing how ranked-choice voting is implemented. The text has been clarified.\n\nCorrection, Nov. 7\n\nThe original version of this story misstated the type of voting New York City will adopt. It will adopt instant-runoff voting.\n\nWrite to Anna Purna Kambhampaty at Anna.kambhampaty@time.com"

      "text": "The Choice: TIME's Person of the Year\n\nFollow @TIME\n\nIn 1782 an expatriate French aristocrat named J. Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur who lived in New York's Hudson Valley published a book in London called Letters from an American Farmer. The third letter was titled \"What Is an American?\" That question reverberated in the late 18th century as the Old World tried to make sense of the New. It's still relevant 230 years later, in part because Americans are changing even as America itself remains much the same.\n\nCrèvecoeur wondered, \"What then is the American, this new man?\" He was a citizen by choice, not birth - he had decided to come here. Such a thing had never existed before. In many ways, Barack Obama is the 21st century version of this new American. But he's more than just a political figure; he's a cultural one. He is the first President to embrace gay marriage and to offer work permits to many young undocumented immigrants. There has been much talk of the coalition of the ascendant - young people, minorities, Hispanics, college-educated women - and in winning re-election, Obama showed that these fast-growing groups are not only the future but also the present. About 40% of millennials - the largest generational cohort in U.S. history, bigger even than the baby boomers - are nonwhite. If his win in 2008 was extraordinary, then 2012 is confirmation that demographic change is here to stay.\n\n( MORE : Barack Obama, 2012 Person of the Year )\n\nObama is the first Democratic President since FDR to win more than 50% of the vote in consecutive elections and the first President since 1940 to win re-election with an unemployment rate north of 7.5%. He has stitched together a winning coalition and perhaps a governing one as well. His presidency spells the end of the Reagan realignment that had defined American politics for 30 years. We are in the midst of historic cultural and demographic changes, and Obama is both the symbol and in some ways the architect of this new America. \"The truth is,\" the President said in the Oval Office, \"that we have steadily become a more diverse and tolerant country that embraces people's differences and respects people who are not like us. That's a profoundly good thing. That's one of the strengths of America.\"\n\nAll elections are about change, and 2012's was as well. Pretty much everyone voted for change of some kind: 49% of voters wanted to change the President, while 51% of voters wanted the change that Obama promised four years earlier. The pollster Frank Luntz told me that 40% of America is ecstatic, 20% is accepting and 40% thinks the country is going to hell. \"The only other time we've seen this was FDR in 1936,\" he said. \"Those who are alienated believe the President and his policies are not grounded in American values.\"\n\n( Inside the White House : Never-Before-Seen Photos )\n\nBut whose America is that? Is there a battle between the old America and the new? Obama would say no. He sees his time in office as a kind of convergence of past and future. \"I think about this eight-year project,\" he says, as one in which \"we've also accommodated all the demographic changes and cultural and technological changes that are taking place and been able to marry those with some of the old-fashioned virtues of hard work and discipline and responsibility - all in a way that allows us to succeed and to thrive.\" That's the new America. And it's finding its voice: the President we heard at the wrenching memorial service in Connecticut was more assertive, more personal, more willing to risk his political capital for what he truly believes.\n\nAt the end of Invisible Man , Ralph Ellison's great 1952 novel about racial injustice, the central character says, \"America is woven of many strands; I would recognize them and let it so remain ... Our fate is to become one, and yet many - This is not prophecy, but description.\" Just 12 years ago, Obama was so invisible that he attended the 2000 Democratic National Convention in L.A. and watched it on the Jumbotron in the Staples Center parking lot. Today he is universally visible - and known. But he would agree with Ellison's observation that this change is indeed description and not prophecy. The new America is not so much the old e pluribus unum - out of many, one - but, as Ellison says, one and yet many. That is Obama's America.

      "text": "NH towns will not be able to choose to use ranked choice voting after House vote\n\nThe New Hampshire House rejected a bill Wednesday that would've allowed municipalities in the state to use ranked choice voting for local elections.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep. Ellen Read , D-Newmarket, would've given municipalities the ability to opt in to rank choice voting, but would not have required it.\n\n\"Cities and towns should be given the freedom to decide which will best meet their needs in their local town or city elections,\" said Rep. Matt Wilhelm, D-Manchester. \"It gives voters the ability to better reflect their preferences on their ballot, and it ensures winners garner the most voter support by avoiding voters vote splitting when there are more than two candidates running for a position.\"\n\nRep. Ross Berry, R-Weare, said that the voting method is too complicated, costly and confusing to voters.\n\n\"It is a convoluted system in an attempt to undermine the 100 years tradition of our 'first past the post' system,\" Berry said.\n\nThe bill failed in a vote of 194 to 145 .\n\nThis bill was just the latest of many failed attempts to establish ranked choice voting in some way in New Hampshire.\n\nThe state's neighbor Maine, however, was the first state to adopt ranked choice voting for statewide elections in 2016. And all other states in New England are considering ranked choice voting bills this session.\n\nRanked choice voting is a system in which voters ranked the candidates in order of preference.\n\nIf no one candidate receives a majority of the votes, the candidate who received the fewest votes is eliminated and voters that ranked that candidate first have their vote counted for their next choice.\n\nThe process continues until one candidate receives a majority of the voters' choices.\n\nRanked choice voting has been adopted in two states, Maine and Alaska. Maine was the first state to use ranked-choice voting in a statewide election.\n\n63 jurisdictions also use ranked choice voting, including the cities of Cambridge, Burlington, and New York.\n\nProponents of ranked choice voting say it leads to more representative outcomes, discourages negative campaigning since candidates compete for everyone's votes, and increases participation.\n\nOpponents say it is confusing and would undermine trust in elections.\n\nRanked choice voting in Maine has led to some controversy: U.S. Rep. Jared Golden , D-Maine, has now won two close elections where second choice votes counted in a ranked choice voting tabulation allowed him to edge out his Republican competitor in the Trump-won district .\n\nWhile Republicans, including one of Golden's defeated competitors, have attempted to challenge ranked choice voting in court, a Trump appointed U.S. district judge has ruled multiple times that the system is constitutional.\n\nAll other New England states are considering ranked choice voting this year, too.\n\nA bill to establish ranked choice voting for presidential primaries in Rhode Island was recommended for further study on Tuesday.\n\nMassachusetts has a couple of bills attempting to implement ranked choice voting: one to provide the voting method as an option in municipal elections (similar to New Hampshire's bill) and one for it to be used for certain offices in the town of Lexington .\n\nBoth Vermont and Connecticut also currently have bills to allow the use of ranked choice voting in presidential primaries."

Choice programs allow states to spend public funds for private or alternative schools.\n\nThe ballot items in Colorado and Kentucky propose adding language supporting school choice to their states' constitutions but neither lays out specifics for a statewide program.\n\nIf the Colorado and Kentucky measures pass, the states would join at least 29 states and the District of Columbia which already have some form of school choice language on the books, according to an Education Week analysis .\n\nThe Nebraska measure aims to repeal a $10 million school voucher program its state legislature passed this year, putting that decision in the hands of voters.\n\nSchool choice experts told USA TODAY that these measures align with debates playing out across the country.\n\n\"What we've seen in the few last years is that private school choice programs are expanding rapidly, among almost exclusively red states,\" said Deven Carlson, a professor and associate director of education at the University of Oklahoma's Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis.\n\nBut these measures indicate \"some sort of pushback,\" Carlson said, especially with Colorado, a blue state, seeking to add school choice to its constitution.\n\nBecause of the vague language in the Colorado and Kentucky measures, it's unclear how any school choice programs these states may pass would play out and which families would be served, said Liz Cohen, a policy director at the independent think tank at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy.\n\nThat will vary based on how much money the states spend on school choice programs, she said.\n\nThe presence of school choice programs in the U.S. dates to at least 1869 in Vermont. The modern school choice movement was powered by parents upset about school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some parents removed their kids from neighborhood public schools and moved them to other types of schools, including private schools, home schools and charter schools. Many parents have kept their children in those alternative schools .\n\nSince the pandemic, several states have passed school choice laws that allow parents to use public funding to pay for alternative schools through vouchers or educational scholarships, according to a national tracker from EdChoice, a nonprofit organization that advocates for school choice.\n\nOpponents of these measures argue that school vouchers, education saving accounts and other school choice options hurt public schools, which they say need all the funding they can get.\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

U.S. Representative Adrian Smith (NE-R) introduced an accompanying legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\"Parents want to see their child succeed,\" Cassidy stated. \"Giving them the ability to make decisions over their child's education puts that child's need first.

      "text": "Commentary: School choice does not equal education freedom. It drains public resources\n\nManage your account\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently signed an executive order aimed at expanding school choice . The order directs federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Education, to issue guidance on how states can use federal funds to expand \"educational choice\" initiatives and encourage \"education freedom.\"\n\nThis order was signed alongside another to \" end radical indoctrination in K-12 schooling ,\" which seeks to end funding for schools that support and include honest and critical conversations around race, gender and sexuality in their curricula.\n\nBoth of these orders are a fear tactic designed to create distrust in our public schools. In reality, expansion of school choice programs deepens inequities and drains resources from public schools, and censoring curricula restricts students' right to learn.\n\nAdditionally, cases such as Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board v. Drummond , which will be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court this spring, present existential challenges to secular public education as we currently know it. This matter concerns what could be the country's first religious charter school, which would not only open opportunities for school choice expansion, but also threaten to erode religious freedom and the line between church and state in our institutions.\n\nThe Trump administration will claim that these orders are a win for parent choice. Every parent wants the best education for their child. And every child, no matter where they live, deserves a high-quality education. Parents should be involved in their students' education, but instead of creating avenues for families to leave public schools, we should focus on bettering our current options.\n\nThe solution isn't to use public tax dollars to fund privatized institutions that serve only the select few. The solution is to fully fund our neighborhood public schools so that all children can benefit. School choice is a distraction. It shifts the focus - and the funds - away from collective responsibility for providing excellent educational opportunities for all toward a competition for individual gain.\n\nNot only does school choice undermine the principle of public education as a public good, but it also increases the divide between students who have access and those who don't. State funding for education and other critical spending priorities all comes from the same pot - more money for private schools and charters means less for rural and low-income schools. School choice doesn't create more options if it only does so by divesting from neighborhood public schools. The math doesn't add up.\n\nIllinois has rejected school choice legislation before - because it doesn't work. The 2017 Invest in Kids Act, which privately funded scholarships for 15,000 students, ended in 2023. While school choice supporters in Illinois often highlight the loss of scholarships when this bill ended, they fail to mention the 1.85 million students in Illinois public schools who were shortchanged by the legislation .\n\nPrograms such as Invest in Kids siphon state resources away from neighborhood public schools, forcing those schools to compete for limited resources, leading to larger class sizes, fewer extracurriculars and reduced support services, while private schools benefit. Federal voucher support threatens to incentivize states to adopt similar inequitable funding models that harm public education nationwide.\n\nInstead of creating pathways that lead families to compete for more inequitable schooling options, legislators at the federal and state levels should focus on bettering the schools that students already attend. In Illinois, the evidence-based funding formula (EBF) was created to direct additional resources to the schools and districts that need them most. This formula is currently underfunded by $5 billion. Illinois cannot afford to take any more money away from public schools.\n\nFully funding EBF will do far more to close the opportunity gap than any tax credit program ever could. Proponents of school choice often claim that school choice programs empower low-income families. Half of current public school students in Illinois are low-income, and 54.7% are students of color. All students in public schools are harmed by underfunding, but marginalized communities will be hurt most by an expansion of school choice.\n\nThe ethical and fiscally responsible choice for legislators who want to empower low-income families is to support increased funding for public education.\n\nOne thing both sides can agree on is that the current system doesn't work for everyone, but the solution - especially in this unprecedented time of uncertainty in federal funding sources due to sharply shifting education policy - is not to move toward school choice models or to cut federal funding from public schools for teaching truthful history.\n\nWe need to fully fund public schools so every child has access to a high-quality education, no matter their ZIP code. Congress and states should reject this federal legislation and focus on reforms that uplift all communities, especially communities of color that have been historically underserved.\n\nThe futures of public education and Illinois' students depend on it.\n\n____\n\nMaddy Wheelock, a former public school teacher, is coalition coordinator for the Partnership for Equity and Education Rights Illinois.\n\n____"

Vouchers typically afford parents the freedom to select nonpublic schools, including faith-based ones, using all or a portion of the public funds set aside to educate their children.\n\nBut research shows that as a consequence, this typically drains funding from already cash-strapped public schools.\n\nGet stories like this delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up for The 74 Newsletter\n\nWe are professors who focus on education law , with special interests in educational equity and school choice programs . While proponents of school choice claim it leads to academic gains , we don't see much evidence to support this view - but we do see the negative impact they sometimes have on public schools.\n\nThe vast majority of children in the U.S. attend traditional public schools . Their share, however, has steadily declined from 87% in 2011 to about 83% in 2021, at least in part due to the growth of school choice programs such as vouchers.\n\nRelated\n\nModern voucher programs expanded significantly during the late 1980s and early 1990s as states, cities and local school boards experimented with ways to allow parents to use public funds to send their kids to nonpublic schools, especially ones that are religiously affiliated.\n\nWhile some programs were struck down for violating the separation of church and state, others were upheld. Vouchers received a big shot in the arm in 2002, when the Supreme Court ruled in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris that the First Amendment's Establishment Clause permitted states to include faith-based schools in their voucher programs in Cleveland.\n\nFollowing Zelman, vouchers became a more realistic political option . Even so, access to school choice programs varied greatly by state and was not as dramatic as supporters may have wished . Because the Constitution is silent on education, states largely control school voucher programs .\n\nCurrently, 13 states and Washington, D.C. , offer one or several school choice programs targeting different types of students. Total U.S. enrollment in such programs surpassed 1 million for the first time in 2024, double what it was in 2020, according to EdChoice, which advocates for school-choice policies.\n\nVoters, however, have taken a dim view of voucher programs. By one count, they've turned down referendums on vouchers 17 times , according to the National Coalition for Public Education, a group that opposes the policy.\n\nMost recently, three states rejected school choice programs in the November 2024 elections. Kentucky voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to enshrine school choice into commonwealth law, while Nebraska voters chose to repeal its voucher program . Colorado also rejected a \"right\" to school choice, but more narrowly.\n\nAt its heart, Trump's executive order would offer discretionary grants and issue guidance to states over using federal funds within this K-12 scholarship program. It also directs the Department of Interior and Department of Defense to make vouchers available to Native American and military families.\n\nIn addition, the order directs the Department of Education to provide guidance on how states can better support school choice - though it's unclear exactly what that will mean. It's a task that will be left for Linda McMahon, Trump's nominee for secretary of Education , once she is confirmed.\n\nTrump promoted school choice in his first term as well but failed to win enough congressional support to include it in the federal budget .\n\nThe push to give parents more choice over where to send their children is based on the assumption that doing so will provide them with a better education.\n\nIn the order, Trump specifically cites disappointing data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress showing that 70% of eighth graders are below proficient in reading , while 72% are below proficient in mathematics .\n\nVoucher advocates point to research that school choice boosts test scores and improves educational attainment .\n\nBut other data don't always back up the notion that school choice policies meaningfully improve student outcomes. A 2023 review of the past decade of research on the topic by the Brookings Institution found that the introduction of a voucherlike program actually led to lower academic achievement - similar to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRelated\n\nA 2017 review by a Stanford economist Martin Carnoy published by the Economic Policy Institute similarly found little evidence vouchers improve school outcomes. While there were some modest gains in graduation rates, they were outweighed by the risks to funding public school systems.\n\nIndeed, vouchers have been shown to reduce funding to public schools, especially in rural areas , and hurt public education in other ways, such as by making it harder for schools to afford qualified teachers .\n\nCritics of voucher programs also fear that nonpublic schools may discriminate against some students , such as those who are members of the LGBTQ+ community. There are some reports of this already happening in Wisconsin. Unlike legislation governing traditional public schools, state laws regulating voucher programs often do not include comprehensive anti-discrimination provisions .\n\nRelated\n\nCriticisms of voucher programs aside, many parents who support them do so based on the hope that their children will have more affordable, high-quality educational options. This was especially true in Zelman, in which the Supreme Court upheld the rights of parents to remove their kids from Cleveland's struggling public schools.\n\nThere is little doubt in our minds that in some cases school choice affords some parents in low-performing districts additional options for their children's education.\n\nBut in general, the evidence shows that is the exception to vouchers, not the rule. Evidence also suggests most children - whether they're using vouchers to attend nonpublic schools or remain in the public school system - may not always benefit from school choice programs. And when it takes money out of underfunded public school systems, school choice can make things worse for a lot more children than it benefits.\n\nWhile the poor reading and math scores cited in Trump's executive order suggest that change is needed to help keep America's school and students competitive, this order may not achieve that goal.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Trump's school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses\n\nManage your account\n\nMar. 24-More than a dozen states in the past two years have launched or expanded programs that allow families to use taxpayer dollars to send their students to private schools. Now, President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress want to supercharge those efforts.\n\nTrump in January issued an executive order directing several federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to tap into federal money for so-called school choice opportunities. Those can come in the form of education savings accounts, voucher programs, tax credits or scholarships. Trump's order also aims to expand access to public charter schools, which are free from some of the rules that apply to traditional public schools.\n\nMeanwhile in Congress, 24 Republican senators have signed on to legislation that would provide $10 billion in annual tax credits to individuals and corporations who make charitable contributions to organizations that provide private-school scholarships. A Nebraska Republican introduced a companion measure in the House.\n\nAlready this year, Idaho, Tennessee and Wyoming have approved school choice programs, and bills are advancing in Kansas, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas. A bill in Mississippi died before advancing. Most of the measures still in play would open programs to all families regardless of income, though some states would cap the total amount of money available.\n\nSupporters of school choice say it gives parents control of their kids' education - and an escape hatch if they are dissatisfied with their local public school. Many conservatives, religious institutions and private schools are in favor of school choice, along with some people of color who live in districts with underperforming public schools.\n\n\"Every child is different. They learn in different environments. There are just so many factors, that I believe that parents should be the ones that make the decision on where their child is going to do the best and have the most success,\" said Indiana Republican state Sen. Linda Rogers. A former educator, Rogers has sponsored a bill in her state that would provide additional money to charter schools, which are considered to be a form of school choice.\n\nOpponents, including teachers unions, public school professionals and many rural lawmakers of both parties, say such measures undermine traditional public schools by shifting money away from them.\n\n\"When we start to take from public schools, we're hurting our kids, our lower-income kids. They will not prosper from this legislation,\" Tennessee Democratic state Rep. Ronnie Glynn said during the floor debate on a far-reaching voucher bill in his state.\n\nJoshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University, said vouchers are a budget-buster for states.\n\n\"Vouchers don't shift costs - they add costs,\" Cowen said in a phone interview. \"Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn't have to fund.\"\n\nThe switch to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, which gave parents a front-row seat to watch what their children were - or were not - learning in their classes, contributed to the recent school choice momentum. So did parent frustration over prolonged public school closures.\n\nI believe that parents should be the ones that make the decision on where their child is going to do the best and have the most success. - Indiana Republican state Sen. Linda Rogers\n\n\"Parents got a good look into sort of what was happening in schools,\" said Bella DiMarco, a senior K-12 education policy analyst at FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University. \"There was a lot of talk during the pandemic around school choice ... of what public schools aren't doing for their kids.\"\n\nThe first modern school voucher program, created in Milwaukee in 1990, was a bipartisan effort to help lower-income families afford private schools. In recent years, more states have moved from school choice programs focused on certain groups, such as low-income students or students with disabilities, to universal programs open to students of all backgrounds.\n\n\"Historically, the programs were always sort of targeted to students in need,\" DiMarco said. \"But in the last couple of years, the new push has been for these universal programs.\"\n\nCurrently, more than 30 states and Washington, D.C., have at least one school choice program. More than a dozen states now offer universal or near-universal access, allowing K - 12 students to participate in school choice regardless of income.\n\nEdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice, estimates that 1.2 million students are attending private schools this school year with the help of public tax credits, scholarships or vouchers.\n\nDifferent strategies\n\nStates that enacted school choice programs this year have pursued different strategies.\n\nThe program Idaho enacted last month, for example, will provide an annual tax credit of $5,000 per child ($7,500 for students with disabilities) to help cover private education expenses.\n\nMost voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn't have to fund. - Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University\n\nTennessee's new program will provide 20,000 scholarships of roughly $7,000 each. During its first year, half of the Tennessee scholarships will be reserved for households earning less than $173,000 for a family of four, but that restriction will be removed in subsequent years.\n\nAbout 65% of the Tennessee vouchers are expected to be awarded to students who already attend private schools, according to a legislative analysis.\n\nCritics say the cost of the program will grow quickly, creating a hole in the state's budget. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who pushed hard for the proposal, suggested that Trump's executive order might provide additional resources. Lee told reporters he hasn't yet analyzed the order, \"but I think there's opportunity there.\"\n\n\"The president wants to support states like ours who are advocating for school choice,\" Lee said in a news conference after lawmakers approved the measure. Lee was at the White House on Thursday when Trump signed an order calling for the U.S. Department of Education to be dismantled.\n\nTexas lawmakers also are actively debating a voucher program, a longtime priority for Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who worked to defeat resistant rural Republicans in last year's state legislative elections and who also attended the White House event. The Senate passed a bill that would provide $10,000 per student ($11,500 for students with disabilities) annually through education savings accounts. A similar House proposal is under review.\n\nKansas is considering a universal refundable tax credit - $8,000 per child for accredited private school tuition and $4,000 for non-accredited private schools. The program starts with a $125 million cap, increasing annually if participation hits certain thresholds.\n\nBallot box defeats\n\nSchool choice opponents question the wisdom of sending taxpayer dollars to schools that may lack certified teachers, follow nonstandardized curricula or discriminate in admissions. Many private schools have testing standards, maintain religious requirements or exclude LGBTQ+ students or those with certain disabilities, for example.\n\nIn some Republican-led states that have expanded school choice, Democrats have filed bills to increase oversight and place restrictions on these programs. A bill in Tennessee would require background checks for teachers at private schools that receive voucher money. And an Iowa bill would require that property tax statements include information on how much money education savings accounts subtracted from local public schools.\n\nAs voucher programs have grown, they have attracted greater scrutiny.\n\nProPublica, an investigative journalism outlet, last year found that Arizona's universal voucher program has mostly benefited wealthier families. Some Arizona parents have tried to use voucher money to pay for dune buggies and expensive Lego sets, according to press reports.\n\nCritics also note that despite recent legislative successes, school ballot initiatives fared poorly at the ballot box last fall.\n\nVoters in Colorado rejected a measure that sought to enshrine school choice rights in the state constitution.\n\nIn Nebraska, voters partially repealed a state-funded private school scholarship program.\n\nAnd in Kentucky, voters overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed the use of public money to support private schools, with 65% of voters - and a majority in every county - opposed.\n\n\"There's a handful of these billionaires that have been pushing vouchers for 30 years,\" said Cowen, the Michigan State University professor. \"The school choice movement is not necessarily driven by public demand, but rather by wealthy donors and political maneuvering.\"\n\nStateline reporter Robbie Sequeira can be reached at [email protected].\n\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE."

      "text": "Does Arizona really have school choice if everyone takes the same tests? | Opinion\n\nManage your account\n\nNine days after being sworn in, President Donald Trump penned an executive order aimed at expanding school choice and supporting families who prefer alternative educational options to public schools.\n\nThe order mentions that \"more than a dozen States have enacted universal K-12 scholarship programs, allowing families - rather than the government - to choose the best educational setting for their children.\"\n\nArizona was the first state to enact an Empowerment Scholarship Account program in 2011. Initially aimed at students with special needs, ESAs gave parents the option to redirect their own tax dollars from public to private education.\n\nIn 2022, Gov. Doug Ducey expanded the program to ensure that all Arizona students could benefit from it.\n\nCompetition is healthy for education because it prevents schools from getting lethargic and protects consumers from a poor product. The more choice, the better.\n\nBut college entrance exams reveal a key weakness in school choice policy: if every high school student is ultimately held to the standard of the same college admissions test, how much choice do you really have?\n\nThe College Board is a private company that controls the PSAT, the SAT and AP tests, and the company, alongside the ACT , had a key role in the creation of Common Core State Standards.\n\nBoth the SAT and ACT exams are tied to the Common Core .\n\nIf we want to create lasting change in American education, we need assessment choice alongside school choice.\n\nThat's where the Classic Learning Test (CLT) comes in. The test provides another way for students to showcase their aptitude for college, buttressing school choice with an alternative assessment rooted in the classical liberal arts tradition of America's founding fathers.\n\nLike the other standardized college admissions tests, the CLT measures students' reading, writing and mathematics skills. It is open to students learning in any school type and within any type of curricula.\n\nBut rather than assessing students with mundane, soulless reading material, the CLT uses classic works of literature, philosophy and history that have shaped western civilization.\n\nTo do well on the CLT, students must be able to communicate clearly, understand difficult prose, think logically, comprehend metaphors and solve puzzles.\n\nFlorida was the first state to adopt the CLT in 2023 as an option for students to meet high school graduation requirements, to earn scholarships to public universities, and to earn admission to colleges and universities in the University of Florida system.\n\nA majority of the state's school districts have now made use of the CLT, and the company administered more than 120,000 exams there in its first year.\n\nArizona should follow suit.\n\nCurrently, the state offers high schools a menu of assessments, but CLT is not yet on that menu. The State Board of Education can easily remedy this.\n\nAdditionally, Arizona's three public universities currently only recognize the SAT and ACT as optional exams for admissions packages.

      "text": "Trump signs sweeping executive order to expand school choice\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order Wednesday that would prioritize and free up federal funding to expand school choice programs.\n\nThe order impacts several federal departments and directs the Education Department to prioritize school choice programs through its discretionary grants, in addition to issuing guidance to states about federal allocations to districts and schools, a senior White House official said.\n\n\"Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Education shall issue guidance regarding how States can use Federal formula funds to support K-12 educational choice initiatives,\" the order says.\n\nThe order, entitled \"Expanding Educational Freedom and Opportunity for Families,\" directs the Department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance that explains how states receiving block grants for families and children can use that money for faith-based and private institutions within the next 90 days.\n\nIt also directs Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to present a plan to Trump for how military families can use Pentagon funds to send their children to schools of their choosing, and directs the interior secretary to submit a plan for how students at Bureau of Indian Education schools can take advantage of federal funds for school choice.\n\nCBS News first reported that Trump was expected to sign the order.\n\nFrederick Hess, the director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank, said the move is \"clearly a stark shift in emphasis for Washington.\"\n\n\"Given the dismal r esults on the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress, released today , I'm pleased to see the administration doing what it can to ensure families have access to more and better choices,\" Hess said. \"While there are significant limits to what's possible, given statutory constraints and Washington's modest role in K-12 schooling, it's notable that the administration is doing what it can to extend the parental choice rather than stymie it - a pattern that was all too familiar during the past four years.\"\n\nDerrell Bradford, the president of 50CAN, a nonprofit group that supports school choice, said the executive order \"is timely, given many governors, families, students and educators across the nation, in all types of schools, are celebrating National School Choice Week right now. I, and I am sure many other advocates at the state level, look forward to seeing the recommendations put forth on this uniquely popular issue.\"\n\nThe Education Department announced Sunday that it was recognizing this week as National School Choice Week , highlighting \"education freedom\" by sharing options for students and families, including public schools, charter schools, private schools and home-schooling.\n\n\"School choice empowers parents and guardians to pursue the best learning environment for their children,\" the department said in a release. \"It allows for innovative schooling models and methods that meet the unique needs of students across the nation.\"\n\nCritics of school choice, which provides vouchers allowing families to pick schools for their children, argue that it hurts public schools.\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said at the union's annual convention last year that research shows vouchers \"negatively affect achievement.\"\n\n\"Today, vouchers subsidize wealthy families who already send their kids to private and religious schools,\" she said. \"Privatizers fund those giveaways by defunding and destabilizing public schools.\"\n\nTrump campaigned on expanding school choice programs, and during the transition period, his spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, said he believed that \" school choice is the civil rights issue of our time \" and that it would \"ensure all families have access to a great education, no matter their ZIP code.\"\n\nThe White House on Wednesday also announced that Trump signed an executive order aimed at \"ending radical indoctrination in K-12 schooling.\"\n\nThe order directs several Cabinet members within 90 days to \"provide an Ending Indoctrination Strategy to the President\" that includes eliminating funding for \"illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools.\"\n\nThe order also references the 1776 Commission, an initiative from Trump's first term that his administration argued would reintroduce patriotism into school curricula.\n\nThe Senate has not yet confirmed Trump's nominee for education secretary, Linda McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO who was head of the Small Business Administration during Trump's first administration.\n\nYamiche Alcindor and Rebecca Shabad reported from Washington.

Instead, she wants the funding for public schools to go toward relocating students to charter or public schools.\n\n\"They should have the ability to do that,\" McMahon said. \"Parents know the success of their children is going to depend on where they're able to get their education.\"\n\nThe hearing, titled \"Education Without Limits: Exploring the Benefits of School Choice,\" is scheduled for 10:15 a.m. ET.\n\nSchool choice is an umbrella term for educational initiatives allowing parents to enroll their children in schools other than their assigned public school - including charter schools, private institutions and homeschooling - often using public funding.\n\nAn executive order signed Jan. 29 gave McMahon, who had not yet been confirmed, 60 days to \"issue guidance regarding how States can use Federal formula funds to support K-12 educational choice initiatives.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's order specified that education freedom should be given \"priority in discretionary grant programs,\" which the Department of Education defines as \"financial assistance in the form of money by the Federal government to an eligible grantee.\"\n\nEssentially, the Trump administration wants to help students switch schools through taxpayer-funded vouchers, scholarships and grants. How that would happen - and what it would cost - has not yet been outlined.\n\nIs the US headed for a recession? 4 warning signs to keep an eye on\n\nSome Republicans on Capitol Hill believe adopting these methods would help America's students regain ground on declining national test scores , but opponents say the federal funding switch-up would negatively impact public schools that need the most help.\n\n\"In rural America, there's one school in the community. You undercut it, and education just dramatically declines,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\n\"Without good schools, without the funding to support these schools, children will be hurt, our country will be worse off, and the American dream falls by the wayside,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics , roughly nine out of 10 K-12 students in the U.S. attended public schools as of 2021.\n\nTuesday's hearing comes as Trump's White House looks to dissolve the Department of Education altogether. The agency's closure was a cornerstone of his campaign and serves as the so-called \" final mission \" for McMahon's subordinates.\n\nLast week, Trump was scheduled to sign an executive order asking McMahon to essentially put herself out of a job, though it was delayed. A White House official told NewsNation the administration would continue to review the department in the meantime.\n\nSenate confirms Lori Chavez-DeRemer as Trump's labor secretary\n\n\"He's been crystal clear that he wants to see the Department of Education closed, and he'd like to see it done sooner rather than later,\" McMahon said. \"But he understands that we need to work with Congress. There are certain things that are in statute.\"\n\nIt would take an act of Congress to shutter the agency.\n\n\"I think my job is to convince Congress that the steps that we are taking are in the best interest of the kids,\" McMahon said.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

      "text": "School choice programs divide Republicans as Trump moves to eliminate Department of Education\n\nManage your account\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to reduce the Department of Education to its essential functions . The directive tells what's left of the agency to prioritize sending money to school choice programs across America.\n\nThese programs -- which are also referred to as school vouchers and school freedom -- allow parents to take tax dollars allocated for their children to attend public schools and, in most cases, use that money to send them to private schools.\n\nMORE: Trump signs order gutting Department of Education while surrounded by kids\n\nThe argument supporting this movement is that private schools often provide a better education for children.\n\nIn Tennessee, where supporters of the programs refer to them as scholarships, State House Rep. Todd Warner is a proud product of rural public schools. He's a self-described \"die-hard Republican,\" but told ABC News that he believes what some conservatives are currently trying to do to education is wrong.\n\n\"Public schools are the backbone of the community,\" Warner said. \"On Friday nights, Friday night lights, the football game. It's where everybody comes together. It's where we tailgate and see each other's family before the game. It's where we cheer each other's children on.\"\n\nFor the past four years at the Tennessee Statehouse, Warner represented what he refers to as \"country folk\" from counties so red that Confederate flags continue to fly over a few homes and monuments.\n\n\"I'm in favor of reducing the Department of Education on the federal level,\" Warner said. \"I would love to see President Trump send more money back to the states. I'm good with that, but I don't want to see that go to the private sector. I want to see it help our public schools.\"\n\nMORE: The future of school choice amid Department of Education overhaul\n\nBut in February, Gov. Bill Lee signed Tennessee's universal school choice program into law . It joined at least 29 states that allow some form of school vouchers, including about 15 states that do not consider parental wealth.\n\nWarner is currently working to limit the number of vouchers in Tennessee.\n\nHe may have a life size Trump cutout in his office and hang his red hat on the wall above a dead buck, but Warner told ABC News that he doesn't mind being called a sellout in Nashville because he knows that at home in the district he represents south of the city, his constituents know that isn't who he is.\n\n\"You know, the best memories in life that I have,\" Warner said. \"Some of them are in the public school, in high school, you know, with those teachers, with those coaches. And it's that way in a lot of rural Tennessee. I mean, it's the public school or it's nothing.\"\n\nSchool choice programs divide Republicans as Trump moves to eliminate Department of Education originally appeared on abcnews.go.com"

      "text": "Choice blindness: Do you know yourself as well as you think?\n\nAsked to make a choice between two things - two faces, or two politicians, perhaps - you may think you know very well the reason you picked A rather than B. But do you? A Swedish psychologist thinks you don't.\n\nYou're shown two pictures - two women, or two men - and you're asked to rate which one you find most attractive. That's easy enough. But then you're asked to explain why.\n\nThat's harder. It might make you think. What is it you like about her? Is there something appealing about her eyes, perhaps? Or her hair? What is it about him? Maybe you like his strong jaw-line, or his perfect teeth.\n\nBut are these really the reasons you found one person more attractive than the other? Once you hear about Prof Petter Johansson's work, you may begin to have your doubts.\n\nSwedish experimental psychologist Petter Johansson loves magic. He's not formally trained but he's taught himself some basic sleight of hand techniques. Magicians have long understood the phenomenon of \"change blindness\". By distracting you, a magician can change a card, say the King of Clubs for the King of Spades, and the chances are you won't notice.\n\nJohansson's rudimentary magic skills are useful for his experiments - for, some years ago, he and his colleagues decided to test not change blindness but \"choice blindness\".\n\nLet me explain. In his earliest experiment, Petter Johansson showed participants pairs of pictures of faces. The subjects had a simple task: to choose the one they found most attractive. Then they were given the picture and asked to justify their selection. But unbeknown to them, Johansson had deployed his magic to make a switch; they were actually handed the picture of the man or woman they had not picked.\n\nYou might assume that everyone would notice. If so, you would be wrong. Amazingly, only a quarter of people spot the switch. To repeat, the faces were of different people, and there were easily identifiable differences between them. One might be brown-haired and with earrings; the other might be blonde and with no earrings.\n\nAfter the switch, the subjects explained why they had chosen the person they had actually not chosen! \"When I asked them, why did you choose this face?\" says Petter Johansson, \"they started to elaborate on why this was the preferred face, even if, just a few seconds before, they had preferred the other face.\"\n\nWhen he explained to them what he had done, he was usually met with surprise and often disbelief. The most intriguing cases were those in which people justified the manipulated choice by highlighting something absent in their original choice. \"For instance, if they say, 'Oh, I prefer this face because I really like the earrings,' and the one they originally preferred didn't have any earrings, then we can be certain that whatever made them make this choice, it can't have been the earrings.\"\n\nWhat can we conclude from this? Well, it turns out that we don't have a clear understanding of why we choose what we choose. We often have to figure it out for ourselves, just as we have to figure out the motives and reasons of others. The window through which we try to observe our own soul is dim and murky.\n\nWhy you believe one face is better-looking than another is hardly a trivial issue. Sexual appeal matters: the survival of the human species rather depends upon it. But Petter Johansson has also used his trickery to test our choices in another weighty domain - politics.\n\nIn one study, he asked a group of Swedish subjects a dozen questions about where they stood on political issues - such as whether there should be an increase in petrol tax, or whether healthcare benefits should be cut. These are topics which tend to divide the Swedish left and right. Their written survey answers were then handed to them, except - as you might by now have guessed - they were not the real ones. Left-wing people were shown answers which were more right-wing; right-wing people were shown answers that were more left-wing. And then they were asked to justify their selections.\n\nAgain, most people failed to spot the switch. A subject who a minute earlier had ticked a box supporting a rise in the petrol tax now proceeded to explain why they believed there should be no such tax hike. They gave explanations that made perfect sense. \"They would say things like, 'Well it's unfair to the population living outside the major cities because they have to drive a lot more.'\" So there was nothing odd about their rationalisation, except that a few minutes earlier they would not have supplied it.\n\nClearly we lack self-knowledge about our motives and choices. But so what? What are the implications of this research?\n\nWell, perhaps one general point is that we should learn to be more tolerant of people who change their minds. We tend to have very sensitive antennae for inconsistency - be this inconsistency in a partner, who's changed their mind on whether they fancy an Italian or an Indian meal, or a politician who's backed one policy in the past and now supports an opposing position. But as we often don't have a clear insight into why we choose what we choose, we should surely be given some latitude to switch our choices.\n\nThere may also be more specific implications for how we navigate through our current era - a period in which there is growing cultural and political polarisation. It would be natural to believe that those who support a left-wing or right-wing party do so because they're committed to that party's ideology: they believe in free markets or, the opposite, in a larger role for the state. But Petter Johansson's work suggests that our deeper commitment is not to particular policies, since, using his switching technique, we can be persuaded to endorse all sorts of policies. Rather, \"we support a label or a team\".\n\nThat is to say, we're liable to overestimate the extent to which a Trump supporter - or a Biden supporter - backs his or her candidate because of the policies the politician promotes. Instead, someone will be Team Trump, or Team Biden. A striking example of this was in the last US election. Republicans have traditionally been pro-free trade - but when Trump began to advocate protectionist policies, most Republicans carried on backing him, without even seeming to notice the shift.\n\nPrior to the last US election - the bitterly contested 2016 race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton - Prof Johansson tried another experiment. He asked voters to rate their preferred candidate on their character, experience and so on, and then he switched their answers, improving the ratings of the candidate they disliked. It worked. People offered reasons why they were actually quite open-minded between the two.\n\nRemarkably, such legerdemain turns out to have a lasting impact. Fool a person that they believe someone with blond hair is more attractive than one with brown, and they are likely to confirm that preference when shown the two faces at a later date. It's the same with political views. After swaying the political preferences of his subjects, Petter Johansson tested their views the following week. Having had to justify their new preferences, it seemed \"they had listened to their own arguments\".\n\nWhich are more effective, violent or non-violent protests? And how big does a protest have to be, to drive a political leader from office? One researcher, who has studied these questions carefully, thinks 3.5% of the population will nearly always succeed.\n\nHow many people does it take to oust a political leader?\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump picking Gaetz to head justice sends shockwaves - and a strong message\n\nDonald Trump's nomination of congressman Matt Gaetz to be his attorney general has arrived like a thunderclap in Washington.\n\nOf all the president-elect's picks for his administration so far, this is easily the most controversial - and sends a clear message that Trump intends to shake up the establishment when he returns to power.\n\nThe shockwaves were still being felt on Thursday morning as focus shifted to a looming fight in the Senate over his nomination.\n\nTrump is assembling his team before he begins his term on 20 January, and his choice of defence secretary, Fox News host Pete Hegseth, and intelligence chief, former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, have also raised eyebrows.\n\nBut it is Gaetz making most headlines. The Florida firebrand is perhaps best known for spearheading the effort to unseat then-Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy last year. But he has a history of being a flamethrower in the staid halls of Congress.\n\nIn 2018, he brought a right-wing Holocaust denier to the State of the Union, and later tried to expel two fathers who lost children in a mass shooting from a hearing after they objected to a claim he made about gun control.\n\nHis bombastic approach means he has no shortage of enemies, including within his own party. And so Trump's choice of Gaetz for this crucial role is a signal to those Republicans, too - his second administration will be staffed by loyalists who he trusts to enact his agenda, conventional political opinion be damned.\n\nGasps were heard during a meeting of Republican lawmakers when the nomination for America's top US prosecutor was announced, Axios reported, citing sources in the room.\n\nRepublican congressman Mike Simpson of Idaho reportedly responded with an expletive.\n\n\"I don't think it's a serious nomination for the attorney general,\" Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said. \"This one was not on my bingo card.\"\n\nGaetz does have some allies on Capitol Hill who share an unwavering loyalty to Trump. The Florida lawmaker has been one of the president-elect's most aggressive and relentless defenders - at congressional hearings, in press conferences and during television appearances.\n\nOn Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, another devoted Trump loyalist, called Gaetz an \"accomplished attorney\".\n\n\"He's a reformer in his mind and heart, and I think that he'll bring a lot to the table on that,\" said Johnson.\n\nIn a social media post, Trump spelled out how he intends to use Gaetz as a wrecking ball to radically change the US Department of Justice, which he has regularly blamed for his multiple legal troubles.\n\n\"Matt will root out the systemic corruption at the DOJ, and return the department to its true mission of fighting crime and upholding our democracy and constitution,\" he wrote.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump promised retribution for the numerous investigations launched against him. Now, it appears, Gaetz will be at the frontlines of Trump's efforts to bring the justice department to heel.\n\nThe department also investigated Gaetz himself.\n\nLast year, it declined to bring charges over allegations he violated sex-trafficking laws during a trip he took to the Bahamas with paid escorts.\n\nHe was the subject of an ongoing ethics investigation in the House of Representatives into allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and misuse of campaign funds.\n\nBut on Wednesday evening, reportedly just two days before a highly critical House report on the investigation, Johnson said Gaetz had resigned as a lawmaker, effectively ending the House probe since the committee only investigates members.\n\nOn Thursday, top Senate Democrat Dick Durbin asked the House committee to preserve and share the findings of that report, saying the sequence and timings of the resignation raised questions.\n\n\"Make no mistake: this information could be relevant to the question of Mr Gaetz's confirmation as the next Attorney General of the United States.\"\n\nGaetz has denied all the allegations against him.\n\nAccording to CBS News, Gaetz had asked Trump for a pre-emptive pardon for any related crimes prior to the president leaving office in January 2021.\n\nAll this makes him an unlikely choice for a position that typically goes to more senior politicians, well versed in law.\n\nGaetz, 42, has a law degree and worked for a Florida law firm before his eight years in Congress. Joe Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland, was a senior federal appellate court judge. Trump in his first term picked US Senator Jeff Sessions, and later Bill Barr, who had decades of experience in Republican presidential administrations.\n\nThe Senate will be responsible for confirming Gaetz's nomination, and the Florida congressman has ruffled more then a few feathers in that chamber - including among Republicans. While his party has a majority, it would only take four \"no\" votes, joined by unified Democratic opposition, to sink his chances.\n\nGaetz himself said last year that he would love to be attorney general while acknowledging it was unlikely.\n\n\"The world is not ready, probably,\" he told Newsmax in an interview. \"Certainly Senate confirmation wouldn't be, but you know, a boy can dream.\"\n\nFor the moment, however, Trump's closest supporters are celebrating his pick.\n\n\"The hammer of justice is coming,\" Elon Musk posted about Gaetz on X.\n\nRegardless of the ultimate outcome of Gaetz's bid to be attorney general, Trump has fired a warning shot across the bow of US government. While his second term in office may be more organised than his first, it may end up being even more confrontational.\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense the presidential election in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter. Readers in the UK can sign up here . Those outside the UK can sign up here .\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

He recently made headlines for his support for President Trump.\n\nBlack people were forcibly brought from Africa to the US during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries and sold as slaves.\n\nWest later tweeted that his comments on Tuesday had been misinterpreted and that he \"brought up the 400 years point because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years\".\n\nTo the interviewers at TMZ, West said that \"right now we're choosing to be enslaved\", which provoked an angry response from a black member of staff at the company, Van Lathan.\n\nMr Lathan said the rapper's comments appeared to be made with \"the absence of thought\".\n\n\"You're entitled to believe whatever you want, but there is fact and real-world, real-life consequence behind everything that you just said,\" he added as the star stood still stroking his chin.\n\n\"We have to deal with the marginalisation that has come from the 400 years of slavery that you said for our people was a choice,\" Mr Lathan continued, adding: \"I'm appalled, and brother I am unbelievably hurt by the fact that you have morphed into something to me that isn't real.\"\n\nIn the TMZ footage, West refers to Mr Trump as \"my boy\" and says that the president is \"one of rap's favourite people\".\n\nHis comments sparked a backlash on social media with some Twitter users suggesting the rapper should revisit the history books.\n\nIt comes just days after West released a song defending his support for Mr Trump, who he has insisted is \"fighting for the people\".\n\nThe controversial track, Ye vs The People, caused a stir among rappers, including Snoop Dogg, who appeared offended by its lyrical content.\n\n\"Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand,\" West raps, referring to a peace agreement between two notorious Los Angeles street gangs.\n\nWest has courted controversy with his support for Mr Trump and conservative commentators like Scott Adams and Candace Owens, who has spoken out against the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Chelsea Handler 'thanks' Lively and Baldoni at ceremony\n\nTV host Chelsea Handler \"thanked\" actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni at Friday night's Critics Choice Awards during her opening monologue.\n\nThe comedian said that people in Los Angeles and across the country had been \"through a lot lately\", and that it was important in such times to have a \"distraction\".\n\nHandler's remarks were met with laughter by the audience but on social media she was criticised for \"trivialising\" the feud.\n\nLively, 37, sued Baldoni, 41, in December, accusing him of sexual harassment and a smear campaign. Baldoni is counter-suing Lively and her husband, the actor Ryan Reynolds, on claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.\n\nBaldoni is also suing the New York Times for libel. Both parties strongly deny the claims.\n\nHandler began the ceremony, which was held in Santa Monica, by praising the first responders who had tackled the recent deadly wildfires in LA.\n\n\"I want to acknowledge that we've been through a lot lately, not just here in Los Angeles, but our entire country waking up every day, not knowing what news we are going to hear that will disappoint or horrify us,\" she said.\n\n\"So, it is important in times like these to have a distraction. And that's why I want to personally extend my gratitude to Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively.\n\n\"Thank you for providing us with that distraction. I'm grateful... I think everybody in this room, no matter whose side you're on, we can all agree to accept that there's probably not going to be a sequel.\"\n\n\"It ends with us, guys,\" Handler concluded, in a reference to the 2024 film It Ends With Us in which Lively and Baldoni co-starred.\n\nNeither Baldoni or Lively were present at the awards on Friday night.\n\nVideo footage posted online shows the monologue as well received by the audience.\n\nBut on social media, one X user said Handler was \"trivialising\" the feud while another said the jokes were \"in poor taste\".\n\nMeanwhile, Demi Moore took another leap ahead in the Oscars race, winning best actress at Friday's ceremony.\n\nThe 62-year-old, who also scooped up the award at last month's Golden Globes , has enjoyed a remarkable career resurgence thanks to her role in body horror The Substance.\n\n\"This has been such a wild ride,\" said Moore.\n\nShe thanked critics for celebrating \"this genre of horror films, that are overlooked and not seen for the profundity that they can hold\".\n\nMoore's win came at the expense of Emilia Perez rival Karla Sofia Gascon, whose past tweets caused a significant fallout .\n\nBut the Spanish-language musical did manage to pick up several awards on the night, including best supporting actress for Zoe Saldana.\n\nAnora, a film about a stripper and occasional sex worker who marries the spoiled son of a Russian oligarch, bagged the prize of best picture at the end of the night, having missed out in earlier categories.\n\nAnora's triumph shakes up the race for the most sought-after award at the Oscars next month.\n\nOther wins on the night included Adrian Brody, who won best actor for his role in historical epic The Brutalist, and Jon M. Chu who won best director for Wicked.\n\nConclave won best adapted screenplay.\n\nAlthough it is set in the US, Netflix's new thriller starring Tom Hardy was filmed across Wales.\n\nAhead Thunderbolts* release the BBC traces Florence Pugh's journey from Oxford schoolgirl to Hollywood star.\n\nJosé Ignacio Bergoglio tells the BBC of the special relationship he had with his uncle who became Pope Francis.\n\nThe actor met Bear the dog while filming a promotional video for the new Netflix film, Havoc.\n\nWeymouth and Portland were chosen to host a series of events as part of a year-long cultural programme.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

It's not about an old-fashioned 'tax the rich until the pips squeeze'.\n\n\"We over-tax people's work and we under-tax people's wealth. I am not sure the balance is right.\n\n\"It is difficult in government. It's not easy to balance the books and make things work but I do think we need to proceed with real caution on benefits cuts.\"\n\nA DWP spokeswoman said the government would continue to \"deliver a social security system for those with severe health conditions and protect the income of those who would never be able to work\".\n\n\"Helping people into good work and financial independence is at the heart of our Plan For Change ,\" she added.\n\n\"But the broken social security system we inherited is failing people who can and have the potential to work, as well as the people it's meant to be there for.\"\n\nShe said the government was delivering a £1bn support package to \"guarantee tailored help into work to break down barriers for disabled people\" and rebalancing Universal Credit payment levels \"in a boost for low income working families\".\n\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on BBC Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook , X , and Instagram , and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer .\n\nThe Greater Manchester Mayor presented the pontiff with the shirt during a Vatican visit in 2023.\n\nA Manchester taxi operator says drivers choose to get out-of-area licences due to speed and cost.\n\nChief Constable Stephen Watson will now remain at the Greater Manchester Police helm until May 2028.\n\nGreater Manchester's mayor wants new national laws to stop out-of-town taxi licensing.\n\nA number of disability-led organisations say they are considering \"stepping back\" from engaging with the government over benefit cuts\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Hooked on ketamine - Gen Z's drug of choice\n\nEvery generation seems to have an association with an illegal drug. Baby boomers had LSD, Gen X had pills and millennials had cocaine. So could ketamine be Gen Z's drug of choice?\n\nThe latest government figures show that the drug's usage among 16-24 year olds in England has tripled since 2016.\n\nCasey Innalls, a recovering addict from Portsmouth, never imagined her casual use of the substance in her teens would lead to a crippling addiction in adulthood.\n\n\"I was so hooked that I was in hospital for ketamine problems and I was sniffing ketamine in my hospital bed,\" she says.\n\nPaul Spanjar, the head of an addiction rehabilitation centre in Bournemouth, says: \"Last year we actually treated more ketamine users than every other drug put together.\"\n\nIllegal use of the drug has reached record levels in recent years , with an estimated 269,000 people aged 16-59 reporting ketamine use in the year ending March 2024.\n\nLast month, it was announced by the Home Office that ketamine could be upgraded to a Class A drug as the government seeks expert advice on its classification.\n\nMiss Innalls' first experience taking the drug was at 16 years old, in a setting familiar to most teens - a house party.\n\n\"I felt like I was walking on the moon,\" she says.\n\n\"I remember vividly walking up the stairs and my feet felt like they were just sinking.\n\n\"It's a totally different feeling to a lot of other drugs.\"\n\nAt 18 years old, her relationship with ketamine worsened, following the passing of her father.\n\n\"By 20 and 21, I was using it every single day. I started using it profusely, any event,\" she explains.\n\n\"It went from trying it, first time usage. Then at parties and festivals. Then I'd do it every weekend at the pub. Then I'd do it throughout the week and it became a regular occurrence for me.\n\n\"And yeah, it ruined my life.\"\n\nKetamine is widely used in the NHS as an anaesthetic, sedative and pain reliever, and is also commonly used on animals.\n\nIt usually comes as a crystalline powder or liquid. It is also thought of as a party drug due to its hallucinogenic effects.\n\nBut Miss Innalls' addiction led to a serious decline in her health.\n\nShe experienced so-called \"k-holes\" and \"k-cramps\", which are side effects of taking the drug in excess.\n\n\"I would cry whilst doing the substance, saying 'don't do it Casey, don't do it' and it felt like insanity, but I genuinely couldn't stop,\" she explains.\n\nUsing ketamine caused serious damage to her urinary system.\n\n\"I was weeing out the lining of my bladder and pure blood,\" she says.\n\nExperts are warning of an alarming increase in bladder issues among young people due to chronic ketamine use.\n\nAt 27, 11 years since she first tried ketamine, Miss Innalls decided it was time for professional help.\n\nWith support from her grandparents, she checked in to the Providence Projects in Bournemouth, an addiction rehabilitation centre.\n\nMr Spanjar, the centre's chief executive, has worked in rehabilitation for more than 23 years and described the growth of ketamine usage as an \"epidemic\".\n\n\"We used to see the odd person with a ketamine addiction 20 years ago but it was really, really rare.\n\n\"Last year we actually treated more ketamine users than every other drug put together.\n\n\"I've never seen a drug become so popular so quickly.\"\n\nThe latest figures from UK police back that up - forces say they seized 189% more ketamine in 2023 than in the year before.\n\nAnd Mr Spanjar acknowledged that like most drugs, culture and fashion played a role in the its growth.\n\n\"When things take off, there's a huge peer element in drug use, people will use what their friends use, so there is a snowball effect when we look at how many people are taking it.\"\n\nHowever, he thinks mental health issues are a bigger factor contributing towards its popularity.\n\n\"Ketamine is what's known as a dissociative,\" he says.\n\n\"We have a generation of young people who are so affected by anxiety, depression, loss of hope, fear of the future, and are carrying around this huge burden.\n\n\"The perceived effect of ketamine is that it takes away those feelings and stops people caring quite as much.\"\n\nHe explains the substance was also cheaper than others: \"Approximately a quarter of the price of cocaine\", and had \"less of a 'come-down' nature than other stimulants.\n\n\"In the beginning, so many people take ketamine because it feels like the answer.\n\n\"Unfortunately this isn't the story at the end.\"\n\nMiss Innalls had started taking illegal ketamine regularly because she wrongly believed it would help her mental health issues.\n\nBut like a lot of addicts, she eventually relied on it to help with physical pains caused by her usage.\n\n\"By the end I was sniffing it for a pain relief,\" she says.\n\n\"My routine was: I'd wake up, roll over, sniff a line.\n\n\"Go to the toilet, come back, sniff a line.\n\n\"Go to the toilet, go downstairs, make a green tea, go to the toilet, sniff a line.\n\n\"I'd then lay in bed in pain, so I'd sniff a line.\"\n\nAfter more than a decade of using ketamine, Miss Innalls has been in recovery for almost six months.\n\nShe has used TikTok to document her journey and support others who might find themselves in a similar situation.\n\n\"I just wanted to help people,\" she explains.\n\n\"I thought I was the only one struggling but there are so many people struggling and they don't even know where to go for help.\n\n\"I get a lot of young people reaching out to me - I get parents reaching out to me for advice.\n\n\"There's a massive stigma around ketamine. It isn't spoken about enough.\"\n\nIf you've been affected by any of the issues in this story you can find help and support via BBC Action Line here.\n\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook , X , or Instagram .\n\nWith the teams from third to seventh in the Premier League separated by just five points, the race to secure Champions League football next season is intensifying.\n\nRedlands Leisure and Community Park in Weymouth is owned by Dorset Council and run by Active Dorset.\n\nPlymouth-based frigate HMS St Albans monitored the Admiral Golovoko as it entered the Channel.\n\nPolice say the charges relate to an incident in Basingstoke on 24 February.\n\nStuart Nineham was arrested over his baby's death, but was set to be released without charge.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Winter fuel cut not easy choice, admits minister\n\nA cabinet minister has said restricting winter fuel payments does not \"sit easily\" with him, after estimates it would increase poverty among pensioners.\n\nTechnology Secretary Peter Kyle said the decision to restrict the £300 payment to all but the poorest pensioners this winter was made with a \"heavy heart\".\n\nBut he insisted the \"difficult\" decision was required to repair the public finances.\n\nIt comes after the government disclosed an official estimate that the move would push an extra 50,000 pensioners into poverty.\n\nIt says this figure does not account for its ongoing drive to increase take-up of pension credit among an estimated 880,000 eligible pensioners not currently claiming the top-up.\n\nWinter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount of £200 a year for pensioners under 80, increasing to £300 for over 80s, paid in November or December.\n\nIt was introduced in 1997 as a universal payment to reassure pensioners they would be able to heat their homes as temperatures drop, although in practice recipients can spend it on whatever they want.\n\nBut from this winter, it will be restricted to those who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, meaning around 9 million pensioners will no longer get it.\n\nIt did not feature in Labour's election manifesto and the move, announced three weeks after its return to power, caught many MPs by surprise.\n\nMinisters say means-testing the payment will save the Treasury £1.4bn this year and is required to help fix a \"black hole\" in the Tories' spending plans for this year identified by a specially-commissioned spending audit in July.\n\nScottish Labour has pledged to make the payment universal again if it forms the next Scottish government after elections in 2026.\n\nOverall state pensions went up 8.5% this year because the longstanding \"triple lock\" policy means payments were linked to rises in earnings.\n\nDespite requests from MPs, the government did not disclose its internal assessment of the impact of the policy when a law to implement it went through Parliament.\n\nIt prompted criticism from a House of Lords committee, which said the change was being introduced \"at a pace that does not permit appropriate scrutiny\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall told a Commons committee that her department estimated the move would lead to a 50,000 increase in the number of pensioners in relative poverty next year after housing costs.\n\nThis had been revised down from an estimate of 100,000 made \"at the time of the original policy decision,\" she added.\n\nThe figures are rounded to the nearest 50,000, with Kendall adding this meant \"small variations\" in the underlying numbers could \"lead to much larger changes in the rounded headline numbers\".\n\nThe government estimates 1.9 million pensioners - around 15% - are currently in relative poverty, meaning their income is 60% less than the median average.\n\nIt has estimated that around 880,000 pensioners who qualify for pension credit at the moment are not claiming it, and would therefore be eligible to continue to receive winter fuel payments if they did.\n\nThe government has estimated that means-testing winter fuel payments will save £1.4bn this year, based on around 100,000 pensioners out of those 880,000 coming forward to claim pension credit.\n\nThe Treasury has said the scale of the take-up is the main uncertainty when it comes to working out how much the measure will save.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Kyle said the government had been \"forced to take\" the decision \"because of the inheritance that we had from the previous administration\".\n\nHe added that the decision does not \"sit easily with me,\" adding: \"We didn't come into office to do these things.\n\n\"We do all of these tough decisions with a very heavy heart,\" he added.\n\nHis argument echoed that made by Kendall, who added the decision was not one \"this government wanted or expected to take\".\n\nHowever, some - though not all - Labour MPs privately believe in the merits of means-testing the benefit, questioning why the wealthiest pensioners should continue to receive it.\n\nSome believe that ministers should be more willing to argue for the decisions they have taken, as well as criticising their Conservative predecessors.\n\n\"We need to make more of a positive, proud case for what we're doing,\" one Labour MP said.\n\nIt is a sentiment shared over changes in the Budget to inheritance tax for farmers, which prompted protests in London on Tuesday .\n\nSome Labour MPs have been willing privately - though not publicly - to argue that it would be a good thing if the changes lead to a fall in the value of farmland.\n\nThat feeling was echoed in public by former Labour cabinet minister Jim Murphy, who told BBC Newsnight the party needed to \"make a more political argument\" about the government's policies.\n\nHe added that benefit rises linked to having children had gone up by less than pension payments, adding: \"Inequality is generational, and the generation that experiences it the most are the young\".\n\n\"Labour has often become a commentator about its own policy, rather than agitating for it,\" he added.\n\nThe government has set out more details about its proposed cuts to disability benefits.\n\nMinisters have been meeting Labour MPs worried about new restrictions to disability payments.\n\nIt could be some time before people know how they may be affected by the government's benefits overhaul.\n\nMeasures include restricting eligibility for disability payments and cutting benefits for health conditions.\n\nLiz Kendall: There is a Labour case for welfare reform\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Starfield creator on 'choice anxiety', long games and exclusive titles\n\n\"I had a moment of realisation of just how much we'd have to design, there's a lot of space in space!\"\n\nTodd Howard, game director of Skyrim and Fallout 4, is speaking to the BBC ahead of the launch of his most ambitious project to date.\n\nStarfield is a sprawling space epic, giving players the freedom to navigate the stars in search of action and adventure.\n\nHoward admits candidly that this new release, \"ended up being much larger than anything we've done. At times we thought, 'are we in over our heads?'\"\n\nIt's not surprising, given the scope of the game Howard and his team were aiming to create.\n\nStarfield promises players unrivalled freedom. As a member of a space exploration group trying to uncover the story of a mysterious artefact, players can choose to travel to more than a thousand different planets, customise their ships and weapons in an immeasurable number of ways and experience hundreds of different stories, missions and side-quests.\n\nBethesda Game Studios, established in Maryland, America, is well known for making role-playing games that players invest a lot of time in and Howard explains the vision for this title was for something \"that people are going to play for a long time.\"\n\nBut how long is too long?\n\nIt is a question that is often asked in gaming lobbies, Whatsapp chats or in pubs and coffee shops.\n\nAren't shorter, more focused and polished experiences the way forward? Do all modern titles need hundreds of hours worth of material? Doesn't that risk the inclusion of errors - all for the sake of providing untold options for players to choose between - when the majority of players won't access all the options?\n\nHoward isn't concerned: \"In my career I've found two things about people who play games. Often they do play one title for a really long time rather than moving on to something new.\n\n\"But even if they only play for 10 or 20 hours, finish the main story, save the world then move on, they'll have at least seen all the other choices that could have been taken. It means those 20 hours will be different for every player because they were exposed to so much choice - which impacted their appreciation of the story and experience.\"\n\nLong role-playing games that players can sink tens if not hundreds of hours of playing time into are currently re-emerging as the big trend in gaming.  This year the games which have impressed critics and audiences alike are titles like Hogwarts: Legacy, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur's Gate 3. All give the player countless options of quests and locations to explore at any given moment. Starfield is the latest.\n\nHoward's games are renowned for this style of gameplay, and Starfield is no different, even if he does acknowledge there are some drawbacks to this style of game design. \"At times I suffer from choice anxiety,\" he admits.\n\n\"But options are what I think keeps a game going in your head.  When you put it down, you start thinking about when you can pick it back up? What am I going to do next? Or when you get distracted by choices in a game, and the hours go by, that's when I start feeling good about a game I'm making.\n\n\"Things are always a bit of a mess during development, but you know things are starting to gel together when you go in to test something, and it's late in the day and you've got to finish up soon, and you start playing. Next thing you know, three hours have gone by and you're like 'oh my, I didn't even know!'\n\n\"That's when I start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and I know we're on to something.\"\n\nMany of the concepts seen in Starfield have been explored in games before and comparisons with titles such as No Man's Sky have already been made. However, the promise of this freedom to explore space coupled with Bethesda Games Studio's legacy of storytelling is what made Starfield one of the most hotly anticipated releases of 2023.\n\nThe reaction so far has been broadly positive, with the review aggregator site Metacritic giving the game 87 out of 100 . In his review for IGN, which scored the game seven out of 10 , Dan Stapleton argues that the \"combination of disjointed space travel, non-existent maps and a slow rollout of essential abilities very nearly did it in. It was the joys piloting a custom spaceship into and out of all sorts of morally ambiguous situations in a rich sci-fi universe that eventually pulled it out of a nosedive.\"\n\nIn The Video Games Chronicle, Jordan Middler scored the game five out of five saying, \"The sense of wonder, adventure, and possibility is an intoxicating trick that never wore off.\"\n\nScoring it seven out of ten , Michael Higham, writing in Games Spot, argues that: \"Bethesda's spacefaring adventure has its moments with impressive scale and satisfying combat... but its uninspired vision of the cosmos make for a journey that's a mile wide, but an inch deep.\"\n\nOther publications, like The Guardian, Eurogamer and Kotaku, whose reviews are highly regarded, have been unable to fully analyse the title yet because of a dispute over when they received a copy of the game to try.\n\nWe sat down to speak with Howard before this was public knowledge,\n\nThis release is an important moment for Microsoft and especially its Xbox console. As an exclusive title, bosses hope it will draw more players to choose their machine over main rival the PlayStation 5.\n\nDespite many of the world's most popular titles being cross-platform, Howard argues that exclusives like this still have a place in the industry: \"When you're making something exclusive then the more you can focus.\n\n\"You know this is the hardware or the thing people are playing on, so the ability to focus on that always yields a better product.

OC&C Strategy Consultants found that products awarded the Choice label see a sales jump of about 300%.\n\nThis is partly because anyone using their Amazon Echo smart speaker to buy products in a category in which they have never shopped before, will get a product bearing the Choice label.\n\n\"We are concerned the badge is assigned in an arbitrary manner, or worse, based on fraudulent product reviews,\" wrote Democrats Bob Menendez and Richard Blumenthal.\n\nA lack of transparency about Amazon Choice means consumers were prevented from making \"informed choices\", they said.\n\nThe senators want answers about the process behind Choice and whether the products in the category are ever checked by people to ensure they are not faulty or badly made.\n\nMr Menendez told Buzzfeed he wanted a \"full and robust\" answer to the queries in the letter. This could prompt a further call to Amazon to change the way Choice products are picked, he said.\n\n\"Or we force it to change by some federal regulatory agency or by some legislation,\" he added.\n\nIn a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said: \"Amazon invests significant resources to protect the integrity of reviews in our store because we know customers value the insights and experiences shared by fellow shoppers.\"\n\nIt said it used both human investigators and automatic tools to find and remove fake reviews.

The state has long had a policy of open enrollment, allowing any family to apply to any of the state's public schools, and it still has a nation-leading percentage of students attending charter schools.\n\nShe remembers vividly the public school teachers who worked tirelessly to teach Jordan when he was younger, marveling at the talent and commitment they displayed. But when the family had to move, or when his teachers moved on, her experience navigating the system and finding the right fit for a son who's struggled with developmental and emotional challenges felt like being in a frustrating bureaucratic maze, she says.\n\nWhat does freedom look like when it comes to education? In Arizona, supporters of a new law say it means giving families the choice to use tax dollars to attend any school that fits them best. Defenders of traditional public schools say freedom was already baked in - in the form of equality.\n\n\"Sometimes they fight the parents, and when they're fighting the parents, the freedom to find an appropriate education for your child is a luxury only for the rich,\" Ms. Visser says.\n\nOn a desert-hot day in August, however, she's standing with Jordan in a modest stable of horses at the private school where she was able to send her son, using funds from an education savings account that Arizona calls \"empowerment scholarships.\" The school, The H.E.A.R.T. Center in Glendale, is a 16-student \"microschool\" that combines equine therapy and personalized instruction, and her son, now 18, has flourished here, both of them say.\n\n\"Arizona is a lot more free when it comes to parent-directed education,\" says Ms. Visser, who taught public school herself in the mid-1990s, when she lived in Colorado and worked with lower-income students in some of the state's outlying rural districts.\n\nHer experiences have made her a vocal advocate for a nationwide movement its supporters now hail as \"education freedom,\" a relatively new label in conservative education circles for a movement of controversial ideas and education policies that have mostly been known as \"school choice.\"\n\nMs. Visser was among the first to participate in Arizona's Empowerment Scholarship Account program nearly a decade ago, when it was limited to families with kids with certain challenges or those enrolled in public schools the state deemed failing.\n\nBut in July, Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed a major, universal expansion of this scholarship program, which he and supporters around the country are calling \"the gold standard for educational freedom.\"\n\n\"Today we're taking additional action to ensure that every Arizona student can attend any school of their choosing,\" Governor Ducey told a raucous crowd of supporters in August, at a ceremonial signing at Phoenix Christian Preparatory School, one of the state's largest and longest-running private evangelical schools.\n\n\"There is no one-size-fits-all model to education,\" he continued. \"Kids and families should have access to the school or learning program that best fits their unique needs, regardless of income. ... Misguided special-interest groups will try to tell you that this legislation will diminish our public education system. They couldn't be more wrong. Public education means educating the public.\"\n\nThis redefinition of public education is intentional, and Arizona has in many ways become not only a leading laboratory for school choice ideas that have simmered in U.S. education for over half a century, but also a battleground in which traditional ideas in public education are clashing with a movement by religious conservatives to bring taxpayer funding to private education.\n\nThis decadeslong movement has found momentum after a series of Supreme Court decisions that paved the way for states to fund private religious schools. Florida, Idaho, Indiana, West Virginia, and other conservative states have also worked to expand programs to help support private and religious schools with state funding.\n\nControversies over curriculum, especially when it comes to race and human sexuality, have fueled these efforts. And a growing number of parents around the country, frustrated with pandemic restrictions and state bureaucracies, have begun to lose confidence in their public schools. In a June 2022 poll , Gallup found that only 13% of Republicans and 43% of Democrats have \"a great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in U.S. public schools.\n\nAs a result, many have become attracted to an understanding of freedom that includes a model of education pluralism, supporting state funding for a wide variety of schools that could in turn send an innovative jolt through American education.\n\n\"I believe this program and ones like it across the country are going to revolutionize education in the U.S.,\" Ms. Visser says of Arizona's approach. \"It will give immediate access to educational options for students and bring accountability to our public education in a way that will improve the entire system in ways that are not possible now.\"\n\nOpponents of Arizona's new law, however, have a very different understanding of the meaning of freedom when it comes to universal education.\n\nOn another unusually hot and humid August day, Rachel Clawson is canvassing a neighborhood in East Mesa, near Phoenix, asking residents there to sign a petition to put the state's expanded school choice program on a voter referendum.\n\nAnd if Ms. Clawson and a well-organized coalition of union members, teachers, and other parents can collect about 119,000 signatures before Sept. 24, the state's effort to provide universal support for all Arizona schools will be put to a majority vote.\n\nIt's already too late to put such a measure on the 2022 ballot, however. So the law would remain in limbo until voters potentially have a say in 2024.\n\nThese opponents have a sense of optimism. In 2017, the Arizona legislature passed a similar universal voucher bill, but opponents then collected enough signatures to put that measure on the ballot. Arizona voters overwhelmingly rejected it by a 2-to-1 margin.\n\nUntil recently, Ms. Clawson taught high school history and government at her hometown alma mater. Now a mother of three kids, she's turned her career toward education advocacy, and she's now a staff member with Save Our Schools, the group spearheading the signature collection campaign.\n\n\"Education is the bedrock of democracy,\" she says. \"It's the bedrock of our economy. And now we're taking taxpayer dollars, funds from public schools, and putting them into systems that are not transparent and for which there's no academic accountability tied to them.\"\n\nMs. Clawson believes that Arizona's voucher measures will only siphon more taxpayer dollars from an already struggling and underfunded public school system. Arizona ranks near the bottom of both the country's spending per student and the amount it pays teachers. Heading into the new school year, Arizona had about 2,000 general teacher vacancies and more than 800 special education teacher openings, according to a survey last month by the Arizona School Personnel Administrators Association.\n\n\"My kids are in public schools, and I see teachers leaving,\" Ms. Clawson says. \"And I mean, I have three kids under the age of 9, and I'm just like, what is that going to mean for my kids' future that we can't seem to keep teachers?\"\n\nArizona's public schools, like most around the country, are funded through a combination of federal, state, and local taxes. The state plans to pay for its Empowerment Scholarship Account program by transferring 90% of the state funding portion that a public school receives for each student, providing up to $7,000 for families that opt out of the system.\n\nThe program will weaken the state's public schools, say members of the Arizona Education Association, a teachers union. Those schools serve the vast majority of Arizona's students, over 1.1 million. If the program goes into effect, over 66,000 students who attend one of the state's private or religious schools will now qualify for a $7,000 scholarship.\n\n\"You can talk about red tape and bureaucracy, but you can also talk about rules and rights,\" says Jack Schneider, associate professor of education at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. \"And if you say that your goal is just to free everybody so that they can pursue their own interests in a free market, what you're also saying there is that we're going to pull down the rules that we have collectively established, that we had democratically established.\n\n\"And so when you do peel back those rules and those rights, is that freedom that people are left with?\" he continues. \"For some it will be, but it will be the freedom to dominate the weak and the less privileged and the marginalized.\"\n\nIn many ways, the entire ethos of American public education from the start has been rooted in an idea of freedom that emphasizes equality, supporters say.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the civic vision of Horace Mann, a Massachusetts reformer who helped establish the nation's first statewide, taxpayer-funded education system, saw public education as \"the great equalizer of the conditions of men, the balance wheel of the social machinery.\"\n\n\"School is a place - and it's one of the few places that we have - to try to help young people learn the kinds of ideas and practices that are compatible with a multiracial modern democracy, where there are lots of different kinds of people who also need to be included,\" says Professor Schneider, who with Jennifer Berkshire co-wrote the book \"A Wolf at the Schoolhouse Door: The Dismantling of Public Education and the Future of School.\"\n\nIndeed, one of the biggest issues that those on the left have with taxpayer-funded vouchers for private schools, and with the school choice movement in general, is the fact that the vast majority of private schools are religiously sectarian, and maintain the freedom to exclude LGBTQ students and others.\n\n\"They don't believe that LGBTQ people belong at their schools to teach or to learn,\" says Jeanne Casteen, a former public school teacher now running for the Arizona Senate, speaking at an August Save the Schools rally in front of the teachers union headquarters in Phoenix. \"And this means we have state-sanctioned discrimination against our kids and our teachers.\"\n\nJeff Blake, the superintendent of Phoenix Christian Preparatory School, says it was pretty exciting when Governor Ducey chose one of Arizona's longest-serving Christian schools to host the event for the state's new universal voucher bill.\n\nThe governor's office had been looking for success stories to highlight some of Arizona's education initiatives, and nearly 96% of Phoenix Christian's students have a significant part of their tuition paid by a \"school tuition organization,\" another financial strategy that school choice thinkers created to indirectly channel funding to private schools.\n\nIn Arizona, anyone who donates to such an organization gets a dollar-for-dollar tax credit, while these organizations then relay these donations to private school tuition. The Supreme Court declared such tuition programs constitutional in 2020.\n\nBut in many ways, the governor's choice to celebrate the new law at the school reflects the fact that the school choice movement has been dominated by a coalition of religious conservatives going back at least a half-century, scholars say, when private Christian academies began to proliferate after the desegregation of public schools in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThose who promote the ideas of education freedom often note that their vision contains a more pluralistic understanding of education. Instead of seeing the classroom as a \"common,\" nonsectarian civic space, advocates believe religious education should be understood as part of a larger American tapestry of different kinds of schools.\n\nBut this brand of education pluralism, built into the idea of school choice, had a surprising and transforming effect on Phoenix Christian, a theologically conservative evangelical institution.\n\n\"There's been a radical shift of paradigm,\" Superintendent Blake says. \"About the same time that the [school tuition organizations] came about, that was about the same time Phoenix Christian took the initial steps in becoming a missional Christian school - that is, a family did not have to adhere to our statement of faith to attend.\"\n\nIn many ways, this only sharpened the school's identity as an unapologetically Christ-centered school, he says, and in interviews with prospective families, they explain their emphasis on chapel, Bible study, and their code of Christian ethics, including a view of human sexuality in which any sex outside a marriage of a man and woman, whether heterosexual or homosexual, is outside God's plan.\n\nHe doubts whether families with LGBTQ students would be comfortable in such an environment. \"But as long as you're aware of that, and are comfortable with that, we're able to enter into a covenant relationship and work together to build a Christ-centered school.\"\n\nThe shift to understanding itself as a mission school open to the community, too, began to transform it from within.\n\n\"When I first started here 27 years ago, the majority of the kids, the vast majority, were Caucasian, and generally coming from upper-middle-class or upper-class families,\" Mr. Blake says. \"You fast-forward to today, we're a school of no majority.\"\n\n\"There's kids piling out of city buses and kids piling out of Mercedes in our parking lot, and now they're coming from every corner of the city,\" he continues. \"And we really think that's part of our unique calling, too, in a world that's kind of tearing itself apart. Here at school, where we build a Christ-centered environment, we seek to pursue unity, both racial and socioeconomic.\"\n\nThe governor's visit to Phoenix Christian included a coalition of Black faith leaders and community activists as well, including Janelle Wood, founder of the Black Mothers Forum in Phoenix, who spoke during the August event.\n\n\"As a concerned Black mother, I want to make sure that we are heard loud and clear from this day forth,\" she said. \"We matter, our children matter, and we're not going anywhere. We're going to keep speaking to each system that holds our families back and our children back.\"\n\nDenise Ceballos Viner, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who is running for the Phoenix City Council, became a vocal supporter for Arizona's school choice policies because she felt the public schools serving Black and Latino communities in the Phoenix area were failing.\n\nShe sent each of her six daughters to public schools, but she says she used the address of a family member in a different district to send her two oldest daughters to better schools.\n\nThat was before Arizona began to pass its school choice initiatives, including a statewide open enrollment policy, which allows any Arizona family to enroll in any public school. \"The majority of people that believe in school choice don't want public schools to be shut down. We just want to hold them accountable for the teaching failures that have been happening for decades,\" Ms. Ceballos Viner says.\n\nPrivate Catholic schools have served poorer urban communities for over a century, says Christine Accurso, another parent of a child with learning challenges who's been organizing parents to fight for the state's voucher expansion. She's also been organizing families to rally against the Save Our Schools effort to gather enough signatures.\n\n\"When we have freedom, and a parent gets to choose, we will look sincerely at what's happening in our public schools, district, or charters, and see if that's what we want for our children,\" Ms. Accurso says. \"And if it's working for them? Awesome, don't move that child. But if it's not working for them, then they can take a path that they know their child deserves.\n\n\"What I'm saying is, the world is a better place when the parent of a child, the mom and dad of a child, are freely directing 100% of a child's education,\" she continues. \"And a lot of parents can't do that because they can't afford something else outside the government-paid schools.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

That makes no sense in the narrow rationality often used in economic models, and some evidence suggests it might not actually be true.\n\nLoading...\n\nJuly 19, 2012, 12:00 p.m. ET\n\nDoes your brain freeze when offered too many options? Do you put off repainting your bathroom because you can't bear to select among fifty shades of white (or, for the more adventurous, grey)?\n\nIf so, take heart. A famous experiment by psychologists Mark Lepper and Sheena Iyengar, published in 2000, suggests that you are not alone. In supermarket tests, they documented what's known as the Paradox of Choice. Customers offered an array of six new jam varieties were much more likely to buy one than those offered a choice of 24.\n\nThat makes no sense in the narrow sense of rationality often used in simple economic models. More choice should always lead to more sales, since the odds are greater that a shopper will find something they want. But it didn't. On those days, in those supermarkets, with those jams, more choice meant less buying.\n\nThis result resonates with many people. I certainly behave that way occasionally. With limited time and cognitive energy, I sometimes avoid or defer choices that I don't absolutely need to make ... like buying a new jam. Making decisions is hard. Just as consumers have financial budget constraints, so too do we have decision-making budget constraints.\n\nToday's TED Blog provides links and, naturally, videos for a series of studies documenting similar challenges of choice, from retirement planning to health care to spaghetti sauce. All well worth a view.\n\nBut how general are these results? Perhaps not as much as we'd think from the TED talks . A few years ago, Tim Harford , the Financial Times' Undercover Economist, noted that some subsequent studies in the jam tradition failed to find this effect:\n\nIt is hard to find much evidence that retailers are ferociously simplifying their offerings in an effort to boost sales. Starbucks boasts about its \"87,000 drink combinations\"; supermarkets are packed with options. This suggests that \"choice demotivates\" is not a universal human truth, but an effect that emerges under special circumstances.\n\nBenjamin Scheibehenne, a psychologist at the University of Basel , was thinking along these lines when he decided (with Peter Todd and, later, Rainer Greifeneder) to design a range of experiments to figure out when choice demotivates, and when it does not.\n\nBut a curious thing happened almost immediately. They began by trying to replicate some classic experiments - such as the jam study, and a similar one with luxury chocolates. They couldn't find any sign of the \"choice is bad\" effect. Neither the original Lepper-Iyengar experiments nor the new study appears to be at fault: the results are just different and we don't know why.\n\nAfter designing 10 different experiments in which participants were asked to make a choice, and finding very little evidence that variety caused any problems, Scheibehenne and his colleagues tried to assemble all the studies, published and unpublished, of the effect.\n\nThe average of all these studies suggests that offering lots of extra choices seems to make no important difference either way. There seem to be circumstances where choice is counterproductive but, despite looking hard for them, we don't yet know much about what they are. Overall, says Scheibehenne: \"If you did one of these studies tomorrow, the most probable result would be no effect.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nIn short, the Paradox of Choice is experiencing the infamous Decline Effect. As Jonah Lehrer noted in the New Yorker in late 2010, sometimes what seems to be scientific truth \"wears off\" over time. And not just in \"soft\" sciences like the intersection of psychology and economics, but in biology and medicine as well.\n\nSome of that decline reflects selection pressures in research and publishing ... and invitations to give TED talks. It's easy to get a paper published if it documents a new a paradox or anomaly. Only after that claim has gained some mindshare does the marketplace then open to research showing null results of no paradox.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

All are from low-income households and receive $7,826 through the state's education savings account program.\n\nWith funding available for private school tuition, parents quickly signed up their children for Dream Academy's smaller class sizes and faith-based curriculum. Demand outpaced leadership's initial plan to start with only 30 students.\n\nVoters rejected a trio of school choice ballot measures in November. But momentum seems anything but stalled, especially with an advocate returning to Washington.\n\n\"For them, it's a slam dunk. It's like, 'Praise the Lord!'\" says Robert Kimble, executive director and head of school.\n\nIt's too soon to say whether the growing school choice shift toward private options has improved academic outcomes, especially for the nation's most vulnerable students. The coming months, however, could set the tone for the movement's future, as well as its effect on public schools in the United States.\n\nState legislative sessions are ramping up, and President-elect Donald Trump is returning to the White House. He hasn't shied away from supporting private school choice - even hinting at a federal effort to expand it. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump and his allies have embarked on a mission to lessen federal involvement in other areas of education, such as dismantling the Department of Education.\n\nPublic perception is more difficult to pin down. In November, voters in three states - Kentucky, Colorado, and Nebraska - rejected school choice-related ballot measures. But parents are increasingly signaling that they want more flexibility.\n\nA poll released last week by the National Parents Union found that 71% of parents support using state public funding to send their children to whatever education setting they deem the best fit - a public school, private school, homeschool, or religious school. A majority of parents also think schools receiving any form of government funding should not be allowed to discriminate on the basis of age, race, gender, sexuality, and abilities.\n\nNearly three dozen states already have passed some form of private school choice , such as voucher programs, education savings accounts, or tax credit scholarships. And a dozen states offer a universal program, meaning families, regardless of income, can access public funds for private options. That expansion is likely to continue.\n\n\"Texas is still a bit of a wild card, but I think you'll see continued efforts, especially in Republican-leading states,\" says Douglas N. Harris, professor of economics and director of the National Center for Research on Education Access and Choice at Tulane University.\n\nNebraska voters repealed a program, passed by state lawmakers earlier that year, that allocated $10 million toward scholarships for students to attend a private school. In neighboring Colorado, voters rejected an amendment that would have enshrined school choice in the state constitution. And further east, Kentucky voters shot down a measure that would have allowed public tax dollars to flow toward private or charter schools.\n\nLiz Cohen, policy director of FutureEd at Georgetown University, cautions against viewing the ballot outcomes as a bellwether for the school choice movement. Policymaking in state legislatures might just be easier to accomplish than direct votes at the ballot box.\n\n\"Most families send their kids to their neighborhood public schools, and most of them are more or less satisfied with that,\" she says. \"So they don't have a lot of incentive to vote for something that they likely have been told is going to threaten the thing that they're already satisfied with.\"\n\nIn Nebraska, families that received money through the state's private school scholarship program are on the hunt for a new source. That includes Katie and John Zach, whose four oldest children attend a Catholic elementary school in Lincoln.\n\nMs. Zach says the money has been a lifeline. She's a stay-at-home mother, and her husband teaches at a Catholic high school. Given the family's modest budget, she says the state scholarship funding made it less financially perilous to give their children a private Catholic education.\n\n\"We didn't have to choose between repairing our fridge last month or continuing to be able to let our kids go to this school, sign up for basketball - whatever it may be,\" she says.\n\nThe program's repeal could catalyze a new approach to bring back private school choice, says Jeremy Ekeler, executive director of Opportunity Scholarships of Nebraska.\n\n\"It has been very much a policy and legislative battle,\" he says. \"I think we're going to see a lot more grassroots parent advocacy.\"\n\nThe policy battle, however, could also make its way to Washington.\n\nDuring President-elect Trump's first term in office, his education secretary, Betsy DeVos, championed the so-called Education Freedom Scholarship. The $5 billion proposal would have awarded tax credits to businesses or individuals who donated a portion of their taxable income to organizations providing scholarships. It never gained enough traction in Congress. Now Republicans have full control of the U.S. House and Senate.\n\nMr. Trump referenced reviving a federal attempt while announcing Linda McMahon, co-founder and former president of World Wrestling Entertainment, as his next education secretary. In a Truth Social post , he wrote that \"Linda will fight tirelessly to expand 'Choice' to every State in America.\"\n\nIf successful, the simultaneous expansion of the federal government's role related to private schools and contraction of the Education Department would dramatically alter the tapestry of America's  public education system as it exists today.\n\n\"Those two things are in tension with each other, so it'll be interesting to see whether they just kind of ignore that and are so determined to expand private school choice, that they do it anyway,\" Dr. Harris says.\n\nSchool choice supporters and opponents will be keeping a close eye on Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott has expressed confidence about the votes needed to pass a voucher-style program this year. The reliably red state's Legislature has resisted launching any such program, largely because of rural Republicans' opposition. In tiny towns across the Lone Star State, the public school is the bedrock of the community.\n\nIf North Carolina is any indication, state lawmakers hold considerable power over this issue.\n\nIn September, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed a bill that would have ramped up funding for private school vouchers, which do not have an income cap. Governor Cooper decried the expanded funding in his veto letter . He described it as a \"scheme\" that lacked accountability and would hurt public schools, especially in rural areas.\n\nBut the Republican-dominated state legislature overrode his veto in November, sending $463 million toward the Opportunity Scholarship program.\n\nIn Florida, the price tag has been even higher. The Education Law Center and Florida Policy Institute estimate private school vouchers are costing the Sunshine State $3.9 billion this school year. Many of those students were already enrolled in private schools.\n\nThe proliferation of taxpayer-funded choice programs has also put a squeeze on the private education marketplace.\n\nThe Drexel Fund, a grantmaking organization, is playing a behind-the-scenes role in the movement as \"demand from families outstrips the supply of private school seats,\" says Mark Gleason, managing partner. It helps aspiring education entrepreneurs launch or expand private schools that primarily enroll students from underserved communities.\n\nSince its founding in 2015, the organization has funded more than 23,000 private school seats, including those at the Dream Academy. Mr. Gleason says they are actively working in a dozen states, mostly those that have a voucher or education savings account program. The Drexel Fund expects to grow that number to 20.\n\nBack in Iowa, the Dream Academy's students and staff have returned from winter break. Mr. Kimble says the smaller class sizes - 10 to 15 students - are reducing behavioral problems and increasing learning time. He hopes that's a recipe to erase long-standing racial achievement gaps and end poverty cycles.\n\n\"Let's see what we can do,\" he says. \"Let's do something different.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The film is now in theaters.\n\nLoading...\n\nFeb. 05, 2016, 11:42 a.m. ET\n\n\"The Choice,\" the latest film based on a novel by author Nicholas Sparks, is now in theaters.\n\n\"Choice\" stars Benjamin Walker of \"In the Heart of the Sea\" and \"Point Break\" actress Teresa Palmer. The film tells the story of Travis (Walker), who is working to become a veterinarian, and a woman, Gabby (Palmer), who is a medical student and who moves in next door. The two soon hit it off.\n\nThe film co-stars Tom Wilkinson, Alexandra Daddario, Tom Welling, and Maggie Grace.\n\nCritics are far from won over by the film, with Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times calling it \"a mediocre, well-photographed, undeniably heart-tugging, annoyingly manipulative and dramatically predictable star-crossed romance,\" while Variety writer Andrew Barker called it \"the latest, and quite possibly worst, tissue-thin weepie to issue forth from the Nicholas Sparks page-to-screen assembly line ... 'The Choice,' which mimics [fellow Sparks movie adaptation] 'The Notebook' in everything but meaningful conflict, believable characters, style and emotional honesty, is a very unsuccessful story.\"\n\nMeanwhile, New York Times writer Jeanette Catsoulis called it \"almost repellently synthetic.\"\n\n\"Choice\" is the eleventh movie to be adapted from a Sparks film. What makes these adaptations work?\n\nSmart scheduling may be one factor. While Sparks' biggest hit, the 2004 film \"The Notebook,\" came out during the summer, his other highest-grossing films, 2010's \"Dear John\" and \"Safe Haven,\" came out around Valentine's Day (\"Haven\" came out on the day itself), most likely the time when audiences would be looking for a romantic film.\n\n(In the last few years, those releasing Sparks movies have no doubt learned to stick to the Valentine's Day release time, as the lowest-grossing movies based on Sparks books, 2014's \"The Best of Me\" and 2015's \"The Longest Ride,\" came out in October and April, respectively.)\n\nDeadline writer Nikki Finke noted the success of \"John\" at this release time, calling the movie's opening weekend gross \"much bigger than expected,\" while Los Angeles Times writer Ben Fritz wrote that \"'Dear John' rode a surprisingly strong wave of support.\"\n\nWhat else makes the Sparks movies a success? Female moviegoers. Fritz noted that the opening weekend success of \"John\" was due \"almost entirely to a single demographic: teen and college-age girls.\" The opening weekend crowd was 84 percent female.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Washington Post writer Emily Yahr writes that \"Sparks's formula plays into the viewing public's desire for comfortable predictability ... with a twist. In each of his works, Sparks reels you in with the ultimate relatable theme - love! - and sprinkles in just enough surprises that no two are ever the same. At this point, seeing a Nicholas Sparks movie is like listening to a remake of an old song: You know all the beats, but it's just different enough to keep your attention.\"\n\nWith that release date that's close to Valentine's Day, if recent history is any indication, \"Choice\" could be another box office hit.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The pandemic has only exacerbated that, but it may also be clarifying a fundamental choice lurking behind the public vs. private debate: whether we're going to let parents fail - because if parents fail, life becomes much harder for children.\n\nI've written about my working-class father , who spent nearly 40 years at the United States Postal Service. Now, it's time to tell you about my working-class mom, whose career in education spans four decades.\n\nAs most teachers will tell you, they don't just have their biological kids. They nurture hundreds or even thousands of kids over many years. That was certainly true of my mom, who used to give her students peanut butter and cheese crackers before a standardized test, along with a rhyme for the times:\n\nBust the test. Bust the test, baby. Bust that test, Ain't no maybe. Bust the test.\n\nBust the test, baby. You can do it. You can do it. You can bust that test!\n\nBehind the clamor about school choice lies a fundamental issue affecting parents and their children: poverty. Listening past the noise could refocus attention on something far more important than where kids go to school.\n\nMy mom's rhyme was cool, but those crackers represented her conscientiousness. I can't help but wonder how many of her students - her other kids - had those crackers as their first meal of the day.\n\nAs much as we talk about politics and preference in education, we are missing a key component: poverty.\n\nBack in 1999, my mom took a job as a teacher specialist in Allendale, South Carolina. She was part of a state-based takeover that lasted from 1999 to 2007, initiated by then-State Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum due to poor academic performance. It's worth mentioning that Allendale County isn't just one of the poorest school districts (and counties) in South Carolina - it's one of the poorest in America.\n\nAccording to census data, Allendale County has a median household income of $24,560, which is below the poverty threshold of $26,200 for a family of four, based on Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.\n\nThe state of South Carolina took over the school district again in 2017 due to the same concerns, but it's worth asking, Is the problem strictly academics? Could another force be at work?\n\nIt could be argued that South Carolina's state government had failed the residents of Allendale County long before it took over their schools, due to its neglect of this rural community. Ideally, education should provide a level playing field for children, regardless of race, gender, or their parents' wealth.\n\nThe reality is different - and dire. How can we expect kids to succeed on standardized tests when their stomachs are rumbling?\n\nYet a hungry belly isn't the only sign of failing infrastructure in education.\n\nLast month, a photo of two children with their computers in front of a Taco Bell went viral. What were they doing? Using the restaurant's Wi-Fi to do their homework.\n\nThe photo reignited discussion about the \"digital divide\" in America. Reports indicate that nearly 16 million kids in K-12 public schools don't have adequate internet connections.\n\nThat divide was especially glaring for the kids in front of Taco Bell, because they were within an hour of Silicon Valley, a tech mecca. Luis Alejo, the county supervisor, retweeted the photo and challenged state officials to create a universal broadband infrastructure bond for students. \"Salinas Valley is 45 minutes from Silicon Valley,\" he told CNN, \"and here we have such a huge divide that's gone on for years but now it's only amplified because of this pandemic.\"\n\nThe girls and their family were eventually given a mobile hotspot, and fundraising efforts yielded a six-figure sum. That type of charity shows the goodness of people. Still, what do we do about the other children suffering through disparities in access?\n\nFinding stopgaps in educational inequities will require good faith discussions about public and private education. Public and private options shouldn't be seen as competitors, but as complements. Yet those conversations get muddied when governments act in bad faith.\n\nMore than 20 years after the state of South Carolina took over Allendale County's school district the first time, Gov. Henry McMaster dedicated $32 million (of $48 million) in CARES education relief for private schools. Dr. Thomasena Adams, a retired South Carolina public school educator, rebuked Mr. McMaster's move in a lawsuit, stating: \"These subsidies and payments to private schools purport to assist about five thousand students in the State of South Carolina. There are over eight hundred thousand students in public schools in the State of South Carolina.\"\n\nWhat Governor McMaster billed as a \"school choice\" option felt like a deliberate transfer of public school funding to private education. In a state and country with clear disparities in education, the move appeared insensitive.\n\nYet Mr. McMaster's ideology regarding school choice is in lockstep with the current administration and its education secretary, Betsy DeVos. It's out of step, however, with the National Education Association, the largest labor union and interest group for public school teachers and staff in the country, whose website flatly condemns the administration.\n\nThe evidence is damning, but it's also heartbreaking. What's happening in education reflects what's happening in our country. Our inability to address the fundamental issues behind the polarizing politics leaves us with perpetually bad choices.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Our columnist argues that rather than getting caught up in the school choice debate, what parents really want is the best education for their children.\n\nLoading...\n\nOct. 10, 2023, 3:11 p.m. ET\n\nThe story of an anti-school choice Chicago Teachers Union president who sent her son to private school understandably generated political backlash. As a parent who sees the viability of both public and private schools, Stacy Davis Gates' decision made me think about the past and the present.\n\nThe first time I stepped into a schoolhouse, it was in preschool at the Minnie Palmore House, a private institution established by one of South Carolina's great Black educators. A short time later, in kindergarten, I attended Clara E. Jenkins Elementary, located in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Augusta, Georgia. Hyde Park, which shares the name of a well-known neighborhood in Chicago, was later found to be in a toxic hotbed .\n\nMy early childhood experiences in education were relative to my parents' availability, which is why I largely ended up alongside my mother in public school from first grade until I graduated high school. Conversations about \"school choice\" end up pitting public schools against private institutions, but I find that parents don't care about those logistics nearly as much as they just want the best educational opportunities for their children.\n\nIdeally, public and private classrooms should represent a frontier for equality, explains Patricia Lynch, who retired in the past decade as an educator in Chicago Public Schools after a 31-year career.\n\n\"Personally, I like school choice. I don't think it has to be a conflict,\" Ms. Lynch says. \"Public schools need to have quality programs in place in all schools to keep students from wanting to leave for a private school.\"\n\nMs. Lynch, who not only taught in the district, but was raised and taught in Chicago's public schools, lamented the school system's segregated history - and present.\n\n\"Historically, Chicago public schools have been segregated and Black students haven't received a quality education,\" Ms. Lynch says. \"Black students are more severely disciplined and suspended from school at a higher rate than their white peers. Even with the opening of selective enrollment schools, these schools are in wealthier white neighborhoods. ... Poor black students are left in their neighborhood schools with less funding and resources.\"\n\nChicago's history of disparities is well documented , including an 1863 city ordinance requiring Black and white students to attend separate schools and more recently a significant amount of displacement among Black students when 50 city schools were closed a decade ago. Of the schools shuttered in 2013, according to an article from South Side Weekly, \"forty-two had a population that was greater than 75 percent Black, and 88 percent of the students affected by the school closures were Black.\"\n\nWhen we pit public schools versus private schools and other alternative education options, the reality is that separate is not equal, and further, separation as it relates to education in this country has always meant unequal. The beginning of unity is a mutual understanding that we should provide opportunities for families whose ambitions may not fit what their neighborhood school has to offer, but we should similarly ensure that such options come about after exploring and emphasizing the richness of our public schools.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nI choose to send my children to private school, with the understanding that taxpayers can and should fully fund public education. I send my children to a Christian school as a matter of preference, but opportunities for exemplary education should be available to all. When my children interact with their public school peers, my hope remains that all of them are on the fast track to successful lives.\n\nWhen it comes to race, as well as how we treat the poor in comparison to the rich, such unity is not just a choice we should make in our schools. It's a decision we must make in this country as a whole.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

It comprised just six words, from a former comedian and television actor who, in an extraordinary career change, had become the president of Ukraine.\n\nForty-eight hours earlier, Volodymyr Zelenskyy's country had suffered a full-scale Russian invasion aimed at eliminating both him and an independent Ukraine. His key ally, America, was offering to evacuate him so he could lead the resistance from abroad.\n\nThe obvious response seemed a grateful \"yes.\" Russia was pushing tens of thousands of troops across the border, and had many more tanks, missiles, and aircraft than Ukraine could muster.\n\nInstead, Mr. Zelenskyy turned Washington down, with a reply that set the tone for Ukraine's fortitude. \"I need ammunition, not a ride.\"\n\nThat same sense of clarity distinguished the even more unlikely protagonist in the year's other bookend moment, which involved the inquiry into the Jan. 6, 2021 mob assault on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson had been in her mid-20s, just out of college. But after interning on Capitol Hill and in Donald Trump's White House, she'd become the top aide to his chief-of-staff, Mark Meadows.\n\nShe is now known to millions of Americans. Her public testimony made her the Jan. 6 inquiry's star witness to what was going on at the highest levels in the White House before, during, and after the attack on the Capitol.\n\nBut at least as compelling is the soul-searching that led her to provide that account - revealed in the transcript , released late last year, of a closed-door conversation with the committee.\n\nIn two earlier appearances, she had answered many of the inquiry panel's questions by saying she simply \"didn't recall.\" She'd been reassured by her lawyer that this wasn't actually lying. And besides, the committee couldn't know what she did or didn't remember.\n\nYet in her own mind, this was lying. It was wrong. And even if the committee didn't know she was withholding information, she knew.\n\nSo ultimately, she decided that despite pressure to hold the line, and an abiding loyalty to Mr. Meadows and others in the White House, she could not live with that knowledge. In the eloquent words of a friend in whom she'd confided, that would have meant \"failing the mirror test\" - being unable to face herself.\n\nThat kind of internal reckoning has also led others to speak out over the past year when silence would have been easier, people like Moscow television producer Marina Ovsyannikova. A few weeks into President Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine, she strode onto the set of Russia's main nightly news broadcast holding a sign saying: \"No war! Don't believe the propaganda. They're lying to you here.\"\n\nOr like the young Chinese citizens who stood holding blank sheets of paper, to dramatize the government's draconian censorship regime, during the protests that helped persuade President Xi Jinping to abandon his \"zero-COVID\" lockdowns.\n\nAnd the countless Iranians who, despite a violent crackdown by security forces, have persisted in chanting their support for \"women ... life ... freedom.\"\n\nOften, such individual actions don't directly alter the course of events.\n\nBut they do convey a powerful message: That such choices of conscience, however difficult, are possible. And that not acting is also a choice.\n\nRecent history - the ethnic slaughters in Bosnia and Rwanda in the 1990s, and Nazi Germany's mass murder of the Jews of Europe in the 1940s - has reinforced that message on an even larger scale.\n\nDuring each of these atrocities some people stood out from their neighbors by making a choice of conscience, often risking their lives to help the victims. A filmmaker friend of mine documented one especially moving example : the inhabitants of the southern French village of Chambon-sur-Lignon, who hid and ultimately saved thousands of Jews during the Nazi occupation.\n\nTragically, many more people abetted the killing in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Europe than tried to hinder it.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

As the late Nobel-winning author and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel memorably said of all genocides, \"what hurts the victim most is not the cruelty of the oppressor.\"\n\nRather, he said, it was \"the silence of the bystander.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Yes, whenever an election is held, we decide on different issues and between political parties and their candidates. But we also make a deeper choice about what we believe is the power which governs.\n\nWhat is the ultimate power governing me, my family and friends, my country, and even the world? Is it human personalities or is it God? Is it mortal mind or the divine Mind? Where do I put my faith?\n\nAny polarization or conflict that arises in elections is the result of the belief that power belongs to people, who have both good and evil qualities, instead of to God. We get riled up because we are convinced that there are candidates whose political positions and activities will harm us. If personalities are able to rule, we do have reason to fear.\n\nThe Bible points us in a different direction, though: \"Power belongeth unto God\" ( Psalms 62:11 ). Accepting that God, good, is all-powerful and governing human existence frees us from fear and distress. The Bible also says, \"I am the Lord, and there is none else\" ( Isaiah 45:6 ). This shows us that the enemy is not a person. It is the false belief that there is a power, mind, or presence other than God.\n\nIgnorance and fear are overcome through Christ, the true idea of God. When Pilate asked Christ Jesus before his crucifixion, \"Whence art thou?\" he didn't answer. So Pilate asked Jesus whether he knew that as Roman governor he had the power to kill or free him. Jesus answered, \"Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above\" ( John 19:11 ).\n\nJesus wasn't afraid; he understood that power belonged to God and not to Pilate.\n\nTo Jesus, God wasn't just a large power in a world full of smaller powers - God, Spirit, was All, the only power. Thus he knew there is no real evil power or mind which could prevent him from fulfilling God's will and completing his mission. He would be victorious no matter how it looked at that point. And in the resurrection he was indeed victorious.\n\nThe First and Second Commandments (see Exodus 20:3, 4 ) can help us guard our thought against resigning ourselves to any claim of evil, the way Jesus guarded his thought. The First Commandment teaches us to have no other gods before God. We are to have or worship no other power, no other presence, no other might or mind. From this basis, we become confident that God is our King and Christ our Savior, and that nothing else - not even politicians or political parties - can save or destroy.\n\nThe Second Commandment brings out that what tempts us away from God are images, mortal beliefs, of material or personal good or of evil - all graven (carved) in thought, and all denying the supremacy of God. We're not to make \"any graven image,\" the commandment says.\n\nNews reporting, social media, television, convey many images of material power or powerlessness. We make a graven image of what we read or hear when we simply take the false beliefs into our thought rather than letting Christ lift our thinking higher and refusing to honor any power but God, good. Conversely, as we love and worship God, we lose our fear of evil. When the fear is gone, we are able to make intelligent decisions during elections. We will select what represents the highest right under the circumstances.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nIf our candidate doesn't win and another does, we have the opportunity to continue to make a wise choice. Mary Baker Eddy , the founder of this news organization, wrote, \"Between the centripetal and centrifugal mental forces of material and spiritual gravitations, we go into or we go out of materialism or sin, and choose our course and its results. Which, then, shall be our choice, - the sinful, material, and perishable, or the spiritual, joy-giving, and eternal?\" ( \"Miscellaneous Writings 1883-1896,\" p. 19 ). We can choose the spiritual and go forward as Jesus did with a full faith in God, who is ceaselessly working His purpose out.\n\nAs we choose to honor the supremacy of Spirit, it is natural to maintain our higher view of, and trust in, the reality and influence of God's power, whoever wins high office. We can know that the guidance and direction of God, Love, who is perfect good, is present with those elected, as well as with all who are part of the national government, and we can pray for their receptivity to that wisdom and understanding. We can continue forward, choosing to know that \"the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the governor among the nations\" ( Psalms 22:28 ).\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But does it have to be that way?\n\nFor our first EqualEd poll , we asked thought leaders both in the classroom and out whether they thought it was possible to have both. The poll is a way to get a range of expert voices on the key issues tied to education equality; it isn't trying to capture the consensus opinion among the education community.\n\nSeventy-nine percent of policy influencers who responded to our poll said yes, as long as a school system was properly set up and regulated, students could benefit from school choice options like charters and private schools competing with traditional public schools, and sharing best practices. Their two biggest caveats were that all schools had to have equal accountability and that there were limits on private school vouchers. Meanwhile, teachers were more skeptical, with their main argument being that school choice drains funding from public schools because money follows children to whichever school they go.\n\nWhile funding is often the main bone of contention traditional public school advocates have with charters, Patrick Riccards, author of the Eduflack blog and the chief communications and strategy officer for the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, echoes the common school choice rebuttal that the presence of charters creates healthy competition.\n\n\"Done properly, school choice can drive all public schools to improve, meeting the needs of the families seeking alternative paths,\" writes Mr. Riccards.\n\n\"School choice can be a robust component of a strong public school system in an urban area with sufficient density to allow meaningful choice. Clearly this is the case for public school choice, as many systems such as New York City have thriving charter systems as well as effective public schools,\" writes Adam Gamoran, president of the William T. Grant Foundation. \"By contrast, public support for private school choice carries more dangers for the public school system; if such support is not means-tested then it is little more than a transfer of public funds to the private sector. As long as support is provided in limited amounts and in a means-tested way, private school choice need not threaten the viability of strong public schools.\"\n\nHowever, others like Jonathon Plucker, the Julian C. Stanley Professor of Talent Development at Johns Hopkins University, pointed out that given the different kinds of schools that fall under the school choice umbrella, it is not easy to generalize about the effects those schools will have.\n\n\"Choice comes in many shapes and sizes,\" he says. \"For example, open enrollment, charters, magnets, and vouchers are all forms of choice, but they can each have very different interactions with traditional public school systems.\"\n\nEven with just one of those school types, there can be great variation. For example, the strongly regulated charter schools in Massachusetts have generally been academically successful and, in some places like the Lawrence turnaround districts, fulfilled their original purpose of sharing best practices with traditional public schools . On the other hand, the network of charters, including for-profit ones, in Michigan hurt the state system as whole as they were badly regulated and underperformed academically.\n\nThe ideal coexistence of school choice institutions and traditional public schools occurs when districts move beyond labels, argues Jim Balfanz, President of City Year, the AmeriCorps national service organization.\n\n\"Schools work when we see past governance structures and school types, and focus on quality, accountable, safe, and healthy learning environments that produce results for students,\" Mr. Balfanz writes. \"When these elements are in place, as they are in many schools across the United States, everyone benefits - students, communities, and our national economy.\"\n\nWhen we asked teachers in our Thought Leaders poll whether robust school choice and strong public schools could coexist, Funding was the No. 1 reason they cited for being skeptical.\n\n\"Since the one drains the funding from the other it puts public education on a downward spiral,\" writes Brett Bigham, 2014 Oregon Teacher of the Year.\n\nAnother teacher who chose to remain anonymous, believes it is possible, but with the caveat that school choice must be just that -- with schools truly open to all and not covertly using strict discipline to \"weed out\" students who might place a drag on test averages.\n\n\"This is possible if all children have access to the educational choice that is best for them,\" the teachers writes. \"If the charter schools do not take an equal representation of ALL students (gender, ethnicity, religion, special ed. status, English Language Learners, etc.) then it will not be equitable.\"\n\nLeah Luke, a high school teacher from rural Wisconsin and previous winner of the Badger State's teacher of the year award, pointed out how school choice can have an outsized financial disruption in districts like hers.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\n\"School choice in a small, rural setting has a negative impact on the public system. The loss of even one or two students to school choice can reduce program offerings for the remaining students,\" she says. \"In the first rural high school I taught in at the beginning of my career, a large graduating class had 25 students. The smallest graduating class during my tenure at that high school was 18. Since the 'money follows the student,' the loss of $8,000-$10,000 per student was huge.\"\n\n\"Then there is the issue of supplies. How do you plan for the purchase of textbooks, 1:1 devices, bus routes, and boxes of Kleenex? Again, please view through the lenses of small districts,\" she adds.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Log in to hide ads .\n\nLoading...\n\nSept. 30, 2020, 3:44 p.m. ET\n\nRanked choice voting might be relatively new to the United States, but it's been around for a while - both as an idea and in practice around the world. Now Maine may be on track to become the first state to use this method in its vote for president.\n\nThe result, proponents say, could be a new degree of empowerment for voters, and boost for the concept of majority rule.\n\nNot everyone supports the idea, and in September a judge in Maine ruled against a petition that would have blocked the system. Additional judicial review is expected in October, but for now the ranked choice method is moving forward in Maine.\n\nThe idea is increasingly moving from textbooks to the real world: Let voters check more than one box, to create ranked ballots. Supporters say it can end \"wasted votes\" and force politicians to earn majority support.\n\nElections in the U.S. typically use a plurality system, meaning whoever gets the most votes wins. However, it's possible to get the most votes but still win fewer than 50% of the votes cast. Ranked choice voting tries to correct that, and ensure the winner has a true majority of votes. Instead of voting for a single candidate, voters in Maine will rank their candidates from No. 1 to No. 5. (The five candidates on the ballot are President Donald Trump; Democratic nominee Joe Biden; Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen; Green nominee Howie Hawkins; and Rocky de la Fuente, of the Alliance Party.) Voters don't have to rank all the candidates. When the votes are counted, the candidate with more than 50% of the No. 1 votes wins.\n\nIf there is no one with an outright majority - more than 50% of the vote - the votes are recounted, with a twist. The candidate with the least votes from the previous round is eliminated, and the ballots with that candidate as No. 1 have their No. 2 slot counted instead. This pattern continues until there is a winner with an outright majority.\n\nIt can be as relevant in presidential races as in down-ballot decisions. In 2016, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won in Maine, despite not having more than 50% of the votes. (She won 47.8% of the total vote to Mr. Trump's 44.8%.)\n\nThough Maine is the only state using ranked choice voting for all voters in federal elections, the voting method is used in various states and municipalities across the U.S. It was used in the 2020 Democratic primaries in Nevada, Wyoming, Alaska, Hawaii, and Kansas.\n\nMassachusetts voters will decide Nov. 3 whether to adopt it for state offices and congressional races, and Alaskans will choose whether to institute ranked choice general elections, including voting for president. It's also used in one form or another in a growing number of municipalities across the U.S., according to data from FairVote, which advocates for voting reform. Maine is unique in that all voters will be using it to select the president.\n\nOutside the U.S., variations of ranked choice have been used in a handful of countries, including Ireland, Australia, Sri Lanka, and Estonia.\n\nAdvocates say ranked choice voting allows people to vote for non-major-party candidates without feeling like they're throwing their vote away. For example, Mainers who voted for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson or Green candidate Jill Stein in 2016 knew their choice probably would not win, so voting for them can feel like a waste. Under ranked choice voting, voters could have still put Mr. Johnson or Ms. Stein as their No. 1 choice, but then their vote would have transferred once those candidates were knocked out.\n\nSince the Maine law was enacted in 2016, it has faced challenges in the courts. The Maine Supreme Court ruled against a Republican-led petition drive to suspend the law. Detractors of ranked choice voting sometimes cite the confusion it can cause: It's new, and requires voters to understand how to rank candidates. Additionally, opponents say the principle of \"one person, one vote\" is best served by the traditional system where whoever comes out with the most votes wins - without multiple rounds of counting in different ways.\n\nRanked choice voting will also require more time and money to tabulate the results if someone doesn't win a majority on the first round. It could also save money by avoiding the need for runoffs in states that require a majority to elect.\n\nAdditionally, ranked choice voting doesn't always work as planned. One study found that in some U.S. municipalities that use it, if voters don't rank enough candidates on their ballots - stopping after only marking their first or second choice, for example - the winner can still be someone who won a plurality, not a majority.\n\nSome scholars say that, in an era of polarization, a ranked choice system could tug candidates and parties toward the center as they see value in being voters' second choice as well as their first. In effect, the system is designed to force candidates to achieve majority appeal, not just plurality appeal.\n\nSupporters also say the system will give the electorate a more honest look at the strength of third parties, as fewer people feel compelled toward \"strategic voting\" for a candidate who might win, rather than for their preferred candidate.\n\nYes. In the 2018 elections in Maine, Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin won the most votes after the first counting, which under normal circumstances would have meant he won the election.\n\nHowever, the state was using ranked choice voting in that election, and Mr. Poliquin had not won more than 50% of the votes. He ended up losing after additional tabulations were made and his opponent ended up with a majority. Political scientists differ on how much and how often ranked choice voting might shake up races across the country overall.\n\nAdvocates say ranked choice voting helps eliminate spoilers, i.e., third-party candidates who don't stand a chance at winning but who still might drain away votes from a Democrat or Republican in a tight race.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nIn Michigan in 2016, Mr. Trump won the state by just 11,000 votes. Neither he nor Mrs. Clinton had a majority. Political observers have speculated about what would have happened if third-party votes, largely for the Green and Libertarian Parties, had been redistributed under a ranked choice system. It's possible the outcome would have changed.\n\nBut in Maine this year, with Mr. Biden polling well, the ranked choice system might not come into play at all at the presidential level.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

In addition to the monthly fee you pay for coverage, you'll also need to cover the cost of the technician's labor with a service call fee of $100.\n\nChoice Home Warranty charges a single flat service fee of $100. This is different from competitors such as AFC Home Warranty and American Home Shield , which both let you choose a flat service fee of $75, $100 or $125 for your plan, with a higher fee giving you a lower monthly cost for your warranty.\n\nService providers working Choice Home Warranty guarantee the quality of the materials for 90 days, and the quality of labor for 60 days. If you file a complaint with the service provider, they're obligated to redo the job at no cost to you.\n\nWhere Choice Home Warranty stands out the most is with its high coverage limits. The company offers a coverage cap of $5,000 per covered item, which landed it on our list of the best home warranties . To compare, AFC Home Warranty pays up to $3,000 per item. Select Home Warranty sets varying limits depending on the item type. For example, for appliances, plumbing and electrical systems, the cap is $500, and for HVAC - $3,000.\n\nChoice Home Warranty provides service nationwide, except for Washington state.\n\nChoice Home Warranty offers two plans: the Basic Plan and the Total Plan. Each plan requires a monthly fee, and pricing depends on factors such as your home location.\n\nThe Basic Plan is the more affordable plan. According to the information Choice Home Warranty shared with CNBC, its average monthly cost is $46. It covers the following items and systems:\n\nThe Total Plan costs $55 per month on average. It covers everything included in the Basic Plan, plus:\n\nThe provider also allows you to add the following optional coverages:\n\nChoice Home Warranty's call centers take service requests 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In some states, weekend, holiday and evening service is only available when it's essential to your health and safety.\n\nAdditionally, you can receive a month of coverage for free when purchasing a single-payment home warranty plan. This can help you save on home warranty costs, so consider this promotion when you shop around for a provider and gather quotes.\n\nFinally, Choice Home Warranty provides a response time of four hours for service requests. This way, you can rest assured your issue will be taken care of promptly.\n\nOverall, Choice Home Warranty has plenty to offer, from straightforward plan structures with a handful of add-ons to customize them, to predictable service fees and swift response times.\n\nStill, you always want to compare multiple options when choosing a financial product. For example, some companies can offer more in terms of membership benefits. American Home Shield especially stands out here. Depending on the plan, you can access maintenance services, HVAC upgrade discounts, rekeying, tech installation and support and more. Plus, American Home Shield offers three plans for you to choose from, so it may be easier to get exactly the coverage you need.\n\nShieldSilver plan covers HVAC, electrical, plumbing systems, while the ShieldGold plan adds laundry appliances. The ShieldPlatinum increases coverage limits and adds microwaves, ceiling fans, icemakers and roof leak repairs.\n\nNot available in Alaska or Hawaii.\n\nShieldSilver: $5,000 per covered HVAC system, ShieldGold: $2,000 per covered appliance, ShieldPlatinum: $4,000 per appliance, $5,000 per HVAC, $1,000 for roof leak repairs. All American Home Shield plans have a $50,000 total limit per contract.\n\nElectronics, pool/spa, septic systems, well and septic pumps, roof leak repairs, guest units\n\n$100 or $125\n\nOn the other hand, if your priority is to find affordable coverage, look into Select Home Warranty . The company advertises generous discounts on all of its plans. On top of that, you'll get free roof coverage, whichever plan you choose.\n\nThe Bronze Care plan covers appliances, Gold Care protects HVAC, electrical and other home systems. Platinum Care plan covers both and adds garage door openers, ceiling fans and plumbing clogs.\n\nNot available in Nevada, Washington or Wisconsin\n\n$3,000 for AC/heating; $500 for electrical, plumbing and appliances; $400 for roof leak\n\nCentral vacuum, sprinklers, pool, spa, sump or well pump, septic system, roof leaks\n\n$60 to $75\n\nWhen you gather quotes, make sure you compare coverage limits, exclusions and other terms. Remember that a lower price doesn't always mean a better deal if you're getting less protection.\n\nMoney matters - so make the most of it.

      "text": "The average adult makes 35,000 decisions a day: Here's how to avoid 'choice overload,' from the authors of 'Out of Your Mind'\n\nRelated Stories\n\nDo you ever wonder just how many decisions you make every day? It's about 35,000 for the average adult, according to researchers . And that estimate only factors in your conscious choices.\n\nFrom simple decisions like what to eat to major ones like where to live, it's easy to become overwhelmed by the wealth of options. This dilemma is what experts call \" choice overload .\"\n\nAccording to The Decision Lab , choice overload is \"the difficulty of making a choice when presented with many options, especially when all options seem to have equal value.\" The company researches behavioral science to help individuals and organizations make important decisions.\n\nIn \" Out of Your Mind ,\" authors Jorge Cham , an engineer-turned-cartoonist, and Dwayne Godwin , a neuroscientist, explore the complicated aspects of the human brain.\n\nOne section of their book explains how having too many choices can negatively affect you, and a simple way you can overcome that choice overload.\n\nFear of missing out, or FOMO , is the negative emotion you experience when compare your life to other people's, which can make you feel left behind.\n\nAnd having too many choices is one of the factors that can cause you to \"compare yourself more to others, and you're more likely to second-guess yourself,\" Cham and Godwin wrote.\n\n\"This is called 'social comparison,' where you not only think you made the wrong choice, but you think someone else made a better one.\"\n\nFOMO is more prevalent now that people can follow along with what others are doing on social media, Cham and Godwin noted. A cartoon Cham illustrated in the book depicts a young man watching a video of someone else on vacation and exclaiming, \"I'm not living my best life!\"\n\nEven if you are content with where you are, perceiving another person's actions as better can make you unhappy about your own choices.\n\nThe pair point to a study that used data from multiple surveys where people were asked how happy they were, then prompted to consider how their income compared to that of their neighbors.\n\n\"The study found that people's happiness increased the higher their income,\" they wrote. \"But their happiness decreased the lower they thought their income was compared to others.\"\n\nHaving many options can feel exciting, \"but sometimes not having any choice can make us happier,\" Cham and Godwin wrote.\n\nBut you can reduce your number of choices you have to make. Cham and Godwin suggest you take a page out of the book of Buddhist monks , and embrace simplicity.\n\n\"Buddhist monks aspire to live a life of simplicity and minimalism, with fewer possessions compared to the average person,\" the pair said.\n\n\"Reducing choices lets Buddhist monks avoid the stress and anxiety that can come with making complex decisions. This can lead to a sense of clarity and calmness, with fewer feelings of indecision and worry.\"\n\nAim to craft your life so that you have enough options to feel content, but aren't overburdened by too many choices that can lead to frustration.\n\n\"And if having too many choices is unavoidable, seek the opinion of others,\" Cham and Godwin wrote.\n\nWant to earn some extra money on the side?

Its exchange offer to shareholders of Wyndham, which runs Days Inn, La Quinta, Ramada and a host of other brands, was the same as its last bid to company management, which was $49.50 in cash and 0.324 shares of Choice common stock per Wyndham share.\n\nChoice's exchange offer expired on Friday. The company also said Monday that it was withdrawing its slate of director nominees for Wyndham's board.\n\n\"Choice intends to continue focusing on its standalone strategy, which the company is confident will create significant long-term value for its stockholders and franchisees,\" it said in a prepared statement.\n\n\"The Wyndham board is pleased that Choice has ended its hostile pursuit and proxy contest, following the expiration of its unsolicited exchange offer,\" Wyndham Chairman Stephen Holmes said in a news release. \"We are confident in Wyndham's standalone strategy and growth prospects under the leadership of our proven management team. The Board remains committed to acting in the best interests of our shareholders and driving superior long-term value creation.\"\n\nChoice had been trying to work out a deal for Wyndham, based in Parsippany, New Jersey, for some time, but had been held at arm's length. In October Wyndham rejected an unsolicited $8 billion buyout offer from Choice. At the time, Wyndham, called the proposal \"opportunistic\" and said that it undervalued the company's growth potential. The offer was rejected unanimously by its board.\n\nHolmes also said in October that Choice's bid was \"subject to significant business, regulatory and execution risk,\" and that Choice had been unable to address Wyndham's concerns.\n\nThe Biden administration has been much more aggressive than previous administrations when it comes to antitrust reviews, regardless of the economic sector.\n\nChoice Hotels International Inc., which is based in Rockville, Maryland, runs about 7,500 hotels in 46 countries. It was seeking to absorb a much larger chain in Wyndham, which operates more than 9,000 hotels that also include Howard Johnson, Super 8 and Travelodge.\n\nShares of Choice rose nearly 4% in midday trading, while Wyndham's stock climbed slightly.\n\nCorrection: A photo in this article was replaced because it was incorrectly identified as a photo of a Wyndham Hotels and Resorts location.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

A balance transfer fee of 5% of each transfer ($5 minimum) applies if completed after 4 months of account opening.\n\n3%\n\nThe Citi Double Cash® Card is one of the top no-annual-fee cash-back credit cards because it earns at least 2% back on every purchase (1% when you buy and 1% when you pay your balance). That gives it an edge over the Choice Rewards, which earns 2X points on many - but not all - purchases.\n\nThe Citi Double Cash's reasonable intro balance transfer fee, generous intro-APR offer and great flat-rate rewards can make it a great card if you're looking for simplicity and value.\n\nLearn more: Citi Double Cash Card review\n\nThere's a lot to like about the Choice Rewards World Mastercard® . It has a low APR (for a credit card), no annual fee and no balance transfer fee. You can also earn rewards on everyday purchases.

      "text": "Having too many options can paralyze investors. Here's how you can overcome 'choice overload'\n\nHumans like choice. Indeed, it's a bedrock principle of autonomy and freedom.\n\nBut when it comes to investing, having too many choices can be bad.\n\n\"Most likely, it will hurt you rather than help you,\" said Philip Chao, a certified financial planner and founder of Experiential Wealth, based in Cabin John, Maryland.\n\nThe dominant view in economics is that more options are \"unambiguously\" good.\n\nTo that point, a \"rich\" environment of choice lets consumers \"curate an experience tailored to their preferences,\" wrote Brian Scholl, chief economist of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Office of the Investor Advocate.\n\nHowever, in the real world, our experience diverges from this paradigm, he said.\n\nHumans get overwhelmed by too many options, a behavioral finance concept known as \"choice overload.\"\n\nOften, people - especially those new to something that carries high stakes - are fearful of making a bad choice or regretting their decision, said CFP David Blanchett, head of retirement research for PGIM, an investment manager.\n\nThis paradox of choice can have many negative impacts on investors: inertia, or doing nothing; naïve diversification, or spreading money across a little bit of everything; and favoring attention-grabbing investments, wrote Samantha Lamas, senior behavioral researcher at Morningstar.\n\n\"These shortcuts can become disastrous mistakes,\" she said.\n\nIt's not just investing: The choice paradox can extend to things like ice cream flavors and apparel, for example.\n\nAmong the early research experiments: buying gourmet jam at an upscale grocery store. According to that 2000 study , by Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper, a tasting booth with a large display of exotic jams (24 varieties) received more customer interest than a smaller one with six varieties. But customers who saw the small display were 10 times more likely to buy jam than those who saw the larger one.\n\nGiven these behavioral biases, retailers and others have evolved, making it less likely consumers will experience choice overload \"in the wild\" today, said Dan Egan, vice president of behavioral finance and investing at Betterment.\n\nMore from Personal Finance: A 12% retirement return assumption is 'absolutely nuts' Why the 'last mile' of the inflation fight may be tough Don't let this passport quirk upend your next vacation\n\nHowever, let's say an investor wants to save money in a taxable brokerage account or individual retirement account. They generally have hundreds or even thousands of options available from which to choose, and several characteristics to compare, such as cost and performance.\n\n\"There's literally more choice than would ever be useful to you,\" Egan said.\n\nIt's a bit different in the context of 401(k) plans, experts said.\n\nDo-it-yourselfers may have about one to two dozen investment options, at most, from which to choose, reducing the choice friction.\n\nFurther, most employers automatically enroll workers into a target-date fund, a one-stop shop for retirement savers that's generally well diversified and appropriately allocated based on the investor's age. This eliminates much of the decision-making.\n\nIf you don't give people an easy choice, \"it's really hard for them,\" Blanchett said.\n\nUltimately, long-term investors who are paralyzed by their available choices should make the process as simple as possible when starting out, experts said.\n\nFor most people, that's likely to be investing in a well-diversified mutual fund like a target-date fund or a 60/40 balanced fund (which is allocated 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds), experts said.\n\n\"Either one of those [funds] is an excellent place to start as opposed to putting all money in cash or not investing,\" Blanchett said.\n\nEven within TDFs and balanced fund categories, there can be dozens of different options. Experts recommend seeking out a provider like Vanguard Group with relatively low costs. (You can do this by comparing the \"expense ratios\" of various funds.)\n\nHere's another approach: If you open a brokerage account at Vanguard, Fidelity or Charles Schwab, for example, use their respective TDFs or balanced portfolios, Blanchett said. In these cases, you're offloading most of the investment decision-making to professional asset managers, and the large providers generally have high quality, he said.\n\n\"Is it necessary to buy all the ingredients to make a cake, or can you just buy a cake and eat it?\" Chao said.\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "AFC Home Warranty vs. Choice Home Warranty: Which is better?\n\nSmall Business\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nCredit Monitoring\n\nHelp for Low Credit Scores\n\nInvesting\n\nFollow Select\n\nA home warranty covers the cost of repairing or replacing appliances and major home systems when they break down. The right plan can save homeowners hundreds or even thousands, especially if it's for an older home that may be more in need of repairs.\n\nAmerica's First Choice Home Warranty and Choice Home Warranty both made our list of best home warranty companies , but there are clear differences. AFC lets you choose your service technician, for example, but it has lower coverage limits for plumbing and electrical systems. Choice has higher coverage limits but no choice in contractors and a much less generous workmanship guarantee.\n\nCNBC Select put these two industry leaders head-to-head to see which might be a better option for you.\n\nSilver : Appliances, garage door Gold : Adds HVAC, electrical, plumbing and ductwork Platinum : Adds faucets, plumbing stoppage, fans, built-in microwaves Diamond : Adds electronics (including phones), exterior water and sewer lines\n\nAFC warranties are available nationwide except California, Hawaii and Washington state\n\n$3,000 limit per covered appliance per contract term, $500 limit for plumbing and electrical, no limit on A/C or heating, $50,000 aggregate cap for all covered items per term.\n\nPool/spa, septic systems, well and sump pumps, freezers, roof leaks\n\n$75, $100 or $125\n\nRead our AFC Home Warranty review\n\nThe Basic Plan covers many appliances and systems and the Total Plan adds air conditioning, washers, dryers and refrigerators.\n\nAvailable nationwide except in Washington state\n\n$3,000 a year for each covered item, up to $500 for roof leaks\n\nPool, sprinkler, additional refrigerator, well pumps, sump pumps, septic systems, roof leaks\n\n$100\n\nPros\n\nCons\n\nPros\n\nCons\n\nAFC Home Warranty is sold nationwide except in California and Hawaii, while Choice Home Warranty is licensed everywhere except Washington state. Both are available for single-family and multiple-unit homes, condos, mobile homes, rental properties and manufactured homes. Both companies also have a standard 30-day waiting period, during which coverage is not in effect.\n\nAFC Home Warranty service contract can last as long as three years. The company offers several tiers, including an appliance-only Silver plan.\n\nSilver Covers: Major household appliances including refrigerators, stoves, dishwashers, built-in microwaves, washers/dryers, garbage disposals and garage door openers Average monthly rate: $31 Gold Covers: Same as Silver but adds HVAC, electrical and plumbing systems Average monthly rate : $44 Platinum Covers: Same as Gold plan but adds ceiling, exhaust and attic fans. Average monthly rate: $52 Diamond Covers: Same as the Platinum plan but adds home electronics and exterior water/sewer lines. Average monthly rate: $83\n\nAFC also offers add-on coverage for items including:\n\nCustomers can choose a $75, $100 or $125 service call fee, with a higher rate resulting in lower premiums.\n\nA Choice Home Warranty contract typically lasts for one year. It's a more simplified setup with just two plans.\n\nBasic plan Covers: Kitchen appliances, plus heating, electrical and plumbing systems Average monthly rate: $45 Total plan Covers: Same as Basic but adds washers and dryers, refrigerators and air conditioning systems. Average monthly rate : $55\n\nAdd-ons with Choice include:\n\nFor service calls, Choice has a flat $100 fee per visit.\n\nBoth companies have sales and limited-time offers, especially if you pay upfront: AFC offers a discount for paying for your full contract, for example, while Choice will give you your first month free. Getting an online quote is the best way to determine your specific rate.\n\nAFC Home Warranty has an aggregate limit of $50,000 for all claims per contract term. It also sets caps on how much it will pay to repair or replace certain items:\n\nChoice Home Warranty maxes out at $3,000 per covered item annually for appliances, HVAC, electrical and plumbing, with a $500 coverage limit for roof leaks.\n\nHere's how the two companies compare with customer service.\n\nYou can get an AFC Home Warranty rate quote or purchase a plan by calling 844-518-0119, daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET. The AFC website can also offer quotes, although you'll have to speak with a customer rep to complete the transaction. There is no online chat feature and no mobile app. AFC will let you choose your contractor, so long as they are licensed, bonded, insured and previously authorized. Alternatively, you can be assigned someone from its network of 40,000 accredited technicians. Contractors are contacted within four hours of AFC receiving a request, although it may take more than 48 hours for a technician to reach out to the homeowner. According to  AFC, policyholders do not have to pay for a follow-up visit if a repair is not successful.\n\nTo buy a Choice Home Warranty plan, you can call 800-816-2688. Existing policyholders can. call 888-373-7924 24/7 to make a service call request.\n\nYou can also view plans, submit claims and renew your contract on the Choice website or mobile app. You can't choose your technician but, according to the company's user agreement, Choice-approved technicians are contacted within four hours of a service request.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau gives both AFC and Choice a B, which is typical for home warranty companies. For customer reviews, AFC scored a decent 3.42 stars out of 5 stars while Choice averaged an underwhelming 1.04 . Nearly 75% of AFC's reviews on Trustpilot earned just one star, while more than 70% of Choice reviews had four five stars.\n\nAn ongoing lawsuit filed by the Arizona Attorney General's office in 2019, however, alleges Choice Home Warranty used \"contract exclusions, payment caps and bad-faith refusals to avoid paying for repairs.\"\n\nAFC Home Warranty and Choice Home Warranty cover similar systems, especially on their higher-tier plans.\n\nAFC comes out ahead in several ways, though: It has lower average premiums and more flexibility with service call fees and technicians. It also offers service contracts with terms of up to three years and guarantees parts and labor for the length of the contract. Choice only has 12-month contracts and guarantees parts for 90 days and labor for 60.\n\nChoice does have higher coverage limits for most items, which may mitigate its more expensive rates.\n\nBoth companies have red flags for customer service: Choice has faced customer complaints about claim denials a n d its limited options for service fees , while AFC has been criticized for problems with getting through to customer service agents and with submitting claims.\n\nA home warranty is a service plan for major appliances and home systems,. Policyholders pay a monthly or annual premium for coverage, plus a service call fee each time a technician comes to make repairs.\n\nHome warranties cover a variety of systems in your home, like electrical, plumbing and HVAC. They can also cover appliances like your refrigerator, oven, dishwasher and washer and dryer. You may also be able to add coverage for pools, septic systems, sump pumps, roof leak repair and more.\n\nChoice Home Warranty does not offer an AARP discount but customers who pay for your contract upfront instead of monthly receive their first month free.\n\nRates vary, but the average monthly cost for Choice Home Warranty is about $45 to $55, with a flat $100 service fee for each visit.\n\nThe average monthly premium for AFC's basic Silver policy is $31, while its top-tier Diamond plan averages $83. Service call fees can range from $75 to $125.\n\nYes, Choice Home Warranty will repair or replace an HVAC system, with a $3,000 annual coverage limit.\n\nHome warranties may be worth the cost if you live in an older home or can't afford to repair or replace appliances and home systems out of pocket. Plans cost hundreds annually, however, and may not cover every situation. Be sure to read the fine print of any home warranty to understand what is and isn't covered.\n\nMoney matters - so make the most of it.

To get the best possible experience please use the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge to view this website.\n\nChoice Hotels and its loyalty program, Choice Privileges® Rewards, isn't usually the first option for many travelers. However, the program offers some surprising benefits, making it a contender in the hospitality industry.\n\nWhile the brand is often overlooked due to its reputation for budget properties, it boasts a worldwide network of accommodations, impressive redemption options and even includes high-end properties. Savvy travelers looking to maximize their hotel points should keep Choice Privileges on their radar.\n\nSince 1939, Choice Hotels has established itself as a prominent player in the hospitality industry. The company, originally called Quality Courts United, Inc., began in Florida as a nonprofit with seven individually owned properties in its portfolio where the owners would refer business to each other.\n\nChoice underwent several changes before it became the company it is today. In 1972, for example, the brand changed its name to Quality Inns International. Then, in 1981, it established its Comfort hotel brand, which would later become the company's flagship brand.\n\nToday, Choice Hotels operates more than 7,400 properties in over 46 countries.\n\nChoice's lineup of hotels includes approximately 22 brands, ranging from budget options to extended stays and even high-end, luxury properties.\n\nFurthermore, there's Strawberry Hotels, formerly known as Nordic Choice Hotels, a franchise under the Choice umbrella and one of the biggest hospitality brands in Scandinavia, boasting over 200 properties in the region. With three of its own brands, these options can also be booked through Choice.com and are:\n\nPreferred Hotels, an affiliate of the Choice Privileges Rewards program, is another option for using your Choice points. It offers a number of upscale, luxury and boutique hotels within the U.S. and internationally and can be one of the best ways to get value out of your Choice points. Redemptions start at just 10,000 points.\n\nIn late 2022, Choice purchased the hotel company Radisson Americas . With this acquisition, Choice points can be redeemed at any Radisson Americas property. Radisson Americas brands include:\n\nRead more. Best Credit Cards For Travel And Cash Back\n\nChoice Hotels' loyalty program is Choice Privileges Rewards and members earn Choice points. You can earn Choice points as soon as you sign up for a free account .\n\nChoice offers several ways to earn points, including hotel stays, spending on the co-branded Choice Privileges® Mastercard® * or Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® * , through transfer partners and more.\n\nThe first option for earning Choice points is booking through an approved Choice channel and staying at participating properties. Eligible hotels include all properties in the Choice portfolio, with the following exceptions:\n\nThe Choice program has other exclusions to be aware of when earning points for hotel stays.\n\nExclusions aside, Choice members earn 10 points for every dollar spent at eligible Choice hotels.\n\nAll Choice membership levels earn a base rate of 10 Choice points per dollar spent at Choice hotels on eligible rates. Choice utilizes three elite status levels and awards its members bonus points on top of the base rate:\n\nPaying $100 for a night at an eligible property will earn 1,000 Choice points. With the Diamond elite status bonus of 50%, they would earn an additional 500 Choice points, for a total of 1,500 points for the stay.\n\nElite status in any hotel program can be the key to unlocking valuable perks, and Choice Privileges is no different. Several benefits include early check-in, late checkout and preferred parking at eligible properties. The following chart shows the benefits offered at each elite status level:\n\nYou can earn status in several ways, including staying at eligible Choice properties, status matching another loyalty program and holding a co-branded credit card. There is a cap of elite-status earnings on extended stays. You will earn one qualifying night each night for stays six nights and under. For stays of seven days or more, you will earn one qualifying night for every two nights stayed. Stays over 31 days do not qualify to earn elite status.\n\nHotel stays . To earn status through hotel stays, you'll need to achieve the following requirements for each level:\n\nStatus match . Choice offers elite status through status matching. Members can match up to Choice's midtier status, Platinum. Additionally, status matching is limited to once per lifetime.\n\nMatched status is valid for the current year when granted between January to June. When matched anytime between July to December, elite status is valid for the rest of the current year and the following year.\n\nTo begin the process of status matching, email Status_Match@choicehotels.com and include the following information:\n\nFor lower-tier elite levels, Choice offers a hybrid status match/fast-track option to gain Diamond status. Known as the Cambria Diamond Elite Status Jump, you'll need an eligible stay at a Cambria hotel as well as proof of elite status in another hotel rewards program to qualify.\n\nCredit cards . Cardholders of a co-branded Choice Mastercard can enjoy status. The Choice Privileges® Mastercard® * awards automatic Gold status and the Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® * boosts cardholders to Platinum elite status.\n\nIn addition to elite status, having a co-branded credit card is one of the easiest ways to load up on points. Choice offers two co-branded credit cards through Wells Fargo.\n\nChoice Hotels offers three options to transfer points from credit card rewards programs:\n\nChoice no longer publishes an award chart and prices vary seasonally. Generally, Choice hotels will cost between 8,000 to 35,000 points. When using \"Points Plus Cash,\" redemptions start at 6,000 Choice points with a cash copay.\n\nPreferred Hotels redemptions are an exception to Choice's pricing, as they can cost up to 55,000 Choice Privileges points per night. Other exceptions are hotels in the Asia-Pacific region where properties cost up to 70,000 Choice points per night and all-inclusive resort stays at Ascend Hotel Collection locations, which can cost up to 100,000 points per night.\n\nYou can utilize Choice's Points Plus Cash option if you're short on points. You'll need at least 6,000 Choice points in your account. Follow the same procedure as a regular award night booking, but this time, select the \"Points Plus Cash\" tab. You can then choose a combination of points and cash to complete your booking.\n\nBuying points, especially speculatively, often results in terrible value and is not recommended in most cases. Occasionally, you may need to top off an account for a stay, and buying points in this case could make sense. Always check the cost of the hotel against buying Choice points to see which option results in better value.\n\nWhen purchasing Choice points, know that:\n\nChoice Hotels does not charge any fees on award stays or other Choice point redemptions.\n\nLocally, standard taxes and fees where applicable could apply. Some hotels may also charge resort fees over and above the booking cost. Check with the property if you are unsure whether fees will apply.\n\nChoice Hotels' sweet spots are hard to find as its award prices are tied to cash prices, but one of the best places to look for great value is with Choice's partner, Preferred Hotels.\n\nTo search for Preferred Hotels, head over to its website . Once there, you will need to find and verify that the property you are interested in has availability. Following confirmation of availability, you can only book via the booking link provided on Choicehotels.com. Online booking is currently unavailable.\n\nChoice Privileges Rewards points expire after 18 months of inactivity. To keep them from being forfeited, complete at least one qualifying activity every 18 months. Qualifying activities include staying a night at a Choice property, using a Choice Privileges credit card, purchasing points and referring a friend.\n\nChoice does not offer options for family pooling.\n\nThe Choice Privileges Rewards program is full of value, it just takes a little more work to find it. From booking with partners in more luxurious hotels to finding cheap options in popular locations, using Choice points can save you money. Consider using them for your next trip.\n\n*The information for the following card(s) has been collected independently by Forbes Advisor: Choice Privileges® Mastercard®, Choice Privileges® Select Mastercard® . The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.\n\nToni is a points and miles enthusiast who has been leveraging loyalty programs to travel around the world (for nearly free) with her husband and their four young children.

Suzanne Rowan Kelleher covers travel for Forbes.\n\nBy Suzanne Rowan Kelleher ,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\nGeoff Ballotti, president and CEO of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Inc., had urged shareholders to reject the bid. (Photo: Michael Nagle)\n\nD ing-dong, a major deal in the hospitality industry is dead. Early on Monday morning, Choice Hotels announced it was abandoning its $8 billion hostile takeover bid for Wyndham Hotels & Resorts that was made public five months ago.\n\nEven before Choice publicly announced its intentions in October, Wyndham had already rejected four offers from Choice, starting with an bid of $80 per share last April, then $85 in May and $90 in August of 2023. In November, Choice tried again with a $86-per-share offer, which Wyndham characterized as \"a step backwards.\"\n\nChoice kept pushing, however, giving Wyndham stockholders until last Friday to tender their shares but ultimately finding insufficient support. \"As such, Choice has decided not to extend the exchange offer and is withdrawing its slate,\" Choice said in a statement .\n\nHad a majority of Wyndham shareholders heeded Choice's appeal, the company would have replaced Wyndham's board members with its own slate of directors and moved to control the company.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Wyndham had sent letter to its shareholders urging them to support its own eight director nominees. \"Choice's opportunistic offer comes at a time when Wyndham continues to outperform Choice across key operating drivers and metrics,\" Wyndham argued. \"Choice has a slower-growing business, lower profitability and, post-transaction, would have higher leverage. Choice views Wyndham as a medicine cabinet of remedies for its many ailments.\"\n\nHad Choice's bid been successful, the acquisition would have been a massive merger in the budget hotel chain space, combining the fifth- and sixth-largest hotel groups in North America to create the continent's largest budget hotel franchisor. Wyndham describes itself as the largest hotel franchisor in the world, with 9,280 locations across 24 brands in 95 countries. The stable runs the gamut from economy chains like Days Inn and Super 8 to mid-range brands like Ramada and La Quinta to upscale hotels like the eponymous Wyndham. Choice Hotels operates nearly 7,500 properties spanning 22 brands, including Comfort Inn and Quality Inn.\n\nThus ends a long saga that has distracted both companies. Since the market closed on Friday, Choice's share price has jumped 8.2%, while Wyndham's share price has dropped 1% and was at $75 minutes after markets opened on Monday."

How did the same phenomenon set in among luxury hotels?\n\nIt only makes sense that the more a traveler pays for their hotel stay, they would - and should - expect a more special experience. Yet the opposite trend seems to be setting in. Several popular independent and boutique hotel brands have consolidated under a small handful of corporate umbrellas over the last decade. Chains that once stood apart have fallen into the trap of homogenization.\n\nIn an era when job-hopping corporate executives have more in common with their peers at other businesses than they do with the employees of the brands they oversee, it makes sense that a degree of sameness would set in within industries, ultimately trickling down to the customer. Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than the travel industry. Big-box hotels are suddenly a dime a dozen, if not actually that cheap. At the same time, even \"design hotels\" that attempt to cater to travelers with a specific aesthetic preference are often so tightly curated, it's easy to forget what city you're in upon entering the lobby.\n\nThis was the pain point behind Radisson and Radisson Blu's \"relaunch\" in June. Choice Hotels International announced its plans for the future of its two upscale brands at NYU's Hospitality Conference, aiming to distinguish these properties from the clutter through a revamped food and beverage program, elevated design, and a more refined overall experience.\n\nThose buzzwords lie behind many well-intentioned brand overhauls that ultimately lead back to a familiar place. Yet Indy Adenaw, Choice Hotels International's Senior Vice President and General Manager, Upscale, gets it: He's seen the trend toward homogenization and doesn't want another luxury hotel brand falling into the trap.\n\n\"As we thought about the upscale guest demographic for the Radisson brand, in doing our own internal and external research and through property tours and discussions with our current owners and operators, we heard that some upscale hotels today feel impersonal and standardized,\" Adenaw said.\n\nIf today's luxury hotels are designed to feel unapproachable, what does an \"approachable\" luxury hotel look like? \"Approachable design focuses on providing a welcoming atmosphere that feels both distinguished and accessible,\" Adenaw said, \"combining the best of traditional hospitality with the intuitive understanding of each guest's modern needs.\"\n\nKing room rendering for the Radisson Hotels' Luxury Redesign\n\nAdenaw shared a few details of what that will look like for the Radisson line:\n\nFuture rendering of the luxury vanity in a Radisson Blu hotel room\n\nAnd for Radisson Blu:\n\nThese ideas might sound straightforward, but executing them is not cheap. Adenaw said the Radisson Blu Mall of America will be transformed into a Radisson Blu \"showpiece\" property, with an expected investment of more than $15 million into the renovation. Globally, the new visual identities (such as signage and collateral, as well as new guest room prototypes) will be available to hotel operators in Q4 of 2024.\n\nAdenaw said the dining menus will be less standardized among properties, with an emphasis on locally sourced ingredients - an encouraging sign that each visit to a Radisson or Radisson Blu property won't look or taste quite like any other place in the world."

      "text": "All In On Cloud, Choice Hotels Turns Its Focus To AI\n\nBy Steven Norton\n\nBy Steven Norton ,\n\nContributor.\n\nChoice Hotels technologists gather at the company's Scottsdale office for the the annual Mastery ... More conference, a weeklong retreat focused on technology and innovation.\n\nEarlier this year, Choice Hotels CIO Brian Kirkland achieved a milestone many technology leaders dream about: he shut down the company's last physical data center.\n\nThe move closed the door on a five-year shift to Amazon Web Services that included decommissioning more than 3,700 servers, phasing out 300 outdated software programs, and improving another 250 before moving them to the cloud.\n\nChief Information Officer Brian Kirkland\n\nToday, Kirkland and his team are taking advantage of the speed and flexibility to scale up artificial intelligence initiatives and deliver new experiences for customers and franchisees across its portfolio of more than 7,500 properties.\n\n\"We had to do this because we don't know what tomorrow looks like,\" Kirkland said of the move to AWS. In an industry that increasingly relies on real-time data to deliver up-to-the-minute room pricing and personalized customer experiences, \"being in a data center is not going to allow for a competitive advantage.\"\n\nKirkland began his career at Choice in 2015 developing a cloud-based version of the company's reservation and inventory management system, a big step for an industry not particularly known for being on tech's cutting edge. When he became CIO in 2018, his focus shifted to bringing that agility to the entire company.\n\nA focus on delivering value alongside strict governance and cost management has been key to the transition, Kirkland said. He worked closely with his peers in the C-suite to plan the transition, and his team established guardrails to monitor cloud consumption and keep a close eye on spending.\n\nThe benefits have begun to materialize in ways both big and small. For example, a shift to deploying software on a daily rather than monthly basis led to big changes to its website. During the first month of the pandemic, Choice launched more changes on its site than it had in the entire year prior.\n\nIn 2022, the company rolled out ChoiceMAX, a mobile- and cloud-first revenue management system that uses machine learning to give real-time pricing recommendations to franchisees. In addition to potentially boosting property revenue, the app also automated much of what was before a time-consuming manual process.\n\nIT roles, tools and skills have also evolved as the company moved to cloud. Many employees who used to manage physical data centers shifted to cloud operations and engineering teams, working alongside AWS to build and manage networks and building tools to optimize cloud spend. Data science capabilities are becoming increasingly democratized, Kirkland said, and everyone is encouraged to explore how they can use AI and machine learning in their work.\n\nChoice has a small \"tiger team\" focused on driving safe and efficient adoption of AI and generative AI. It ramped up tech-focused training initiatives for both employees and franchisees, and its Mastery innovation summit includes \"make-a-thons\" where teams can show off new projects to executives that could get fast-tracked into production.\n\nA benefit of working closely with a large cloud provider like AWS is the chance to test new products and services as they become available, Kirkland said. Choice is a trial customer for Amazon Connect, a platform that uses AI to improve efficiency in customer call centers. It's also testing an AI tool that aggregates customer data across multiple systems to create a unified profile, which ultimately can help deliver more personalized experiences.\n\nOn the generative AI front, Choice is testing Amazon's CodeWhisperer developer productivity tools and Microsoft's copilot solutions, among others. While not quite ready for prime time, teams are also testing genAI capabilities that could be used directly with customers.\n\nNo matter the AI technology, \"when they are ready for employees to use in a safe way, rolling that out fast will be a focus,\" Kirkland said.\n\nThe onslaught of new technologies offers a range of opportunities for Choice to leverage its data to drive growth and move more quickly. Looking ahead, Kirkland said he is focused on scaling up new AI use cases, getting reliable data into the hands of end users, and tying together knowledge and insights across disparate parts of the organization.\n\n\"We are the most advanced we've ever been, and the least advanced we'll ever be,\" Kirkland said. \"The journey's never over.\""

Tucker ,\n\nContributor.\n\nDuring his career as a motivational psychologist, Dr. Denis Waitley often spoke to athletic teams, ... More including Olympic athletes on the power of controlling one's self-talk.\n\nI began my career interviewing thought leaders, futurists, innovators, and visionaries as a Los Angeles-based journalist. For the May 1982, edition of PSA Magazine , I interviewed renowned speaker and behavioral psychologist Dr. Denis Waitley, whose \"Psychology of Winning\" cassette learning system was riding high on bestseller lists, and Waitley's calendar was full of speaking engagements.\n\nWaitley's ideas were pivotal in fueling my own career trajectory and belief system, for he and other human potential leaders opened my eyes to how far you can go if you work to control your thoughts and self beliefs. Waitley and I eventually wrote a book together called Winning the Innovation Game , and sadly, we have lost touch.\n\nNevertheless, when I came across this interview the other day, I thought about Waitley's ideas on not blaming others (\"the government,\" \"racism,\" \"the other party,\" \"the Deep State,\" \"growing up in poverty,\" etc.), I couldn't help notice how the pendulum has swung even more towards victimization. These days, we seem to be moving away from our own sense of agency (\"If it's going to be, it's up to me\") and towards nursing grievances and blaming others for our lack of results, rather than taking responsibility for our lives and making it happen every day by the way we control our thoughts.\n\nTUCKER: Of all the characteristics of high-achieving individuals that you've had a chance to observe, which one seems to define them best?\n\nWAITLEY: It's their understanding of the degree of control that their thoughts have over the actions that follow in their lives. Whether they happen to be astronauts or parents or prisoners of war, these people have taken responsibility for their own achievements. They're self-managers.\n\nTUCKER: What does that mean?\n\nWAITLEY: Self-management is declaring that life is a do-it-to-myself project. Instead of just letting life happen, I'm going to make it happen for me, and I'm going to exercise the greatest freedom I have, which is the freedom of choice. The deepest, most significant choice we make is in the way we choose to think.\n\nTUCKER: Isn't controlling one's thoughts one of the hardest things to do?\n\nWAITLEY: No, but I think one of the hardest things to believe is that it can have any effect on your life. Almost all people believe that they are victims of environmental circumstances, the government, the weather, their horoscopes, certainly the economy. They feel they must wait for luck or fate or karma to change before they can have some effect on their lives. What's hardest to understand is that we're doing it every day, using our self-talk either for or against ourselves.\n\nTUCKER: What do you mean by self-talk?\n\nWAITLEY: We're talking to ourselves every moment of our waking lives. It comes automatically. We're seldom even aware that we're doing it. We all have a running commentary going on in our heads on events and our reactions to them. By changing what you're saying, you can change your behavior.\n\nTUCKER: Should we consciously try to stop thinking negative thoughts by repressing doubts and fears?\n\nWAITLEY: No. Those are natural emotions.\n\nTUCKER: If you're giving a speech, for instance, and you're nervous, should you go ahead and admit it to the audience?\n\nWAITLEY: No, because that is self-fulfilling and becomes a habit. It's much better to go on and do it anyway and listen for positive responses from the audience and try to reward yourself for a successful speech. It's not so much the performance that counts, because on any given day your performance will be good or not so good-a lot of factors affect your performance. But your response to it is what's most important of all.\n\nTUCKER: But people do have fears. Businesspeople worry constantly about a slump in their businesses, and salespeople worry about blowing a sale. Are you suggesting we shouldn't verbalize those fears?\n\nWAITLEY: I see the expression of fear as fine, but most fears and phobias are imaginary. A Michigan study found that 60 percent of our fears are totally unwarranted; 20 percent have already passed and are out of our control entirely; and another 10 percent are so petty that they don't make any difference. Of the remaining 10 percent, only 4 or 5 percent are real and justifiable fears, And even of those, we couldn't do anything about half of them! The other half we could easily solve by seeking out further information. Fear is not an effective emotion. It's an emotion you should feel under physical danger.\n\nTUCKER: How do you control your interior dialogue? What instructions can you offer?\n\nWAITLEY: The self-talk of winners is affirmative and directed toward the results they want: after a poor performance, a winner would say, \"That's not like me, I can do better than that. I need more information about the target because I didn't hit it. Therefore, I've either set the target too far off for right now, or I don't have enough to go on.\" The immediate self-talk of that performance should be, \"target correction necessary.\" After a good performance, on the other hand, the immediate feedback would be, \"Now we're getting somewhere. This is the way I see myself performing.\" Non-high-performance individuals will have a good day or do something exceptional, but they'll totally defeat themselves because they'll have convinced themselves that it was a fluke.\n\nTUCKER: So you believe in coaxing the mind toward the goal, almost talking to yourself?\n\nWAITLEY: Absolutely. I believe in talking to myself in words, pictures, and emotions for a long time before a performance and just afterward. It's even more important after a successful performance to assimilate it.\n\nTUCKER: You recommend using simulation also as a way of improving performance. How does the system work?\n\nWaitley: The neat thing about the brain is that it is a mimic of what we put into it in advance. Airline pilots have been using simulation for years. But it's also a technique that businesspeople and everybody can practice, just by creating each experience that we want in our imagination first, before the event. The other day on a flight to Chicago, I was sitting next to a fellow who was making a weird, high-pitched humming noise, with his eyes closed. I turned the overhead air nozzle on his face and asked him if he wanted me to call the stewardess to come to his aid. It turned out that he was an oboist for the Chicago Symphony and he was practicing for that night's performance. I met a world-champion Russian figure skater who told me that she rarely falls because she practices each sequence in her imagination at night with her eyes closed. She could probably perform her entire routine blindfolded with no hesitation. Simulation is the ability to do within when you're without.\n\nTUCKER: What is your primary message to those you teach?\n\nWAITLEY: That the period of time we're living in is no worse than any other period in history, and probably better. Because problems are normal and inherent with change. And since society is changing rapidly, it's up to the individual to view change as normal and to see many of the changes taking place as positive rather than negative. But we're not historians by nature. So we're not apt to say, let's look at what happened in the past for guidance. There's such an incredible focus in society on deviant behavior, bad news, and things going wrong that most people take it all on their shoulders. They feel that things were better before and will probably be better at some unpredictable point in the future called \"someday.\"\n\nTUCKER: Do you consider yourself a psychologist first or a motivator?\n\nWAITLEY: I'm a motivational trainer first. I teach people how to view the world, how to view themselves in the world, and how to establish some rules of conduct toward their personal and professional lives. So in effect, I'm a performance enhancer. I consider myself a psychologist second, although I'm constantly trying to make sure that the techniques, I'm applying have some basis in fact and have been researched.\n\nTUCKER: What do your audiences want from you?\n\nWAITLEY: They think what motivation is is a pump up, let's-go-out-there-and-kill-'em mentality. Motivation has been one of the most misunderstood, oversold words I've ever come across. What researchers have found is that the old locker-room psych-up causes you to peak too early. The adrenaline athletes have pumped up in the locker room tends to make them overanxious, and they make mistakes. They go out there, and instead of being relaxed and knowing exactly what they're going to do, they're actually too aroused to think. The new way is to have quiet time in the locker room -this applies to both Olympic and Super Bowl athletes- when athletes sit and listen to soft music and rehearse in their imaginations the game they know they are capable of playing because they're prepared. And it's really the same situation in life if you think about it.\n\nTUCKER: Why is it more important to replay a successful performance than to analyze a bad one?\n\nWAITLEY: Because most of us don't spend enough time preparing for or simulating success in advance, and we aren't prepared for it when we achieve it. We haven't spent enough time thinking about how good it is going to feel to be successful. For whatever reason we become successful, we don't completely understand it. And because of this, we don't feel deserving of it; it comes upon us like instant stardom or winning the sweepstakes. Right away, our self-talk begins to tear down the success, and we get back to where we were before or we go back to being our \"practiced selves.\"\n\nTUCKER: Of the high-achieving people you've observed, do they seem to be\n\ngoal-oriented?\n\nWAITLEY: It's definitely a common denominator of successful people. I find that the most common problem with people who never reach their goals is that they never set them. It isn't that goals are unreachable; it's that most people never take the time to write them down. They spend more time planning Christmas or a vacation than they do their lives. I'll ask people what they are going to do in 1983 and they'll say, \"Who can tell? It depends on whether Reaganomics works.\" Then I'll ask, \"What are you going to be doing by 1985?\" they'll reply, \"Well, it will probably be worse, with the interest rates and all. We don't have any idea.\"\n\nTUCKER: What's your method for setting goals?\n\nWAITLEY: I believe it's best to write out your life goals first, the things you want to do in the long range. Then, break down your goals into intermediate ones: What do you want to accomplish in the next three years? What do you intend to accomplish in the next six months? And then, after you've done this, how are you going to achieve them? It's very important to be specific; not just that you want to be happy. You want to be happy in what way? Do you want to be happy with your children at night when you come home? To answer these questions, you'll have to put down certain affirmative statements that will project you toward your goals.\n\nTUCKER: What do you say to people who reach their goals and find that they still aren't happy?\n\nWAITLEY: If your goals are symbols of success-a mansion, a yacht, a certain position in business or in the university-those I call shallow and superficial targets. If your goal was to make a million dollars and you made it, you'd find it shallow, because no one really cares. It isn't the achievement of the million dollars that's important; it was the process you went through in achieving it. So, goal setters have to be careful. They must understand that life itself is a process and that there is a big picture, that they fit into the big universe and that the most successful people look beyond themselves and their own goals for meaning and purpose in life.\n\nThese people are the ones who are busy planting shade trees under which they know they'll never sit. The biggest fools are the ones who look at the destination as the answer and not the process of the journey as being important. But it's equally foolish to go out there and just journey without having a destination.\n\nTUCKER: What role does ambition play in your psychology of winning?\n\nWAITLEY: A great one. Ambition is the role of imagination. It's simply a desire for change or a dissatisfaction with the status quo. A desire for change means that I can see something out there that is better than what I have.\n\nTUCKER: You mentioned earlier that we Americans may be working so hard that we may not be taking enough time to relax and reflect. What do you recommend as ways to keep from becoming too narrowly focused in one's work?\n\nWAITLEY: I think reading the best-selling nonfiction books is important. And if you don't have time to read those, then definitely read the digests of them. They even have digests of medical breakthroughs, and they're starting to put these digests on tape, so that what we used to think of as downtime in rush-hour traffic can be come in your auto-classroom. Attending seminars and lectures of all kinds, is important. Even more important is talking to people who have different views from yours.\n\nTUCKER: Do you advocate having a specific daily routine?\n\nWAITLEY: I'm a big believer in a success routine if the things you are doing are really beneficial. That might include getting up half an hour earlier, to ask yourself, \"What is the most important thing I can do today that's going to benefit me and those close to me?\" Unfortunately, routines often end up stifling growth; we start resting on our laurels, becoming complacent, thinking about retirement. And then some young Turk comes along who's not in a routine and can knock you right off your perch.\n\nTUCKER: The direct opposite of resting on one's laurels would be continually innovating, and continually undertaking new projects. What are your thoughts on that?\n\nWAITLEY: I have a rule for that. If you're just starting to succeed, keep repeating the success, and don't innovate at the beginning of a successful pattern, but continue until you have succeeded for some time. Once you're successful in your own eyes and in the eyes of the audience, then diversify, because people will help you do anything you want to after you are successful in each field.\n\nTUCKER: In your book, The Psychology of Winning, you talk about creating a model for yourself. Could you explain the idea?\n\nWAITLEY: Throughout the first half of most people's lives they operate under a system of trial and error. Finally, we get smart through our failures and begin to repeat a success. It's a heck of a way to live, yet everyone says you must go through it. But you really don't. What is important is for a person to find a role model or a success model of someone who seems similar in intelligence and maybe even background, and maybe in a similar field. The only difference is that this model has had a great deal more success. Modeling is looking at other people's lives, how they do what they do, interviewing them, reading about them, listening to them, really studying them, and finding out how they do it."

      "text": "The Difference Between Making A Choice And A Decision\n\nBy Svetlana Whitener\n\nBy Svetlana Whitener ,\n\nFormer Forbes Councils Member.\n\nShutterstock\n\nAlthough it might appear that the words \"choice\" and \"decision\" are just synonyms for the same thing, there is actually a difference between the two.\n\nFrom psychological investigations , we know that the difference stems from the concepts of freedom and determinism, where freedom is the place of choice and determinism is the point of decision. A little confusing? I'll explain.\n\nDeterminism is the doctrine that, in its absolute form, all events, including human action, are ultimately determined by causes external to the will. Thus, we can't really choose anything. All has been pre-determined.\n\nFreedom, on the other hand, if absolute, means just what you think it does: the ability to choose among different alternatives unfettered by other considerations and restraints. Nothing has been pre-determined.\n\nSo are the determinists right that all is pre-determined? Probably not, although we have to admit that decisions are usually influenced by outside factors. Similarly, absolute freedom is rare - constraint, in some form or another, is the norm.\n\nDon't rush to the point of decision. Reconnect to the place of choice first.\n\nEffective decision making can only flow from a place of choice. You must make a conscious effort to free yourself from fear and perceived limitations to get there. You must open your mind to all possibilities, without feeling restricted. When you are there, nothing seems like an insurmountable problem. Instead, there are only opportunities for growth and discovery. Nothing can stop you.\n\nThe place of choice is the crossroads between feeling fulfilled and aligning with your own values. Only after you have identified the place of choice can you move on to the point of decision, which is where you finally consider all options and decide what to do.\n\nTo illustrate, let's use a TV remote as an example. With your remote, you have the freedom to choose from an endless list of shows and channels. You could choose a simple sitcom, a TED talk on physics, or a golf tournament. You are at the place of choice.\n\nBut, you don't make decisions in a void. Your decisions are influenced by a myriad of factors, both external and internal, such as habit, culture, education, goals, etc. It's when you start taking these factors into consideration that you move to the point of decision.\n\nThus, if you're watching TV just to relax, then a simple sitcom or reality show might be just fine. However, if you want to be able to participate in office small talk the next day, you should probably choose a program you know your co-workers will be talking about.\n\nWe don't think about this decision-making process. We just automatically do it. However, I am suggesting that you will achieve better results if you slow down and analyze the process, not just in choosing which TV show to watch, but with the important decisions in your life.\n\nAnother example: You are about to hire a new employee and have several suitable candidates. At the place of choice, you can choose among any of them. One is just as good as another. However, we need to take into account the company's needs, each candidate's skills, experiences, etc. This is the place of decision - where we have limited our possible choices by all relevant factors.\n\nThis is the core distinction between choice and decision. Choice connects to the place of desired intention, values and beliefs. Decision connects to the place of behavior, performance and consequences. You might say that choices are connected to reasons and decisions are connected to causes.\n\nUnderstanding the difference between the place of choice and the point of decision helps you practice identifying your feelings, whether positive or negative, so you can make inspired choices and clear, robust decisions. By visiting the place of choice first, you can obtain the confidence needed to stay motivated and take bold, life-changing actions.\n\nBy understanding the difference between choosing and deciding, you can avoid having regrets about what you have done or not done in life. Utilize your full human potential and be the best version of yourself. Understand and appreciate the difference between choosing and deciding."

That is, one might strive to bring a higher sense of autonomy into their daily tasks, whatever they may be.\n\n\"There will always be things that I feel I have to do,\" says Kukita. \"But that is okay. I would not pretend that I purely want to do it. Admitting the have-to as is, I would try to see if I would feel that I want to do it as well.\"\n\nAccording to the authors, finding ways to turn have-to's into want-to's can have the following psychological benefits:\n\nA full interview with Atsushi Kukita discussing this new research can be found here: Did you know about this unexplored aspect of happiness?"

      "text": "Spurned Choice Hotels Brings Its Takeover Bid To Wyndham Shareholders\n\nBy Suzanne Rowan Kelleher\n\nBy Suzanne Rowan Kelleher ,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\nThe Wyndham Hotels & Resorts empire spans 24 brands and includes more than 9,000 properties.\n\nN ever mind that its $7.8 billion hostile takeover bid for Wyndham Hotels & Resorts was publicly spurned in October or that three other proposals have also been rejected. Suitor Choice Hotels now wants to take a new offer directly to Wyndham shareholders.\n\nChoice had previously offered to buy Wyndham four times over a six-month period, starting with an bid of $80 per share in April, then $85 in May and $90 in August. Last month, Choice tried again with a $86-per-share offer, which Wyndham characterized as \"a step backwards.\"\n\nChoice announced Tuesday that it is launching an exchange offer to acquire Wyndham for $49.50 in cash and 0.324 shares of Choice common stock per Wyndham share, representing a value of $40.50 based on Choice's trading price as of October 16, 2023. \"The proposed offer price equates to a 30% premium to Wyndham's closing share price of $69.10, and reflects a 14.9x multiple of Wyndham's consensus 2023 adjusted EBITDA estimate, a forward multiple Wyndham has never achieved, absent COVID disruptions,\" Choice's statement reads.\n\n\"The offer proposed by Choice appears unchanged from the terms outlined in a letter to Wyndham dated November 14, 2023 and is currently valued at approximately $86 per share,\" Wyndham replied in its own statement , noting that its board will carefully evaluate an offer that \"looks to be unchanged from Choice's previous highly conditional offer the board reviewed and rejected, which failed to address the serious concerns repeatedly expressed by Wyndham.\"\n\nSince Choice's takeover aspirations became public in October, its share price has fallen 11%, while, during the same period, Wyndham's share price has climbed 10% and was at $79.86 before markets opened on Tuesday.\n\nChoice said it would have preferred a negotiated agreement, but the Wyndham board is refusing to explore a deal, so it has no choice but to take its offer directly to shareholders. \"Wyndham chose to publicly reject our last proposal without any engagement even after we addressed their concerns, including adding significant regulatory protections for their shareholders,\" said Choice CEO Patrick Pacious in a statement.\n\nWere the merger to go through, it would be a massive realignment of the economy hotel chain landscape, with the sixth-largest hotel group in North America acquiring the fifth-largest to create the continent's largest budget hotel franchisor.\n\nChoice Hotels operates nearly 7,500 properties spanning 22 brands, including Comfort Inn and Quality Inn. Meanwhile, Parsippany, New Jersey-based Wyndham calls itself the largest hotel franchisor in the world, with 9,280 locations across 24 brands in 95 countries. The Wyndham stable runs the gamut from economy chains like Days Inn and Super 8 to mid-range brands like Ramada and La Quinta to upscale hotels like the eponymous Wyndham.\n\nIn its latest statement, Choice says currently holds roughly 1.5 million shares of Wyndham's common stock valued at more than $110 million and said that it would file the Hart-Scott-Rodino notification later Tuesday. This step provides the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice with financial information and kicks off the required regulatory review process for large mergers and acquisition.\n\nIn its statement on Tuesday, Wyndham noted that the 1.5 million shares Choice owns is less than 1.7% of Wyndham common stock and that Choice is is restricted from further purchases without antitrust approval.\n\nWyndham believes a deal would be subject to an FTC second-round review, which could take up to 18 months. \"God only knows how they can get a deal through the FTC where we are not a willing participant,\" Wyndham Chairman Stephen P. Holmes said in October.\n\nBeyond shareholders, there is another key group of stakeholders to consider. Like many major hospitality corporations, both Choice and Wyndham rely on an asset-light business model focused primarily on franchise operations rather than assuming the risks associated with owning real estate properties.\n\n\"Most of the media coverage has not paid any attention to the hotel owners, the franchisees, who will face the most significant changes,\" says Laura Lee Blake, president and CEO of the Asian-American Hotel Owners Association (AAHOA), whose members include over two thirds of the franchisees for both Choice and Wyndham. \"We feel strongly that the merger of the two brands would reduce competition, especially in this economy, limited-service segment, and really to the detriment of the franchisee hotel owners.\"\n\nBlake points to a recent informal survey of more than one thousand AAHOA members, which revealed strong opposition to the merger. Nearly 80% of Choice and Wyndham franchisees believe a merger would have a negative impact on their business. Most interestingly, roughly three quarters of AAHOA members that own a mix of properties franchised in both Choice and Wyndham also think the merger would hurt their business.\n\nWyndham urged its shareholders not to take any action with respect to the offer until its board announces its recommendation. Choice's exchange offer will expire on Friday, March 8, 2024, unless its extended or terminated."

Both companies have received thousands of BBB customer reviews, but American Home Shield holds a higher customer rating.\n\nAdditionally, Choice Home Warranty is involved in a current lawsuit, while American Home Shield is not. In 2019, the Arizona Attorney General's Office filed a civil lawsuit against Choice Home Warranty and accused the company of making false promises to clients and using misleading advertising when explaining the limitations and exclusions on covered items. In 2015, Choice Home Warranty settled a similar lawsuit brought by the New Jersey Attorney General. While the company settled that lawsuit, it did not admit to wrongdoing. Choice's representation noted in a statement to the Asbury Park Press, a daily newspaper in Neptune, N.J., that \"those involved in the state's case represent a very small percentage of the tens of thousands of clients to whom CHW provides service.\"\n\nWe recommend reading the terms and conditions of your home warranty contract before signing up for a plan so you understand exactly what is and isn't covered.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFifteen U.S. states have at least one universal private school choice program, which allows families to use taxpayer-funded education money to attend private schools, be homeschooled or seek options other than local public schools.\n\nSchool choice has long been a focus of Republican education platforms, with proponents arguing that they give students in underperforming schools a way out and allow parents to choose the best educational environment for their children.\n\nBut choice programs often face pushback from opponents that say such policies gut public education and further exacerbate educational inequalities. They note that wealthier families may be better positioned to take advantage of the programs and that many children benefiting from school choice had already been attending private schools.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Education Week, 29 states and the District of Columbia have at least one private school choice program. But of those, 15 have at least one program that is universally accessible to all K-12 students in the state.\n\nTwenty states have tax-credit scholarships, 16 have Education Savings Accounts, 10 plus the District of Columbia have vouchers, five have direct tax credits and two have tax-credit educations savings accounts, per the analysis by Education Week.\n\nSome states offer direct tax credits to parents to cover the cost of private school tuition or homeschooling expenses.\n\nEducation Savings Accounts (ESA) provide families with public per-pupil funding, allowing them to use it for tuition at private schools, tutoring, homeschooling supplies or other educational expenses. Some states have universal ESAs, but others restrict ESAs to students with disabilities, those attending underperforming schools or those from lower-income households.\n\nThese are a less common form of ESA through which families receive a designated amount of per-pupil funding from a state-authorized nonprofit that administers the account, but families can also use the funds to cover any educational expenses.\n\nThese programs provide scholarships to families that can be used at private schools of they choice, including faith-based schools.\n\nSchool vouchers are public funds that families can use to subsidize the cost of tuition at private schools of their choosing, including religious schools.\n\nPresident Donald Trump , who promised to expand school choice during his 2024 campaign, signed an executive order on January 29 that directs the Department of Education to prioritize the programs when awarding grants.\n\nThe order also directs the education secretary to issue guidance to states on how they can use federal money \"to support K-12 educational choice initiatives.\"\n\nThe order was signed on the same day a report showed American students have still not regained the ground lost during the COVID-19 pandemic. It cited the National Assessment of Education Progress, known as the nation's report card, that found only 28 percent of eighth-grade students were proficient in math and only 30 percent were proficient in reading.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Republicans in January proposed legislation-the Educational Choice for Children Act-that would provide $10 billion in annual tax credits for individuals and businesses to fund K-12 scholarships.\n\nThe White House said that traditional public schools have failed students and that the executive order signed by Trump \"begins to rectify that wrong by opening up opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Tim Scott, co-chair of the Congressional School Choice Caucus, in a statement in January: \"When you give parents a choice, you give kids a better chance at achieving their dreams. By empowering families with more education resources and freedom, this bill will unlock opportunities that have been out of reach for students across America who deserve every chance to succeed and a schooling system that fosters their potential.\"\n\nNational Education Association President Becky Pringle, in a statement in January: \"Every student deserves fully-funded neighborhood public schools that give them a sense of belonging and prepare them with the lessons and life skills they need to follow their dreams and reach their full potential. Instead of stealing taxpayer money to fund private schools, we should focus on public schools-where 90% of children, and 95% of children with disabilities, in America, attend-not take desperately needed funds away from them.\"\n\nLinda McMahon, who was recently confirmed as education secretary, will have to issue the guidance on states using federal funds for choice initiatives in the coming weeks, per Trump's executive order.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nKhaleda Rahman is Newsweek's National Correspondent based in London, UK.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order to expand school choice across the country. While this policy could allow more students access to alternatives outside of public schooling, critics warn it might divert essential funding from public schools and exacerbate educational inequalities.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the White House for comment via email Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAccess to school choice programs varies widely by state. While some states offer voucher programs and charter school funding, others have resisted, leaving students in underperforming public schools with limited options.\n\nAccording to the National Assessment of Educational Progress , which provides a comprehensive measure of students' academic achievement across the country, overall student achievement has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. The percentage of eighth-graders reading below NAEP Basic is the highest in the assessment's history, and the percentage of fourth-graders scoring below NAEP Basic is the largest in 20 years.\n\nBy redirecting federal funds, Trump's executive order aims to expand opportunities for families seeking alternatives to traditional public schools. However, critics argue that redirecting federal funds to expand school choice could further strain public schools and exacerbate educational inequalities.\n\nTrump's executive order directs the Department of Education to prioritize school choice initiatives when awarding grants. The order also gives states guidance on how they can use federal funding to support school voucher programs and other alternatives such as charter schools and private school tuition assistance.\n\nIt also instructs the Defense Secretary to present a plan for military families to use Department of Defense funds for school choice, and the Interior Secretary to submit a plan for families with children attending Bureau of Indian Education schools to use federal funds for their preferred schools.\n\nAside from military families and parents of children who attend Bureau of Indian Education schools, it's unclear exactly who will benefit most from Trump's executive order. While states receive federal funding for voucher programs, eligibility for the voucher system varies on a state-by-state basis.\n\nSupporters of the move argue that expanding school choice allows parents to select the best educational environment for their children, fostering competition that could lead to improved academic performance across all schools. Many Republicans have long advocated for school choice, arguing that public school systems often fail to meet the needs of students, particularly in low-income communities.\n\nHowever, critics contend that diverting federal funds to private institutions could further weaken public schools, leaving those without access to alternative education options at a disadvantage. Some education experts warn that increased school choice could deepen existing educational inequalities, as wealthier families may be better positioned to take advantage of voucher programs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump stated in his Inaugural Address : \"And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves - in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.\"\n\nFrederick Hess, the director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, stated: \"Given the dismal results on the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress, released today, I'm pleased to see the administration doing what it can to ensure families have access to more and better choices.\n\nWhile there are significant limits to what's possible, given statutory constraints and Washington's modest role in K-12 schooling, it's notable that the administration is doing what it can to extend the parental choice rather than stymie it - a pattern that was all too familiar during the past four years.\"\n\nTim Walker, senior writer for The National Education Association, previously wrote : \"Voucher laws generally do not require any sort of disclosure from private schools about their finances, how they operate, or how they measure student achievement. Arizona's is one of the least accountable voucher programs in the nation.\n\nRecent audits revealed that private school parents, and now voucher recipients, have used the funds for a slew of, at best, questionable expenses, including kayak lessons, horseback riding lessons, home gyms, televisions, and more. Earlier audits conducted prior to the most recent expansion revealed similarly questionable uses.\"\n\nEdTrust stated in a press release : \"What doesn't work? Vouchers that direct public dollars to private schools lead to even worse academic outcomes and increase gaps between the haves and have-nots. Let's call Trump's proposed plan what it really is: ending public education by diverting taxpayer dollars to private schools.\n\nThis plan will cut essential funding and destabilize the public schools that serve the vast majority of students. We've seen the consequences of underinvestment at the state and federal level, as well as when states aren't held accountable for supporting the success of their students attending public schools. State leaders asked for more freedom to improve education in their states. Clearly, they haven't lived up to the agreement and students have paid the price.\"\n\nIf signed, the executive order will set in motion new guidance from the Department of Education on how states can allocate federal funds to support school choice programs. Linda McMahon , nominated to be the Secretary of Education, is awaiting Senate confirmation, but a date for her hearing has not yet been announced. In the meantime, Denise Carter is the current acting Secretary of Education.\n\nOnce confirmed, McMahon will likely prioritize school choice initiatives and issue guidance on using federal funds for educational alternatives. The implementation of this policy will largely depend on state-level decisions, with Republican-led states expected to embrace the changes while Democratic-led states may challenge or resist them. The long-term impact on students, educators and public school funding remains to be seen.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nRobert Thorpe is a Newsweek reporter based in Massachusetts.

      "text": "How the School Choice Movement Finally Began Winning | Opinion\n\nAdvocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe following essay is an adapted excerpt from Corey A. DeAngelis' new book, The Parent Revolution: Rescuing Your Kids from the Radicals Ruining Our Schools (Center Street, May 14).\n\nDecades of appealing to Democrats by using liberal arguments for school choice-for example, that it expands educational opportunity for the most disadvantaged-failed to result in more than token support from a small number of elected officials on the Left. The bipartisan approach had a certain appeal to it, but it was not enough to form a winning coalition. Meanwhile, the school-choice movement writ large was avoiding the very arguments that might appeal to conservative, rural Republicans out of a concern that those arguments would turn off Democrats.\n\nMoreover, it wasn't clear that the education reform coalition was really as bipartisan as it claimed. Over time, the education reform movement had begun to drift to the political Left-and spurn the political Right. Jay P. Greene of the University of Arkansas and Rick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute analyzed the political giving among staff at major education reform organizations. In 2000, political campaign contributions by education reform advocates were nearly \"evenly split between Democratic and Republican candidates.\" But by 2019, more than 90 percent of the contributions were going to Democrats, even though Republican legislators were much more likely to support education reforms like school choice.\n\nAs Greene and Hess observed, education reform organizations that had bent over backward to avoid alienating liberals suddenly had no compunction about alienating conservatives or even the median voter. But if the Democrats weren't on board anyway, what did we have to lose?\n\nSo instead of playing the same old advocacy game, I went rogue. In 2020, I began coordinating regularly with a small group of like-minded education choice advocates to discuss the future of our movement. We all recognized that the union response to COVID had provided a unique window of opportunity-parents were more aware than ever before of the problems with government schooling and they wanted solutions. Taking over school boards was not enough. They needed education choice, too. That required forming a winning political coalition.\n\nAmerica has two major political parties. To get anything done politically, you need at least one of them on board. Most Republicans already were on board for school choice as it aligns with their general support for families, freedom, and market competition. But there were enough GOP holdouts in deep red states' legislatures to block reform. Forming a winning coalition would require either persuading a sizable number of Democrats to buck one of their most powerful constituencies, or persuading a similar number of Republicans to side with their base, key coalitional allies, and a majority of parents. Which seems like the easier lift?\n\nWe decided that the first step to winning on school choice was to show frustrated families that school choice was a solution to their problems. Parents who had been upset about a host of issues-mask mandates, CRT in the classroom, secret transgender policies, males in girls' locker rooms, and so on-tended first to try to get schools or school boards to reverse the policies, then to go to the legislature to force their hands. We needed to show them how school-choice policies provided them with additional leverage with school officials and school boards, and an immediate escape hatch when they still wouldn't listen.\n\nThe second step was to help parents turn up the heat on state legislators, especially Republicans. If we amplified the voices of frustrated parents and the GOP's conservative base, then Republican politicians would feel pressure to vote for school choice. Until now, many GOP legislators had only been hearing from union lobbyists and their local superintendents. Now they needed to hear from a host of their actual constituents.\n\nThe third step to winning on school choice was to make the policy a litmus test for Republicans. Despite the pressure, some GOP legislators would probably continue to vote against it. We needed to let their constituents know who they were so the voters could replace them. We needed to transform the Grand Old Party into the Parents' Party.\n\nIf we were right that school choice was popular among the general population, then voters would reward the Republican Party in the general elections. The fourth step was capitalizing on those electoral victories. Success begets success. When legislators saw that school choice was a winning issue among voters, some of the holdouts would flip their views on the issue or risk being thrown out of office.\n\nWe presented our strategy to many of the legacy education reform groups but did not find a receptive audience. Even if it worked in a few deep red states, they argued, this hyperpartisan strategy was going to backfire in the long run. Tying school choice too closely to one party would make it impossible for anyone associated with the other party to embrace it. Red states might eventually come on board, but blue states would be lost forever.\n\nWe disagreed. First, the blue states were nowhere near making any progress on school choice and were highly unlikely to do so in even the distant future. If all we managed to do was pick up a few red states, that was already better than the stagnant status quo. And second, our strategy was only hyperpartisan in the short term. In the long term, our strategy was bipartisan, too, just in a more realistic fashion. How so? Those who championed bipartisanship appealed to the Left's ideals. That's nice, but insufficient. We were appealing to interests. With a few notable and admirable exceptions, Democratic politicians were not going to embrace choice because we persuaded them that it was the morally right thing to do. They were going to come on board because the voters forced them to.\n\nIf we passed school-choice laws in enough red states, then we would normalize them. As citizens of those states became accustomed to more education freedom, voters in other states would start demanding school choice, too. And if the issue of school choice gave the Republicans a significant enough advantage in elections, then Democrats would eventually get tired of losing and tell the unions they weren't going to die on that hill anymore. But we would never get to that point unless the school-choice movement-or at least some elements of it-was willing to make school choice a culture war issue.\n\nNot a single state had universal school choice prior to 2021. In the past three years, 11 states have enacted it. This is a monumental achievement-and more victories for America's children are imminent. The red-state strategy was not only the most effective way to expand education choice, it was also the right thing to do.\n\nCorey A.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA social media post from a far-right political pundit proclaiming \"your body, my choice\" has gone viral, as women report a rise in online abuse following the presidential election.\n\nNick Fuentes' post on X, formerly Twitter , which adapted the pro-abortion phrase \"my body, my choice\", saw an immediate reaction, with some users saying they were worried that many others would agree with him.\n\n\"Your body, my choice. Forever,\" he shared, with the comment finding its way into the replies of women's posts on various social media platforms over the past few days.\n\nThe Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) tracked the comments, as well as other misogynistic remarks including \"get back to the kitchen\" and \"repeal the 19 th \", referring to the right to vote.\n\nWhile these latter two had appeared in some posts in the past month, instances soared after Nov. 5. \"Your body, my choice\" went from fewer than 20 mentions a day to nearly 2,000.\n\nISD found posts from female users on TikTok , with one stating: \"I had to delete a video because I was being threatened and several men commenting [sic] saying they couldn't wait until I get raped or 'your body my choice.'\"\n\nAnother said she had woken up to men posting similar comments on her content, while on Reddit another said TikTok had declared the comment was not a violation of its policies.\n\nTikTok told Newsweek that the term violates its guidelines for hate speech and posts containing it would be removed.\n\nYoung girls were also reporting hearing the phrase chanted at them at school, ISD said, while 52,000 posts including it had appeared on Facebook within a 24 hour period.\n\nFuentes, 26, is a white nationalist podcaster. He's known for his long history of misogynistic and antisemitic remarks online and hosts his own show called America First.\n\nHe previously branded supporters of President-elect Donald Trump as being part of a cult and refused to endorse him this year, but he did show support for the Republican in 2020.\n\nFuentes later had dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, alongside Ye (formerly known as Kanye West ).\n\nOn election night, Fuentes doubled down on his comment about women's bodies, posting: \"I'd just like to take the opportunity to thank men for saving this country from stupid b*****s who wanted to destroy the world to keep abortion.\"\n\nIn a stream Thursday night, Fuentes said it had been a joke but then poked fun at women for crying over his comments.\n\nFuentes's streams on video site Rumble, which often exceed three hours, receive upwards of 100,000 views, some more than double that, and the topics reflect a similar trend of podcasts which speak to younger male voters who shifted in Trump's favor.\n\nThe Republican appeared on various podcasts as part of his campaign, including Joe Rogan 's. Some of that was influenced by his youngest son Barron Trump , who the president-elect said had told him who he should speak to.\n\nAppearances like this helped Trump speak more directly to younger male voters than the Harris campaign was able to, reaching them via content creators they trust more than traditional media.\n\nAmid the rise in misogynistic rhetoric, some women are embracing the 4B movement, a trend that began in South Korea and means they abstain from romantic relationships with men.\n\nThe four Bs refers to: bihon (no marriage), bichulsan (no childbirth), biyeonae (no dating), and bisekseu (no sex) and it encourages women to reclaim autonomy over their bodies and reject traditional gender norms of marriage and childbearing.\n\nThey have been pushed in this direction over Trump's controversial decisions, such as taking credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade , and his personal history which has exacerbated fears around gender inequality and violence.\n\n\"Trump's victory has lit a flame for a lot of women,\" said Abby, a 27-year-old from Florida with the TikTok handle @rabbitsandtea. In a video with 1.7 million likes and 9.3 million views, she shared her story of breaking up with her Republican boyfriend and officially joining the 4B movement. She chose not to disclose her last name due to safety concerns since she has since received death threats online.\n\nDan Gooding is a Newsweek reporter based in New York City.

      "text": "School Choice Is Key to Ensuring Parents' Rights | Opinion\n\nAdvocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe time for school choice in all 50 states is here.\n\nArizona, Florida, Iowa, and West Virginia have already enacted legislation that lets parents choose their children's school and ensures that state funding follows the student. Legislators and parents in Tennessee and Texas are working to do the same. As encouraging as that is, it also means there are 44 states lagging behind on the defining educational reform movement of our time. It's time for all parents to speak up.\n\nThe reason we need school choice is simple: when it comes to their fundamental purpose-educating our children-many public schools deserve a failing grade.\n\nLast year, a FOX investigation found 23 schools in Baltimore that did not have a single student test proficient in math. Another 20 schools had only one or two students testing at grade level. A full 93 percent of Baltimore public school students-over 70,000 pupils-performed below grade level in math, and 84 percent -more than 65,000-performed below grade level in reading.\n\nIt's tempting to think this is just a Baltimore problem, but parents are learning otherwise. In data reviewed by Wirepoints , 30 schools in Illinois did not have a single student reading at grade level. For math, it was even worse, with 53 schools failing to raise a single student to grade level.\n\nReviewing these disturbing findings, economist Stephen Moore rightly describes the situation as \"a case of widespread educational child abuse.\" Moore notes that, rather than impose consequences, Illinois state officials described some of these failing schools as \"commendable.\" If schools fail to teach reading, writing, and arithmetic, what on Earth are they being commended for?\n\nSince there's clearly no effective oversight of our taxpayer-funded schools, it's up to parents to pay attention and demand answers. Abysmal test scores show what our schools are not teaching, but parents also need to monitor what the schools are teaching -which in many cases is even more shocking.\n\nMy organization, Moms for America, has developed resources to help parents identify problematic trends in education. Part of the reason students don't have time to learn basic math and reading-aside from the fact that the teachers' unions needlessly kept schools shut down in 2020 -is that classroom time is spent pushing ideological curricula that have nothing to do with legitimate instruction.\n\nSocial and Emotional Learning (SEL) is the most pervasive trend jeopardizing our students' success. Administrators use surveys to gauge students' attitudes and behaviors and then manipulate classroom instruction to emphasize feelings and create openings for revisionist propaganda. It sounds too wild to be true, but whistleblowers are speaking up and parents see it happening before their very eyes.\n\nAnother concerning trend is the use of Critical Race Theory (CRT) in curricula. Ironically claiming to be a solution to racism, CRT pushes racism on students and encourages them to see all subjects and personal interactions through the lens of race.\n\nIn Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis took bold action to ban CRT , a move which other states should follow. But that is not enough. In addition to CRT, radical activists in school administration and teachers' unions are peddling left-wing messages about gender , as well as anti-religious, anti-American, and anti-family bias in the classroom. With young people already suffering through a mental health crisis, the last thing we need is a program that encourages our students to hate themselves and hate their country .\n\nWe can no longer rely on public schools to teach basic competency in math and reading. Progressive activism in school administration and the classroom has replaced conventional instruction with left-wing propaganda. This represents a grave threat to our children.\n\nWhat's the solution? Let parents choose where their children go to school.\n\nContrary to the anti-choice spin promoted by self-serving teachers' unions, school choice will not cost taxpayers more; in fact, it could easily end up saving money. The same Maryland and Illinois schools recently shown to be failing spend about $16,000 and $18,000 per student, respectively, while the average private school tuition in Maryland is around $14,000 , and in Illinois it's just $9,000 .\n\nActivist organizations have held students hostage for too long. It's time to cut them off. Our children are the nation's most precious resource. What they learn today determines the country we will have tomorrow. Moms are one of the most powerful influences on the formation of our young patriots. It is time that schools support the work of mothers and partner with them to educate virtuous citizens who can think and reason for themselves.\n\nMoms for America is working with state lawmakers and governors to enact school choice legislation, and our legislative team is also active on Capitol Hill. With an army of moms, we can speak to elected officials across America with a powerful voice.\n\nOur children's education is too important an issue for us to sit on the sidelines. The time has come to demand equal access to quality education for every American child.\n\nKimberly Fletcher is the founder, president, and CEO of Moms For America, a national, non-profit 501c3 educational corporation rooted in the principles of liberty and virtue our nation was founded on, and focused on promoting these principles, values, and virtues in the home and family, particularly through the women and mothers of America.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA mom who was initially baffled by her infant daughter's choice of words for describing thing has finally discovered their unexpected origins.\n\nToddlerhood is an important time in the development of a young child, not least when it comes to vocabulary . As a 2016 study published in the journal Applied Psycholinguistics notes, while the average 18-month-old recognizes around 260 words, by preschool age children can know anywhere between 1,000 and 10,000 words.\n\nParents can play a role in nurturing this development through activities like reading and simple conversation. As a former elementary school teacher, Victoria Swift, from Florida, knows more about this than most.\n\nHer daughter is just 17 months old and is already developing a fine vocabulary. However, Swift was left scratching her head recently when she noticed her young daughter kept referring to her peppermint and gingerbread man toys as \"hippos.\"\n\nSwift was initially baffled. \"She knows a lot of words and is super smart so I knew there had to be a reason why she was calling all things gingerbread 'hippo,'\" she said.\n\nThe one day something suddenly \"clicked\" in her head. \"\"She loves reading books and I remembered that hippo is one of the many words she would say while reading one of her ABC books,\" she said.\n\nReading back through the book, Swift discovered that the page explaining \"H is for Hippo\" came just before one explaining \"G is for Gingerbread\" which featured an image of a gingerbread man complete with a gingerbread house and path made out of peppermints.\n\nSwift's initial confusion gave way to something else. In that moment she became a very proud mom. \"All parents think their kids are smart but I thought this was next level,\" she said. \"I used to be an elementary school teacher so seeing her ability to make connections was very impressive to me for her age.\"\n\nSwift said this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to her daughter's vocabulary too. \"She remembers many words and pictures and already puts two words together to communicate,\" she said.\n\nEager to share in her discovery, Swift posted a video explaining what happened to TikTok under the handle victoriaj0y . \"I share little bits of my life on my social media all the time,\" Swift said. \"I thought this was a cute video that would make people laugh but did not expect it to get this much attention!.\"\n\nAt the time of writing, Swift's video has been watched over 3.4 million times with viewers eager to share similar stories . \"My toddler would call Octopus an Applepus. Took months to realize his detangling spray had an octopus with a head shaped like an apple,\" one wrote. \"My nephew used to call himself 'Aww' because whenever we saw him or showed him a picture of himself we would say 'awww look at you,'\" another said.\n\nA third commented: \"My son's second word was 'Saturday.' It took us awhile to realize it was his favorite page in 'A Very Hungry Caterpillar,'\" with a fourth adding: \"My 2 year old granddaughter was calling lightbulbs 'ideas.'\"\n\nJack Beresford is a Newsweek Senior Internet Culture & Trends Reporter, based in London, UK.

      "text": "Best Whitewater Rafting Adventures\n\nBounce over rushing rapids or meander downstream with a few fun dips on your next whitewater rafting adventure with one of these companies. From week-long journeys through rugged canyon walls to half-day floats for first-time rafters, the trips you'll book through the groups below are some of the best in the country. You'll even find rafting options with man-made rivers (for those who need a quick thrill) and overnight glamping.\n\nThese 10 zip lines were selected by our featured panelists and contributors and voted on by readers as the best of the best.\n\nNearly all travelers rate their trip with Western River Expeditions as a five-star experience. They praise the wise and funny guides, the delicious campfire meals (with special attention to dietary restrictions) and the unbelievable beauty and adventure that unfolds around each river bend. This company runs rafting excursions on six different rivers for families, group charters and solo travelers.\n\nTraining grounds for 24 Olympians, Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) is one of the most popular whitewater rafting spots in the Southeast. The whole family can experience the fun of riding down gentle waves on routes that are rated for kids as young as three, but if you've got a couple of teenagers, check out the trips down the Middle Ocoee with Class III and IV rapids.\n\nIf you've ever dreamed of exploring the Alaskan wilderness by raft, St. Elias Alpine Guides can make those dreams a reality with its 3-15 day journeys through the Wrangell Mountains. The shorter itineraries are great for families or first-time rafters and can be scheduled as private if you want a more personalized experience. However, the two-week Source to Sea trip is an incredible expedition for veteran rafters.\n\nMoab Adventure Center tackles the Colorado River with fun, attentive guides. Its itineraries include one-day trips with BBQ picnics by the water and four-day journeys through river-cut cliffs that end with a flight back to your starting point. Tip: For more intense rapids, plan your trip during the spring runoff when the Big Drops in Cataract Canyon are roaring.\n\nAdventures on the Gorge appeals to rafters of all skill levels. If you're looking for a scenic float with a few fun rapids, the Upper New River experience is a great choice and can accommodate kids as young as 6. Pros, however, flock to the Upper Gauley each fall for a wild ride down an 11-mile section of the river that has worldwide acclaim.\n\nTravelers with Glacier Guides and Montana Raft rave about the jovial and knowledgeable captains, the roomy boats (which means everyone gets a chance to paddle) and the high-quality equipment. Consider booking one of the company's combination adventures if you'll be in the area for several days; you can bike, hike and enjoy horseback riding in addition to your rafting expedition.\n\nFor a tranquil float past famous natural wonders or a heart-pounding ride through thundering rapids, choose Wilderness River Adventures. The half-day Horseshoe Bend experience leads you up the Colorado to visit Petroglyph Beach and the river's iconic bend, while the six-day Full Grand Canyon tour provides a journey spanning 188 miles on a wild river cut through giant rock walls.\n\nDesigned for the traveler accustomed to the finer things of life, trips with Far and Away Adventures combine the beauty of America's wilderness with the conveniences of her cities. Spend the day rafting down the remote Middle Fork of the Salmon River, and then unwind at a glamping site, complete with a professional chef, wine tastings and oversized tents that include elevated beds.\n\nWith over 90 years of experience on the Green River, Hatch River Expeditions can put even the most apprehensive of rafters at ease. Choose from motorized rafting trips, ideal for any age, and oar trips, which switch between fast and wild and scenic and slow as they follow the river's flow. These adventures can be packed into four days or stretched to 12.\n\nGet your feet wet in the biggest man-made whitewater river in the world at the Whitewater Center. Built for those who want to experience the outdoors without leaving the city, the facility's rafting sessions last around one hour with options catered to families looking for Class II rapids as well as pros who prefer high-intensity rides. Purchase a day pass for access to all the on-site activities, like rock climbing and ropes courses.\n\nOur nominees are editorially driven with contributions from a panel of travel experts.

      "text": "School Choice Is Popular and Increasingly Common\n\nNational School Choice Week\n\nJ.D. Tuccille | 1.22.2024 7:00 AM\n\nOne of the best things about National School Choice Week (celebrated this year from January 21-27) is watching people take advantage of the growing range of options that allow them to opt out of public schools, often while taking per-student funding with them to pay for preferred alternatives. From panicked supporters of government schools to relieved parents and joyful choice advocates, the shift in education is showing up across American society.\n\nYou are reading The Rattler from J.D. Tuccille and Reason . Get more of J.D.'s commentary on government overreach and threats to everyday liberty.\n\nΔ\n\n\"Fresh from the academic struggles that followed the pandemic, and with federal relief funds soon to run out, [public school district leaders] now confront a massive enrollment crisis,\" Linda Jacobson wrote January 9 for education-oriented The74 .\n\nHer piece cites recent research from the Brooking Institution, finding that \"over a four-year period that includes the pandemic, about 12% of elementary schools and 9% of middle schools lost at least one-fifth of their enrollment.\" While there were enrollment declines in public schools pre-COVID, the pandemic marked a significant change, resulting in pressures to close public schools and reduce programs.\n\nBut while Jacobson's article focuses on the struggles of traditional public schools, Brookings researchers have a broader scope. Importantly, they find that part of the explanation is found in kids still happily learning, but through a variety of approaches outside the doors of public-school buildings.\n\n\"Declining enrollment in traditional public schools may reflect demographic shifts, migration, and school choice to some extent,\" Eloise Burtis and Sofoklis Goulas of the Brookings Institution point out in an October 2023 paper . \"For example, families may have tried out various schooling alternatives during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as homeschooling, and may have found that these options worked well for their children or wanted to avoid a transition to a more typical learning setting after COVID-19.\"\n\n\"At the start of the pandemic, in 2019-20, roughly 84 percent of school-age children were enrolled in traditional public schools,\" they add. \"This number dropped by 2 percentage points to roughly 81 percent in the 2020-2021 school year, and another 2 percentage points to 79 percent in the 2021-2022 school year.\"\n\nBurtis and Goulas saw gains in kids attending charter schools, virtual schools, and, especially, a grab-bag category \"attending private schools, being homeschooled, or out of school entirely.\"\n\nThat's helpful-ish, but not as much as an Urban Institute report from earlier in 2023. Author Thomas S. Dee wrote that \"over the first two school years under the pandemic, K-12 enrollment in public schools fell by more than 1.2 million students\" and that over the same period of time \"private school enrollment was 4 percent higher while homeschool enrollment was 30 percent higher.\"\n\nIn December, the National Center for Education Statistics data reported private school enrollment remaining constant in terms of raw numbers from 2019 through 2022 and growing for younger kids. \"Contrary to the increases in the lower grades for private school enrollment, between fall 2019 and fall 2021, public school enrollment decreased by 3 to 6 percent in grades K-7.\"\n\nIn October, The Washington Post reported homeschooling soared after the appearance of COVID-19 and the closure of many public schools, before settling to a 51 percent gain over pre-pandemic practices. Amidst much fretting over the \"largely unregulated\" educational approach, the authors labeled homeschooling \"America's fastest-growing form of education\" and estimated \"there are now between 1.9 million and 2.7 million home-schooled children in the United States.\"\n\nWhy the disparity in numbers? Not all states obsessively track kids' activities. Many leave it to parents to watch out for their children. Some that require notification may weakly enforce the rule; it was years before I bothered telling Arizona authorities my son was homeschooled . I knew my wife and I did a better job than they could and felt no obligation to defer to officials.\n\nAlso, as options proliferate, they sometimes overlap. In what category is a child mostly educated at home, but studying drama at a public high school, chemistry at a community college, and Spanish from an online private school? Data geeks care, but families just want their kids to learn.\n\nUnfortunately, the explosion of options doesn't fully explain the disappearance of students from traditional classrooms. \"More than a third of the loss in public school enrollment cannot be explained by corresponding gains in private school and homeschool enrollment and by demographic change,\" writes the Urban Institute's Dee.\n\nA big part of the problem lies in the monolithic and remarkably unresponsive public schools that still dominate the education landscape. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many closed their doors for extended periods of time while they fumbled attempts to offer online instruction.\n\n\"Some parents, unimpressed by what instruction consisted of during remote learning, didn't see missing school as that consequential,\" Alec MacGillis recently wrote for The New Yorker . \"Some simply liked having their kids around.\" As a result, school \"became optional.\"\n\nSome kids may permanently lose out on education. But most families decided that public school is optional, but education is not. They choose homeschooling, private schools, charter schools, and programs that make per-student funding portable, such as vouchers and education savings accounts .\n\n\"On a national level, based on most recent data: 1.9% of students are utilizing an educational choice program. 6.8% attend private school by other means. 74.6% attend a traditional public school. 4.9% attend a magnet school. 6.6% attend a charter school. 4.7% are homeschooled,\" according to numbers published last week by EdChoice, which supports education freedom.\n\n\"It's little secret 2023 was a transformative year for education,\" notes EdChoice research associate Colyn Ritter. \"Eight new states joined Arizona and West Virginia in making school choice available to all or nearly all students within their borders. Today, approximately 36% of students have access to educational choice.\"\n\nExtending education choice to more students and families may offer new hope to even those kids who've been turned off to learning by the failure of their old schools. Flexible and more impressive approaches to education than what they experienced before might entice them back and give them better knowledge and skills on which to build their lives.\n\nWhen asked if they want school choice, Americans overwhelmingly say \" yes \" by 70 percent or more . When offered education options, American families take them. By their actions they demonstrate that the best way to mark School Choice Week is for us to make our own choices about learning.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D. Tuccille.

      "text": "Arizona School Choice Program Comes Under Bureaucratic Attack\n\nSchool Choice\n\nJ.D. Tuccille | 10.2.2024 7:00 AM\n\nArizona's governor, Democrat Katie Hobbs, a nonentity who won because Republicans ran a Trump sycophant instead of a viable candidate, hates school choice . So does Attorney General Kris Mayes, who won by 280 votes against another Trump acolyte. Both officials have targeted Empowerment Scholarship Accounts (ESA), a state program that lets students use a portion of the funding allocated for education in public schools to pay instead for private school tuition or homeschooling costs . Hampered by the popularity of the program among Arizonans, Hobbs, Mayes, and their allies pursue a strategy of death by bureaucracy. Families are fighting back in court.\n\nYou are reading The Rattler from J.D. Tuccille and Reason . Get more of J.D.'s commentary on government overreach and threats to everyday liberty.\n\nΔ\n\nIn July, Phoenix's KJZZ reported that Mayes \"opened an investigation into the Arizona Department of Education over allegations it approved school voucher expenses not authorized under law, prompting the department to stop approving the expenses in question.\"\n\nThe Attorney General's office had contacted the Department of Education, which is led by Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne, a Republican, objecting to approval under the ESA program of the purchase by families of \"supplementary materials\" for education without documentation that the materials are linked to approved curricula. Classroom supplies, museum passes, and educational books are now off limits unless specifically required by a curriculum-a challenging requirement for homeschoolers, many of whom customize lesson plans to meet the individual needs of their children.\n\n\"The absence of requirement for documentation of a curriculum nexus may enable account holders or vendors to engage in fraudulent behavior,\" Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Boughton insisted in a not-so-subtle threat to families.\n\nThe Department of Education promptly caved without a fight , agreeing to require families to provide proof that supplemental materials purchased with ESA funds are directly tied to approved curricula. This drew a strong rebuke from the Heritage Foundation's Jason Bedrick (disclosure: Jason is a friend), a school choice advocate and Arizona resident who warned that \"opponents of education freedom are doing everything they can to eliminate or undermine the ESA\" and calling out Horne and his department for failing to stand its ground against an attempt to undermine education freedom through bureaucracy.\n\nIt's no surprise that Hobbs, Mayes, and company are targeting school choice with red tape rather than through legislation or at the ballot box. The GOP controls both houses of the legislature and supports school choice. Speaker of the House Ben Toma urged the Department of Education to ignore the attorney general's foray into education issues. State residents also favor choice. A September survey of Arizonans found 67 percent support for the ESA program-72 percent among parents of school-age children. That's very close to the 65 percent support for ESAs in a 2022 Data Orbital survey . If given a choice, the people of this state will keep ESAs, so opponents of education freedom are trying to make the program difficult and legally fraught to use.\n\nHorne weakly defended himself for failing to fight over what he called a \"minor issue\" and insisted he would have lost in court. He did, though, offer to support lawsuits against the attorney general challenging that office's interpretation of the program's requirements and its threats against families and vendors of educational materials. Whether or not he'll follow through, that's exactly the path chosen by Arizona families backed by the state's Goldwater Institute.\n\n\"The government is changing the rules and putting impossible burdens on me,\" homeschooling mom Velia Aguirre, a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the state comments in a Goldwater video . \"It's been really challenging and hard having to meet the expectations that the AG wants with a curriculum.\"\n\nFellow plaintiff Rosemary McAtee, also a homeschooling mother, points out that under the new rules, the ESA rejected the purchase of reading books for her children because they weren't linked to a specific curriculum. \"The A.G. clearly doesn't have any interest in what an education looks like for a homeschool child,\" she comments. \"She just wants to shut down and eliminate this program.\"\n\nFor its part, the Goldwater Institute points out that \"public and private school curriculum documents don't even necessarily list items like 'pencils' and 'erasers,'\" leaving little ground for any educators in the state to justify the purchase of classroom materials if the A.G.'s position is taken seriously. In addition, the organization emphasizes, \"the AG's new mandate simply ignores state law and violates the Department of Education's own handbook , which safeguards the ESA program by requiring documentation for unusual purchases, but not for common-sense purchases of items that are 'generally known to be educational.'\"\n\nBut logic is beside the point in Mayes' weirdly restrictive reinterpretation of ESA purchase rules and Hobbs' ongoing attempts to hobble school choice in the state. If good sense mattered, they'd acknowledge the massive popularity of an ESA program that now serves almost 80,000 students , up from 13,400 students when the program was introduced in 2022. They would give a nod to the state's improving National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) student achievement, which was among the top ten in the country for growth in reading and math scores among both fourth graders and eighth graders even as education spending remained under control, rising from an inflation-adjusted $10,353 per student in 2002 to $10,790 in 2020. Both achievement gains and cost controls are documented in the Public Education at a Crossroads report from the Reason Foundation, which publishes this magazine.\n\nHobbs and Mayes could even admit that the ESA program, which gives families 90 percent of the funding that would have otherwise been allocated to public schools on students' behalf so they can seek education they prefer elsewhere, has contributed both to better outcomes and to controlling spending.\n\nArizona could do even better. The state traditionally ranks lower in reading and mathematics than the national average in NAEP assessments-though it held its own as students lost ground post-COVID. But Arizona is improving as it advances educational choice and lets families choose what works for kids.\n\nThe lawsuit by Aguirre and McAtee, and backed by Goldwater, seeks \"declaratory and injunctive relief to vindicate Arizona parents' right to use ESA funds for common-sense educational purchases without having to jump through bureaucratic hoops and complete arbitrary paperwork.\"\n\nIt deserves to succeed. And Mayes and Hobbs need to back off their attacks on their own constituents.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D. Tuccille.

      "text": "This National School Choice Week, It's a Boom Time for Education Freedom\n\nNational School Choice Week\n\nJ.D. Tuccille | 1.29.2025 7:00 AM\n\nThis week is National School Choice Week, and there's a lot to celebrate. Innovation in education was accelerated by pandemic-era school closures, as was interest in alternatives to one-size-fits-some schooling. With education funding following the student rather than being assigned to government-run institutions in a growing number of states, more families are choosing what works best for their kids-and the majority are satisfied with their decisions.\n\nYou are reading The Rattler from J.D. Tuccille and Reason . Get more of J.D.'s commentary on government overreach and threats to everyday liberty.\n\nΔ\n\n\"By the end of 2024, more than one million students in America were participating in a private school choice program,\" EdChoice's Colyn Ritter reported this week. \"Participation growth has climbed rapidly, having more than doubled since the beginning of 2020.\"\n\n\"Florida leads the way with nearly 13% of students enrolled in a private school choice program. Arizona follows close behind, with 10% of their students participating in a private school choice program,\" he adds.\n\nBy \"private school choice program,\" Ritter refers to the rapid adoption in recent years of programs that allow students to use all or part of the funding allocated by their state for public school education to pay for private schooling, microschools, homeschooling, and other alternatives. A majority of states now offer some sort of education savings account (ESA), tax credit, or voucher program. The terminology can get confusing and implementation varies from place to place, but ESAs are generally the most flexible while vouchers offer direct payment for tuition at private institutions .\n\nThat's not the end of it. Plenty of families make their own education decisions without going through one of these programs. Drawing on the most current data, Ritter breaks down school attendance accordingly: 2.2 percent of students attend private schools through an educational choice program, 6.8 percent attend private school by other means (paying tuition themselves, private scholarships, and the like), 74.8 percent attend a traditional public school, 4.9 percent attend a magnet school, 6.6 percent attend a privately run but publicly funded charter school, and 4.7 percent are homeschooled.\n\nAlong with private school choice programs, homeschooling has seen rapid growth in recent years. Many families stepped in to teach their children when public health policies shuttered traditional public schools, and they discovered they liked both the process and the results.\n\nBased on Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey data, Johns Hopkins University's Homeschool Hub , which focuses on DIY education, estimates that in the 2022-2023 school year, 5.82 percent of American K-12 students were homeschooled (numbers vary for this inconsistently tracked option).\n\nSince then, Johns Hopkins researchers have seen continued growth in homeschooling. Not all states count homeschoolers, but of 21 states reporting data for the 2023-2024 school year as of this past September, \"there are three states with continued growth, meaning that there was no post-pandemic decline.... Sixteen states show a rebounding trend, meaning that there was a post-pandemic decline, in some cases several years of a decline, and then, in 2023-2024, the number of homeschoolers increased again.\" Only two states saw declines in the ranks of homeschoolers, and in one of those (New Hampshire), the drop may result from a change in how homeschooled students who use ESAs are classified.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the growing adoption of different types of education reflects a shift towards what parents of school-age children say they would pick if they could. In December 2024, Morning Consult/EdChoice pollsters asked , \"If given the option, what type of school would you select in order to obtain the best education for your child?\" Among school parents, 8 percent picked charter schools, 13 percent chose homeschooling, 12 percent favored religious private schools, 20 percent chose secular private schools, 35 percent selected public schools in their district, and 6 percent preferred out-of-district public schools (the remainder didn't know or had no opinion).\n\nSo, removing legal barriers to options and making it easier for people to afford them rather than pay for tuition on top of taxes allows families to move closer to the education approaches they want for their children. The growing adoption of these options makes it clear that people mean what they say.\n\nUnsurprisingly, when people get what they prefer, they're reasonably happy with the outcome. The same poll (which is conducted monthly) asked parents, \"to what extent are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your child's/children's experiences with the following types of schooling?\" Eighty-one percent of school parents reported being very or somewhat satisfied with charter schools, 94 percent reported satisfaction with homeschooling, 90 percent were satisfied with religious private schools, 88 percent said they were satisfied with secular private schools, 80 percent were satisfied with in-district public schools, and 85 percent satisfied with out-of-district public schools.\n\nThat said, majorities of parents were \"very satisfied\" only with homeschooling and both religious and secular private schools. By and large, parents of school-age children are pretty happy with their kids' education, and that's especially true when it's one they've obviously chosen themselves.\n\nSchool choice has long been popular among Americans, and that hasn't changed as options proliferate and families have increased opportunity to jettison schooling that doesn't work for their kids and replace it with something that does. For some, that may be traditional public schools, and for others it's a wide range of private schools with different philosophies or one of the many DIY learning approaches bundled under the term \"homeschooling.\" When asked, the public makes it clear it wants freedom to choose.\n\nThe American Federation for Children maintains records of years of polling on the question: \"School choice gives parents the right to use the tax dollars designated for their child's education to send their child to the public or private school which best serves their needs. Generally speaking, would you say you support or oppose the concept of school choice?\" The idea consistently draws support from roughly two-thirds to three-quarters of respondents.\n\nAfter the chaos of fumbled school closures and lost learning time during the COVID-19 pandemic and simultaneous schoolroom culture-war battles over what is taught and how to teach it, it would be surprising to see anything else. Why not opt out of a headache if you can choose something better?\n\nAmericans want school choice and they're happy when they get it. There's a lesson in there.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D. Tuccille.

      "text": "Trump Expands School Choice, Narrows What Schools Can Teach\n\nNational School Choice Week\n\nEmma Camp | 1.30.2025 1:30 PM\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed a pair of executive orders that could transform public K-12 education in the United States. The first is an order directing federal grants to help fund state-level school choice programs, and the second attempts to ban so-called \"radical indoctrination\" in K-12 education.\n\nThe school choice order directs the secretary of education to issue guidance on how states can use federal formula funds to fund \"K-12 educational choice initiatives.\" The order also contains provisions to expand school choice opportunities for low-income families, military families, and those eligible for Bureau of Indian Education schools.\n\n\"When our public education system fails such a large segment of society, it hinders our national competitiveness and devastates families and communities,\" the order reads. \"For this reason, more than a dozen States have enacted universal K-12 scholarship programs, allowing families-rather than the government-to choose the best educational setting for their children.\"\n\nThe second order denies federal funding to K-12 schools that engage in \"illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.\" Under examples of this \"discriminatory ideology,\" the order lists teaching like \"members of one race, color, sex, or national origin are morally or inherently superior to members of another race, color, sex, or national origin,\" or that \"an individual, by virtue of the individual's race, color, sex, or national origin, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously.\" The order also reinstates the 1776 Commission, a group dedicated to promoting \"patriotic education.\"\n\nWhile Trump's school-choice executive order primarily works to allow states to use federal funds to expand school-choice programs, his order against Critical Race Theory attempts to reshape the ideological tenor of many public school curricula. Governments generally have wide latitude to direct curriculum decisions in public schools, but there's reason to be cautious of orders like this. Many \"divisive concepts\" measures, like this executive order, are \"so vague that they arguably forbid teaching about slavery or racism at all, even uncontroversial and anodyne statements of historical fact,\" warns the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), a First Amendment group.\n\nHowever, it's almost certain that the \"radical indoctrination\" executive order is constitutional. While similar laws have generally not been upheld when they've been applied to universities, laws like Florida's STOP WOKE Act have been allowed to go forward in their applications for K-12 schools. Public university professors have full First Amendment rights, but public K-12 teachers face much stricter limits on academic freedom.\n\n\"Imprinting anti-American, subversive, harmful, and false ideologies on our Nation's children not only violates longstanding anti-discrimination civil rights law in many cases, but usurps basic parental authority,\" reads the order . \"Demanding acquiescence to 'White Privilege' or 'unconscious bias,' actually promotes racial discrimination and undermines national unity.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "You Prefer 'High-Quality Public Education' Over School Choice? Define 'High-Quality.'\n\nSchool Choice\n\nJ.D. Tuccille | 4.10.2023 7:00 AM\n\nArizona has one of the more liberating school-choice policies in the country, allowing funding for a student's education to follow that child to chosen learning options. The state also has a newly minted governor who is hostile to education freedom. Despite attending a private school, Katie Hobbs wants to roll back the state's scholarship program and offer all kids \"high-quality public education\" instead. With her allies, she pretends that's a goal easily defined and achieved with more money, instead of a hotly debated topic involving irreconcilable differences over priorities, education philosophies, and ideology.\n\nAfter Hobbs opposed school choice in her inaugural address , Fox News Sunday host Shannon Bream asked , \"Why shouldn't all students have a chance at what you said was so important in your own life?\", especially in light of \"the private Catholic high school that you went to.\"\n\n\"My parents made that choice,\" Hobbs answered. \"I begged them to send me to public school. We sacrificed a lot. There were times when we were on food stamps. So, it was a choice that they made, and they struggled to make that choice. What I want is for every student in the state of Arizona, no matter where they live, to have access to high-quality public education.\"\n\nOK. So, beyond throwing her parents under the bus for picking a school other than the default one assigned by government, Hobbs clearly thinks that \"high-quality public education\" is a knowable and achievable standard. She's not alone in that assumption; the American Federation of School Administrators also holds \"high-quality public education\" in opposition to independently chosen alternatives, as does the American Association of University Women of California . Nina Rees of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools argued there should be an enforceable right to a high-quality public education even while conceding that \"endless struggle between the federal government and the states often leaves education policy mired in half measures and recriminations.\"\n\nBut if high-quality public education is a shared standard, what's the source of that endless struggle? Could it be that we don't all agree on what high-quality education looks like?\n\nYou are reading The Rattler from J.D. Tuccille and Reason . Get more of J.D.'s commentary on government overreach and threats to everyday liberty.\n\nΔ\n\n\"A recent Pew Research Center survey found widespread partisan divisions in the topics that parents of K-12 students across the country believe are appropriate for children to learn about in school,\" Pew reported last week. \"A 56% majority of districts in Democratic-voting areas mention their diversity, equity and inclusion [DEI] efforts in their mission statements. That is true of just 26% of districts in Republican-voting areas, a difference of 30 percentage points.\"\n\nThe split can also be expressed as a rural vs. urban/suburban divide over the ideologically charged issue. Either way, there's sharp disagreement on incorporating DEI themes into curricula. That's unsurprising, given that DEI often stands in for other differences of opinion on sensitive educational matters.\n\n\"Americans are deeply divided over how much children in K-12 schools should be taught about racism and sexuality, according to a new poll,\" the AP reported a year ago. \"The poll from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows stark differences between Republicans and Democrats who want to see schools make adjustments.\"\n\nFar beyond race, sexuality, and DEI issues, Americans have long disagreed on interpretations of history and current events. That's why publishers tailor lessons in school textbooks for different audiences around the country.\n\n\"The books have the same publisher. They credit the same authors. But they are customized for students in different states, and their contents sometimes diverge in ways that reflect the nation's deepest partisan divides,\" correspondent Dana Goldstein wrote in 2020 for The New York Times .\n\nOK, so forget about divisive curricula. We can at least agree on measuring our success at teaching kids the basics, right? Well, no.\n\nRecent years saw a revolt against standardized testing in schools across the country. Many parents and students opted out, no matter what the rules said. \"The problem, as educrats are discovering, is that there's a hell of a lot less agreement than they thought about what kids are supposed to learn, how they're supposed to learn it, and how fast it should be learned,\" I wrote in 2015.\n\nMuch of the controversy was over the adoption of Common Core standards for English language arts and mathematics at various grade levels. While intended as a means of guaranteeing high-quality education , it turned out that not everybody was on-board.\n\n\"Since the beginning of this year, many legislators and critics have dubbed Common Core 'developmentally inappropriate,'\" North Carolina Public Radio noted in 2014. \"They argue that the new Math and English standards should be repealed because they are not suitable for some students.\"\n\nThe debate echoed an earlier one over national educational standards set by the No Child Left Behind Act. \"With its emphasis - obsession, critics would say - on standardized testing, the law became unpopular among many teachers and parents and technically expired in 2007,\" NPR reported in 2015.\n\nLawmakers in conservative states are again pushing back against federal dominance of education, this time with a combination of resistance to burdensome regulations and objections to politicized curricula.\n\n\"Republican leaders in two states - Tennessee and Oklahoma - have taken steps to cut ties with the U.S. Department of Education, arguing that they'd rather lose billions in federal funding than comply with what they view as onerous mandates from Washington,\" according to education-focused The74 .\n\nSo, when Hobbs and her allies argue that school choice, which lets families pick the educational philosophies, environments, and curricula that suit them, is a distraction from \"high-quality public education,\" just whose definition of \"high-quality\" do they have in mind? Clearly, there's not just one.\n\nWe've spent decades arguing over lesson content, educational standards, and assessment methods only to discover time and again that Americans simply don't agree on these issues. Why isn't it better to encourage people to explore their own definitions of high-quality education for their children instead of trying to force all kids into one-size-fits-some government institutions that are doomed to serve as battlegrounds for people who could, instead, peacefully go their own way?\n\nHobbs may publicly resent her parents for sacrificing to send her to private school instead of the public institution she says she'd have preferred. But she wants to put all children in the position of suffering schools inflicted on them by government officials. School choice frees families to choose from a range of options that meet their definition of \"high quality.\" If more people can pick the education that suits them now, that means fewer people resenting Hobbs and company in the future.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D.

      "text": "Could School Choice Work at the Federal Level?\n\nSchool Choice\n\nAaron Garth Smith | 2.15.2025 7:00 AM\n\nPresident Donald Trump's recent executive order indicates that school choice is on the way for military families and students in the Bureau of Indian Education, but there's momentum building in Congress for something even bolder: a federal tax credit scholarship program that would unleash school choice across all 50 states. For those who support education freedom, this might seem like the holy grail of K-12 policy-but there's good reason to be wary of federal involvement in school choice.\n\nThe Educational Choice for Children Act (ECCA) proposes tax credits for individuals and businesses that donate to scholarship-granting organizations (SGOs)-nonprofits responsible for awarding funding to students. Households with an income not greater than 300 percent of the area median gross income would be eligible to receive funding. The program would initially be capped at $10 billion-enough to give about 2 million students $5,000 each. Families could use these dollars on a variety of educational expenses, including private school tuition, tutoring, and homeschooling curricula.\n\nTax credit scholarships are a fixture at the state level. Twenty-two states have similar policies in place, and scholarships are paid for with private contributions, not public dollars. The ECCA goes to impressive lengths to protect families and SGOs against burdensome regulations, including promising \"maximum freedom to provide for the needs of the participants without governmental control\" and barring the ability of \"any Federal, State, or local government entity...to mandate, direct, or control any aspect of any scholarship granting organization.\"\n\nThe potential upside of the bill is huge. Overnight, millions of students could gain access to public school alternatives, dealing a significant blow to the teachers unions' stranglehold over K-12 education. For families in places like California, New York, and Connecticut-blue states with little hope of adopting school choice-the ECCA could provide an immediate lifeline, especially for those who might struggle to afford private options.\n\nFamilies in states with existing school choice programs-like Arkansas, New Hampshire, and West Virginia-would also benefit since funds from the federal program could be combined with dollars from state programs. School choice participants receive less funding than public school students, and extra resources would give families even more options and help cultivate a more robust marketplace of K-12 providers.\n\nIt's easy to see why school choice advocates are lining up to support the ECCA. But in the long run, inviting the federal government into school choice could prove detrimental.\n\nThe ECCA would make private providers vulnerable to far-reaching regulations that fundamentally change the K-12 marketplace. Because scholarships aren't funded with public dollars, private schools couldn't be regulated directly under the program. But they could be caught in the crosshairs if federal lawmakers decided to target SGOs, such as by regulating how they operate or establishing requirements for where scholarship dollars can go.\n\nPrivate schools that grow dependent on federal dollars could then be forced to comply with federal dictates around admissions, testing, curricula, and countless other things. Regulations like these would make private schools more like public schools, reducing the benefits of school choice and offering families fewer meaningful options. While similar threats exist for state-level school choice programs, giving the public school lobby a one-stop shop in D.C. would raise the stakes for everyone. Burdensome mandates would no longer be confined to just one state and could easily affect thousands of private providers. Because the most likely path to passing the ECCA is through budget reconciliation , it would be even easier for opponents to uproot the bill's safeguards.\n\nFor those who want educational freedom, the federal government has a legitimate constitutional role in providing more options to military families, students attending Bureau of Indian Education schools, and those living in D.C. But that's where its involvement in school choice should end. The ECCA, as crafted, provides little cause for concern-but there's virtually no chance it will stay that way for long.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs Wants To Hobble School Choice, Despite Years of Student Achievement Gains\n\nSchool Choice\n\nChristian Barnard | 2.29.2024 2:01 PM\n\nBefore the start of the state legislative session in January, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, proposed a plan to heavily regulate the state's universal education savings account (ESA) program. Her proposal aims to make private schools comply with some of the same standards adhered to by public schools, including requiring that private school teachers meet \"minimum education requirements\" before teaching ESA students and that private schools provide special education students the same services they had received in public schools. Additionally, she wants to require that students attend public schools for 100 days before receiving an ESA and for the state to audit expenditures at choice-participating private schools.\n\nHobbs's plan is an attempt to stifle Arizona's booming ESA program and bureaucratize private schools into operating much like the public schools that ESA students already opted out of. It also comes on the heels of a failed attempt to repeal the state's ESA program last year. Like last year, the state's Republican-controlled legislature is unlikely to go along with her measures and already killed one of the bills sponsored by Hobbs allies before it made it to committee in February.\n\nHobbs will find it difficult to rein in school choice in Arizona-not just because so many families are benefiting from it, but students also made impressive academic improvements while choice expanded over the past two decades.\n\nNational and state level trends in student achievement, public school staffing, and education funding for all 50 states are detailed in Public Education at a Crossroads , a new study by the Reason Foundation (the nonprofit that publishes this magazine). Because of lags in when the federal data are published, the paper only covers trends prior to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2003-2019, Arizona students made substantial gains across the board on student achievement as measured by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), better known as the Nation's Report Card. Across fourth- and eighth-grade NAEP scores for reading and math, Arizona ranks in the top ten in achievement growth when compared to other states, except for fourth-grade math scores for low-income students, where it ranks 14th. Fourth-grade scores for reading and math grew by 7 and 9 points, respectively. Eighth-grade scores on reading and math improved by 4 and 9 points.\n\nThe NAEP improvements are even more pronounced for low-income students. For Arizona students eligible for free and reduced-price lunches, fourth-grade reading and math scores grew by 8 and 9 points, respectively, and eighth-grade reading and math scores grew by 7 and 12 points.\n\nArizona also managed to improve student achievement while eschewing the conventional demands for more money and smaller class sizes in public schools. In 2002-2020, per-student revenues for public education only grew in inflation-adjusted terms from $10,353 to $10,790, a 4.2 percent increase that ranks the state 47th nationally in per-student revenue growth. Nor has the state prioritized reducing class sizes or adding support staff: Despite enrollment growth of 25 percent in 2002-2020, Arizona's public school staff only grew by 13.7 percent over the same timeframe. By comparison, public schools nationwide added staff at more than twice the rate of student enrollment growth.\n\nInstead, Arizona spent the past few decades extending a breadth of education options to families. It was an early adopter of charter schools and public school open enrollment in 1994. The state also established the nation's first tax credit scholarship program in 1997 and the nation's first ESA program in 2011. Beginning in 2022, Arizona's ESA program, which was initially only available for students with disabilities, expanded to universal student eligibility and now serves over 75,000 students . Charter schools currently serve more than 20 percent of the state's public school population, a larger proportion than any other state.\n\nOver this period, educational approaches that would be considered experimental in other states have matured and found comfortable niches in Arizona. Arizona Autism Charter Schools , currently with four campuses, specialize in serving kids with autism spectrum disorder and have been operating since 2013. Many of the state's other well-established charters have diverse instructional approaches including Montessori, STEM-focused, and classical education. There's even an environmental sustainability focused charter school for Navajo children in rural Arizona. Prenda, the popular microschool management platform , supports 149 private and charter-partnered microschools in Arizona. In Phoenix, the Black Mothers Forum adapted Prenda's model to better fit the needs of black families early in the pandemic.\n\nTo be sure, Arizona students don't fare as well in absolute NAEP rankings. For instance, the state's fourth-graders rank 44th and 36th nationally in overall reading and math scores. But it's hard to know the extent to which greater investments in public education would have led to better outcome growth in Arizona. Consider New York , which led the nation in per-student revenue growth in 2002-2020-increasing from $18,054 to $30,723, or 70.2 percent. Despite those massive funding increases, New York students made almost no NAEP gains over that period. In fact, Arizona's low-income students outscore New York's low-income students in fourth- and eighth-grade math.\n\nThe fact that students have gained academic ground in Arizona's choice-rich, fiscally conservative context cuts against Hobbs's attempt to hamper the state's ESA program. Parents in the Grand Canyon state have already proven themselves capable of holding schools accountable without her help.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "School Choice Is Winning in Arizona-and Beyond\n\nSchool Choice\n\nJohn Stossel | 9.28.2022 1:00 PM\n\nFinally! Now more states will let parents use their tax money to educate their kids at a school they choose.\n\nIn Arizona, families can get $6,500 to spend on private school, tutoring, or even homeschooling.\n\nThe education establishment is horrified-especially teachers unions. They don't want competition.\n\nBut competition makes us all better. The Ford Model T was a breakthrough. But it's lousy compared to what we have today. That's because carmakers compete to make better cars.\n\nBut American education has barely changed since the days of Henry Ford. Kids still sit in a room, watching a teacher at a blackboard.\n\nFor my video this week, I debate a union leader.\n\nHe's David Walrod, president of the Fairfax, Virginia, chapter of the American Federation of Teachers. The AFT has been controlled by union boss Randi Weingarten for 14 years. I once provoking her by saying, \"Unionized monopolies like yours fail!\"\n\n\"We are not a unionized monopoly!\" she replied. \"Folks who want to say this...don't really care about kids.\"\n\nWeingarten won't talk to me anymore, so I'm glad Walrod would.\n\n\"What's wrong with giving parents a choice?\" I ask. After all, competition makes us try harder.\n\n\"If I compete directly against you, I have a vested interest in doing better than you,\" he said.\n\nIsn't that good?\n\n\"Not in education,\" he replies. Parental choice would just \"duplicate bureaucracy.\"\n\nBut his schools are already drowning in bureaucracy. They spend $16,505 per student! That's more than $300,000 per classroom. $300,000 would fund several good teachers, but the bureaucracy prevents that money from going to actual teaching.\n\n\"Any ideas you have for lowering bureaucracy-you're not gonna hear any disagreement from the teachers union,\" says Walrod.\n\nBut his union supports the complex rules that protect every teacher's job.\n\n\"Teachers that aren't up to snuff should be let go,\" says Walrod.\n\nBut the school's human resources handbook makes that nearly impossible. Fairfax schools spent more than $70,000 on lawyers trying to fire a teacher they considered incompetent. They failed.\n\nAnother reason some parents want to escape government-run schools is because during the pandemic, many stayed closed while private schools reopened.\n\n\"There are definitely valid arguments to say that some districts played it too cautious,\" Walrod admits, \"but we were dealing with an ongoing health crisis...CDC guidelines.\"\n\nI push back. \"Seems like you were eager to embrace the CDC's message...so you didn't have to go to work!\"\n\n\"Online teaching was harder than in-person teaching,\" Walrod responds. Really.\n\nAttitudes like that are a reason 5,000 students left Fairfax public schools during the pandemic.\n\nAnother reason was: hard-left indoctrination.\n\nFairfax paid Ibram X. Kendi $20,000 for a one-hour Zoom presentation on racism .\n\nMaybe Fairfax parents want their tax money spent this way. But I bet not all do.\n\nIf parents want their kids to study critical race theory, wear masks, or learn that America constantly oppresses people, they should be able to choose a school that offers that.\n\nBut they should have a choice.\n\nChoice would allow families to \"take their children to institutions that best align with their values,\" says education researcher Corey DeAngelis.\n\nWalrod had told me, \"Public schools have consistently outperformed charter schools.\"\n\nWhen I asked for evidence, he said, \"Look in educational policy journals.\"\n\nSome studies have found that school choice hasn't raised test scores.\n\nThat's \"cherry-picking the evidence,\" says DeAngelis. Most studies found test score gains.\n\nAdditionally, \"Public schools actually upped their game in response to competition.\"\n\nThat was an unexpected benefit.\n\nAfter school choice was allowed in Washington, D.C., both charter and public schools improved. That's a win for kids and taxpayers.\n\n\"Government-run schools spend over $30,000 per year [per student] in D.C. The voucher's only about a third of that,\" says DeAngelis.\n\nThere aren't many reforms that bring results like that.\n\n\"For a long time...the only special interest group was the teachers unions,\" says DeAngelis. \"Now there's a new special interest group in town: parents.\"\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2022 BY JFS PRODUCTIONS INC.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Most People Support School Choice. Why Won't They Vote For It?\n\nSchool Choice\n\nEmma Camp | 11.7.2024 2:00 PM\n\nOn Tuesday, voters in Nebraska, Kentucky, and Colorado rejected school choice at the ballot box, voting against two pro-school choice state Constitutional Amendments and moving to repeal a school choice law. The defeat of all three measures signals a turning tide for school choice policies. After several years of major legislative and electoral successes-and a night where Republican politicians, who are more likely to support these measures, overperformed-voters themselves seemed resistant to approving individual pro-school choice ballot measures. However, this outcome isn't exactly surprising.\n\n\"School choice has never-at least not that I can think of-been approved in a popular vote,\" says Neal McCluskey, the director of The Cato Institute's Center for Educational Freedom. \"We see polling that typically shows people support school choice if you just sort of present them with, 'hey, we could give you money and then you could use it to go seek the education of your choice.'\" But, McCluskey adds, highly motivated public education employees manage to dominate the conversation when it comes to ballot measures.\n\n\"Referenda for school choice are always at a disadvantage because you're trying to take on entrenched, easily organized interests who defend the status quo and they can put a lot of money into defending the status quo and a lot of boots on the ground,\" says McCluskey.\n\nIn Nebraska, voters moved to repeal a school choice bill signed into law earlier this year. The law, Legislative Bill 1402 , created scholarships allowing certain families-including low-income families, military families, those with special-needs children, or children facing other challenges like bullying-to allow eligible families to pay for private school with private money.\n\nIn Kentucky, voters also rejected Amendment 2 , a measure that would have enabled the state legislature to fund school choice programs like charter schools, tax-credit vouchers, education savings accounts, or other backpack funding programs that would give parents the ability to use some of the money that would have funded their child's public school education to help fund private or homeschooling.\n\nIn Colorado, voters also rejected a school choice Amendment, though Colorado voters came the closest to passing the measure-the tally hovered around 52 percent voting \"no\" and 48 percent voting \"yes\" when the race was called by The New York Times on Thursday. The ballot measure, Amendment 80 , aimed to enshrine a right to school choice into the state's constitution. The text of the measure states that \"All children have the right to equal opportunity to access a quality education; that parents have the right to direct the education of their children; and that school choice includes neighborhood, charter, private, and home schools, open enrollment options, and future innovations in education.\"\n\nDespite polling indicating generally broad support for school choice, it's hard for pro-school choice groups to combat intense campaigns from anti-choice advocates, who frequently frame the measures as destroying or defunding local schools.\n\n\"A lot of parents would probably like to have school choice, but they have regular jobs. They're not sure, even if school choice passes that they're going to get it. They're not sure how to use it. But the status quo or the establishment knows that they could lose money and they don't like that,\" says McCluskey. \"You have a highly motivated, relatively easily organized group of people who will defend the status quo, and it's very hard to balance that out on the pro-school choice side, in large part because parents can't go out every weekend and campaign for it.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Employees who used to depend on company stock performance or pensions for their retirement savings now have the option to diversify their assets across many industries, countries and equity styles. They have more control over the outcome of their investments, and can seek independent advice about how to best grow their nest eggs. But trying to choose from an ever-expanding list of investment options can sometimes leave investors at a loss. It's like flipping through a menu with course after course of exotic dish descriptions, but ordering a burger by default. It may not be the best option, but it's the one that you know. \"The risk of too many choices is that investors just get paralyzed,\" says Christine Benz, director of mutual fund analysis for Morningstar. The first step in successfully navigating a growing list of options is to set some goals. Before you ever call a broker, open a 529 or IRA, or pull up your 401(k) fund online and start choosing funds, think about what you want your investments to do for you. The mix of stocks versus bonds is going to look very different for someone who is aiming to retire at 50 than it is for someone who'd be happy working until their late 70s. When in doubt about how much to save, overestimate. \"For years financial advisors recommended that you shoot for 80% of your working-years income during retirement,\" says Jim Baka, senior vice president and director of investment management services for Calamos Investments. \"But people are living longer; they want to travel or spend time with the grandkids. Now everyone's saying you might need 100% of your earned income while you were working, and that should be your target.\" Once you've set some dollar goals, it's time to narrow your options. Letting too many choices baffle you can hurt long-term returns. Using 401(k)s to illustrate the point, a study by Columbia Business School on the impact of choices in 401(k) plans found that the more mutual funds available, the less likely an employee is to invest - and those who do are more likely to pick safe options like low-yielding money market accounts. Those in the business refer to it as \"choice overload,\" something that can lead to investor inertia, risk aversion and lower returns from your portfolio. The situation becomes even stickier when investors try to look at the big picture, not just their 401(k) plans.\n\n\"It's a big problem,\" says Benz. \"Most people have multiple accounts - a retirement account, a couple of IRAs, a spouse's account, and you may end up with many more funds than you need, and too much to keep track of. You end up with a portfolio that's like an expensive index fund.\"\n\nPage: 2 , 3 , 4"

      "text": "A Nonbinary Choice\n\nSpare us the benefit of your cleverness this election season.\n\nYou stink at game theory.\n\nProbably you do. Most people do. Do you know how a lot of men think they know how to fight or throw a football or ... run the executive branch of the U.S. government ... without ever having been taught how to do it? You know what those guys sound like when they talk? That's what I hear when people talk about strategic voting.\n\nPat Toomey, the admirable conservative and former senator from Pennsylvania, just invited a torrent of bootless attempts to display cleverness when he announced that, come November, he would vote neither for Donald Trump nor for Kamala Harris for president. While I suspect there is some politics-of-cooties at work there-nobody who wants a future in Republican politics wants to be on the record voting for Harris-it is an entirely defensible position. Nonetheless, the harrumphs arose thundering from the Schuylkill Expressway to Crosstown Boulevard, from points in between and from points beyond.\n\nUnlike most of the people who agonize in public about their presidential vote-the 97 percent of public agonizers who reside in New York City, California, or Washington and whose public agonizing thus amounts to something less consequential than a vague rumor of donkey squat-Toomey lives in a battleground state. Pennsylvania could -and very well may-decide the 2024 election.\n\nBut, even if it does, Toomey's vote is unlikely to be a matter of historical significance. It is very, very unlikely that either Trump or Harris will win the Keystone State by a single vote. No single vote, even in the most closely split state, has much consequence in that way.\n\nVotes are aggregate things, and they are expressive things.\n\nConsider the case of Texas: Mitt Romney won Texas in 2012, and Donald Trump won Texas in 2016 and in 2020-but Romney won with 57.2 percent of the vote, while Trump underperformed him by 5 points in 2016 and then underperformed himself, slightly, in 2020, declining from 52.2 percent of the vote to 52.0 percent of the vote. The Republican (or \"Republican,\" Trump being a literal RINO) won in every case, but Texas voters are sending the GOP a message. If Trump should win Texas by an even smaller margin in 2024, that also will be significant, though it will have no effect on the outcome of the election. Of course it is the case that, at some point, losing 5 points here and a fraction of a point there means losing the state, because states flip Hemingway style: gradually, then suddenly.\n\nThe sudden part makes the headlines, even though the gradual part is where the real evolution happens. The GOP's position in Texas in 2020 already was 11.6 points lower than the high-water mark of 1984. (Fun nugget: Ronald Reagan set the benchmark in Texas at a time when the state was Democrat-dominated, having elected only one Republican governor since Reconstruction, nearly two decades before Republicans would finally win control of the statehouse.) Losing another few points would flip the state (Joe Biden took 46.5 percent of the vote in 2020) but would be in absolute terms a smaller decline than the (halting and inconsistent) one the GOP has seen since 1984.\n\nWith that in mind, there are a couple of ways of approaching a vote in a presidential election. The first and most obvious-and the one I recommend-is: voting for the candidate you prefer. (A subset of that approach is not voting if you don't like any of the candidates: That, too, is usefully expressive.) The second is: voting to send a message to one party or the other. If (to stick with the earlier case) Trump's vote share in Texas declines a bit more in 2024, then that will tell Republicans something. But-and here is where I suppose my Bulwark friends and Joe Scarborough et al. really have their heads-it makes a difference whether Harris' share of the vote goes up , too, or if Trump simply bleeds votes to the Libertarian Party or to Mitch Daniels or whomever it is my friend in Tarrant County is writing in. A voter who goes from the GOP to the Libertarians is a loss of one vote, but a voter who goes from the GOP to the Democrats is, in effect, a two-vote loss: Minus one for Trump and plus one for Harris. And if that is the message you want to send-or if you are a Democrat who wants to vote for Donald Trump to ... I don't know, maybe punish your party for failing to stage a coup d'état the last time it lost an election?-that's how you do it. You add your voice to the other voices making the same point or a complementary one.\n\nThat's all good.\n\nBut don't inflict your \"binary choice\" horsefeathers on your friends and the general public. There are lots of ways to use your vote, many of them effective as political expression and almost none of them likely to be very consequential in determining the outcome.\n\nThis isn't really a time for cleverness. It is, as someone once put it, a time for choosing.\n\nKevin D. Williamson is national correspondent at The Dispatch and is based in Virginia.

      "text": "The Obvious Choice\n\nNo need to overthink Josh Shapiro.\n\nThe governor of Pennsylvania is extremely popular with his state's voters. Whoever wins Pennsylvania in November will almost certainly win the presidency . Kamala Harris should therefore choose the governor of Pennsylvania to be her running mate.\n\nThus endeth today's newsletter. What more is there to say?\n\nThere's always more to say. That's my motto, as regular readers of this interminably long daily column know.\n\nHarris has yet to announce her selection as I write this on Monday but the only serious contender left beside Josh Shapiro appears to be another governor, Tim Walz of Minnesota. And if I squint hard, I can kind of see why she might prefer Walz.\n\nNot really, but kind of.\n\nIf you believe Harris' greatest electoral liability is with working-class voters who are drifting away from the left , Walz is arguably superior to Shapiro. Former Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, himself a working-class Midwestern Democrat, made the case for the Minnesotan in an op-ed Monday. Walz is \"a high school teacher, a football coach, and a 24-year veteran of the Army National Guard,\" Ryan wrote. \"Born and raised in a small town, he has spent his career working on agriculture, veterans, and rural issues-key areas that resonate with voters in the Midwest and beyond.\"\n\nHe's neither a businessman nor a lawyer by trade, as Harris and Shapiro are, which gives Walz a degree of populist credibility that's rare nowadays among the leaders of a party run by, and increasingly for, the professional class. He's also unapologetically progressive , especially on labor issues, and displays a no-nonsense common touch in public appearances. He's pugnacious in television interviews too, a quality that's built him a national fan base in the span of a few weeks. He might plausibly be a better attack dog against Republicans on the trail than Shapiro.\n\nHe's the populist choice, simply put, a Sherrod Brown type whom Trumpy rural Midwestern voters might find relatable despite his ardent leftism. And maybe Kamala Harris needs that, as those voters are apt to find her not so relatable-not because of her race and sex (or not just because of that) but because she hails from the same overeducated technocratic class that now dominates Democratic politics.\n\nYou want \"balance\" on the ticket? Then you need Walz, a beer-track guy in a party dominated by wine-trackers like Shapiro and Pete Buttigieg.\n\nBecause he's the closest thing on the menu to Bernie Sanders, choosing Walz could also provide left-wing cover for Harris to tack toward the center aggressively on policy. Her flip-flopping so far has been low-key and conducted through campaign statements; once she starts doing debates and interviews, progressives will pay closer attention to her reversals and grow irritated at seeing her abandon the hard-left positions she took as a candidate in 2019.\n\nThrowing them a bone by picking Walz will ease that irritation and sustain the sense of unity in the party that's prevailed since she replaced Joe Biden as nominee. No matter how Harris positions herself on policy thereafter, leftists will have the consolation that one of their own is on the ticket and poised to be a credible presidential candidate himself in 2028 or 2032.\n\nWalz wouldn't be a terrible pick the way Buttigieg, say, would be terrible . But I still prefer Shapiro. And not just for the obvious reason that if you absolutely must win Pennsylvania, you should probably choose the guy who's most likely to win you Pennsylvania.\n\nI want Harris to win because I want Donald Trump to lose, and I suspect Shapiro would do more than Walz to make that happen.\n\nAlthough I confess to not entirely trusting my own analysis here.\n\nAfter all, it's too convenient for a conservative to believe that a center-left running mate would earn more votes than a hard-left running mate would. I prefer Shapiro to Walz because he's a bit closer to me on policy and so surely it must follow that swing voters will prefer him too, no?\n\nNot necessarily. Whatever good Shapiro does for Harris with centrist voters could be undone and then some by disaffected progressives who boycott the race in protest of his selection. Whereas Walz could turn out the left in droves and still do reasonably well among centrists, if not quite as well as Shapiro, by dint of his populism.\n\nBut I doubt it. The strategic calculation for Harris starts here: What perception of her own politics does she most need to \"balance\" with her choice of running mate?\n\nThe answer, of course, is that she's too left-wing. The Trump campaign has hours of footage of Harris taking far-left positions on the trail as a Democratic primary candidate in 2019, some of which has already been featured in Republican ads down ballot . Trump's going to spend the next three months calling her a not-so-secret communist who's feigning moderation at the moment and will revert to her radical roots once in office.\n\nWhich running mate is more likely to counter that impression as voters begin forming opinions about her? The center-left Shapiro or the hard-left Walz?\n\nShapiro supports school vouchers, has tough-on-crime credentials as a former attorney general and clemency-board member , opposes tearing down monuments to colonial-era statesmen, and seems to disdain the anti-anti-Hamas crowd on campus almost as much as Republicans do. He ran ahead of Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in his home state in 2016 and 2020, respectively, and did well in red areas of Pennsylvania four years ago. \"Shapiro got a slightly lower vote share than Biden did in Philadelphia and the key suburban counties nearby,\" the New York Times reported on Friday, \"but he outperformed Biden in western and rural parts of the state, which are typically more conservative. That might mean he could help Harris in parts of the state where Democrats typically lose.\"\n\nMany anti-Trump conservatives bear Democrats a grudge for describing the threat of a second Trump presidency in existential terms while doing nothing to moderate on policy for the sake of building a winning coalition with them. Prominent Republicans are willing to go to bat for Harris against the common enemy despite her reputation for being further left than Biden; what they need from her is a gesture to show Nikki Haley voters that Harris is more moderate than they had believed. Choosing Shapiro over Walz is her opportunity to do that.\n\nAll of this is up in smoke if snubbing Walz really would trigger a significant left-wing backlash, but I'm with Tim Miller in believing that threat is overhyped. Most leftists are giddy at having been unburdened by what has been and are now laser-focused on what can be. The Shapiro versus Walz debate, Miller writes, is \"taking place in a hermetically sealed bubble among political hobbyists who have extremely strong feelings about the ideological trajectory of the Democratic primary ... and nobody else. They are a fraction of a fraction of the party.\"\n\nMy strong suspicion is that any progressive who's willing to stay home or vote for the Green Party because a guy they'd never heard of a month ago was passed over for VP was always going to find a reason to stay home or vote for the Green Party. The rest will be there early on Election Day no matter who Harris' running mate is. In which case, why not choose the guy who's more likely to make swing voters feel comfortable?\n\nWho knows? The Trump ads about \"Commie-la\" might even bring some disgruntled leftists back around to her side.\n\nTim Walz would be a bolder choice than Josh Shapiro in some respects. He's more of an ideologue, as I've explained, and the electoral upside of choosing him is riskier given Shapiro's stature in the most important swing state.\n\nBut there's one way in which choosing the Pennsylvanian would be arrestingly bold . He's Jewish, and the American left's feelings about Jews in 2024 are, shall we say, complicated . Enough so that anchors on major news networks have mused openly of late about the political \" risk \" Harris would be taking in selecting Shapiro.\n\nThe most influential progressive in America, Bernie Sanders, is Jewish . The governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, is also Jewish and quite popular on the left. By no means have the Walz-loving Bernie bros of the Democratic Party let their hostility to Israel inform their opinion of Jewish politicians generally.\n\nBut it is true that modern progressives increasingly divide Jewish leaders into \"good Jews\" and \"bad Jews\" based on their support for the Jewish state. And \"bad Jews\" like Josh Shapiro come under special suspicion even when their position on Israel is all but indistinguishable from Tim Walz's or Mark Kelly's or any other potential vice presidential pick's.\n\nAmong the shortlist, only Shapiro gets tagged as a genocide enthusiast , \" the one pick who could potentially ruin Democratic unity. \" That's the \"risk\" Harris would be running in selecting him: By elevating a \"bad Jew\" to the West Wing, she'd be flouting the sotto voce progressive belief that Zionist Jews can never be trusted to be tough and clear-eyed where Israel is concerned. Their alleged \"dual loyalty\" will get in the way.\n\nThe governor is no Likudnik- on the contrary -but putting a Jew on the ticket after months of ugly agitation by the \"from the river to the sea\" crowd would have the feel of a rebuke by Harris. It might be received as a \" Sister Souljah moment \" even if she took care not to frame her decision that way, as I expect she would not. (\"Forget about claiming we're the only party standing against anti-semitism,\" one Senate Republican staffer told Jewish Insider about a potential Harris-Shapiro ticket.) If her strategy is to convince centrist voters that she's not the loony leftist they thought she was , few things would communicate that more tersely than running with a guy named Shapiro whom progressives don't like.\n\nWhich is not to say that her strategy will pay off, especially if Iran's war with Israel expands to Lebanon and refocuses American politics on the region. Already Trump is trying to exploit leftist suspicion of Shapiro by warning that if Harris picks him she's going to \" lose her little Palestinian base .\" Maybe-but what she loses on the left she might pick up in the center among Israel supporters who are trying to talk themselves into voting Democratic but keep bumping up against the left's radicalization over \"settler colonialism.\" Those voters exist, you know.\n\nWe also shouldn't discount the effect tribal partisanship might have in cross-pressuring the base on both sides. Some progressives who greet Shapiro's selection suspiciously will come to feel defensive on his behalf as the right attacks him; some nationalists who greet his selection as the least bad option will grow hostile toward him as Harris' chances of winning improve. It's an open question as to which party's garbage populist fringe will sound more antisemitic about him as the campaign winds on.\n\nI'm eager to see how it shakes out. I like clarity in politics, and we've had a lot of it since 2015. Putting Josh Shapiro on the ticket would give us a bit more. Let's find out just how low the two ends of the political horseshoe are willing to go.\n\nThe irony is that, if Harris-Shapiro sweeps to victory despite progressive resistance, he's apt to become one of the left's best friends in the White House. \"The truth is that whatever Shapiro's views, a Jewish vice president would function in precisely the opposite manner from what [his] critics fear,\" Yair Rosenberg wrote recently for The Atlantic . \"Far from a sinister Semitic Svengali suborning the president to an Israeli agenda, a Jewish veep would be trotted out to defend Harris in her inevitable conflicts with Israel's right-wing government, and to insulate the boss from charges of anti-semitism.\"\n\nThat's exactly right. Josh Shapiro would almost certainly end up as a fig leaf for a more pro-Palestinian U.S. foreign policy. Progressives are looking a gift horse in the mouth.\n\nThere's one more reason to root for Shapiro, courtesy of Chris Christie. Call it \"poetic justice.\"\n\nDonald Trump created Josh Shapiro, Christie claimed in an interview on Sunday. And now the governor might be the agent of his political demise.\n\nThat's not exactly true, but it's true enough.\n\nIt's true that Trump endorsed Doug Mastriano, a kook among kooks , in the 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary in Pennsylvania. It's also true that Mastriano's kookery made him a weak candidate and exceedingly easy to beat-so much so that Shapiro ran ads during the Republican primary promoting Mastriano .\n\nShapiro ended up beating him by 15 points, a margin gaudy enough to have helped carry John Fetterman to victory in that year's Senate race elsewhere on the ballot. The governor emerged with a mystique similar to Ron DeSantis in Florida as a politician formidable enough to win by a landslide in an evergreen swing state. If not for Trump, DeSantis would probably be on the national ballot this year. By the time you read this, Shapiro might be on it as well.\n\nChristie did get one important thing wrong, though. He implied that, but for Trump's endorsement, Mastriano wouldn't have won. In reality, Trump withheld his endorsement in that race until three days before the primary. By that point, Mastriano was already up 12 points in the polls and was probably unstoppable.\n\nThis wasn't a repeat of what Trump did in Ohio that year, where he sent J.D. Vance to a come-from-behind victory in the Senate primary by endorsing him. (Another endorsement with major implications for 2024, it turns out.) This was a case of Mastriano seemingly running away with his race and Trump deciding at the last second that he might as well endorse him in order to claim a bit of credit for Mastriano's impending victory.\n\nIt wasn't Trump who created Josh Shapiro by sending a populist tomato can to face him in the general election, in other words. It was Republican primary voters. They preferred Mastriano, just as they usually prefer cranks as nominees to more electable candidates-even in swing states, where they have every reason to know that the path to victory runs through appealing to the center.\n\nThe 2022 midterms were full of terrible decisions like that. Mastriano and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, Kari Lake and Blake Masters in Arizona, Herschel Walker in Georgia: Republican voters swooned for the weirdest slobs in the party . They cost themselves three Senate seats and a couple of governorships that year because they were unable or unwilling to grasp that the most MAGA candidate in the race is not the candidate that's most likely to win.\n\nThen they turned around in 2024 and did the same thing in their presidential primary by choosing a twice-impeached, coup-plotting convicted felon with obvious mental problems over DeSantis and Nikki Haley. At best, Republicans voters remain wildly deluded about the broader national appeal of the politicians whom they like best. At worst, they're indifferent to winning and wielding power and have come to see primaries as little more than referendums on what the right should stand for.\n\nLast week on The Remnant , John Podhoretz of Commentary wondered when the GOP's populist base will finally have the sort of reckoning with political reality that conservatives were forced to have in 2016. Trump proved that year that the grassroots right didn't care about most of the things it had claimed for years to care about. Reaganites had to face that and accept that they'd misunderstood what voters wanted. Trumpists have somehow avoided the same reassessment despite losing the House in 2018, losing the presidency and the Senate in 2020, and losing many more congressional races than expected in 2022 in one of the worst midterm performances for the out-party in decades.\n\nInstead of accepting that they've misunderstood what voters want, Podhoretz noted, the fragile MAGA movement copes with its unpopularity by retreating into fantasies about rigged elections. That's how Mastriano, a conspiracy theorist, got traction in Pennsylvania in the 2022 primary, in fact. And now here we sit, waiting to see if the guy who clobbered him in the general election that year will join the national ticket and deliver the presidency to Democrats on a silver platter.\n\nIt would be the tastiest of just desserts if Donald Trump's political career were to end at the hands of a politician whose own path to power was paved by the populist right's juvenile, self-destructive radicalism. That's reason enough to hope Josh Shapiro is Harris' pick. We'll know soon.\n\nNick Catoggio is a staff writer at The Dispatch and is based in Texas.

      "text": "What Happened to Ranked Choice Voting?\n\nIn more than a half-dozen states, the trendy voting system reform fell flat with voters.\n\nHappy Tuesday! We're looking forward to today's Dispatch Summit and to meeting so many of you in person. If you see us, come say hi!\n\nOn Monday we wrote to you of the recriminations and finger-pointing among Democrats as they grapple with their election defeat last week. In short: It's ugly.\n\nBut ranked choice voting advocates also suffered a pretty serious shellacking on Election Day, though they're managing to be much less fatalistic about it. \"It was a false start down a pathway that people do not like,\" Linda Templin, the executive director of Ranked Choice Voting for Colorado, told TMD .\n\nRanked choice voting has been hailed by its proponents as a reform that could fix democracy. It's often accompanied by the adoption of \"open\" primaries (where any voter can vote in either party's primary) or \"jungle\" primaries (where candidates from all parties on a list advance to a three-, four-, or five-person runoff). But in seven of the 10 places where voters decided whether to adopt it, ranked choice voting lost. Alaska's measure is still awaiting a call, although it looks likely to lose there, too.\n\nVoting reform advocates' limited success is indicative of what may be a discouraging trend for them: difficulty translating the growing success of ranked choice voting in municipal and local elections to larger, statewide, results.\n\nInitiatives related to ranked choice voting and open primaries were on the ballot in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Missouri, Montana , Nevada, Oregon, and South Dakota last week. While the exact nature of each ballot measure varied slightly, the broad thrust of each measure would move the state to some combination of open primaries and ranked-choice voting.* Missouri is the notable exception, as it passed an amendment preemptively banning ranked choice voting.\n\nAmong the only victories? Not a state, but the district of Washington, D.C., where a ballot measure, Initiative 83 , led to the adoption of both ranked choice voting and open primary elections, which would allow people not registered as a member of a political party to vote in that party's primary.\n\nSo what is ranked choice voting? Sometimes called \"instant runoff,\" the system is still relatively unknown to most Americans, and it's a stark change from the standard paradigm of elections in the U.S.-which is perhaps one of the reasons it's been slow to catch on. Typically, a representative from each political party-usually the victors of a competitive primary decided by hardcore partisans-face off in a head-to-head general election.\n\nIn a ranked choice system, voters rank their preferences-usually three or four-from a list of candidates: Mary, Grayson, and James, for example. Votes are then counted in multiple rounds. Say, for the sake of argument, that Mary was the fewest voters' first choice. She would be eliminated from the running and the candidates her voters selected as their second choice would receive a tally in their column. That process of vote redistribution continues until one candidate wins an outright majority.\n\nWhile the process is somewhat confusing, its advocates point out that it fixes some real flaws in established electoral practices. The candidates presented to voters in a general election are usually selected by a highly unrepresentative portion of the electorate: Registered Democrats and Republicans, especially those who choose to vote in primaries, are a small, ideologically committed bunch.\n\n\"Voters are tired of picking the lesser of two evils on Election Day,\" Templin told TMD . In a ranked choice system, \"you simply say who you love, who you like, and who you can live with.\"\n\nBut in most of the U.S., the \"binary choice\" paradigm still exists. For example, the current mayor of Philadelphia, Cherelle Parker, won the general election in 2o23 after winning the Democratic primary with only 32 percent of the vote . She cruised to victory over her beleaguered Republican opponent in the general election, refusing to debate him because, she argued, in a city with a seven-to-one voter registration advantage for the Democrats, it would be a \"waste of campaign resources.\"\n\nAdvocates also argue that ranked choice voting incentivizes candidates to build broad coalitions. A candidate in a ranked choice system would theoretically need to be palatable enough to be not just a committed devotee's first choice, but someone else's second choice, if they hope to succeed in subsequent rounds. Under that system, then, negative campaigning and extreme positions are much less viable strategies than in a traditional partisan primary.\n\nAnd until last week, the system's use had been expanding, particularly in liberal cities and towns. More than 50 cities and municipalities used ranked choice voting, from the city council of Portland, Oregon, to local offices in Memphis, to primary and special elections in New York City. \"We've gone from 10 cities using it in 2016 to 50 cities and two states using it today,\" Deb Otis-the director of research and policy at FairVote, a national organization that researches and advocates for ranked choice voting and proportional representation-told TMD .\n\nAnd now, Washington, D.C., can be added to that list. \"I think a lot of people from across the political spectrum wanted more choice in their elections,\" Porter Bowman, the volunteer communications director for the \"Yes on 83 Campaign,\" told TMD . Bowman noted that the measure enjoyed broad support, winning large majorities in each of Washington's eight wards. It also has support from a range of progressive advocacy groups, from the Sunrise Movement, to the D.C. Working Families Party, to Democracy D.C.-a group that advocates for progressive causes and statehood for the district.\n\nBut entrenched political interests were much less likely to support ranked choice voting and open primaries. The D.C. Democratic Party opposed the measure and the city's Democratic mayor, Muriel Bowser, said she was \"totally against\" the reform. \"I don't think that our very good experience with elections suggests that we need to make any change,\" she said. Only two members of the 12-member D.C. City Council came out in strong support of the measure: Matt Frumin, a Democrat from Ward 3, and Christina Hendrickson, an at-large independent who had introduced a ranked choice bill in 2021.\n\n\"Elected officials wonder how much it will change their campaigns,\" Otis told TMD . \"They know how to win under the old system.\"\n\nMany local and state parties are also waking up to the fact that ranked choice voting could threaten their hold on election processes. Alaska, which adopted ranked choice voting and jungle primaries for national offices, governor, and the state Legislature in 2020, had been considered a poster child by many advocates.\n\nBut it's also been representative of how ranked choice can inspire a determined backlash.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, a moderate Alaska Republican, lost the endorsement of both the Alaska Republican Party and former President Donald Trump in her 2022 reelection bid after she voted to impeach Trump in 2021. But, with the backing of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, she ran as an independent Republican, winning a majority after ranked choice tabulation of the votes in Alaska's top-four jungle primary system.\n\nMurkowski's victory led the group Alaskans for Honest Elections to introduce Measure 2 , which would abolish ranked choice voting in the state. The group adopted the lyrical slogan, \"Let's Take Out the Trash, Let's Rid the Rank.\" Ranked choice proponents claimed Measure 2 was being pushed by outside, Washington-aligned interests; an \"incumbent-protection program,\" in the words of Murkowski's 2022 Republican opponent, Kelly Tshibaka. Measure 2 proponents, like ranked choice critics elsewhere, argued that the system is too confusing for many voters and that it led to misleading or unrepresentative outcomes. Phil Izon, one of the leaders of Alaskans for Honest Elections, pointed to a 2022 special election for a House seat in which former Gov. Sarah Palin and Nick Begich, both Republicans, gained more combined first-choice votes than Democrat Mary Peltola, who eventually won the race.\n\nLast week's anti-ranked choice ballot measure in Alaska gained the endorsements of four state senators and Palin, the first to sign the petition that got it onto the ballot. With 80 percent of the vote counted as of early Tuesday morning, it leads by 1.6 percentage points and seems likely to pass.\n\nThe threat to the power of state parties was probably the poison pill for ranked choice and open primary measures. Templin's organization, for example, remained neutral on Proposition 131 , Colorado's measure that included a top-four, non-partisan jungle primary. She told TMD that the fact that jungle primaries were a deal-breaker for both the state GOP and the state Democrats meant the issue was likely to be doomed all along. \"Leave the parties alone,\" said Templin. \"The problem with top-four primaries is that they eliminate partisan ballot access to the November ballot, so that's a non-starter for the parties.\"\n\nThe future, then, for ranked choice advocates might be to moderate their aims, at least at the state level. Templin pointed to Maine's ranked choice system, which simply implements ranked choice in party primaries and the general election, as a model which could gain more support in the future.\n\nBut advocates who spoke to TMD remained optimistic about the election reform's future prospects. \"We're still seeing tremendous growth for this movement,\" said Otis. \" We understand those who have won under the current system are going to extend effort to fight change, but we still think the future is bright.\"\n\nAssociated Press : Mattel Says It 'Deeply' Regrets Misprint on 'Wicked' Dolls Packaging That Links to Porn Site\n\nGOP Rep.

      "text": "An Unthinkable Choice\n\nDonald Trump's advisers would have put the U.S. military in the position of defying orders or turning their weapons on civilians.\n\nFour John Trumbull paintings hang in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol: one of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, two depicting British surrenders at great American victories of the Revolutionary War, and one titled General George Washington Resigning His Commission . The art is well-chosen, as the act commemorated in the last painting is as important as what happened at Independence Hall, Saratoga, and Yorktown. In it, Washington made clear that he harbored no autocratic ambitions, that the army he commanded remained subject to civilian democratic control, and that it would play no role in domestic politics.\n\nThe painting is also relevant to our current moment. Former President Donald Trump has been charged with four felonies for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As a veteran, my blood ran cold reading two particular passages in special counsel Jack Smith's indictment . They suggest that part of the former president and his co-conspirators' autocratic plan to remain in power, despite knowing that they lost the 2020 election, was to make the U.S. military choose between subservience to civilian control or refusing to undertake an anti-democratic domestic political role.\n\nIn the first passage, it appears that when a deputy White House counsel warned Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark that if Trump remained in office despite the absence of any evidence of outcome-determinative election fraud, riots would break out in U.S. cities, Clark responded, \"That's why there's an Insurrection Act.\" In the second, the indictment reports that when similarly warned of the risk of riots, Trump's outside counsel John Eastman responded that there were points in American history when violence was necessary to protect the republic.\n\nAt the time of these statements, Trump planned to name Clark acting attorney general-the nation's chief law enforcement officer-and Eastman had authored a memorandum advancing an argument, which he privately admitted was without legal merit, that Vice President Mike Pence could unilaterally reject slates of electors pledged to Joe Biden.\n\nTaken together, these statements suggest that Clark and Eastman sought to have the vice president nullify the results of the 2020 election in bad faith, anticipated that this unconstitutional act might lead to widespread unrest, and that they planned for the commander-in-chief to order federal troops (or federalized National Guardsmen) to put down those riots. The armed services were to be told to use force against Americans to keep Trump in office, despite the objective fact, as established in more than 60 judicial proceedings, that Biden won the 2020 election.\n\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807, as amended, provides that a president may, after calling for \"insurgents\" to disperse, use the military to suppress violence that obstructs the execution of federal laws or so hinders the execution of any laws as to deprive citizens of their rights. Clark and Eastman anticipated then-President Trump doing exactly this-using troops against crowds of fellow citizens that, as during the June 2020 disorder after the murder of George Floyd, would inevitably include arsonists, vandals, and looters mixed in with a majority of peaceful protesters.\n\nImagine the scenario: Understandably angry crowds facing young soldiers with little training in responding to civil unrest. Tragic loss of life would occur, and on a scale beyond that of the Boston Massacre of 1770, the Pullman strike of 1894 (during which President Grover Cleveland dispatched federal troops under the Sherman Antitrust Act), or the Kent State shootings of 1970. Events would deteriorate from there.\n\nThe presidential demand anticipated by Clark and Eastman would place military leaders in the excruciating position of responding to an order facially legal under relevant statutes, but given for a purpose inimical to the ideals of the framers of the Constitution to which they swore an oath. Generals would be forced to choose whether to abandon an unbroken tradition of American military obedience to civilian control, or turn their guns on civilians to facilitate a losing candidate remaining in the White House beyond Inauguration Day.\n\nThe foreseeable consequences of Clark, Eastman, and Trump's criminal plot would have been profound for the military and the nation. I suspect the generals would have reluctantly chosen the first of the two bad options they faced. In either case, the republic would still suffer grave damage. If convicted of this conspiracy, that potential harm should be taken into account in the former president's sentencing.\n\nKevin Carroll served as senior counsel to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly (2017-18) and House Homeland Security Committee chairman Peter King (2011-13), and as a CIA and Army officer.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Ranked-Choice Voting Would Dramatically Improve the 2024 Republican Primary\n\nBut Trump would likely still win.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses kick off the 2024 Republican presidential primary today, and Donald Trump is projected to clean up among a dwindling field of challengers-the first step toward a rematch against Joe Biden in the general election.\n\nThe dynamics of this race-which in some ways echo the dynamics of the crowded 2016 Republican primary-have led some to wonder whether Republicans should follow the lead of Democrats in states like Kansas and employ a ranked-choice voting system to select their nominee.\n\nRanked-choice voting (RCV) is a powerful tool. It empowers voters to offer nuanced opinions, encourages candidates to expand their coalitions beyond their bases and, when used to conduct an instant runoff, ensures winners have broad support. Applied properly, RCV offers promise as a reform to our more common \"plurality\" elections.\n\nPerhaps its greatest effect could be found in the presidential primaries.\n\nWhat is ranked-choice voting?\n\nRanked-choice voting (RCV) is a style of election that allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference, ranking as many or as few as they choose.\n\nWith these rankings, states can conduct \" instant runoff \" elections that require the eventual winner to secure majority support. All of the first-choice votes are tallied, and if one candidate has a majority, game over-he or she wins. But if no one has more than 50 percent of the vote, the last-place candidate is eliminated, and his or her voters' ballots are re-tabulated using their second-ranked choices. If still no majority winner is found, the process continues by dropping the last-place candidate, reallocating votes, and re-tabulating until one candidate reaches majority support.\n\nRCV is used in states and localities from Alaska to Maine, and although it has some high-profile detractors , the system regularly earns overwhelming praise from voters. However, not all uses of RCV are equally effective. RCV works best when voters view multiple candidates favorably, and when the winner in a plurality election regularly earns less than 50 percent support. Coincidentally, these are the exact dynamics of a presidential primary .\n\nHow would RCV impact a presidential primary?\n\nBut before wading further down this hypothetical, let's remember the ground rules that impact the outcomes of primary elections.\n\nFirst, the GOP regularly awards an outsize share of delegates to whichever candidate wins a plurality of a state's voters. Unlike Democrats, who grant delegates proportionally in all states, Republicans use a combination of proportional, \"winner-take-all,\" and hybrid options to commit a state's delegation. With many candidates in the race, those with the highest vote total in winner-take-all or hybrid elections wins most or all delegates, even if a majority of voters picked someone else. Trump's 2016 primary victory in South Carolina is instructive: He won all 50 of the state's delegates despite securing less than a third of the vote in the state.\n\nSecond, the primary season truly is a season. Unlike the general election, which centers around one day in November, the primary is a series of elections spread out across the country over months. The results of one state affect voters' choices in the next, and candidates drop out along the way, leaving fewer meaningful options. The combination of \"winner-take-all\" delegate allocation and these shifting dynamics means candidates with strong support early in the race can snowball victories into the nomination. Earning a plurality of votes on Super Tuesday, when more than a dozen states hold their primaries, can be enough to catapult a candidate into the general election.\n\nUnder these circumstances, RCV can be quite powerful. With voters' rankings, a state could conduct an instant runoff and award their delegates to the candidate who is truly the most popular in the state rather than one who has a committed base but turns off a majority of voters. This is especially important early in the cycle, when many candidates are on the ballot and winning a state carries more weight.\n\nRCV can also help solve the problem of \"wasted votes\" on candidates who drop out of the race by reallocating those ballots to still-viable candidates. As absentee and early voting expand across the country, the problem is increasingly acute. In 2016, more than 500,000 votes were cast for Republican candidates who had suspended their campaigns before a given state's election day. In 2020, more than 2 million such votes were cast for Democratic candidates. It's easy to imagine that these voters would have appreciated their ballots counting for their favorite remaining candidate.\n\nAdditionally, RCV may dampen the urge to engage in \"strategic voting.\" Under current rules, voters are often encouraged to focus on polling and support candidates who may not be their first choice but whose campaigns appear more viable. As a result, our primary elections often don't accurately reflect where voters actually stand on the candidates. If a voter likes an unpopular candidate, RCV allows them to demonstrate their support while still ensuring their voice is heard when the race winnows down.\n\nRCV also may help improve our political culture. While early data is mixed , incentive structures created by an instant runoff theoretically encourage candidates to reach beyond their narrow bases of support to gain second-choice votes from other candidates' supporters. While nationwide RCV wouldn't herald the end of negative campaigning, it would disincentivize candidates from demonizing their opponents-and perhaps more importantly, their opponents' supporters.\n\nWould RCV change the outcome of the 2024 Republican primary?\n\nProbably not. Donald Trump, who holds a monumental lead in the polls , would still likely win the Republican nomination no matter the system. But the results would be a lot less certain than they are now.\n\nHeading into the Iowa caucuses, Trump is sitting well north of 50 percent nationally in the RealClearPolitics polling average. With majority support among Republican voters, he would be in line to win an instant runoff in the first round-the rankings would be irrelevant. But the primary election is not a national election, and RCV could have some impact as the race unfolds, starting in Iowa.\n\nAgain turning to RealClearPolitics , Trump has just over a majority of support among Republicans in the Hawkeye State. If that polling bears out at the caucuses later today, Trump would win in the first round under an instant runoff. But Iowa is not a \"winner-take-all\" state; the Iowa GOP allocates its delegates proportionally . This makes RCV potentially useful as a mechanism to set aside also-ran candidates, by requiring a minimum threshold of support for receiving delegates-much like Democrats' \" 15 percent rule .\" If Republicans had this rule, low-performing candidates-in this hypothetical, Vivek Ramaswamy and Asa Hutchinson-would be eliminated and their votes would be reallocated to Trump, Nikki Haley, and Ron DeSantis, according to their voters' second-choice preferences.\n\nIf some of the more recent polling of the state is correct, DeSantis may struggle to reach a 15 percent minimum threshold as well. Granted, if he is at 13 percent in the first round, it's likely that some portion of the eliminated candidates' voters would be reallocated his way, keeping his campaign alive. But if his campaign truly collapsed in the home stretch and he failed to earn 15 percent of the vote, DeSantis' elimination would result in all delegates being divided between Trump and Haley-likely resulting in a Trump-Haley head-to-head matchup in subsequent states.\n\nNext up is New Hampshire, where an instant runoff using RCV could create quite the drama. Like Iowa, New Hampshire allocates its delegates proportionally. But unlike Iowa, New Hampshire sets a floor at 10 percent support in order to qualify for delegates and allows independent voters to participate. With Chris Christie recently suspending his campaign , only two remaining candidates are polling above 10 percent in the Granite State: Trump (43 percent) and Haley (29 percent).\n\nUsing an instant runoff, the votes for Christie (12 percent), DeSantis (7 percent) and Vivek Ramaswamy (5 percent) would be reallocated between Trump and Haley. Assuming the vast majority of Christie's voters would rank Haley over Trump, the vast majority of Ramaswamy voters would rank Trump over Haley, and most of DeSantis' voters would rank Trump over Haley, the two candidates would likely split the delegates roughly equally, with a slight advantage to Trump.\n\nAt this point, DeSantis and Ramaswamy would be in third and fourth place with no delegates. With no \"firewall state\" in the near future for either candidate, one could reasonably expect them to drop out. Suddenly, what looks in the real world like an insurmountable lead for Trump has become a tighter, head-to-head contest between the frontrunner and his former ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nNext on the calendar is Nevada, where Haley has opted to run in the state's primary, which awards no delegates, instead of the state party's caucuses, which does award delegates. Trump holds a near 60-point lead over the other caucus candidates. Like Iowa and New Hampshire, Nevada allocates its delegates proportionally in the caucuses, and Trump is set to win the vast majority of the delegates there. While RCV would have minimal impact on the outcome of Nevada under current conditions, it is possible that the use of RCV in the caucuses may have encouraged Haley to file. Like Iowa before, Trump's delegate lead could be dampened by an instant runoff in Nevada, making an investment in campaign operations by Team Haley more worthwhile.\n\nAnd after Nevada is South Carolina. Trump also appears dominant in the Palmetto State, with more than 50 percent support in recent polls . Unlike Iowa and New Hampshire, the South Carolina GOP allocates its delegates under a winner-take-all system. If Trump maintains his majority position, he would earn all of South Carolina's delegates in the first round of an instant runoff.\n\nBut with a stronger showing in Iowa and New Hampshire with RCV, it's possible that Haley could chip away at Trump's lead in her home state, keeping him under 50 percent in the first round. Nonetheless, absent a monumental shift in the race, it's likely that Trump would still carry South Carolina. While it's certainly possible for a candidate to jump from second to first place over the course of an instant runoff, Trump's lead would likely be too big-and his popularity with DeSantis and Ramaswamy voters too high-for Haley to expect to leap-frog him.\n\nBy that point, the Republican primary would likely be over. Trump would have won four states in a row, including Haley's native South Carolina. Republican voters have coalesced around the former president since his various indictments began rolling in, and his polling advantage has generally only increased over the past year. The 2024 cycle doesn't look like 2016, where a narrow band of Trump-supporting Republicans gave Trump the lead while anti-Trump Republicans split their votes between Ted Cruz, John Kasich, and Marco Rubio. The point of an instant runoff with RCV is to find the most popular candidate, and, in this cycle at least, that's Trump.\n\nHow might RCV impact candidate behavior?\n\nBut RCV wouldn't just impact the mechanics of the 2024 Republican presidential primary-it would likely also impact the actions and rhetoric of candidates, as well as which candidates decide to jump in the race in the first place. After all, the rules of the game affect the way it's played. Thus, RCV would further complicate the outcome of the 2024 primary by changing candidate behavior and campaign strategy.\n\nHaley and DeSantis, for example, have focused on the other's shortcomings throughout the primary season. This strategy still has merit under RCV: Both candidates want to be the last one standing against Trump, but they would still need their opponent's supporters' second-place votes to win. Any negative campaigning would need to be muted to avoid doing more harm than good.\n\nBeyond the impact to Trump's top challengers, an RCV system would affect the strategies of the lower-polling candidates as well. Christie, prior to dropping out, was accused of functioning as a \"spoiler\" candidate for Haley in New Hampshire. RCV would more or less render such criticism obsolete, allowing him to have stayed in the race longer. His continued presence would have given voters yet another way to express opinions on the primary, and RCV would allow them to do so without \"throwing away\" their votes.\n\nThat said, while RCV does create healthier political incentives, it is no panacea. As the dominant leader, Trump would be incentivized to sow confusion about RCV among Republican voters, perhaps encouraging them to rank just one candidate. In so doing, he might reduce the likelihood of a challenger like Haley rising due to second-place votes. With such a large lead, it would be in Trump's interest to reduce the denominator in subsequent rounds of voting and thus make it easier to win a majority in the runoff. This strategy could backfire-after all, the voters most likely to be influenced by Trump may be the very voters likely to rank him second-but Trump has been known to double-down on strategies that undercut his interests, and it's possible to imagine him doing so here.\n\nSo no, unlike the 2016 primary race-where instant runoffs may have advanced another candidate to the general election-RCV in the 2024 primary would not prevent a Trump primary win. The results would likely be the same. But what it does offer are worthwhile improvements to the presidential primary system. It gives voters a greater say, incentivizes positive campaigning, and prevents a candidate with a passionate but narrow base of support from snowballing early victories in a crowded field.\n\nMatthew Germer is the director of the Governance Program and a resident fellow at the R Street Institute.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "The American Innovation and Choice Online Act Would Foster Neither Innovation Nor Choice\n\nBut it would overturn decades of antitrust rulings with a 'guilty until proven innocent' approach toward Big Tech.\n\nIt's always fun to see what names politicians come up with for their legislative proposals. Take, for example, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which is co-sponsored by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and just cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee. Should it pass, it would promote neither innovation nor choice, but would in fact give the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice a mandate to squash innovation.\n\nThe measure directly goes after a few politically unpopular Big Tech firms such as Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook by preventing these companies from \"self-preferencing\" their services. When Google places its Google Maps at the top of a search result, that's self-preferencing. When an iPhone comes with Apple's flashlight app installed, that's self-preferencing.\n\nThe bill would overturn decades of antitrust rulings in that Google, for example, wouldn't be able to defend itself by showing that the action was good for competition, the goal of antitrust. Instead, the company would have to explain why putting its map atop its search engine results was necessary to \"enhance the core functionality\" of the product. If the company couldn't, it would face fines of up to 15 percent of its total U.S. revenue. This huge risk would simply make it not worth implementing a new system.\n\nCompanies will improve their products only if they think it will make them more money. Google can profit through its search engine from improving its maps. Because it could profit from a high-quality product, Google Maps blew past competitors in popularity.\n\nWhile the most obvious casualty will be innovation by Big Tech companies, the legislation will have spillover effects by indirectly suppressing innovation by smaller companies too. One common way to profit from an innovative idea is to be acquired by a bigger company. Startups create new products that integrate well with existing internet infrastructure, making them appealing and valuable to bigger companies. Acquiring startups is a major component of what Big Tech companies do. Microsoft, for example, acquired six companies in the third quarter of 2021 alone.\n\nHowever, if Microsoft fears it will lose 15 percent of U.S. revenue from integrating a new application into its lineup, it won't acquire a small company in the first place. In response, by limiting the prospects of being acquired (which the FTC also wants to crack down on in other ways), the so-called innovation bill limits the number of new ideas that are pursued. A \"guilty until proven innocent\" approach to market behavior will suffocate innovation, even if it is only about self-preferencing.\n\nFor innovation to flourish, we must push to make it permissionless, as innovation scholar Adam Thierer stresses more generally. Companies and individuals need the ability to tinker with systems and processes. All innovation is incremental, as Anton Howes has stressed in his research.\n\nFor example, take something that people recognize as being a major technological improvement: steam engines . Contrary to the popular story that James Watt invented steam engines, they took centuries to develop. Starting in the early 1600s, there were decades of experimentation and prototypes across Europe. It was not until the 1710s that practical atmospheric steam engines appeared. These became profitable only after several more decades: first, thanks to marginal improvements by Henry Beighton, John Theophilus Desaguliers, and John Smeaton; then, finally in the 1760s, James Watt. Little by little, permissionless innovation drives an economy forward.\n\nOn a shorter timescale, the products we love today on the internet involved lots of tinkering; they evolved incrementally over time. As we know, Google started as a search engine, then it integrated a map into its search engine. Eventually, it decided to self-preference its own map, instead of using everyone's favorite: MapQuest's. It then also added its own system of reviews, instead of Yelp's.\n\nIs either of these a necessary aspect of running a search engine, as the new burden would require? Probably not. Do users seem to like a well-integrated map and review system when searching for nearby restaurants? Absolutely.\n\nAt which point should the FTC have stepped in and signed off on the integration of Google's product? No individual or government agency can know what form of tinkering is necessary for the business. To mandate that they try is to give them an impossible task. If you force a bureaucrat to sign off on every new product, you can expect fewer new products. Just because the products are digital and offered by Big Tech companies that are politically unpopular does not change the basic economics.\n\nBrian Albrecht is an assistant professor of economics at Kennesaw State University, a faculty affiliate at the International Center for Law and Economics, and a Young Voices contributor.

      "text": "Cheney's Choice\n\nShe has opted to do her job, rather than just have her job. That matters.\n\nProminent Republican elections blog Red Racing Horses (RRH) recently scolded Rep. Liz Cheney, who faces primary voters next week, saying, \"Sticking to your guns and voting your conscience is one thing. Torpedoing your career by trying to change the minds of the vast majority of your party's primary voters almost single-handedly, (by joining the January 6th Commission) is another.\" Citing polls showing Cheney losing handily to her former supporter -turned- election conspiracy theorist , Harriet Hageman, the post continues, \"I'm not sure that Dick (Cheney) ever taught Liz about the aphorism 'live to fight another day.\" This insightful comment perfectly encapsulates the best-case argument against Cheney.\n\nIt's also dead wrong.\n\nThe recommendation \"live to fight another day,\" raises the question: Fight ... for what? She could serve in Congress for decades longer and never do as much to preserve our constitutional order as she has serving as the key Republican on the January 6 committee.\n\nA decade ago, as a junior congressional staffer, I had a front-row seat to representatives learning this lesson. After the Tea Party wave of 2010 brought in nearly 100 freshman members of Congress, there was excitement, but also frustration. I was privy to a conversation involving two members of Congress lamenting that they had so little influence. \"I came to Congress to do something, and it's like I have no say,\" said one. \"You are irrelevant to this process,\" said the other, resigned.\n\nThese representatives learned that, particularly in a democracy, no one person usually has much power over the waves of politics. Being merely one of 435 members of the House gives one very little ability to influence the direction of the political draft. The ability of any individual to make a significant, meaningful difference is both difficult and rare, even for those who hold federal office.\n\nCheney's decision to join the January 6 committee was to use her office to do something. Namely, holding former President Donald Trump accountable for his illegal and dangerous attempts to stay in office through bullying, threats, and lies that ultimately led to the violence of January 6. This is something no other Republican, save fellow committee member Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, was willing to do. As New York Times columnist Katherine Miller recently said, Cheney has internalized the saying, \"If you don't do it yourself, nobody is coming to help you.\"\n\nCheney knew that this decision would be unpopular. She'd already been ousted from her perch as the House Republican Conference chair because of her outspokenness against Trump's post-election malfeasance. Moreover, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that telling nearly 70 percent of your state's voters (and an even higher percentage of Republicans) that they had voted for a potentially criminal reprobate, was always going to be a hard sell. If polls are to be believed, they aren't buying.\n\nIf Cheney had chosen to be quieter, as RRH suggested, there's a decent chance she could have kept her seat and \"lived to fight another day.\" It's worth mentioning that the people who run RRH are not election deniers. They openly call Trump's fact-free claim that he won the 2020 election a \"big lie,\" and they are not shy about continuing to call out Trump and his media backers for falsehoods. Their case is not against Cheney on substance, but on politics. And they are undoubtedly right that she would have had a much better chance of keeping her seat in Congress by muting her opposition to Trump.\n\nThe question that isn't being addressed, however, is what would Cheney do with those extra years? She'd undoubtedly pass a few bills, influence others. Maybe work her way up to be a committee chair. But anything she would do differently from any other member of Congress from Wyoming would be minimal.\n\nThere is truth to the idea that sometimes you need to make compromises to accomplish anything. The first job of a politician is to be elected, or they'll be hard pressed to accomplish much. But at a certain point, you need to take opportunities to make a difference, even ones that may wound or end your political career, or else be rendered irrelevant. Cheney addressed this specifically, saying \"If the cost of standing up for the Constitution is losing the House seat, then that's a price I'm willing to pay.\"\n\nHageman is a counter example. She previously called Donald Trump \"racist and xenophobic,\" and the 2016 Republican National Convention even tried to stop him from getting the nomination after he'd already essentially clinched it. But now, she's a big Trump supporter and claims she was fooled by \"Democrats, and Liz Cheney's media friends.\"\n\nIt would be difficult to find a more humiliating and debilitating way to enter Congress than by saying, \"Vote for me because I'm easily conned by members of Congress and the media,\" but that's essentially what Hageman is doing. She's decided she'd like to occupy the seat, and will do anything to get it. That mindset will leave her with little to no control over her fate. She could be replaced by a proxy vote, and it wouldn't matter.\n\nCheney, on the other hand, is making a real difference. The history of the January 6 committee, whereby Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy opposed a more rigorous and less partisan version of the committee as bargained for by his own hand-picked negotiator, Rep. John Katko, is complicated and depressing. Yet the existence of this less-than-ideal committee, to gain access to and document facts about Trump's post-election attempts to undermine the electoral process, is important for both the near and distant future. Without Cheney, this committee would have less credibility (which is what drives the rage against her), and would drift into a more partisan, and less useful, direction.\n\nIndeed, as National Review 's Andy McCarthy sagely observed , Cheney is \"winning\" the committee because her goal is to make a \"powerful showing that Trump is unfit\" and \"to show the public, Republicans in particular ... that even if (Trump) seeks the nomination,\" that \"no party in its right mind would make him its standard-bearer.\"\n\nThis is different from the Democrats on the committee, who, even assuming the best about their motives, are still acting predictably in their best political interests, which is mostly to cast blame at their opponents and distract from their own failures. There is nothing inherently wrong with honest partisanship, but unalloyed from a true purpose, it becomes dishonest and unmoored. Indeed, some Democrats are cynically boosting Republican candidates who pledge loyalty to Trump's lies in the belief they will be easier to beat while simultaneously claiming such candidates are a threat to democracy itself.\n\nIndeed, in large part because of Cheney's presence, the committee has largely (although not entirely) stayed away from the purely partisan distraction that this exercise could have been and focused on substantive facts that members of both parties need. Most of the witnesses are Republicans who worked with or for Trump, and it undoubtedly made it easier to testify about their concerns knowing that Cheney shared their concerns from her perch on the committee.\n\nCheney's efforts matter. A recent poll finds that \"a majority of registered voters (53%) now say-in the wake of the House select committee's high-profile Jan. 6 hearings-that Trump should not even be allowed to serve as president again, due to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\" The poll also shows that Republican voters are increasingly looking for new alternatives.\n\nIt's rare, but others have chosen the same difficult path. The late Sen. John McCain and former Sen. Joe Lieberman made a similar choice. From 2007-2008, there was a raging debate over the \"surge\" in Iraq, which was highly unpopular. Democrats were trying to defund the surge, and many Republicans privately wanted to, afraid of the political consequences. But proponents of the surge carried the day, because McCain, a Republican presidential candidate, and Lieberman, a heterodox Democrat, took huge political risks to publicly defend it. Their efforts to do so saved America from defeat, and Iraq from disaster. But Lieberman didn't bother running for Senate again, having alienated much of his base. McCain was luckier. The surge proved successful, and it likely ended up helping him in the 2008 presidential primaries (how it affected the general is hard to tell), but it didn't look like that would be the case till the last minute.\n\nMike Pence is another who chose the road less traveled. As I've argued in the past, Pence's refusal to illegally reject Biden electors on January 6, 2021, was an act of heroism. In a sense, no sitting vice president has ever had as much of an impact on the future of America than Pence did. He single-handedly halted a major constitutional crisis. Hopefully, the country will never face one again in his lifetime.\n\nTo paraphrase Captain Queenan from the Academy Award winning film The Departed , Cheney chose to be a member of Congress, to do the substance of what a legislative check on a dangerous executive looks like, rather than to simply go through the motions and appear to be a member of Congress, but having no real influence. Much as Pence's deeds narrowly averted a constitutional crisis, Cheney is using her position to ensure we don't face another one.\n\nEven if it ultimately costs Cheney her seat, she'll have made a much larger impact with her six years in Congress than most anyone else would have in 26.\n\nCliff Smith is a lawyer and a former congressional staffer.

      "text": "The Power of Choice\n\nAnd the futility of central planning.\n\nWelcome to the third installment of Economics for English Majors, which is appearing as a series of standalone essays until my new Dispatch newsletter, Wanderland , officially launches next Monday. (Please do join if you haven't.) I'm taking advantage of the temporary format to write some longer pieces-the ones in the newsletter will be shorter, usually. But, since there's no newsletter real estate to take up, for now I'll go long.\n\nAnother way of thinking about that is that, at the moment, the opportunity cost of writing longer E4EM essays is relatively low. Opportunity cost is one of the three or four most important concepts in economics, especially for non-economists who want to understand economic thinking in the public policy context. It is simple enough, but still underappreciated, in part because we tend to look at opportunity cost from the consumer point of view and forget all about the production side.\n\nThe fundamental issue in economics is scarcity . Scarcity is a fact of life: No matter how rich we become as a society, and no matter how much material abundance we enjoy, there is never enough to go around to satisfy every desire of every person: Some goods are naturally limited (there are only so many Rembrandt paintings), some goods are rivalrous in consumption (if Steve smokes a cigar, Jonah can't smoke the same cigar), and our desire to consume goods that require work to produce (see last week's discussion of Say's Law) conflicts with our practically infinite appetite for leisure time. As much as it may grieve David French, you can't plant turnips and play World of Warcraft at the same time. You have to choose one.\n\nThat special application of scarcity -\"If you want x , you have to forgo y \"-is opportunity cost.\n\nYou all know that, of course. I'm just laying some groundwork.\n\nOpportunity cost is not exclusively an economic issue as such. As Ludwig von Mises points out in his famous essay \" Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth \"-which we'll be revisiting directly-there are all sorts of tradeoffs in life that we cannot put a monetary price on: Sometimes, we have to choose between having a hydroelectric plant or the beauty of an unspoiled waterfall, Mises writes, or choose between income and honor. (Mises and F.A. Hayek- émigrés who provided the Austrian school of economics its name-were obliged to abandon their native Austria after its annexation by Nazi Germany and thus had the example of richly rewarded collaborators to illuminate that latter issue.) To value the beauty of the waterfall or one's honor is not irrational, Mises argued, but such dilemmas fall outside of the scope of economic calculation per se . In the context of an exchange-based economy-as opposed to that socialist commonwealth-money provides a standard and a unit to help us to impose some rigor on our treatment of opportunity cost.\n\nSay you want to buy a house in San Antonio, where the median home price is about $320,000. (The median house price in San Antonio is six times the median household income, and that is pretty high; but the median house price in San Francisco is about 13 times the median household income. There's American politics circa 2022 in a nutshell.) Say you can afford a nicer-than-average house, but a nice house is not the only thing you want in life. If the price difference between the house you really want and the house you can live with is $20,000 (which you are going to spread over a 30-year mortgage) then probably you make the stretch, because $20,000 won't even get you a new Honda Civic. But if the difference is $300,000, that's a Bentley Flying Spur with some options. It's about 75,000 venti lattes at Starbucks, or 30 Gibson ES-350s like Chuck Berry used to play , or four pizzas, because $70,000 pizza with gold in the crust apparently is a thing that exists in our age of angst and deprivation. Actually, $300,000 is about 4.29 of those pizzas, but I don't think you can order 29 percent of a $70,000 gold pizza-even in Times Square, they won't sell that by the slice. That's four years at Princeton at the rack rate with some money left over. Maybe you don't want any of those things (I'd take the Gibson) but have lots of other things in your wish list-without money to act as a yardstick to simplify what Mises calls our \"oppressive plenitude,\" figuring out what you're potentially giving up by choosing the more expensive house gets pretty difficult. But money works only when there's free exchange-because what we are interested in is how much people actually value Princeton educations and golden pizzas, not how much some guy at a desk backed by guys with bayonets says you should value this or that.\n\nWhat Mises gets into-and you should really read the whole essay; it's both interesting and accessible-is the even more complex issue of \"higher order\" goods. In one of those desert-island economies that economists like to write about, with two guys trading fish and coconuts (Mises even considers the case of Robinson Crusoe, an even simpler desert-island economy), we can probably just about handle the question of how much of each commodity to produce, the answer being: more . There isn't much opportunity cost for the fisherman on the desert island to spend an extra hour or two fishing-what else is he going to do all day? But if you decide to build a steel plant that sits on 40 acres of land, takes up billions of dollars in capital, and employs 1,000 workers, then your opportunity cost is considerable and difficult to apprehend in terms of barter exchange: The opportunity cost is every conceivable thing that land and that capital and that labor might have been used for instead.\n\nMises' argument in its simplest form (and I will go ahead and say this is oversimplified even if sufficient for our purposes here) is that the problem facing central planning-which is the fundamental task of the socialist economic power-is not that central planning is inefficient or wasteful or prone to error and corruption or anything like that but is, in fact, impossible .\n\nHow so?\n\nIf the state owns the means of production, then there can be no prices attached to the factors of production, these being res extra commercium . Without the means of rigorous apples-to-apples comparison afforded by prices, there can be no real economic calculation, and hence no rational central planning worth the name. We cannot make rational decisions about opportunity costs if we cannot define what it is we are giving up: You cannot make rational tradeoffs if you do not have a reasonably precise idea of what it is you are trading away and what it is you are getting. Even if the Soviet Union had been run by people who were both enormously intelligent and morally upright to the point of saintliness (and it surely was not, though it had some of those very intelligent men, at least) it still would have failed, because its major problem was not corruption, which is universal-it was that the central planners had set themselves an impossible task.\n\nMarkets embed economic information in society where it is accessible to those who make decisions about what to produce and to consume and where to invest and to spend. Central planners do not have access to that knowledge, and even the most intelligent of them would not have the capacity to act rationally on that knowledge if they could somehow acquire and compile it, because the sheer amount of knowledge-often short-lived and contingent knowledge-held in the brains and experience of the tens of thousands of people who make up the steel industry is too much for the 12 brains on the steel committee at the Department of Economic Planning. This is what the followers of Mises and Hayek have called the \"knowledge problem.\"\n\nThat the Soviet Union was an economic (and moral) disaster is well-understood. But we have other examples that we can draw from. The collapse of the Roman Empire brought with it a collapse in trade and the use of money in much of Europe, a condition that lasted until the revival of the money-enabled economy that led to the Renaissance. A famous Anglo-Saxon document known as the Burghal Hidage (You really going to cite the Burghal Hidage at this hour on a Monday morning, Williamson? Damned skippy I am!) catalogs the fortresses (\" burhrs\" ) of the medieval English kingdoms and the taxes that were due to each of them based on \" hides ,\" a hide being (originally and approximately) a quantity of land sufficient for the support of a household of 10. Taxes due were based on the number of hides assigned to a particular jurisdiction. But, of course, there was little money in circulation, so the taxes ended up being positively comical to the modern reader, with one often-cited law demanding a tax consisting of \"10 vats of honey, 300 loaves, 12 ambers of Welsh ale, 30 ambers of clear ale, 2 full-grown cows or 10 wethers, 10 geese, 20 hens, 10 cheeses, a full amber of butter, 5 salmon, 20 pounds of fodder, and 100 eels\" for every 10 hides on the tax roll. Why 100 eels and not 101? Do you think this was the result of a calculation ?\n\nThe economy described in the Burghal Hidage offered practically everything a central planner could ask for: a severely limited range of commodities, few luxury goods to fight over, mostly unfree labor, and a political agency with the power to exercise something very close to total surveillance and total control over economic production and consumption, which was mostly local in character and for that reason much easier to manage than our high-tech modern global economy. Bernie Sanders wouldn't have to worry about these peasants having 57 different kinds of deodorant. (I have been to a Bernie Sanders rally, and the great problem I detected there was not an oppressive superabundance of hygiene products.) The medieval manorial economy wasn't quite the economists' desert island, but it was pretty close. There were no pesky private-equity firms in the mix, to be sure. The result of those economic arrangements was a very long period of economic and cultural stagnation (at best) or decline (often enough) that persisted until the reemergence of the social features that still characterize prosperous and dynamic societies today: urban life, trade, access to financial services and distant markets, reasonably stable money (remember stable money?), mobility of labor and capital, etc.\n\nIf it seems like we have wandered far from opportunity cost, we haven't. What the medieval peasants lacked was what the Soviet subjects lacked: choice. What every central planner-including every trade protectionist who wants to defend Americans from the bane of dastardly foreigners scheming to sell us goods we want at attractive prices-proposes to take away from people is that same thing: choice. Markets can tap all that miraculous human knowledge and human ingenuity only where there is choice. Where there is no choice, there is no question of thinking rationally about opportunity cost, because there is no opportunity-there is only doing what you are ordered to do.\n\nMises, bless him, wrote for grown-ups-i.e., for people who understand that we have to make choices and that our choices are constrained by reality, by the facts on the ground, and that choosing x means forgoing a practically infinite variety of things in the category not- x . The utopians-and the socialists are not the only kind of utopian, or possibly even the most dangerous kind at the moment-tell a different story: that we don't have to make hard choices, that we can have everything we want at whatever price we like (\" Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price \") as long as we give up one little thing: the power to choose our own tradeoffs.\n\nOf course, as Hayek pointed out, choice doesn't cease to exist in the command-and-control economy. It's just that the power to choose is taken away from most people and concentrated in the hands of a powerful few. It is one of the ironies of our time that the people who advertise their commitment to \"American greatness\" work from the false and unfounded belief that Americans are too stupid and too weak to make their own decisions. Funny kind of greatness, that.\n\nKevin D. Williamson is national correspondent at The Dispatch and is based in Virginia.

      "text": "Decline Is a Choice\n\nDomestic strife and foreign policy adventurism have undoubtedly hurt the United States' relative power and prestige compared to the height of American influence in the 1990s. For a decade, the American Union-termed a hyperpower instead of a superpower in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union-led the international liberal order and upheld Western political norms. George W. Bush's administration put the first dent in what seemed like a nearly invulnerable U.S. regime through the disastrous invasion of Iraq and a botched response to the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nBad policies and poor prioritization continue in foreign policy, but the news might not be as bad as it seems.\n\n\"Relative decline results from bad choices,\" Mr. Maitra said, \"but they are choices which, by definition, can be reversed. It needs political will and an agent to carry through, but it is doable.\"\n\nThe citizens of the United States need to understand that decline is a choice. Suppose we're to remain a strong country capable of upholding liberal democracy. In that case, we must realize that this will mean acting forcefully and ensuring that transcendent moral beliefs and commitments support liberal democracy.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, Louis Rubin Jr., a Jewish Carolinian poet, jested that two types of Americans knew that \"history\" could happen to them: Jews and Southerners. Rubin's jest meant that Jews and Southerners understood that they hadn't escaped history. Macro-historical and epochal events could and still did occur. Human life could still be turned upside down. Progressives nowadays seem blissfully unaware that history can happen to the United States. En masse, sexual revolution and flirtation with Maoist iconoclasm in the form of Black Lives Matter (BLM) and other radical movements are indulged without any consideration of the potential consequences of such an earth-shattering overthrow of the social and political orders.\n\nClassical historians understood the profound consequences of stabilizing an empire's political and social foundations. Subtly, without even noticing, a polity would lose its strength and become a weak, enervated, and emasculated version of what it once had been. Times of relative prosperity and apparent international peace blinded citizens to what happened as their empire slowly was drained of the transcendent values that had once made it strong.\n\nIn Tacitus's \"Annals,\" he wrote of the Roman Republic's slide into imperial decadence and social decay:\n\n\"At home all was tranquil, and there were magistrates with the same titles; there was a younger generation, sprung up since the victory of Actium, and even many of the older men had been born during the civil wars. How few were left who had seen the republic!\"\n\nTacitus warned his readers that these subtle changes in the Roman regime had profound effects on society. There was no such thing as politics denuded of moral consequence. The Roman state, Tacitus lamented, \"had been revolutionized, and there was not a vestige left of the old morality.\"\n\nWhen Americans overthrew the British Empire in North America and formed their republic, they understood, like Tacitus and Romans before them, that societal success and the endurance of what Thomas Jefferson called the American \"empire of liberty\" hinged on the maintenance of specific moral and social commitments, most but not all coming from the Judeo-Christian tradition received from Western Europe.\n\nJohn Adams argued unambiguously that the U.S. Constitution only worked for moral and religious people, and he didn't believe that the definitions of morality and religion were meant to be value-neutral and redefined ad infinitum by every succeeding generation. This wasn't the concern only of the 18th-century founders. In the late 20th century, Russell Kirk warned, \"In no previous age have family influence, sound early prejudice, and good early habits been so broken in upon by outside force as in our own time.\" Morality and virtue \"among the rising generation is mocked by the inanity of television, by pornographic films, by the twentieth-century cult of the 'peer group.'\"\n\nIn our own time, the rise of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and the BLM movement have sought a wholesale overthrow of the longue durée of Western moral and social commitments by accusing the very foundations of the American regime of being racist, and so on. American commitments to liberalism and tolerance might make us want to indulge our tendency to discuss or debate the merits of this new moral order being foisted upon us, but that would be to admit an ideology that was essentially seditious.\n\nAmerican liberalism and the moral and social commitments that have upheld American power worldwide are too important to negotiate. Americans and the American state need to act forcefully to eradicate ideologies that would undermine the American order that allows us the freedoms we value so highly.\n\nAmerican decline isn't inevitable, but stopping decline will mean acting to protect the liberal order in ways more forceful than our decadent and slothful age has become accustomed to."

      "text": "You Must Make a Choice\n\nNext Tuesday, you will make a choice.\n\nThe choice itself is pretty straight forward, but its consequences will be widespread and felt by virtually every American.\n\nYou will get to choose whether you want a better future for yourself, your family, and your neighbors-or if you want to stay on the disastrous road our country has been on for nearly two years.\n\nIf you want crime and violence to continue to rise in cities such as Atlanta, Philadelphia, Seattle, and others, then you should vote for whatever Democrat is on your ballot. Nearly all of them have supported defunding police departments and fomented hostility toward law enforcement for short-sighted political gains.\n\nIf you want fentanyl and other dangerous drugs to continue flooding across the southern border, poisoning our neighborhoods, and killing our children and young adults, you should vote Democrat. As a party, they have rejected every effort to control our border-and denied there is even a problem there. Meanwhile, more than 200,000 people illegally enter the country each month, and more than 103,000 Americans died from drug overdoses from May 2021 to May 2022, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIf you want your grocery bills to get even more expensive, vote Democrat. Every Democrat supported President Joe Biden's (dishonestly named) spending bill which has driven inflation to the highest point in 40 years and shrunk your wallet. In effect, the Democrats' spending and policies have given every American an 8.2 percent pay cut. They have also hamstrung American energy production, which has kept the price of gasoline and diesel fuel high. This has made virtually everything you buy more expensive from eggs, to milk, to clothing, to medical supplies, to energy for your home. This will be a serious problem in the coming months as heating oil prices skyrocket and put people in northern states in real danger of freezing.\n\nIf you want your children and grandchildren to be trapped in schools that fail to teach them-and at the same time brainwash them with radical gender-ideology, then you should probably vote Democrat. As long as the Left has the levers of power, the Teachers' Unions will have the ability to ruin your child's future. It's that simple.\n\nSo, the choice is simple. If you want a better future, vote Republican. If you want to continue the disaster, vote Democrat.\n\nBut no matter your choice, I want to stress one point: You must vote.\n\nIf you love this country, you have an absolute obligation to vote. You have an obligation to tell your friends to go vote. With Veterans Day also next week, it's important to remember that Americans risk their lives every day all around the world to give you the privilege of voting. To choose not to vote is an abrogation of your duty to them.\n\nI am optimistic. If everyone goes out to vote, then we will see a landslide election for Republicans. We will have strong majorities in the House and Senate which will be able to check the Democrats and force Biden to change course or become irrelevant. But we will also see Republicans filling state houses and walking into governor's mansions across the country.\n\nI believe we are on the verge of a profound election in which the American people reject the ideas and policies which have been dragging our country into despair and poverty and instead choose a path which will return us to an America that works for all Americans.\n\nWe must make the choice and vote."

According to data from DK Shifflet, guests driving to the group's hotels accounted for 82 percent of all Choice room nights in 2022, well above the industry average. Approximately 90 percent of Choice-branded properties in the U.S. are in suburban, interstate, and small-town locations, with 76 percent located within one mile of a highway entrance.\n\nCurrently, 41 percent of Choice's Cambria hotels offer EV charging, and by the end of 2024, all are expected to be outfitted with at least one charging station.\n\nTravelers can filter for hotels that have EV charging capabilities on ChoiceHotels.com and the Choice Hotels app.\n\nChoice's two co-brand credit card holders will receive accelerated everyday earnings when using an EV charging station installed at a Choice-branded hotel. Choice Privileges Select Mastercard cardholders will earn 5x points on qualifying purchases at EV charging stations, and Choice Privileges Mastercard cardholders will earn 3x points."

      "text": "'My Body, My Choice' Is Giving Girls the Wrong Idea About Life\n\nI woke up this morning and, before I brushed my teeth or had my coffee, I changed diapers. I wiped butts. I breastfed a baby. I held my five-year-old so he could regulate his emotions.\n\nNothing about this morning was about my body, my choice. In fact, to be a wife and a mother is to accept that your body is no longer just your own-it becomes a part of something bigger. It belongs, in a way, to the people who depend on you: to my husband, with whom I share a covenant; to my children who were knit together in my womb and now find nourishment and comfort in my arms.\n\nWhen we tell young girls over and over again that their bodies belong only to them, are we preparing them for the immense sacrifices of motherhood? Are we equipping them for the reality of pouring themselves out for others? Or are we training them to believe that their comfort, their convenience, and their personal autonomy should come before everything else-including their family and, ultimately, God?\n\nRegardless of where one stands on abortion, the phrase \"my body, my choice\" has become a cultural mantra that conditions women to prioritize the self above the whole. It tells them that the highest good is personal freedom, rather than self-sacrifice. It teaches them that their wants and desires should come before their duties and obligations. It fosters an ego-driven, transactional view of life that is utterly at odds with the reality of motherhood.\n\nIf I were to tell my 7-year-old daughter that everything is your body, your choice, I would be instilling in her the idea that her decisions should always revolve around her own needs and wants. But motherhood is a calling that demands a willingness to surrender-to put others first, to give when you don't feel like giving, to push past exhaustion and frustration and show up, day after day, for the little souls who depend on you.\n\nHave you ever tried explaining abortion to an 8-year-old? It's nearly impossible.\n\n\"So wait, Mommy-some people don't want their babies, so they suck them out with a vacuum?\"\n\n\"Yes, honey.\"\n\nThat is a horrifying conversation to have. But just as disturbing, in a more subtle way, is the idea that we can train our daughters to see their bodies as wholly separate from their responsibilities to others. I want my daughter to understand that motherhood is hard and demanding-but that it is also the most rewarding thing she will ever do. I want her to know that she and her siblings are the greatest gifts of my life, that breastfeeding for more than 10 years has been an honor, not a burden.\n\nAnd I want her to avoid the great regret of my early 20s: believing the lie of \"my body, my choice.\"\n\nMotherhood is not about choice. It's about love. It's about sacrifice. It's about embracing the highest calling a woman can have: to nurture life, to shape souls, to give of herself fully and completely.\n\nThat is the message I want my 7-year-old daughter to carry forward. That is the truth I want her to live by."

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nLerer Hippeau Ventures' Eric Hippeau gives his take on how investors should respond to the development of AI on 'The Claman Countdown.'\n\nThe rapid adoption of powerful new generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT is creating a lot of buzz, but some tech-driven businesses are holding off jumping on the bandwagon until they can be more assured any existing bugs and risks are worked out.\n\nOne of those companies is hospitality giant Choice Hotels, which has utilized AI and machine learning in its operations for years and has a history of showing it is not afraid of being an early adopter.\n\nChoice Hotels has used AI for years across its brands, but it is not yet ready to utilize generative AI. (Choice Hotels)\n\nChoice, which owns upward of 20 brands with more than 7,100 locations worldwide , has a lot of firsts under its belt.\n\nThe company founded in 1941 was the nation's first hotel chain, the first to offer 24-hour toll-free reservations over the phone, the first to release a global marketing and reservation system and the first to have a hotel website with real-time rate and availability information.\n\nIt was the first to develop a cloud-based property management system, developed the first hotel app for iOS and was the first hotel company to offer instant booking on TripAdvisor.\n\nChoice was also the first to have a cloud-based reservation system and the first hotel company to go \"all in\" on Amazon Web Services .\n\nAIRBNB CO-FOUNDER NATHAN BLECHARCZYK: HOW THE SELF-TAUGHT ENGINEER HELPED BUILD LODGING INDUSTRY DISRUPTOR\n\nChoice uses AI for all sorts of applications across its business, from predicting booking patterns, peaks and cancellations; helping owners and developers identify new locations to build; and providing franchisees with AI tools to manage property operations and revenue.\n\nYet, while the company is watching GenAI tools closely, it is not yet ready to pull the trigger on integrating it into its systems - at least for now.\n\nChoice Hotels CIO Brian Kirkland (Choice Hotels)\n\nBrian Kirkland, Choice Hotels' chief information officer, says GenAI is \"a lightning rod\" that has the potential to change consumer decision-making. He acknowledged the media attention the technology has garnered and the fact that everyday people are trying it out and exploring its capabilities before telling FOX Business , \"What we're realizing is the systems are very early on\" and \"the technology is not ready yet.\"\n\nKirkland pointed to several issues with Gen-AI tools, noting that the systems' answers can be inaccurate, they often hallucinate and there are risks associated with protecting intellectual property.\n\nORACLE ANNOUNCES NEW GENERATIVE AI SERVICES FOR BUSINESSES\n\n\"We're cautious,\" he said, but \"we're invested in paying attention to it because when it does solve some of these problems - when you can take the power of generative AI and tie it to a curated set of data ... and you can also merge it with private datasets that you don't want exposed to the broader community, but you want to leverage within that power - you're going to have a great opportunity to leapfrog.\"\n\nChoice Hotels is exploring GenAI tools for integration into its systems but says the new technology is not ready for primetime.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nLerer Hippeau Ventures' Eric Hippeau gives his take on how investors should respond to the development of AI on 'The Claman Countdown.'\n\nThe rapid adoption of powerful new generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT is creating a lot of buzz, but some tech-driven businesses are holding off jumping on the bandwagon until they can be more assured any existing bugs and risks are worked out.\n\nOne of those companies is hospitality giant Choice Hotels, which has utilized AI and machine learning in its operations for years and has a history of showing it is not afraid of being an early adopter.\n\nChoice Hotels has used AI for years across its brands, but it is not yet ready to utilize generative AI. (Choice Hotels)\n\nChoice, which owns upward of 20 brands with more than 7,100 locations worldwide , has a lot of firsts under its belt.\n\nThe company founded in 1941 was the nation's first hotel chain, the first to offer 24-hour toll-free reservations over the phone, the first to release a global marketing and reservation system and the first to have a hotel website with real-time rate and availability information.\n\nIt was the first to develop a cloud-based property management system, developed the first hotel app for iOS and was the first hotel company to offer instant booking on TripAdvisor.\n\nChoice was also the first to have a cloud-based reservation system and the first hotel company to go \"all in\" on Amazon Web Services .\n\nAIRBNB CO-FOUNDER NATHAN BLECHARCZYK: HOW THE SELF-TAUGHT ENGINEER HELPED BUILD LODGING INDUSTRY DISRUPTOR\n\nChoice uses AI for all sorts of applications across its business, from predicting booking patterns, peaks and cancellations; helping owners and developers identify new locations to build; and providing franchisees with AI tools to manage property operations and revenue.\n\nYet, while the company is watching GenAI tools closely, it is not yet ready to pull the trigger on integrating it into its systems - at least for now.\n\nChoice Hotels CIO Brian Kirkland (Choice Hotels)\n\nBrian Kirkland, Choice Hotels' chief information officer, says GenAI is \"a lightning rod\" that has the potential to change consumer decision-making. He acknowledged the media attention the technology has garnered and the fact that everyday people are trying it out and exploring its capabilities before telling FOX Business , \"What we're realizing is the systems are very early on\" and \"the technology is not ready yet.\"\n\nKirkland pointed to several issues with Gen-AI tools, noting that the systems' answers can be inaccurate, they often hallucinate and there are risks associated with protecting intellectual property.\n\nORACLE ANNOUNCES NEW GENERATIVE AI SERVICES FOR BUSINESSES\n\n\"We're cautious,\" he said, but \"we're invested in paying attention to it because when it does solve some of these problems - when you can take the power of generative AI and tie it to a curated set of data ... and you can also merge it with private datasets that you don't want exposed to the broader community, but you want to leverage within that power - you're going to have a great opportunity to leapfrog.\"\n\nChoice Hotels is exploring GenAI tools for integration into its systems but says the new technology is not ready for primetime. (Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nThe CIO expects GenAI ultimately to change how guests plan their travel, provide opportunities in myriad ways for people to interact and even solve problems like fraud analysis.\n\nKirkland says there are all kinds of things Choice will be able to do with the power of GenAI \"when it matures a little bit farther than where it is today.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"We're actively monitoring it, and, in our world, that involves exploring with it,\" he said. \"But it's not yet ready for commercial use with consumers.\"\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

      "text": "Yuval Levin is many things-constitutional scholar, former presidential adviser, political analyst. Jonathan Chait in New York magazine called Levin \"the most influential conservative intellectual of the Obama era.\" Ben Shapiro called him \"the most important voice in the political culture.\"\n\nHe is also, for my money, one of the most cogent explainers of our current political moment. His books- The Fractured Republic , A Time to Build , and the just-published American Covenant -are essential for anyone who wants to understand how things unraveled and how we might stitch them back together again.\n\nThat's the key theme on my mind-and, I imagine, yours too-in the aftermath of the almost-assassination of Donald Trump. What are the roots of that violence? Does one \"side\" bear more of the responsibility? How can we step back from the brink? And how can our history-especially our Constitution-help us face our present challenges?\n\nYuval and I talk about all of that and much more today on Honestly. You can listen to it by clicking just below-or save it for after you read Yuval's essential essay, which we're proud to publish. -BW\n\nAt first glance, Saturday's terrifying assassination attempt on Donald Trump seems like an obvious extension of our depressing political drift.\n\nWe have grown more divided in this century, we use more militant rhetoric, and political violence has escalated. In the last 15 years, there have been shootings of members of Congress of both parties , a foiled assassination attempt of a Supreme Court justice and his family, a mob storming the Capitol to disrupt the certification of a presidential election, and rising levels of threats against public officials of all sorts. A near assassination of a once and perhaps future president might seem like all too natural a next step.\n\nAnd yet, this moment feels like a sharp break. Maybe because it was by far the highest profile act of domestic political violence in this century, directed at the highest profile figure in our politics, in front of television cameras, that it struck even our cynical culture as a shock. It gave us a terrible glimpse into what it would feel like to live beyond the bounds of our constitutional republic.\n\nWe have tested those bounds pretty aggressively in the last few years. Our leading politicians have called each other fascists and enemies of the people, deployed or threatened to deploy the justice system against their opponents, declared that election results were illegitimate, and insisted that our society's very existence would be imperiled if the other party were in power. Donald Trump himself has been the worst offender on this front, but his opponents and critics have frequently come close. Both sides have seemed incapable of criticizing one another's violations of essential norms without engaging in their own. All of this has shown contempt for the character of our republic.\n\nBut what Trump's would-be assassin did on Saturday was different-and not only by degree.\n\nThe bullets fired by Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, symbolize the alternative to constitutional democracy. They constitute the other option-the only other option.\n\nOur political system allows citizens to share a common life even when they differ fiercely on important public questions. Their disputes aren't always settled civilly, but they are settled politically, through competition and negotiation rooted in the premise that partisan victories and defeats are both inevitably temporary, and that the people we disagree with aren't going away. Politics within this framework can be so intense, its stakes can be so high, precisely because we are arguing about what our common future looks like.\n\nConstitutionalism defines the boundaries of this political realm. It offers the rules for setting priorities, deploying power, resolving disputes, and making demands of each other. Its purpose is not so much to help us agree as to help us disagree constructively and safely.\n\nBut beyond the bounds of constitutionalism, there is a realm of violence and pain. In this domain, there is no expectation that the people we disagree with today will still be here tomorrow and have to be accommodated somehow. There are no reliable limits on the use of power, no enforceable rules for competition, and no binding requirements to negotiate. There is only force.\n\nThroughout most of history, most people have been acutely aware of this deadly potential of politics. But here and now, we've had the luxury of being largely ignorant of it. And so we have let ourselves imagine that we can rebel against the frustrating deficiencies of our constitutional republic-like its tendency to become anti-democratic, elitist, morally vacuous, or just plain boring-without taking care to preserve its fundamental achievement: its capacity to sustain a modicum of peace.\n\nSaturday's shooting was a reminder of what it would mean to cast aside that achievement, and to really break the bounds of our constitutional republic. The near universal recoil from the assassination attempt suggests that even the people who have tested those bounds don't actually want to break them.\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss that recoil, to cast the sudden outbreak of a more civil rhetoric as mere hypocrisy. How can the people who spent years calling Donald Trump a fascist and a mortal threat to democracy now suddenly distance themselves from a young man who apparently took their accusations seriously and did something about them? How can the people who denied the verdicts of elections and cheered on Trump's promises to jail his political opponents be surprised when their rhetoric of war is answered with gunfire?\n\nBut this would be the wrong reaction. That we feel repulsed by the alternative to our constitutional democracy, having seen it up close, is a very good sign. In this sense, hypocrisy plays an important part in the moral formation of us fallen creatures. Pretending to be a better person than you are is a pretty good way to become a better person than you are. So let's allow each other the space to do that. Let's take one another's embrace of the boundaries of our politics seriously, even if the people you oppose aren't about to confess all their past sins.\n\nBut let's also think practically about what it would take to sustain and reinforce those boundaries. Our constitutional system exists to help us disagree well-and its degradation has meant we have gotten much worse at disagreeing. Our parties have lost sight of their proper work. Politicians want nothing to do with the kind of bargaining and competition that our system of government requires and prefer instead to traffic in extravagant displays of vicious bile. Congress has turned itself into a venue for their performative hysterics rather than an arena for negotiation.\n\nThe constructive reform of these institutions demands a reacquaintance with their purpose, and the purposes of our constitutional system. One of its primary purposes is to facilitate our disputes. And those disputes are bound to be intense and passionate.\n\nTaking the Trump assassination attempt seriously does not mean censoring ourselves so we don't argue with each other or criticize politicians we think are unfit to lead. We do need to do that.\n\nRather, it should reaffirm both the necessity of the boundaries of our politics, and the necessity of the politics that happens within those boundaries. We need to refocus our political debates on tractable public problems. And we need to lower the temperature of those debates by revitalizing the institutions that keep their stakes relatively low-making sure that no person or institution has all the power, no majority gets everything it wants, and no election is the final one.\n\nPolitical violence is not the inevitable conclusion of the path we have traveled in our politics. It is a choice we risk making, and which we must now rise to reject by recognizing the options before us.\n\nYuval Levin is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. His new book, American Covenant: How the Constitution Unified Our Nation-and Could Again , has just been published.\n\nTo support our work, become a Free Press subscriber today:\n\nI used to listen to Yuval Levin when he was a guest on conservative podcasts in the mid 2010s. National Review, The Weekly Standard, etc. One thing he said that stayed with me is this: \"There is no plan.\" He said it in reference to the perception of chaos in the government. This was in the later years of the Obama administration. He meant that beyond the acquisition and maintenance of power in D.C. and other places, there wasn't an agenda. It was just politicians trying to stay in office.\n\nThe fact that that statement stayed with me might lead you to think I have an admiration for Yuval Levin. I do not. Each podcast I listened to where he was a guest was unsatisfying, to say the least. Back then, he did not turn away from the description of \"big-government conservative,\" a paradoxical characterization a conservative should protest. While conservatives do pursue government power, it's poor form to brag about it.\n\nNo. Yuval Levin is one of those bloodless conservatives. Passionless, a wonk who would feel right at home in a debate over the merits of the Jaffa School as opposed to the Straussian School or quoting the best of Russell Kirk. The people who grew up voting for Republicans don't want that anymore. We don't want the gradual descent as dignified losses pile up, as our so-called \"principles\" condemn us withstand leftists experimentation on our society, hoping for someone to galvanize the party like Reagan did four decades ago.\n\nThat someone showed up. It was Donald Trump. He showed up and understood immediately that the purpose of a political party is to win elections, not dither about what planks should go in the platform. The era of theorizing is over. The Left wants us dead, or neutered enough that we can't fight back against their incessant attacks against our institutions. And as for the divisive rhetoric? The Leftists have been calling Republican candidates for president Hitlerian since Thomas Dewey. Our side has been more than patient with the Left's crybullies who slander us constantly and then keen for civility the moment we open our mouths to fight back. Enough. Time to be honest. Time to say out loud who the Left really is. No more genteel debates bemoaning mean tweets. It's time to win an election and reverse the catastrophes caused by the buffoon Joe Biden and his cabinet full of incompetents.\n\nIt's not your party anymore, Levin. Go align yourself with the dignified losers who are still Never Trump. They'll be happy to share their dogeared copies of Russell Kirk with you. The rest of us will be voting for the man who encouraged us to fight.\n\nRegarding JD Vance's statement, the first part (Biden campaign's central premise is that Trump is dangerous) is absolutely true. While I agree the second part (Biden is directly responsible for the assassination attempt) is a bit overcooked, we all know what the narrative would be if the shoe were on the other foot, because right now with the shoe on this foot, they are still trying to blame it on Trump.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "One of the things we value most about this community is that we have people with politics all over the map-on unions, on immigration, on the risks and opportunities presented by Big Tech, on whether America should intervene in Ukraine, on surrogacy, on the best way to parent. And on abortion.\n\nAbortion is a topic we've covered extensively, from the ideologically motivated attacks on pro-life organizations, to the political backlash against the reversal of Roe v. Wade in Kansas, to the realities on the ground for women whose states banned abortions essentially overnight. We've devoted three episodes of Honestly to the subject and have worked to bring you the best, most thoughtful content on both sides of the issue.\n\nThis is a debate that tends to bring out the strongest passions because it touches on our most deeply held beliefs-about freedom, about choice, about the role of government, about women's rights, and about life itself.\n\nAbortion is right now in the news because on April 7, a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas suspended FDA approval for mifepristone, the abortion pill, and made it illegal to send in the mail. On April 13, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals partially blocked the Texas ruling, but with strict limitations on how mifepristone may be dispensed. The Supreme Court temporarily suspended this decision, allowing access to the drug until it reviews the arguments. The court has indicated it will hand down a decision by Friday night.\n\nIn light of that news, today we have an essay by the writer Jenny Hontz about her harrowing pregnancy experience and during the birth of her son, and how that informed her views on abortion. If you have a story about how you landed on whichever side of this debate you happen to be on, please email tips@thefp.com . We'd love to hear from you.\n\n-BW\n\nI had no problem getting pregnant at 38. The problem was staying pregnant.\n\nIn the beginning, things seemed normal. Healthy and energized, I was working and teaching yoga through my 27th week (just over six months). Then, suddenly, my abdomen started tightening at regular intervals, and I knew I was going through contractions far too early. I went to the doctor, who diagnosed me with an \" irritable uterus ,\" and prescribed bed rest and pills to prevent the contractions from progressing.\n\nI spent the next month glued to my couch. Any time my contractions started coming faster, I rushed to the hospital for a shot of terbutaline, a drug that, at the time, was widely used for slowing down the birthing process. (It now contains a boxed warning , the FDA's most serious, against this usage.)\n\nOne month into this ordeal, the meds completely stopped working, and my contractions grew more frequent and intense. Doctors admitted me to the hospital and hooked me up to an IV to give me magnesium sulfate to halt preterm labor. At first I felt relieved: a fetal heart monitor was attached to me around the clock, and if any quick action were needed, I knew I was in the right place.\n\nBut spending so much time in one small room with beeping machines, soul-sucking fluorescent lights, and only one window made me feel like the world was closing in on me.\n\nHooked up to various tubes and wires, I was unable to get up and even walk to the bathroom, and I had to lie on my left side because doctors believed other positions were riskier for the baby. My husband visited me frequently and even crawled into my hospital bed to sleep next to me one very difficult night, but because he also had a job, he could spend only brief periods by my side.\n\nDays dragged into weeks. There was no way for me to work, but it was very hard not to Google search (one-handed, on my laptop) all that could go wrong if my baby boy was born too early : sepsis, blindness, cerebral palsy, impaired learning, hearing loss, behavioral and psychological problems, an increased risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and more.\n\nI knew that each day I kept my son inside me, the better his prospects. But I was losing my mind. I had to beg nurses to wheel me out on a balcony to get one hour of sunlight a day. They initially refused, but I argued that even prisoners get an hour of yard time for outdoor exercise a day.\n\nEight months in, after two months on bedrest and about a month confined to a hospital bed, doctors finally told me I could go home. At this point, continuing to lie in bed presented a greater risk to my health than the risk my son faced being born a month early. But as soon as they removed the IV, my contractions kicked into high gear, clenching tighter and faster. I was moved straight to a delivery room with my husband at my side.\n\nFor the next 39 hours, I tried to push my baby out while excruciating pain stabbed me in the abdomen.\n\nWhen a nurse noticed my baby's heart rate plunging, doctors ordered an emergency C-section to save his life. My body shook uncontrollably as I was rushed into the operating room. Awake the entire time, I could see nothing with a curtain draped across my midsection, but I could hear my doctor bragging that his C-section cuts were so low I'd be able to wear a bikini without my scar showing. Vanity was the furthest thing from my mind.\n\nAnd then suddenly, I heard my baby cry. My husband cut the cord, brought our son out from around the curtain, and held him close to my head. Tears of joy-and relief-streamed down our faces. He was 6 pounds 5 ounces and 18 1/2 inches long, with a full head of dark hair that stood straight up, just like my husband. His name was Maxwell.\n\nBut within moments, nurses whisked Max away, and doctors continued to work on me. I asked if everything was okay, and that's when my surgeon said I'd had a placental abruption . I later learned this happens when the placenta separates from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery, leading to shock, heavy bleeding in the mother, and even organ failure. Fortunately, the abruption in my case was only partial, which meant I would survive it. I was lucky. Placental abruptions account for 5 to 8 percent of maternal deaths.\n\nThank God, I wasn't one of them. Maxwell is now 13. He's getting straight As and plays soccer and just learned to solve a Rubik's Cube. But lately I find myself thinking back to Christmas Eve 2009, when I was stuck in the hospital, essentially chained to a bed, and the decade-plus of raising a child that has followed and I think: I was willing to do almost anything to save my son. But I did not want to die.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer, I started to wonder: What if I had lived in a state that banned abortion and I had not wanted this baby? What if the risks to my health had been too serious to continue my pregnancy? What if I'd had other children at home who needed me, but the doctors in my state felt the law required them to put my very life at risk to save a dangerous pregnancy?\n\nThat calculus is going to become more and more common across America. On April 12, three Republican-appointed judges ruled that mifepristone, a key abortion pill used in more than half of all abortions in the U.S. and often taken at home, should not be shipped to patients' homes , despite its FDA-approved status since 2000. This has not yet gone into effect, but the same Supreme Court that struck down Roe v. Wade could decide the fate of the drug as early as Friday-and with it, the fate of millions of American women. Many of them will be forced to give birth in states where abortion is no longer legal, and chances are some will face similar trauma to mine-with far more tragic outcomes.\n\nIn Ireland, there was once a blanket ban on abortion, where the life of an unborn fetus was given the same value as the life of its mother. This led to the death, in 2012, of Savita Halappanavar , a 31-year-old Indian-born dentist. Savita was 17 weeks pregnant when a sudden infection caused her to start giving birth. Miscarriage was inevitable and there was zero chance the fetus could survive. And yet, doctors refused to abort her child while a fetal heartbeat could still be detected, and she died from septic shock. Savita's death galvanized the country and spurred Ireland to reverse its strict abortion ban .\n\nSince Roe was overturned, 13 states in the U.S.-including Missouri, Texas, and South Dakota-have full bans on abortion, including in the cases of rape or incest. In Georgia (and soon, likely Florida), abortions are legal only up until six weeks-when many women don't know they're pregnant. Abortion bans in six more states are blocked until courts decide whether to allow them.\n\nThe new abortion laws do not prevent abortion in the case of saving the mother. But already women are saying in the post- Roe world, their lives have been put at risk because doctors fear possible prosecution.\n\nIn March, five Texas women sued the state after they were denied medically necessary abortions even though none of their babies stood a chance of survival. The suit argues that the state's strict laws are scaring doctors and exposing women \"to risks of death, injury and illness, including loss of fertility.\" It is now \"less likely that every family who wants to bring children into the world will be able to do so and survive the experience,\" the suit states.\n\nTexas also allows private citizens to sue providers and anyone who helps a woman seeking an abortion after the six-week mark. Doctors can lose their license to practice, face $100,000 in fines, and even get up to 99 years in prison for offering abortion care in the state. One man, NPR reports, has already brought a claim against the women he says helped his now-ex-wife obtain abortion pills.\n\nForcing women to continue a doomed pregnancy has led to some appalling consequences. In October, 35-year-old Texas mom Lauren Miller, who was pregnant with twins, had to sneak out of state to abort one of her fetuses whose fatal anomaly endangered both her and the life of her healthy twin.\n\nLast fall in Florida, Deborah Dorbert was 24 weeks pregnant when an ultrasound found that her fetus had Potter syndrome , meaning it wasn't producing amniotic fluid. Her baby would be born without kidneys or the ability to breathe-but Dorbert, 33, was still denied an abortion. She had to carry the baby for months, and withdrew from society to avoid meeting others while carrying a very visible pregnancy that was no longer viable.\n\nA 2014 study found that 59 percent of American women who get abortions are already mothers. Furthermore, 75 percent of pregnancies after age 40 are unplanned. The maternal mortality rate for women 40 and over is 7.8 times higher than the rate for women under 25. As more women are forced to continue pregnancies with higher risks of preeclampsia, placenta previa , hypertension, and gestational diabetes, it is inevitable that more mothers will die.\n\nFor years, polls have consistently shown that two-thirds of Americans support Roe v. Wade . Post- Roe research from Pew showed that about 61 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in \"all\" or \"most\" cases. Fewer Americans support legal abortion after the start of the second trimester. But in reality, 91 percent of abortions are performed before 13 weeks, and just 1 percent occur after 21 weeks. Many of those second-trimester abortions happen because doctors find structural fetal anomalies in the fetus, which can be detected only at the 20-week ultrasound. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, almost all women who learned about a fatal fetal anomaly chose to terminate their pregnancy when it was legal.\n\nIn the last year since the reversal of Roe , one thing has become clear. When the issue is put to voters, majorities in even some of the reddest states, like Kansas and Kentucky , uphold a woman's right to choose (though currently, in the latter state, a complete ban still stands). And Republicans placing extreme limits on abortion care are increasingly finding it's a vote loser .\n\nEven so, the restrictions continue. On April 13, Republican governor Ron DeSantis of Florida signed a six-week abortion ban into law, which will take effect if the current 15-week ban is upheld in a legal challenge before the state Supreme Court.\n\nThere is a reason I have only one child. After Max was born healthy, I told my husband that I would never, ever go through another pregnancy. Doctors agreed with that decision, telling me I had a \"sensitive uterus\" and would likely suffer the same ordeal a second time.\n\nFortunately, I never got pregnant again, but if I had, I could not imagine risking my life or enduring another endless-seeming period of hospitalization with my young son at home, unable even to visit me in the prenatal ward with high-risk mothers, per hospital rules. During my prenatal confinement, a nurse told me there was a woman down the hall who had been there since the sixteenth week of her pregnancy, with six months to go before reaching full term.\n\nI chose to endure what I went through. It was worth it because I wanted Max so badly and I love him more than anyone in the world. But I would never, ever wish this on a woman facing an unwanted pregnancy. It's inhumane to force a woman or, God forbid, a girl, to go through what I did. Mothers understand what women face when we bear a child. That's why most mothers, like me, are pro-choice.\n\nThis is Jenny Hontz's first piece for The Free Press. She is a journalist and housing and education activist living in California.\n\nListen to Bari discuss the two realities of living in post-Roe America here .\n\nAnd to support more of our work, become a Free Press subscriber today:\n\nI believe the narcissistic view of self value over that of your own child is a tragic viewpoint. The war on life is still going strong be it at the beginning or end of life. The destruction of Judeo-Christian values be the Progressive Left (Marxist Nihilists) has succeeded and the fight to counter that continues.\n\nYou're right if the mother is crashing, then she is the one the doctor must attend to. However, it is a very unusual for an abortion to need to be performed in that situation, and if that is the case, the doctor simply gets the baby out as quickly as possible. He doesn't take the time to kill the baby first, which is what happens in an abortion.  1.3% is more than a million 24 week abortions since 1973. Non-viable fetuses do not need killing prior to delivery as they are non-viable.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "LOUISVILLE, KY-More Grace Christian Academy is located inside a small, run-down church in the West End, the poorest neighborhood in the biggest city in Kentucky. In 2021, at the height of Covid school closures, Cecil Blye opened the school, named after the nearby church where he serves as pastor.\n\nThere are about a dozen kids, almost all black, from first through twelfth grade. By the time most of them started at the school, Blye told me, they were at least two to three grade levels behind. He said none of their parents pay the school's $100 a week tuition because they can't afford it. Instead, he has to run the school for about $5,000 a month from whatever money the families can cobble together-sometimes $50 a week, sometimes nothing at all-plus the income he gets from his church and the donations of friendly neighbors and strangers.\n\nIn this neighborhood, where Blye grew up in a since-demolished housing project, 58 percent of children live below the poverty line , the streets are plagued by violent crime , and just six percent of students at some public schools read at state standard levels. But Blye has no doubt that his school would blossom if \"school choice\"-shorthand for giving parents state education money to send their children to private school-became law in Kentucky.\n\n\"We'd be able to fully fund what we do here because each kid would come with a payroll attached that would enable us to buy their curriculum, pay for their breakfast and lunch, and pay teachers,\" he told me.\n\n\"We already know that what we've been doing doesn't work,\" Blye said of local public schools. \"If we try something new and it doesn't work, then we just would drop it. But how do we know if we don't try?\"\n\nJust over a dozen states in the U.S. have laws that allow school choice. Most of them are red states-including Alabama, Oklahoma, and Florida-because in the national debate over education, the issue has long been championed by conservatives, who see school choice as a means of pushing back against culture war issues such as library books with LGBTQ content or how race is taught in schools. Liberals, especially the big-city teachers unions, argue that any law that diverts public dollars would essentially defund public schools .\n\nBut the deep red state of Kentucky does not allow school choice, because its constitution decrees that funds for education can go only toward public schools. Unlike many states, Kentucky doesn't even offer charter schools , which can serve as a public school alternative. Last December, when the state's legislature passed a law to allow charter schools, a judge struck it down as unconstitutional.\n\nThen, this year, Kentucky's Republican-controlled legislature approved Amendment 2 . If passed by voters on November 5, the measure would amend the state's constitution to allow public tax dollars to go toward private schools. School choice would finally be legal in Kentucky.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "What's actually wrong with the president? Big news from the Supreme Court. J.K. Rowling and the 'Lolita test.' Kamala and Jill fight fire with cringe. And more.\n\nRegarding President Biden's disputed condition I am surprised that no one has mentioned an objective nuclear imaging scan for Parkinsonism. It is called DaTscan and is an indication of loss of dopamine in the brain. Although most Parkinson's can be diagnosed clinically, this scan would remove the criticisms from the objectivity of a neurology work up. The scan is readily available in most hospitals with a nuclear camera. The resulting images from the scan are clear and easily interpreted, although not only specific for Parkinson's. It is simply an objective way to complete the diagnosis.\n\nLiterally the only reason people are rising up against pedophilia in Lolita is in reaction to Rowling and her supposed anti-trans stance. This same tribe on a different day will rail against people who have a problem with pedophilia in the name of being against icky, discriminatory ageism.\n\nFood for though, a German friend of mine, who is a student of history, likens the Trump position to 1933, I am not saying what happened in Germany in 1933 can happen in America, but those of us who  study history and see the correlations cannot help be concerned. Your comments are welcome.\n\nThe Free Press is biased and as much as I have a left leaning centrist philosophy, the lack of choices is exactly what George Carlin has predicted.  We have insanity vs. senility, and nothing in between.  God help us.\n\nWhat is it about The Free Press that continuously brings to mind the phrase, Too little, too late?\n\nIn always attempting to split the political difference, this site misses the momentous change that's taking place throughout the West: the rise and triumph of populism and the end of the centralized state.\n\nBy adopting a reassuring 'plague on both your houses' stance, I suppose Bari hopes to scoop up a silent majority of moderates. Instead I suspect this frustrates most readers.\n\nThe promise of populism holds out a new covenant for democracy and the American Dream, while Democrats offer nothing new beyond a broader and deeper Deep State, buttressed and praised by the corporate media and academia.\n\nSooner or later TFP may have to choose sides.\n\nAn airbrushed Jill Biden on the cover of Vogue spouting \"We will decide our future\".   What an arrogant piece of work she truly is.    A perfect match for Joe, even if he doesn't recognize her all that often.\n\nHmmm....I wonder if Biden were to dispatch the military to take out the Supreme Court, if that would be an \"official act?\"\n\nMAGA: HA-HA!!! Biden is old, dementia-riddled and needs to get out of the race!! Ha-ha!!!\n\n** Andy Beshear & Gretchen Whitmer enter the chat***\n\nMAGA:  ...wait.. Not like that!!\n\nI think contemporary writers and intellectuals are wrong (and also dishonest) in deflecting criticism of Nabokov's book which even at the time I found somewhat dubious. If this is romanticism, which it is in a sense, this is the weak point of romanticism, its lack of moral compass because of essential narcissism. Nothing and no one matters except oneself. The romantic lover likes the sensation of being in love but repulses any idea that this should involve responsibility, and certainly does not not bother about the havoc he (or she) might cause. Casanova is a stirring figure in a way but he has zero sympathy for the women obliged to prostitute themselves to look after their offspring from one-night stands and at one point nearly had an affair with one if his own many daughters. I knew Casanova/Humbertian characters, of whom there were many around in the Sixties and Seventies and found them at once fascinating, entertaining -- and repulsive.  Nabokov is a dubious figure and a good but certainly not great writer. It's basically surface glitter with no depth. He should have written a sequel giving Lolita's version of the affair, that would have been beyond his capacity.\n\nThe J.K. Rowling vs. Kempner is classic.  It is the age old story of class versus spectacle.  You get to guess which is which.\n\nSo Sebastian's comment didn't sway you?\n\nNo, it is a standard that some have.  They have the right to live by such a code.  Morals are a very fluid concept and change based on time and/or place.  So am not going to condemn someone for writing something that is at best morally dubious, if they do it in a fantastically wonderful way.  Art does not recognize morals so much as it does the beauty in which something is done.\n\nEthics is actually more standardized through out history and the world, though for the most part less practiced.\n\n\"Mika Brzezinski began Monday's edition of Morning Joe with a fifteen-minute monologue about the brilliance of Joe Biden.\"\n\nI wonder if she was wearing kneepads?\n\nWhile attempting to guzzle down a Milwaukee's Best tall boy. Shameless whores can do it all. It's the expertise of their profession and skill in execution that makes the most money.\n\nAnd Jenn has entered the building!\n\nThese women! KJP, Harris etc. I just can't get over the fact that these women happily debase themselves for money, tv time and magazine covers. The spectacle is shameless.\n\nThanks, Jen - I just blew some ice tea through my nose...  :-)\n\nCheers!\n\nTFP will be more important than ever in the near future.\n\nWhose future?  What??\n\nI must continue to question myself on whether I like what you write because I agree with it or because it is an accurate representation of current affairs. In any case, I find it a breath of fresh air.  Thanks.\n\nJK Rowling is a gem and a treasure. Anyone who throws trash on her should be flogged.\n\nLooking back to 2019, apparently some main stream journalism outlets questioned Biden's mental fitness. But as soon as Trump said \"Joe's a loser... a dummy... even slower than he used to be.\" and \"I think he's the weakest mentally... I like running against people that are weak mentally.\"\n\n...the press immediately moved to defend Biden and minimize his cognitive struggles. I imagine that is working for Biden again. After an initial call for Biden to step down, now the mainstream outlets are back in the Biden camp. Trump only had to call out Biden's obvious impairment. Who knew the country's Ivy-educated journos were so easy to manipulate?\n\nHell, it was Joe's primary opponents in 2020 (i.e., Democrats) who started the commentary on whether he was up to it.  Julian Castro and Cory Booker for sure made debate comments about it.  Castro even tried to publicly humiliate him with (paraphrased) \"you just said something different two minutes ago--did you forget what you said two minutes ago?\n\nNo one seems to remember this.\n\ni'm coming to believe that preserving their confidential sources on the Hill requires mainstream journalists to simply toe the party messaging line. Most are inclined to see things from a leftward point of view anyway, so the pitch isn't hard to make. Want more inside baseball info? Don't rock the party boat.\n\nBut reporting really ran off the rails when it became taboo to report bad things about vulnerable Democrats on account of it might end democracy. The life's work and value created by the Katharine Grahams and Ben Bradlees of the world has been frittered away by journalists who believe they are missionaries sent to save the world, not just boring reporters.\n\nUh, everybody.\n\nTrump.\n\nRFK and his hammer and chisel are actually under consideration when the most effective effort is a wrecking ball.\n\nA day or two after showing us what he was made of in the debate, Joe Biden said, \"I know I will respect the limits of the presidential powers as I have for three-and-a-half years.\"\n\nIt is possible he is so adled that he actually doesn't know how many times he has failed to respect any limit of his power.  But I'm more inclined to believe he is evil on earth and acts accordingly.\n\nYeah, trashing the SCOTUS on national TV while they sit there on camera sure does show respect.\n\nBiden's efforts to prosecute his likely opponent probably motivated the broad immunity just affirmed by SCOTUS. What was mostly obvious to all Americans had to be codified in an embarrassing slap in the face from the Judicial Branch. Maybe Biden thought he'd be immune to prosecution once out of office because he's a \"sympathetic elderly man with a poor memory.\"\n\nThe decision, written by the Chief, actually contained a lecture for Associate Justice Sotomayer.  Maybe law school didn't take as well for her as for Roberts."

      "text": "For most of human history, having kids wasn't much of a choice. Social expectations, lack of birth control, and limited autonomy for women presented a couple of options: Have children, or join a convent. But the 1960s ushered in a big change. With better options for birth control and expanded career opportunities for women, many people for the first time could choose how many children to have, and whether they should have any at all.\n\nFast-forward to today: More people are choosing not to have children for a wide range of reasons. Having children, of course, is a personal choice. But it's a choice that has broader implications. Everywhere across the globe-the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa-fewer children are being born. And strangely enough, having kids has become part of the culture wars. There are pro-natalist public figures like Elon Musk on one side saying everyone needs to have more kids now in order to save humanity. And on the other side, people like climate activist Greta Thunberg say rising sea levels are so catastrophic that having kids in this era is akin to genocide.\n\nBut there's no debate that the fertility rate is plummeting in America and around the world. Presently, American women, on average, have 1.8 kids. In the 1950s, it was 3. The replacement rate in the United States, which is the fertility rate needed for a generation to replace itself without considering immigration, is approximately 2.1 births per woman. Around the world, the fertility rate fell by more than half between 1950 and 2021, as many countries became wealthier and women chose to have fewer children.\n\nFor economists like Emily, the speed with which the fertility rate is falling is cause for alarm. Economic growth depends, at least in part, on population growth. Retired people rely on generations of younger workers for support, through contributions to Social Security and taxes. With fertility rates in free fall, the math doesn't add up.\n\nThat's the big picture. Now back to our own families. Our series so far has focused on the state of our children. Today, we cap things off with a fundamental question: Should we even have kids in the first place, and what happens if we don't?\n\nResources from this episode:\n\nBryan Caplan: Selfish Reasons To Have More Kids (Bookshop)\n\nGina Rushton The Parenthood Dilemma: Procreation in the Age of Uncertainty (Bookshop)\n\nLeah Libresco Sargeant\n\nHelena de Groot\n\nRoss Douthat\n\nNo posts"

Birth Control pills are cheap and readily available. Its time we stopped coddling the irresponsible and  stop calling the killing of babies health care.\n\nI can understand rare early term abortions in the case of rape or incest but those are rare and there are exceptions for that. But the concept that one ends a life out of convenience is heinous.\n\nFormer State Sen. Kelli Stargel, who sponsored the 15-week pro-life bill, said that Dorbert is eligible for an abortion under state law. Dorbert's doctor, along with abortionists, states that the medical field's arbitrary definition of \"viability\" is different and does not depend solely on the child's age but their health status as well.\n\nThe irony is that mothers, including pro-choice mothers, would jump in front of a bus to save their two year old.  Somehow it's different when you can see it and feel it.\n\nHelp women navigate around restrictive abortion laws.\n\nA woman who received quality medical care for the conditions she describes goes on a rant about abortion .Sorry, doesnt line up\n\nToo many pro abortion people are trying to engage me in all these threads at the same time and on this forum it's really tough to locate them all. (Please fix that substack lol)\n\nI see the notifications but can't always track down the comment without hunting through every post. Apologies. I don't mean to ignore anyone's responses to my comments.\n\nSomeone named Liora Jacob wants to know if I'm a medical doctor. I am not. I am also not particularly hung up on credentialism and don't like to waste much time dealing with appeal to authority fallacy.\n\nThat said, yes we all know that sometimes severely sick or malformed babies will not have long, healthy or pain free lives. This sad reality does not negate their essential humanity or the obligation of medical professionals to treat them as human patients. I urge you to contemplate the work being done in perinatal and postnatal palliative and hospice care. These sick little humans need not be intentionally killed before delivery or thrown in the garbage post delivery. There are more humane options and studies have well demonstrated what should be somewhat obvious; that the parents of sick babies do much better psychologically and even physically when their helpless child is respected and treated as a human being, and they as parents of children with life limiting conditions are allowed and encouraged to grieve the loss of their human child should they not survive.\n\nFrom a Christian standpoint (of course not everyone can relate, but many comments here have touched on faith); these children are created in the image of God and loved before the foundation of the world every bit as much as healthy, thriving children.\n\nI would also point out that there are plenty of instances where postnatal diagnosis and prognosis differ substantially from antenatal predictions.\n\nThere's a whole missing element to the abortion discussion. There have been 50 million abortions in the US since Roe vs. Wade. I'm pretty sure (despite being a man) that if you ask ANY woman would she like to have an abortion, she'd say no. VERY low on her list of things to do. Traumatic in 17  different ways.\n\nThe broader cultural question migh be: If the social contract is written in such a way that does not protect women from unwanted pregnancies, there is something serious off-kilter about the social contract.\n\nAs a (desperate) solution for sickness and rape, there are very good arguments for abortion. But as a handy way for getting out of pregnancy, it's extremely abusive and disrespectful of women. This is NOT where 'women's rights' should have led.\n\nI think a deeper change is needed, not an argument about the 'right' to abortion. How about the right to live life without fearing you might need to undergo something traumatic and physically threatening, just because guys would rather have more intercourse.\n\nI love you.\n\nI choose you.\n\nI will give my life for you.\n\nNo matter what outcome might be, what trauma might occur, what uncertainty might await, I choose this moment, this little piece of time, not for the chance that your life might turn out the way I want it -\n\nbut your life, as it is, what we have, now. You are worth it. You are my miracle.\n\nI will give my life for you.\n\nI choose you.\n\nI love you.\n\nThe article convinces me of the importance of restricting abortion with exceptions for the mother's health. There was no reason to abort this baby other than health risks for mom. Otherwise it would have been terminating life for no reason. I cannot understand how the author herself could come to any other conclusion based on the FACTS.\n\nWithout the facts and context, the author could come to any random conclusion like the one she articulated. Here is an alternate non sequitur: after this experience, I believed more strongly than ever in the right to carry a firearm.\n\nMy wife was pro-choice. She had a baby (our son). Now, she is firmly opposed to abortion. There... my anecdote contradicts yours.\n\ni remain pro-choice because i have always supported people making decisions about their own health. that being said - one needs to understand when she is having an abortion, something with a very good chance at becoming a life is being killed and there are both physical and emotional consequences that will go along with that. additionally, all other options should be exhausted prior to one making the decision to abort. like all other aspects of medicine - informed consent should be the rule. when we continue to phrase this as a \"reproductive rights\" issue, we continue to de-value the life of this soon-to be human\n\nFor those who are interested, the original  Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine vs FDA complaint as at https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/23-10362/23-10362-2023-04-12.pdf?ts=1681387283\n\nI realize the complaints are usually slanted, but it contains interesting facts to be aware of.\n\nAnd the Alito dissent is here: https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22a901_3d9g.pdf\n\nHe argues that  \"As narrowed by the Court of Appeals, the stay that would apply if we failed to broaden it would not remove mifepristone from the market. It would simply restore the circumstances that existed (and that the Government defended) from 2000 to 2016 under three Presidential administrations.\"\n\nThese articles are why I cancelled my subscription. I dare the author to look at her son and go tell him to his face that his life was almost not worth the inconvenience she went through to have him, and that she supports another woman's right to kill her child if she decides it isn't worth it. What a selfish, horrible person.\n\nI understand this woman's emotional response, but it is just that - a personal, emotional response to a traumatic experience. Like most pro-choice arguments it has no scientific, biological, or consistent ethical basis. It is a 'worst case scenario' strawman. And in fact, an abortion - a procedure with the sole intention of killing the fetus - would not be medically necessary to save the mother in this situation. An early induction or emergency c section in which the child may be too premature to make it - yes, this could happen and no one wants to outlaw this. There are no 'emergency' abortions. A woman may say the risks are too high for her and she wants to terminate based on a risk analysis, but it is not medically necessary to save her life.\n\nThe Dublin Declaration has been signed by over 1,000 physicians:\n\n\"As experienced practitioners and researchers in obstetrics and gynaecology, we affirm that direct abortion - the purposeful destruction of the unborn child - is not medically necessary to save the life of a woman.\n\nWe uphold that there is a fundamental difference between abortion, and necessary medical treatments that are carried out to save the life of the mother, even if such treatment results in the loss of life of her unborn child.\n\nWe confirm that the prohibition of abortion does not affect, in any way, the availability of optimal care to pregnant women.\"\n\nremind me to ask my doctor f he /she signed this so I can find other one"

Wade. Depending on where you sit, the Court just rolled back women's rights by 50 years, or corrected an egregious instance of judicial overreach.\n\nToday, a deep and honest conversation about the Dobbs decision with two women-both mothers-who represent the pro-choice and pro-life sides of this debate.\n\nKatherine Mangu-Ward is the editor in chief of Reason Magazine. Bethany Mandel is the editor of the children's series \"Heroes of Liberty.\"\n\nJoining them is the head of the National Constitution Center, Jeffrey Rosen, who the LA Times called the nation's most influential legal commentator.\n\nBari, I've been thinking about how things might have played out the last 50 tears if Roe had been correctly decided. If SOCUS had rolled that there is no constitutional right to abortion, I presume each state would have enacted their own laws governing this issue. We would already be where we are going, but without all the social media rancor.

Only 20% of voters said students \"should attend the schools they are assigned to attend.\"\n\nDavid Byler, chief of research at Noble Predictive Insights, told The Center Square that the question tests how voters react to the conservative argument for school choice, charter schools or what are sometimes described as school vouchers or education savings accounts (ESAs).\n\n\"It says, 'What do you think of having choice when it comes to education?' And what you find is that the message there works really pretty well.\"\n\nByler said that even across political parties, the percentage of voters who back school choice initiatives is surprisingly high.\n\n\"If you look at the party crosstabs, you have very high support amongst Republicans, and you have some strong support amongst Democrats, which makes it a classic wedge issue, an issue where one party is united, and the other party is divided.\"\n\nAmong Republicans, 77% said they back a federal school choice program while 62% of Democrats responded affirmatively to 27% who said students should attend the school they are assigned.\n\nTrue independents were least enthused about a federal school choice program, the poll found, though 60% of likely independent voters signaled approval and 24% said they thought students should be assigned to their schools.\n\nByler said how Democratic voters respond illustrates a divide in the party and where Republicans and Democrats can come together.\n\n\"So amongst Democrats, you have sort of a pro-reform wing. You saw this a lot during the Obama era, where there was one side open to things like charter schools, open to measures that have that sort of reform-minded origin,\" Byler said.\n\n\"And you had a separate side, that's more teachers union-oriented and more traditionalist that says we don't necessarily need changes in how students are sent to school or what schools they're sent to,\" Byler said.\n\n\"Republicans like the idea of some sort of greater choice, some sort of market forces being unleashed in schools,\" Byler said. \"They can find some allies on the Democratic side who maybe aren't as into the idea of markets, but are into the idea of reform who might be able to meet them halfway.\n\n\"And then you also have some Democrats who are a little bit more traditionalist in their ideas about education and what it takes to make changes and improvement. And so that's really what this tests,\" Byler said.\n\nByler said asking voters if school choice would weaken public schools would better illustrate how voters feel about Democrat-led talking points on school funding.\n\n\"That's the strongest Democratic message, the idea that some form of school choice is ultimately going to lead to lower quality or fewer resources for public schools,\" Byler said.\n\nUltimately, Byler said what voters want is for schools to teach students the best.\n\n\"What people ultimately want is for schools to work and so you get a public that is open to messages on either side that seem like they're headed toward that goal of making the education system work,\" Byler said.\n\n• This story initially published at Chalkboard News, a K-12 news site that, like The Center Square, is also published by Franklin News Foundation."

Abbott has led the charge to pass the bill after previous efforts failed in the House, including successfully campaigning last year to replace House Republicans who opposed the measure.\n\nPublished: April 3, 2025 11:17pm\n\nThe Texas House Committee on Public Education on Thursday passed a school choice bill for the first time in state history.\n\nThe committee, chaired by state Rep. Brad Buckley, R-Killeen, passed SB 2, filed by state Sen. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe, which passed the Texas Senate and was sent to the House for consideration. The legislation would create an Education Savings Account program to provide taxpayer-funded subsidies for primarily low-income families of roughly $10,000 per student.\n\nBoth the Texas Senate and House proposed budgets allocating $1 billion for the program to support roughly 100,000 students, prioritizing low-income and special needs students, The Center Square reported . The savings accounts can be used by parents to send their children to the school of their choice, including private schools.\n\nThe committee advanced the bill by a vote of 9-6. It also passed HB 2, a school funding bill filed by Buckley by a vote of 13-2. Buckley filed an education package, including HB 2, HB 3, the House version of SB 2, and HB 4, implementing public school assessment and accountability processes, The Center Square reported .\n\nThe package was filed after House Speaker Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, identified expanding public-school funding and creating the state's first ESA program as legislative priorities. Public education and creating Texas' first ESA were also identified as emergency legislative items by Gov. Greg Abbot. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick listed school choice as a legislative priority in the Texas Senate, which has passed school choice bills for several years that went nowhere in the Texas House.\n\nAbbott praised the committee vote, saying, \"Texas is within reach of the largest school choice program launch in the nation.\" Abbott has led the charge to pass the bill after previous efforts failed in the House, including successfully campaigning last year to replace House Republicans who opposed the measure. Abbott's efforts paid off. Many new House Republicans won their primary , runoff and general elections and were sworn into office in January, all vowing to vote for the bill.\n\nThe committee \"moved universal school choice one step closer to reaching my desk,\" Abbott said. \"This achievement was truly a team effort. Chairman Brad Buckley and the members of his committee worked around-the-clock to hear public testimony that lasted for nearly 24 hours. I thank them, as well as Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, Speaker Dustin Burrows, and Chairman Brandon Creighton, for their tireless work to empower Texas parents and students by providing school choice. I look forward to its swift passage in the Texas House and signing this bill into law.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Burrows said the bill would pass. He has joined Abbott at events promoting it, The Center Square reported .\n\nAccording to a recent poll, a majority of registered voters surveyed in Texas, 63%, support a proposal to create Texas' first Education Savings Account program, The Center Square reported .\n\nSupport exists across multiple demographics. The majority of Black respondents, 69%, white respondents, 62%, and Latino respondents, 59%, support an ESA program open to all students. Likewise, 78% of Republicans, 64% of Independents and 46% of Democrats support it.\n\nA \"Texas Trends\" survey launched by the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs and Texas Southern University also reported similar support. Of the nearly 2,300 Texans surveyed, 69% said they support an ESA program for all parents statewide, The Center Square reported.\n\n\"There is across-the-board support, not only across racial and partisan lines, but among urban, suburban and rural voters,\" Jim Granato, dean and professor at the Hobby School, said. \"Rural residents, and the legislators who represent them, have traditionally joined with urban Democrats to oppose voucher proposals, but we found 63% of respondents in rural and semi-rural areas support vouchers open to all families, along with 64% of suburban residents and 67% of urban residents.\"\n\nThe ESA bill and other Buckley measures that passed will next go before the full House for a vote."

The measure also included a requirement that only U.S. citizens vote in the state's elections. The ballot measure was passed, according to NBC News . Missouri is the 11th state to ban RCV .\n\nAlaska is one of two states that has RCV statewide and is the only state with a ballot measure to repeal the election system. The results of the ballot measure are close , but it may pass, if the final vote tabulation follows the trend of \"yes\" votes leading the \"no\" votes.\n\nOut of the ballot measures to implement RCV statewide and in the nation's capital, the only one that has passed is Washington, D.C.'s.\n\nBallot measures to implement RCV were defeated in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and South Dakota.

The battle over whether to implement or ban RCV has been ongoing for nearly a decade. However, more states have banned RCV or chosen not to use it than have implemented it.\n\nRCV is an election process whereby if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, then a runoff system is triggered. When voters cast their ballots, they rank each candidate in order of first-to-last.\n\nIf no candidate reaches the 50% plus-one vote threshold, then the candidate with the least amount of first-choice votes is eliminated, then second-choice votes from those who voted for the last-place finisher are reallocated among the remaining candidates and tallied - in a process that continues until a candidate receives the majority of the vote.\n\nRCV proponents argue that the system results in representative outcomes and majority rule, incentivizes positive campaigning, allows for more voter choice, and saves money when replacing preliminaries or runoffs, according to pro-RCV organization FairVote .\n\nAt the same time, election integrity advocates have warned of the increased use of more dark money in RCV elections, and NAACP chapters have raised issues about RCV potentially confusing voters. Alaska and Maine are the only two states that use RCV in elections statewide, and three counties and 46 cities use RCV, according to FairVote . Maine was the first state to implement RCV statewide in 2018.\n\nThe movement to ban RCV began in Florida and Tennessee in 2022, followed by Idaho, Montana and South Dakota in 2023, then Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma last year.\n\nLast year ballot measures to implement RCV were largely defeated . Washington, D.C., was the only jurisdiction that passed a ballot measure to implement RCV, after the city's Democratic Party lost a lawsuit to block the initiative from being placed on the ballot. Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Oregon all rejected ballot measures to enact the system in November.\n\nWyoming Gov. Mark Gordon (R) on Tuesday signed a bill into law banning RCV.\n\n\"Partisan and nonpartisan candidates who receive the largest number of votes for each office to be filled at the general election are elected,\" the enacted bill reads. \"Nothing in this election code shall be deemed to authorize any election in Wyoming to be conducted through ranked choice voting. Any existing or future ordinance enacted or adopted by a county, municipality or any other governmental entity that purports to authorize ranked choice voting in violation of this subsection is void.\"\n\nJason Snead, co-chairman of Stop RCV and executive director of the Honest Elections Project, praised Wyoming for enacting the ban on RCV. \"It should be easy to vote and hard to cheat, but ranked-choice voting makes it harder to vote and harder to trust the results,\" Snead said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Voters can be thankful that state officials like Secretary of State Chuck Gray in Wyoming are leading the charge to stop RCV and protect ordinary, common-sense election processes.\"\n\n\"Wyoming is a state known for taking election integrity seriously,\" he added. \"Banning ranked-choice voting and the private election funding scheme known as ' Zuck Bucks ' goes a long way in ensuring that Wyoming maintains its position as one of the best states in the country for honest elections.\n\n\"The Wyoming state legislature and Secretary Chuck Gray have been instrumental in critical protections signed into law. Wyoming has already earned the distinction of being the first state in 2025 to stop foreign influence in state ballot measures. Banning ranked-choice voting and 'Zuck Bucks' will further secure election integrity and increase voter confidence in the electoral process in the state of Wyoming.\"\n\nWest Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey (R) also signed a bill into law banning RCV on Tuesday. \"No state, county, or local elections office may use ranked choice voting or instant runoff voting to conduct an election or nomination of any candidate in this state for any local government, statewide, or federal elective office,\" according to the enacted bill . \"Any existing or future ordinance enacted or adopted by a county, a municipality, or any other local government entity which is in conflict with this section is void.\"\n\nWest Virginia Secretary of State Kris Warner (R) on Thursday commended the state legislature for passing the bill. \"Ranked choice voting is a complicated process that reduces confidence in election outcomes,\" Warner said in a statement. \"It can theoretically result in an initially third-or-fourth favorite candidate being elected.\"\n\n\"Fair, accurate, and secure elections are the foundation of our government. In West Virginia, the highest vote-getter is the winner. That method is tried and true, easy to understand, uniform, and transparent to the electorate,\" he added .\n\n\"I am grateful to the Legislature for taking this simple but important legislation seriously and getting it across the finish line early in the session,\" Warner said .\n\nSnead also noted West Virginia's track record of election integrity. \"West Virginians have grown accustomed to secure elections with timely results,\" Snead said Wednesday. \"By outlawing ranked-choice voting statewide, the legislature and governor have ensured that voters will continue to get just that.\"\n\nTrent England, co-chairman of Stop RCV and executive director of Save Our States, elaborated on the drawbacks to RCV. \"RCV is a failed election reform,\" England said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"It hasn't lived up to any of the claims made by FairVote and other far-left groups that push it. Instead, it's disenfranchised elderly and minority voters, delayed results, and elected fringe candidates. Thankfully, states are rushing to ban RCV.\""

With RCV, if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, then a runoff system is triggered. When voters cast their ballots, they rank each candidate in order of first-to-last.\n\nIf one candidate doesn't reach the 50% plus-one vote threshold, then the candidate with the least amount of first-choice votes is eliminated, then second-choice votes from those who voted for the last-place finisher are reallocated among the remaining candidates and tallied - in a process that continues until a candidate receives the majority of the vote.\n\nRCV proponents argue that the system results in representative outcomes and majority rule, incentivizes positive campaigning, allows for more voter choice, and saves money when replacing preliminaries or runoffs, according to pro-RCV organization FairVote .\n\nAlaska and Maine are the only two states to have RCV at the state level, and both experienced delays in announcing the 2022 midterm election results. Election Day 2022 was Nov. 8, but the races for Alaska incumbents GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Rep. Mary Peltola weren't tabulated until Nov. 23.\n\nMurkowski trailed slightly behind Trump-backed Republican challenger Kelly Tshibaka on Nov. 18 at 43.11%, to Tshibaka's 43.28%, with 95% of the ballots counted. However, after counting the ranked choices until a candidate received a majority, Murkowski won with 54% of the vote.  In Maine's election, the results were announced eight days after Election Day.\n\nFairVote says that three U.S. counties and 45 cities also have RCV for their elections.\n\nThere are efforts to repeal RCV in Alaska , and a bill introduced in the Maine state legislature to repeal RCV failed to pass . The Maine Republican Party has stated that it will not consider all the RCV results in the GOP presidential primary and only consider the results of the candidate who wins the most votes during the first round, reported Maine Public .\n\nFlorida, Montana, Idaho, South Dakota, and Tennessee have banned RCV . Ohio is currently considering a bill that would ban RCV , the Ohio Capital Journal reported.\n\nEfforts are underway to have residents in various states vote on ballot measures for RCV-related constitutional amendments in November, with some measures already set to be voted on in the general election. Many of the ballot measures would implement RCV for presidential primary elections.\n\nThe states that are either considering bills in the legislature or ballot measures to be voted on in the November election are Arizona , Colorado , Idaho , Montana , Nevada , Oregon , and Wisconsin .\n\nWashington, D.C., also has a ballot measure applying RCV for voters to consider. However, the city's Democratic Party has filed a lawsuit to block the ballot measure, arguing that it might disenfranchise minority and low-income voters, reported Oklahoma Watch.\n\nNAACP chapters in Oakland, Calif., the state of New York and Arlington, Va., have all raised issues about RCV potentially confusing voters.\n\nWhile Montana and Idaho enacted laws banning RCV, constitutional amendments approving them would supersede those laws.\n\nIn Colorado and Nevada, elected officials have also warned against RCV.\n\nColorado county clerks have expressed concerns over lower voter turnout due to RCV's complexity and likely negative impact on the security of the state's election system, according to Coloradoan. The Colorado ballot initiative was proposed by the former CEO of Denver-based dialysis giant DaVita, Kent Thiry, who claims it will bring elections back to the people, rather than allow political insiders to have too much power, the news outlet reported .\n\nIn Nevada, elected officials from both sides of the political aisle - including the state's governor, senators, a congressman, and state legislators - oppose RCV , according to Ballotpedia.\n\nWisconsin is simultaneously considering a ballot measure to ban RCV through a state constitutional amendment and a bill to implement RCV, according to Fox News .\n\nLikewise, federal lawmakers have two bills pending regarding RCV. The Senate bill endorses RCV. Called the Voter Choice Act and reintroduced last month by Senators Angus King, I-Maine, and Michael Bennet, D-Colo., would provide \"$40 million in federal grants to cover up to 50 percent of the cost for state and local governments that choose to adopt RCV\" for federal elections, according to King's press release.\n\nMeanwhile, the House bill, the One Vote One Choice Act , introduced by Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., in May, would \"prohibit States from using ranked choice voting to carry out an election for Federal office.\"\n\nJason Snead, executive director of Honest Elections Project, told Just the News on Monday that RCV proponents are \"misleading people\" by claiming that RCV presidential primaries are open primaries, where voters do not have to declare their party affiliation to cast their ballot. RCV primaries are actually like the California jungle primary system, where there is no party primary and all the candidates run \"on a single ballot for each race,\" Snead explained.\n\nHe added that by forcing candidates to seek to win second and third-place votes, they must outsource their negative campaigning to independent expenditure groups. Therefore, campaigns need \"more dark money,\" Snead said.\n\nAs a result, through RCV, donors increase \"their influence over politics\" at \"the expense of political parties,\" he noted.\n\nAfter Election Day 2024, Snead said that Americans could wake up to \"one-fifth of the states in the nation\" using RCV in future elections, which would \"be a massive shift in the way Americans are conducting elections.\" He believes RCV is \"detrimental\" to \"transparency,\" as it \"turns elections into a black box,\" leading to delays in counting votes, more difficult recounts, election results being \"harder to understand, and discouraging people from voting.\"\n\n\"RCV is elite-choice voting,\" Snead said, adding that the \"same cohorts of big money donors on the left are pushing this, weakening the party apparatus,\" so that they will be \"in position to step in and fill the gap.\" He believes that \"liberal mega-donors are buying a new election system\" that will \"cater to their interests\" and help push politics further left."
