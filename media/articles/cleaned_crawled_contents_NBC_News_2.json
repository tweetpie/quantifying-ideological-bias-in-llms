      "text": "nbc news\n\nWith less than three weeks to Election Day, as the polls tighten and early voting is underway in dozens of states, Donald Trump has pulled out of yet another mainstream media network TV interview, the third in less than a week, this time with NBC News.\n\n\"Overnight,\" CNN 's Brian Stelter writes in his newsletter, \"I learned of another planned Trump interview that was suddenly scrapped. NBC News thought it had secured a sit-down with Trump to discuss the economy and other matters, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter. The interview was expected to take place in Philadelphia on Monday and correspondent Christine Romans (a CNN alum) was set to be the interviewer, I'm told. But then it was called off by the Trump team.\"\n\nTrump also pulled out of a scheduled interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" which aired its interview with Trump's Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris , on Sunday. Also this week he abruptly canceled an interview with a pro-Trump CNBC host.\n\nRELATED: Harris Goes All in With Fox News, Charlamagne, and Possibly Rogan Interviews\n\nTrump this week did appear in a staged Fox News town hall that was taped and edited, filled with GOP women voters hand-picked and invited by Fox News that aired Wednesday morning. Stelter described it as \"very friendly.\" He appeared on a Univision town hall Wednesday night and did not do well in front of undecided Latino voters in Miami who asked him several questions he could not or would not answer. Trump also did not do well in a live interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait at the Economic Club of Chicago, during which he grew defensive and attacked the host .\n\nStelter says Trump's canceled NBC interview was \"postponed,\" according to one of his sources, \"and NBC is in discussions to reschedule it...\"\n\n\"Look,\" Dante Atkins, an expert in strategic communications and campaign management, wrote in response to the Harris campaign's post highlighting Stelter's reporting, \"if I were asked about climate change and I responded by talking about how I got awards for mixing sand and water, I would cancel the rest of my interviews too. Trump's best shot at this point is to hide from the public so they don't see just how bad his sundowning is.\"\n\nAtkins appeared to be referring to Trump's damaging Univision town hall, and the ex-president's Philadelphia town hall Monday night where he stopped answering questions after taking just four from the audience, waited for two medical events to be addressed, then spent more than 30 minutes on stage playing his favorite music and dancing . Several internet commenters suggested Trump is suffering from dementia and was \"sundowning.\" The New York Times' Paul Krugman cited \"Trump's bizarre behavior\" and his \"cognitive decline.\"\n\nThe Bulwark on Tuesday reported since Trump's only debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, he isn't giving interviews to the mainstream media.\n\n\"In recent weeks, Trump has almost exclusively decamped to outlets that are already in his tank. Since the September 10 presidential debate, with the exceptions of a Las Vegas ABC affiliate and a quick NewsNation hit, nearly all of Trump's 14 one-one interviews have been with interviewers ranging from friendly to sycophantic.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign's Ammar Moussa wrote : \"Trump cancelled on 60 Minutes, is refusing a second debate, and is hiding his medical records. What's going on?\"\n\nVanity Fair's Molly Jong-Fast remarked , \"This seems very weak of Trump.\"\n\nDemocratic strategist Matt McDermott added , \"If Kamala Harris had canceled three major sitdown interviews in the past week, headlines across America would be demanding answers as to what the candidate is hiding.\"\n\nREAD MORE : 'Is He OK?': Trump's Dark of Night Rage Posting Backfires\n\nThe backlash from NBC News' hiring of Ronna McDaniel is not over. New reporting from Puck, CNN, and The Washington Post reveals the considerable efforts from top NBC and MSNBC brass to recruit, hire, and support the former RNC chair who promoted false election claims, was allegedly involved in helping Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, and refused to say Joe Biden had been elected fairly.\n\nStaffers at NBC News and MSNBC were outraged at McDaniel's hiring, but new details about behind-the-scenes efforts reportedly have increased that outrage.\n\nSome critics are either calling for resignations of NBC News and MSNBC leadership, or questioning how long they can ride out the mess.\n\n\"What is Brian Roberts going to do?\" CNN 's Oliver Darcy asks. \"The Comcast boss is watching an unceasing five-alarm fire rage at 30 Rock, scarring the reputation of NBC News and threatening to consume multiple parts of the Cesar Conde-run NBC Universal News Group.\"\n\n\"Conde has lost control of his organization, prompting industry insiders to wonder how he continues to remain in his role as chairman of the NBC News Group. In the words of one veteran media executive I spoke to Wednesday, 'It's inconceivable that he should,'\" Darcy writes, saying Conde's actions and those of his top executives have \"hosed gasoline\" on the scandal.\n\nThat scandal involves these revelations from Puck's Dylan Byers, who reports , \"bringing McDaniel to 30 Rock had been part of a nearly two-month-long effort that was spearheaded by Budoff Brown and her boss, NBC News President Rebecca Blumenstein, with buy-in from Conde and his deputies at both NBC News and MSNBC.\"\n\n\"Rashida Jones,\" he adds, \"the president of MSNBC, was very interested in having McDaniel appear as a contributor on her network, as well.\"\n\nBut this bombshell has drawn a good deal of attention. Noting how Chuck Todd led off the very public pushback against the hiring of McDaniel, Byers reports, \"On Sunday, Budoff Brown reached out to McDaniel's aide and former chief of staff at the R.N.C., Richard Walters, to see if there were any friends or colleagues who could speak up on her behalf.\"\n\n\"The two sides also discussed having these folks call attention to what they saw as a double standard-after all, this was the same network that was turning Psaki, a former Biden White House Press Secretary, into a Maddow-adjacent prime time star. Walters later assured Budoff Brown that they'd been able to advance conservative pushback on social media against Todd, specifically, and that this might give NBC News some cover, for which Budoff Brown thanked him.\"\n\nCNN, pointing to those details, adds, \"staffers inside NBC News are enraged at the fact an executive would have engaged in such behavior.\"\n\nFormer Chicago Tribune editor Mark Jacobs, who now writes about politics and the media , called for the firing of Jones, Blumenstein, and Budoff Brown.\n\nOther critics are expressing concerns on multiple fronts.\n\n\"It's like the hunger games at @NBCNews. Every day new, horrible stories of journalism & corporate malpractice. Every single one of these managers must go,\" observed Jennifer Schulze, a media critic who was a Chicago Sun-Times executive producer, WGN news director, and adjunct college professor of journalism.\n\nShe also highlights a Washington Post report that ropes NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt into the mess.\n\n\"Every @NBCNews exec who thought hiring a reputed liar & phony elector co-[conspirator] needs to resign or be fired,\" Schulze says .\n\n\"The @NBCNews managers who recruited & signed an election denier should be out the door, too,\" she adds . \"Not only was it downright offensive to hire Ronna, it was journalism AND corporate malpractice.\"\n\nPointing to his newsletter , former Obama senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer writes , \"NBC's ill-fated decision to hire Ronna McDaniel is a story of a media outlet unwilling to accept the ways Trump changed politics, but it's also one of the best arguments for Dems need to build our media ecosystem ASAP.\"\n\nHe calls McDaniel's hiring \"evidence\" the media has \"yet to accept the reality that this is not a normal election between a Republican and a Democrat.\" And adds , \"An [industry] that prizes objectivity above all else, is incapable of accurately covering an election where one candidate is a normal politician and the other is an insurrectionist. Many in the media would rather stumble into autocracy than take a side.\"\n\nVeteran journalist and Sirius XM host Michelangelo Signorile observes , \"We couldn't have asked for a better situation to shine a bright light on the corruption of the corporate media-and its impulse to legitimize MAGA extremism and lawbreakers for profit-than NBC's hiring former RNC chair, election denier, and Trump enabler Ronna McDaniel.\"\n\nAnd he warns, \"The forces that made the coup-plotting former RNC chair a paid contributor are still shaping news and information about this pivotal election.\"\n\nFormer Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Ronna McDaniel is reportedly done at NBC News just days after she was hired, according to a breaking report.\n\nPuck News correspondent Dylan Byers was first out with the news , tweeting that he had obtained insider information from NBC News confirming that the network was planning to announce McDaniel's firing after an internal meeting. McDaniel is reportedly speaking with her own legal counsel, suggesting the former RNC chief may attempt to sue NBC for wrongful termination.\n\nByers attributed the impending firing of McDaniel to \"on-air revolt from NBC/MSNBC talent,\" after a weekend of contentious segments from both NBC and MSNBC commentators engaging in rare on-camera critique of their employer's decision to hire her. MSNBC primetime host Rachel Maddow in particular went viral for her commentary about NBC's decision to hire the former GOP chair, based on her well-documented role in helping former President Donald Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nIn her opening segment on Monday night, Maddow explained how McDaniel is specifically mentioned in Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of former President Donald Trump in his DC election interference case. She also noted that she supported an RNC resolution that criticized the prosecution of January 6 criminal defendants, describing their actions against the US Capitol as \"legitimate political discourse.\"\n\n\"The fact that Ms. McDaniel is on the payroll at NBC News, to me that is inexplicable. You wouldn't hire, like, a 'wise guy,' you wouldn't hire a 'made man,' like a mobster to work at a DA's office, right? You wouldn't hire a pickpocket to work as a TSA screener,\" Maddow said. \"And so I find the decision to put her on the payroll inexplicable and I hope they will reverse that decision.\"\n\nAt the time McDaniel's hiring was announced, NBC vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown said in a company memo that \"it couldn't be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna's on the team.\" But other voices on the network, like former Meet the Press host Chuck Todd, vehemently disagreed.\n\n\"There's a reason why there are a lot of journalists at NBC News uncomfortable with this because many of our professional dealings with the RNC over the last six years have been met with gaslighting, have been met with character assassination,\" Todd said on Sunday.\n\nIt isn't impossible that McDaniel herself could be the subject of an investigation in the future. She was present on the call with Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when she promised legal representation to several Wayne County, Michigan election officials in exchange for their refusal to certify the results of the 2020 election.\n\n\"The reality is there are several criminal inquiries happening at the state and federal level into the post-election attempts to both pressure local elected officials, state lawmakers to interfere with the process, all the way up to the tragedy on our capitol, at the US Capitol on January 6th,\" Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in December. \"Will the existing criminal investigation capture any additional illegality that are revealed through this reporting? That's possible.\"\n\nMcDaniel would have been paid $300,000 as a part-time on-air political contributor on NBC News. Her hire came after the network fired MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan - who was one of the network's most critical voices of the Netanyahu regime's response to the October 7 Hamas terror attack. NBC also fired more than a dozen union-affiliated reporters prior to announcing McDaniel's hire.\n\n\"Ronna encouraged a lie that many of our own journalists have spent countless hours debunking,\" the NBC News Guild tweeted . \"Our journalism is tarnished by @NBCNews execs elevating a liar over the workers who have spent years delivering the kind of reporting that our newsrooms are typically known for.\"\n\nExactly two weeks after her Trump-engineered exit as chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel has been hired by NBC News and MSNBC as a political commentator, fomenting fury among journalists, press watchers, and ordinary Americans.\n\nDeclaring that the network has a \"crucial mission,\" which it \"performs like no other,\" NBC News senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown announced McDaniel's hiring to employees in a memo Friday, which ws published by The Hollywood Reporter .\n\n\"It couldn't be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna's on the team,\" Brown wrote. \"As chair of the Republican National Committee, she spent nearly eight years at the highest levels of American politics before stepping down earlier this year. As we gear up for the longest general election season in recent memory, she will support our leading coverage by providing an insider's perspective on national politics and on the future of the Republican Party - which she led through some of the most turbulent and challenging moments in political history. And as a longtime Michigan resident, she'll be an important voice from one of this year's key battlegrounds.\"\n\nCritics shared a different version of McDaniels' résumé - and NBC News' responsibilities.\n\n\"NBC is and must be, first and foremost, in the credibility business. She will compromise that every time she appears on air. She cannot be trusted,\" wrote David Rothkopf, a journalist, author, and foreign policy, national security and political affairs analyst and commentator. Rothkopf is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also called it \"a terrible decision\" and McDaniel \"a proven serial liar.\"\n\nMedia Matters ran this headline: \"NBC News hires Ronna McDaniel, who played a key role in Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, according to NBC News.\"\n\nThe sub-head: \"Even participating in an attempted coup can't disrupt the politics-to-pundit pipeline.\"\n\n\"Prosecutors argued that, as NBC News characterized it, McDaniel has 'unique knowledge' about 'the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election,'\" writes Media Matters' John Knefel. \"NBC News executives can perhaps be forgiven for these repeated oversights, though. After all, the network laid off dozens of its news staffers in January, so maybe there aren't enough researchers around to dig into the network's own coverage of its newest contributor.\"\n\nOthers also pointed to McDaniel's credibility and alleged actions to undermine democracy and overturn the 2020 election.\n\n\"McDaniel lied about the 2020 election result, was involved in a pressure campaign to get Michigan officials not to certify the vote, and has accused MSNBC of 'spreading lies' and employing 'primetime propagandists,'\" declared former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan, now editor-in-chief of Zeteo News.\n\nPolitical strategist Rachel Bitecofer, talking about McDaniel's work during the 2020 election, wrote : \"Ronna McDaniel was balls deep in the coup plot. She flew to swing states to encourage Republican state legislators and Republican election officials to submit fraudulent electors to steal the election from Joe Biden. If I was an @NBCNews employee I'd be pissed.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast's senior media reporter Justin Baragona dug up a social media post by McDaniel that disparages the network she will now be working for.\n\nAttorney and MediasTouch.com editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski posted video of McDaniel \"saying she hopes the US defaults on its debt because that will help Republicans.\"\n\nFormer Chicago Tribune editor Mark Jacob served NBC News this dire warning: \"A MAGA dictatorship would crush legitimate news organizations and embrace propaganda outfits. By hiring fascist liar Ronna McDaniel, NBC has shown which one it wants to be.\"\n\n\"Carrie Budoff Brown is a traitor to democracy,\" continued Jacob, who writes the Stop the Presses newsletter. He added : \"This is what media complicity with fascism looks like. NBC is paying a co-conspirator in the Jan. 6 insurrection to keep deceiving the American people.\"\n\nCurrent MSNBC columnist Marisa Kabas wrote Brown a letter in which she says , \"As we approach the 2024 election, it has never been more important for viewers and readers to have trust in their news outlets. Rehabilitating the reputation of an enabler of a government coup will completely undermine that trust.\"\n\n\"As RNC Chairwoman,\" Kabas continued, \"McDaniel was quite literally on a phone call with former President Trump when he pressured two local Michigan officials not to sign the certification of the 2020 presidential election. McDaniel told the officials, 'If you can go home tonight and do not sign it... We will get you attorneys.' She also called for an erroneous investigation into another Michigan county's voting procedures which was so riddled with false claims, the Michigan Department of State issued a statement saying her claims had 'no merit.'\"\n\nDash Dobrofsky, who writes The Gen Z Perspective, posted : \"MSNBC just hired Ronna McDaniel - an election-denying, racist, pro-fascist, homophobic pathological liar - as their latest political contributor/commentator. In other words, they will pay her to lie for Trump during an election year. MSNBC is not a legitimate news organization.\"\n\nFrom McDaniel's home state, Craig Mauger of The Detroit News writes : \"Here's our reporting from December about her involvement in a call to pressure the Wayne County canvassers not to sign the 2020 election certification,\" as he points to this story that reads in part:\n\n\"On a Nov. 17, 2020, phone call, which also involved Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, Trump told Monica Palmer and William Hartmann, the two GOP Wayne County canvassers, they'd look 'terrible' if they signed the documents after they first voted in opposition and then later in the same meeting voted to approve certification of the county's election results, according to the recordings.\"\n\nPuck News founding partner and Washington correspondent Julia Ioffe summed it up :\n\n\"Real journalists are losing their jobs, but the handmaids of American fascism are getting plum spots in legacy American media organizations. Shame on you, @NBCNews.\"\n\nThe third Republican presidential primary debate in Miami, Florida will be broadcasted Wednesday night on NBC, in partnership with a media company that has spent the last few years trafficking in conspiracy theories related to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSalem Media Group - which also partnered with CNN in four presidential debates in 2016 - prominently features election deniers in its hosting lineup, according to a new report in the Washington Post . Salem notably had executive producer credits on the documentary \"2000 Mules.\" That film, made by far-right pundit and convicted felon Dinesh D'Souza, falsely suggested that several swing states President Joe Biden narrowly won conducted their elections in a fraudulent manner (Reuters fact-checked the film's claims and concluded they were baseless). Additionally, one of Salem's top podcasters is attorney Jenna Ellis , who recently pleaded guilty to a felony in Fulton County, Georgia for her attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n\"This is a major mistake for NBC,\" political historian Brian Rosenwald told the Post . \"I think it really undermines their journalistic credibility.\"\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nSalem, which was founded in 1974 with a stated mission \"to provide the best outlets and platforms for the Christian message,\" is a major player in the broadcasting sphere. Its website shows the network has radio stations in 19 states and Washington, DC, and the Post reports that its programming is disseminated by more than 3,100 radio stations nationwide. The network is also fervently behind former President Donald Trump, hiring former Trump White House staffer Sebastian Gorka in 2020 along with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.\n\nFormer Congressman Joe Walsh (R-Illinois), who was a Salem radio host between 2013 and 2019, alleges the network forced him out of its lineup after he refused to \"get on Team Trump.\"\n\n\"I told them I can only say what I believe every time I go on the radio, and that just couldn't stand there. You could not stand there being even ambivalent to Trump,\" Walsh told the Post . \"[Salem] brought in these idiots whose only cachet was they were Trump cheerleaders.\"\n\nNBC's partnership with Salem was reportedly foisted upon the network by the Republican National Committee when it initially organized the debate, though the Post reports that the network will maintain \"full editorial control\" over the questions candidates will be asked. Tonight's debate stage will feature former Governor Chris Christie (R-New Jersey), Governor Ron DeSantis (R-Florida), former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, and Senator Tim Scott (R-South Carolina). Donald Trump - the heavy frontrunner - will not be in attendance.\n\nOn Tuesday, NBC News published a piece of commentary arguing that President Donald Trump's behavior so far over the past several days is \"toned-down\" and \"presidential\":\n\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is already facing an avalanche of accusations of perjury after his fiery testimony last week contained many gross mischaracterizations and many outright falsehoods. But a new report from NBC News on Monday evening only added to the judge's troubles, suggesting he may have knowingly misled the Senate under oath about the extent of his knowledge of the second set of sexual misconduct allegations brought against him.\n\nDonald Trump started the morning with a string of allegations, including accusing NBC and Lester Holt of \"fudging my tape on Russia.\" Which would appear to be a claim that Holt had somehow altered or edited the interview that he conducted with Trump on May 11, 2017, just after Trump fired James Comey. In that interview, Trump admitted that the reason for Comey's firing was that he refused to halt the Russia investigation.\n\nWhy would Trump suddenly, more than fifteen months after it aired, be introducing the idea that Holt \"fudged\" the interview? The only clue might be the other tweets that Trump issued on Thursday morning.\n\nIt's clear that Comey was on Trump's mind. In addition to the comment about Holt, Trump fired off a separate tweet saying that \"The only thing James Comey ever got right was when he said that President Trump was not under investigation!\" Which is not something that Comey ever said, at least not in public. It's something that Trump said Comey said, most notably in the letter he had a bodyguard drop on Comey's desk while Comey was on the West Coast. It certainly seems significant that, like the Holt interview, Trump felt compelled to resurrect this old claim.\n\nAnd in addition to attacking NBC, Trump also tossed insults at CNN's management. He followed up with a tweet saying that the media in general is \"totally dishonest\" and \"truth doesn't matter to them.\" Trump also makes a swipe at \"fake books\" before repeating his new, dangerous, Stalinist motto that the media is the \"Enemy of the People!\" This, together with his statement about the Holt interview, would seem to reflect a line Trump began pressing last month .\n\nTrump : Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what's happening, Just stick with us, don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has attacked both Google and social media with claims that they're filtering out his supporters. Trump has argued that sites like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram shouldn't attempt to stop hate speech or threats, and should instead let all statements come through. In that context, Trump's accusations against Holt are just another brick in the wall of obfuscation Trump is building between Americans and objective truth.\n\nIt also seems quite possible that Trump's new attempts to claw away what remains of reality might also be connected with another pair of tweets he issued this morning. The first was about how Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had \"nothing to do\" with pushing Don McGahn out of the White House. The second was about how excited Trump was at the person he was bringing in to replace McGahn. So excited, that he apparently forgot that person's name.\n\nTrump finished the first of these tweets by claiming that media reports of conflict in the White House are overblown, saying \"They know that chaos doesn't exist-just a 'smooth running machine' with changing parts!\"\n\nJust like when you're driving down the highway, and your transmission smoothly drops to the asphalt.\n\nNBC News is not ready to bench MSNBC host and political commentator Joy Reid after alleged anti-LGBT posts from her long-shuttered blog were surfaced by an amateur sleuth on Twitter. Reid has stated her site was hacked and denies she wrote the posts. She says she contacted a cyber-security expert who investigated and has issued a report that finds there was a breach of her site.\n\nAmericans who care about democracy and voting should stop jumping to conclusions about Russians hunkered down in Moscow cyber-bunkers , and instead look at what's happening on these shores as shoddy journalists and Silicon Valley's content curators are doing Vladimir Putin's work for him. Last week, a mini-drama played out in the world of American elections, Russian interference and vote-hacking conspiracies that was a microcosm of the same online dynamics that tilted and force-fed American voters seven times as much Hillary-hating propaganda on YouTube as comparable anti-Trump content. This snapshot reveals that little has changed in the misinformation engines driving the attention economy. This is the frail state of American democracy today, where the most powerful content curators, opportunistic partisans, poorly informed journalists-and yes, overseas adversaries-are funneling and amplifying \"divisive, sensational and conspiratorial\" content, as one authoritative report put it, further undermining already shaky public confidence in voting.\n\nCNN reports that five women have accused Mark Halperin, a popular political journalist and co-author of Game Change , of sexual harassment during his time at ABC News."

      "text": "'Mistake of epic proportions': Trump allies making national security adviser 'the fall guy'\n\nAs the so-called \"Signalgate\" scandal continues to dominate news coverage in the U.S., many Democrats are calling for President Donald Trump to fire Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Trump, however, is defending Hegseth and appears to be sticking by him.\n\nBut some Trump allies, according to NBC News , have someone else in mind as a possible \"fall guy\": Defense Secretary Michael Waltz.\n\nThe scandal ignited on Monday, March 24, when The Atlantic published a bombshell article by editor Jeffrey Goldberg headlined \"The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans.\" Goldberg revealed that Waltz had mistakenly invited him to a group chat on Trump's plans for a military operation attacking Houthis in Yemen.\n\nTrump himself, who isn't fond of using either e-mail or text messaging, did not participate in the chat - which took place via the messaging app Signal. But top officials in his administration did, including Waltz, Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice President JD Vance and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, among others.\n\nBefore Goldberg's article was published, Waltz and the others had no idea that he had access to the chat.\n\nSome Trump allies are trying to downplay the severity of the scandal by attacking Goldberg - a line of attack that many Democrats are calling out as a ridiculous kill-the-messenger effort, noting that the Atlantic editor never asked to be invited to the Signal group chat. But Waltz said that he takes \"full responsibility\" for the security breech.\n\nIn an article published on March 26 , NBC News reporters Jonathan Allen, Matt Dixon and Katherine Doyle detail efforts by some Trump allies to make Waltz the \"fall guy.\"\n\nA former Trump adviser, interviewed on condition of anonymity, told NBC News , \"We are talking about a political problem right now.... They need to put this on someone and clean it up that way. The most obvious person to do that with is Waltz.\"\n\nA current Trump adviser, also quoted anonymously, told NBC News , \"This is serious, and it can't just be sloughed off. Any honorable public servant would see that and recognize that they've made a mistake of serious proportions, and a lesson needs to be learned from it.... I can assure you, if that were me, I would have resigned.\"\n\nIn a March 26 video posted on X , formerly Twitter, Barstool Sports' Dave Portnoy, a major Trump supporter, described \"Signalgate\" as a \"f----- of epic proportions\" and said, \"Trump, you may love Michael Waltz. You love Pete Hegseth. You may love these guys. Somebody has to go down.\"\n\nRead the full NBC News article at this link ."

Musk last month called Social Security \" a Ponzi scheme \" and \"one big pyramid scheme\" in an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan. As NBC reports, \"a Republican lawmaker ... said Musk's disparagement of Social Security has unnerved people.\"\n\nA Trump adviser acknowledged that they were aware of \"outside concern\" around Musk's comments. Trump allies - including some on Wall Street, in corporate America and Congress - have conveyed to the White House and even the president directly that Musk either has to be taken off air or needs to be more scripted.\n\nAccording to the report, an anonymous White House official \"said they were sympathetic to the views of some Republicans who see Musk's comments on Social Security as potentially problematic and worrying to some senior citizens.\"\n\n\"Of course they don't want their Social Security cut,\" the person told NBC News. \"So if they hear something on the news that Elon Musk is saying, that we should do something with Social Security - of course there might be some concerns. But the only concern they have to worry about is what the president of the United States is saying and what he's doing. We haven't touched Social Security. We're not going to touch Social Security.\"\n\nStill, the official affirmed Trump \"has full trust in Elon Musk's decisions.\"\n\n\"The reality is everything that Elon is doing when it comes to Social Security is just to improve it,\" the official said.\n\nIndeed, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a statement to NBC News, championed DOGE's work - while promising \"any American receiving Social Security benefits will continue to receive them.\"\n\n\"The sole mission of DOGE is to identify waste, fraud, and abuse only ... DOGE has already identified billions of dollars in savings for American taxpayers, and President Trump will continue to direct this effort until our government is truly for the people, and by the people.\"\n\n\"Even beyond the president, the White House itself has made crystal clear that they're not touching Social Security,\" a former Trump White House official told NBC News.\n\nBut the dialogue isn't going over well in some districts, as \"the one-two punch of office closures and new limits on phone service\" prompt bipartisan \"concerns,\" NBC News reports.\n\n\"On Thursday, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., described the choice to close a Social Security hearing office in his district as 'a slap in the face to thousands of my constituents who rely on these services,'\" the report adds.\n\nLawler, who represents a swing district, called the impact on his constituents \"completely unacceptable.\"\n\nRead the full report at NBC News."

McCaffrey on Sunday called the president's NBC News interview \"Mussolini talk,\" referring to former Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. \"Where are the Republicans leaders in Congress and [the] states,\" McCaffrey wondered.\n\nAs Newsweek reports, Trump's \"remarks came a day after Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland in a scaled-back visit with his wife, Usha Vance , touring the U.S.'s Pituffik Space Base in the northwest of the island, hundreds of miles from Greenland's capital, Nuuk.\" Former deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO policy, Jim Townsend, last week told Newsweek NATO \"would never recover\" from a U.S. military operation in Greenland. \"It would be just a horrendous catastrophe for the trans-Atlantic relationship, or NATO or U.S. relations with Europe and the rest of the world,\" Townsend said. \"It would hand a huge victory to Russia and to China,\" the former official added.

      "text": "NBC firing former RNC chair Ronna McDaniel after 'on-air revolt' from anchors: report\n\nFormer Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Ronna McDaniel is reportedly done at NBC News just days after she was hired, according to a breaking report.\n\nPuck News correspondent Dylan Byers was first out with the news , tweeting that he had obtained insider information from NBC News confirming that the network was planning to announce McDaniel's firing after an internal meeting. McDaniel is reportedly speaking with her own legal counsel, suggesting the former RNC chief may attempt to sue NBC for wrongful termination.\n\nByers attributed the impending firing of McDaniel to \"on-air revolt from NBC/MSNBC talent,\" after a weekend of contentious segments from both NBC and MSNBC commentators engaging in rare on-camera critique of their employer's decision to hire her. MSNBC primetime host Rachel Maddow in particular went viral for her commentary about NBC's decision to hire the former GOP chair, based on her well-documented role in helping former President Donald Trump attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nIn her opening segment on Monday night, Maddow explained how McDaniel is specifically mentioned in Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of former President Donald Trump in his DC election interference case. She also noted that she supported an RNC resolution that criticized the prosecution of January 6 criminal defendants, describing their actions against the US Capitol as \"legitimate political discourse.\"\n\n\"The fact that Ms. McDaniel is on the payroll at NBC News, to me that is inexplicable. You wouldn't hire, like, a 'wise guy,' you wouldn't hire a 'made man,' like a mobster to work at a DA's office, right? You wouldn't hire a pickpocket to work as a TSA screener,\" Maddow said. \"And so I find the decision to put her on the payroll inexplicable and I hope they will reverse that decision.\"\n\nAt the time McDaniel's hiring was announced, NBC vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown said in a company memo that \"it couldn't be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna's on the team.\" But other voices on the network, like former Meet the Press host Chuck Todd, vehemently disagreed.\n\n\"There's a reason why there are a lot of journalists at NBC News uncomfortable with this because many of our professional dealings with the RNC over the last six years have been met with gaslighting, have been met with character assassination,\" Todd said on Sunday.\n\nIt isn't impossible that McDaniel herself could be the subject of an investigation in the future. She was present on the call with Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when she promised legal representation to several Wayne County, Michigan election officials in exchange for their refusal to certify the results of the 2020 election.\n\n\"The reality is there are several criminal inquiries happening at the state and federal level into the post-election attempts to both pressure local elected officials, state lawmakers to interfere with the process, all the way up to the tragedy on our capitol, at the US Capitol on January 6th,\" Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in December. \"Will the existing criminal investigation capture any additional illegality that are revealed through this reporting? That's possible.\"\n\nMcDaniel would have been paid $300,000 as a part-time on-air political contributor on NBC News. Her hire came after the network fired MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan - who was one of the network's most critical voices of the Netanyahu regime's response to the October 7 Hamas terror attack. NBC also fired more than a dozen union-affiliated reporters prior to announcing McDaniel's hire.\n\n\"Ronna encouraged a lie that many of our own journalists have spent countless hours debunking,\" the NBC News Guild tweeted . \"Our journalism is tarnished by @NBCNews execs elevating a liar over the workers who have spent years delivering the kind of reporting that our newsrooms are typically known for.\""

      "text": "'Desperate measures': Johnson wants to 'eliminate an entire district court' to help Trump\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has a solution to help President Donald Trump circumvent a federal judge striking down his executive actions - getting rid of the court altogether.\n\nThat's according to a Tuesday article in NBC News , which reports the speaker floated the proposal in response to U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruling against Trump's invoking of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport immigrants without due process. Speaker Johnson reminded reporters that Congress has the ability to legislate new district courts into existence - and the power to abolish them.\n\n\"We do have the authority over the federal courts, as you know. We can eliminate an entire district court. We have power of funding over the courts and all these other things,\" Johnson said. \"But desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act.\"\n\nThe speaker later clarified that his remark wasn't necessarily a statement of intent, but rather an acknowledgement of Congress' powers under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, which established the federal judiciary. As NBC News reports, the last time Congress eliminated a federal court was in 1913, when it got rid of the Commerce Court and moved its cases to the U.S. Court of Appeals. And in 1982, Congress established the Article I Court of Federal Claims and the Article III U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n\nJohnson would face an uphill battle to eliminate a federal court. In addition to needing the support of the entirety of the House Republican Conference (which is questionable given Johnson's paper-thin GOP majority), any legislation to abolish a court would also need 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to bypass a filibuster. Republicans have a 53-seat majority and would need still seven Democrats to join them.\n\nAs NBC reports, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) previously hinted at legislative solutions to help Trump ram executive actions through the courts, though he didn't offer specific details. Rep, Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) has proposed a bill that would prevent U.S. District Court judges (like Boasberg) from issuing nationwide injunctions.\n\nTrump is using his bully pulpit to call for Boasberg's impeachment after the judge questioned Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act, which hasn't been invoked since World War II. Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas) last week introduced articles of impeachment targeting Boasberg. Actually removing Boasberg from the bench is an even heavier lift than the Senate's 60-vote threshold for legislative filibusters - two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote for conviction, meaning all Republicans would need 14 Democratic votes to successfully impeach a federal judge."

      "text": "'Pretty bad': Yale historian slams NBC for hiring ex-RNC chair who 'tried to disassemble our democracy'\n\nNBC News has drawn widespread criticism since announcing its decision to hire former Republican National Committee (RNC) Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel as a contributing pundit. And some of the criticism has come from prominent figures at MSNBC, including Rachel Maddow and \"Morning Joe\" hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski - who, on Monday, March 26, made it abundantly clear that they will not be featuring McDaniel on their show.\n\nThe hire has also been lambasted by everyone from Media Matters to Mehdi Hasan, a former MSNBC host who is now editor-in-chief of Zeteo News. But media figures aren't the only ones who are speaking out.\n\nTimothy Snyder , an historian at Yale University in Connecticut, considers NBC News' decision to feature McDaniel egregious in light of her efforts to help Trump overturn the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nSnyder has no problem with NBC News hiring conservatives. In fact, some of MSNBC's hosts are conservative, including Scarborough, Nicolle Wallace (who served as White House communications director under former President George W. Bush) and former RNC Chaiman Michael Steele.\n\nDuring an appearance on MSNBC, Snyder argued, \"What NBC has done, of its own volition, is bring into a very important conversation about democracy - one which is going to take place for the next seven months or so - someone who.... tried to disassemble our democracy, who personally took part in an attempt to undo the American system.\"\n\nThe Yale historian continued, \"And so.... what NBC is doing is saying, 'Well, (it) could be that in '24, our entire system will break down. Could be we'll have an authoritarian leader. Oh, but look, we've made this adjustment in advance because we've brought into the middle of NBC somebody who has already taken part in an attempt to take our system down.' So yeah, I think this is pretty bad.\"\n\nInterviewed by The Guardian - which he has written for - Snyder emphasized that a major media organization like NBC News shouldn't be hiring someone with a record of promoting outright lies.\n\nSnyder told The Guardian : \"If we're going to be putting people on the news who have participated in an attempt to overthrow the system, then we have to ask, at the very beginning: 'Why did you do that? Why is that legitimate?' And we have to ask ourselves, 'Why is it that we are taking this step to bring people into the middle of our discussion?'\"\n\nThe historian added , \"So, my two red lines are: You should be somebody who's at least trying for the facts, and you shouldn't be somebody who has taken part in an attempt to undo the system - which is what we're talking about here. We shouldn't mince words about it.\""

      "text": "What Was NBC Even Thinking?\n\nHiring Ronna McDaniel as a contributor angered the network's contributors, staff, and audience-and with seemingly no upside.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nAn old journalism axiom says that if everyone's mad at you, you must be doing something right. Since NBC announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the recently deposed chair of the Republican National Committee, as a paid contributor, everyone's been mad. NBC executives are sure to be consoling themselves that they're doing something right. It's just hard to see what.\n\nOn Sunday, Meet the Press host Kristen Welker rightly raked McDaniel over her past election denialism. Chuck Todd, Welker's predecessor at MTP , then said the network's bosses owed her an apology for placing her in a tough position-he said he didn't know whether to take McDaniel's answers as honest. \"There's a reason why there are a lot of journalists at NBC News uncomfortable with this, because many of our professional dealings with the RNC over the last six years have been met with gaslighting, have been met with character assassination,\" Todd said on air.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Republicans are no longer a political party\n\nThen, on Morning Joe today, the titular Scarborough said, \"We weren't asked our opinion of the hiring, but if we were, we would have strongly objected to it for several reasons.\" Co-host Mika Brzezinski said she hoped NBC would reconsider.\n\nIf NBC on-air personalities were the only ones who were upset, that wouldn't mean the McDaniel hire was bad per se-it might even be a nice demonstration of editorial courage. She's hardly the first political hack to get a TV gig-just ask MSNBC host Jen Psaki, a former White House press secretary, or ABC's George Stephanopoulos, a former White House communications director. Seeing such tsuris over a Republican hire, even as former Democrats pepper TV sets, has a whiff of hypocrisy-though, as Todd points out, the blood between the Trump GOP and journalists has been much worse than the normal partisan jostling.\n\nThe problem is that McDaniel has no apparent value to viewers or the network. When outlets hire figures like her, they typically say that these people add perspective and insight that only insiders can provide. \"It couldn't be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna's on the team,\" the NBC political editor Carrie Budoff Brown said in a statement .\n\nRead: Why Trump won't stop suing the media and losing\n\nSometimes, the private explanation is more mercenary. When CBS hired former White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney in 2022, an executive bluntly told staffers that the network expected Republicans to capture Congress in that year's midterm elections, and that Mulvaney would assist in getting \" access .\" Semafor 's Ben Smith has a related theory for this year : Many corporate leaders seem to have concluded that Donald Trump will win the presidential election, and so they're trying to make moves to get in his good graces.\n\nThe problem is that McDaniel falls short both as an editorial offering and as favor-currying. She spent more than seven years as chair of the RNC, but prior to that had only a short stint as a state party chair. Her management of the national party was undistinguished: Republicans consistently underperformed in elections on her watch, including in 2022. The GOP enters the 2024 election cycle with its fundraising lagging behind the Democrats, and with chaos at the state level. McDaniel is not known for her strategic acumen or ideological fervor. She was chosen for the job for loyalty for Trump, and then discarded later when that loyalty proved insufficient.\n\nMcDaniel's credibility is also in question. As Welker pointed out, she spent years indulging Trump's claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and that January 6 insurrectionists were patriots. McDaniel's explanation was not reassuring: \"When you're the RNC chair, you kind of take one for the whole team, right? Now I get to be a little bit more myself, right? This is what I believe.\" In other words, Trust me, I was lying .\n\nAll of this makes it hard to take McDaniel's on-air political commentary all that seriously. Still, if she's getting NBC entrée into Republican circles where the mainstream press has struggled to penetrate, that could still be worthwhile.\n\nRead: What Trump supporters think when he mocks people with disabilities\n\nBut is she? There are three kinds of prominent Republicans: Those who are in Trump's good graces; those who have been cast out of Trump's good graces; and those who have always loathed Trump. The third group has no truck with McDaniel, whom they see as a sycophantic sellout. (They note that she dropped her maiden name, Romney, in deference to Trump's disdain for her uncle.) McDaniel herself is in the second group-she was available for the NBC gig because Trump demanded her removal as RNC chair, after all.\n\nThe Trump loyalists in the first group have no affection for McDaniel either. A top campaign official crowed to Politico 's Playbook about her getting caught in the crossfire. No one in Trump's current orbit will want to appear close to McDaniel for fear of being cast out themselves. If Trump wins the election, McDaniel won't be able to speak very effectively to his inner circle; and if he loses, she won't be a credible voice in a post-Trump era of Republican politics.\n\nThis leaves McDaniel without any constituency. Her hire offended NBC News journalists. No liberal viewers will like seeing her, and some MSNBC hosts have already ruled out booking her. Neither MAGA Republicans nor the establishment rump will accept her.\n\nThis is a devilish moment for news organizations. Outlets that seek to understand Trump and his movement-even those that are very critical-want to find voices that represent them. But finding people who are still connected to Trump and can also speak with intellectual honesty is exceedingly difficult, if not inherently impossible. The McDaniel fiasco shows NBC hasn't solved the puzzle yet."

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nUpdated at 8 p.m. ET on December 4, 2024.\n\nThis morning, I had an unsettling experience. I was invited onto MSNBC's Morning Joe to talk from a studio in Washington, D.C., about an article I'd written on Trump's approach to foreign policy. Before getting to the article, I was asked about the nomination of Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense-specifically about an NBC News report that his heavy drinking worried colleagues at Fox News and at the veterans organizations he'd headed. (A spokesman for the Trump transition told NBC, \"These disgusting allegations are completely unfounded and false, and anyone peddling these defamatory lies to score political cheap shots is sickening.\")\n\nI answered by reminding viewers of some history:\n\nIn 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated John Tower , senator from Texas, for secretary of defense. Tower was a very considerable person, a real defense intellectual, someone who deeply understood defense, unlike the current nominee. It emerged that Tower had a drinking problem, and when he was drinking too much he would make himself a nuisance or worse to women around him. And for that reason, his nomination collapsed in 1989. You don't want to think that our moral standards have declined so much that you can say: Let's take all the drinking, all the sex-pesting, subtract any knowledge of defense, subtract any leadership, and there is your next secretary of defense for the 21st century.\n\nI told this story in pungent terms. It's cable TV, after all. And I introduced the discussion with a joke: \"If you're too drunk for Fox News, you're very, very drunk indeed.\"\n\nAt the next ad break, a producer spoke into my ear. He objected to my comments about Fox and warned me not to repeat them. I said something noncommittal and got another round of warning. After the break, I was asked a follow-up question on a different topic, about President Joe Biden's pardon of his son. I did not revert to the earlier discussion, not because I had been warned, but because I had said my piece. I was then told that I was excused from the studio chair. Shortly afterward, co-host Mika Brzezinski read an apology for my remarks.\n\nA little bit earlier in this block there was a comment made about Fox News, in our coverage about Pete Hegseth and the growing number of allegations about his behavior over the years and possible addiction to alcohol or issues with alcohol. The comment was a little too flippant for this moment that we're in. We just want to make that comment as well. We want to make that clear. We have differences in coverage with Fox News, and that's a good debate that we should have often, but right now I just want to say there's a lot of good people who work at Fox News who care about Pete Hegseth, and we will want to leave it at that.\n\nShe's right, of course: There are good people at Fox News. But if NBC's reporting-based on interviews with 10 current or former Fox employees-about Hegseth's alcohol abuse is accurate, many of those same good people have failed to report publicly that their former colleague, appointed to lead the armed forces of the United States, was notorious in their own building for his drinking. That would be a startling and shameful shirking of responsibility on a matter of grave national importance. What's the appropriate language to call it out?\n\nI am a big admirer of the Morning Joe show and the commitment of all involved to bring well-informed political discussion to a national audience.\n\nI recognize, too, that the prominence of the program has exposed the hosts and producers to extraordinary pressures and threats in the Trump era. Trump has spoken again and again of his determination to retaliate against unfriendly media. Shortly before leaving office, Trump amplified a conspiracy theory that Brzezinski's co-host, Joe Scarborough, was a murderer. Kash Patel, Trump's nominee to head the FBI, has compiled an enemies list to target with investigations. Trump's candidate to chair the FCC has speculated about stripping licenses from platforms that displease the new incoming administration. Interference with mergers and acquisitions to punish critics was a feature of Trump's first administration. Now MSNBC may be spun off by Comcast, leaving the future of the liberal network very much in question. The hosts of Morning Joe visited Mar-a-Lago in November to mend fences with Trump. They genuinely have a lot to worry about.\n\nAs for my own comments: You can decide for yourself whether I overstepped the proper limits of television discussion. But I also note that if I did misstep, well, my face was on the screen, my name was on the chyron, and anyone who took offense knows whom to blame.\n\nIt is a very ominous thing if our leading forums for discussion of public affairs are already feeling the chill of intimidation and responding with efforts to appease.\n\nI write these words very aware that I'm probably saying goodbye forever to a television platform that I enjoy and from which I have benefited as both viewer and guest. I have been the recipient of personal kindnesses from the hosts that I have not forgotten.\n\nI do not write to scold anyone; I write because fear is infectious. Let it spread, and it will paralyze us all.\n\nThe only antidote is courage. And that's infectious, too.\n\nThis article originally misstated Comcast's plans for its news channels."

The U.S. Southern Command is reportedly drafting potential plans to increase U.S. military presence in Panama and partner more closely with Panamanian forces in an attempt to diminish China's influence and cut off its access to ports in the Panama Canal. The NBC News report is based on the accounts of two U.S. officials. Panamanian officials responded saying, \"our sovereignty over the Panama Canal is absolute and not the basis of any negotiation.\" The Panama Canal Authority is run entirely by the Panamanian government, not China, as Trump has falsely claimed.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump was asked about his threats to annex Greenland during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Trump's reply: \"I think it will happen.\" During their meeting, Rutte praised Trump and vowed to keep rallying NATO members to increase military spending."

We speak with Arkin, whose award-winning reporting has appeared in The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post. He is the author of many books, including \"Top Secret America: The Rise of the New American Security State.\"\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: \"Prisoners of Donald Trump.\" That's how longtime NBC reporter and analyst William Arkin described the mainstream media in a scathing letter last week announcing he would be leaving the network, accusing the media of warmongering while ignoring the, quote, \"creeping fascism of homeland security.\" Arkin issued the blistering critique after a 30-year relationship with NBC , calling for Trump-free media days and a reckoning about how the network encourages a state of perpetual warfare.\n\nIn the memo, he writes, quote, \"I find it disheartening that we do not report the failures of the generals and national security leaders. I find it shocking that we essentially condone continued American bumbling in the Middle East and now Africa through our ho-hum reporting.\"\n\nHe continues, quote, \"Of course [Trump] is an ignorant and incompetent impostor. And yet I'm alarmed at how quick NBC is to mechanically argue the contrary, to be in favor of policies that just spell more conflict and more war.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, for more, we're joined by William Arkin, longtime NBC reporter and analyst. His award-winning reporting has appeared in The New York Times , the Los Angeles Times , The Washington Post . He's the author of many books, including Top Secret America: The Rise of the New American Security State .\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now!\n\nWILLIAM ARKIN : Thanks, Amy, for having me on.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, you left NBC with this explosive memo, that not only indicts NBC , your network, says basically NBC , they might not like this, but doesn't stand out among the crowd of corporate networks in dealing with this issue of perpetual war.\n\nWILLIAM ARKIN : Everything I said in this letter, which was a goodbye letter to my colleagues at NBC , applies to all of the mainstream networks, applies to CNN and Fox, as well. So, I'm not really singling out NBC . I was just most familiar with it.\n\nAnd my decision not to renew my contract was really one of thinking to myself that I wanted to stand back and think more about what we needed to do in order to change our national security policy. We've been at war now for 18 years. I don't think anybody could argue that there's a country in the Middle East that's safer today than it was in 2001. The generals and the national security leadership that runs the country, and now also is the commentators and the analysts who populate the news media, really are not people who we can look to as saying, \"Wow! They won a war. They avoided a war. They achieved some magnificent objective.\" In fact, they are the custodians and the architects of perpetual warfare. And it seemed to me like there needed to be both a different voice and a solution. And I want to step back myself and think about how we can end this era of perpetual war and how we can build some real security, both in the United States and abroad.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I'm wondering, in terms of your concerns about the coverage of President Trump and of the Trump era and your concern about the fixation-and it really is an obsession, almost-of all of the networks with covering him on not just a daily, but an hourly, minute-by-minute basis.\n\nWILLIAM ARKIN : Well, let me just say, I'm here at Democracy Now! , and I shouldn't bite the hand that feeds me, but you started your broadcast today making fun of the president and his remarks last night about the border. It's almost impossible to avoid.\n\nDonald Trump runs a circus. Every day, he gets up, he unzips his pants, and we go, \"Oh, my god! What is he doing?\" And then the next day he repeats, and we repeat.\n\nSo, I think that, to some degree, he sucks the oxygen out of the debate. He changes the discourse. And we haven't figured out yet in the news media, every part of the news media, how to get beyond that. So, I'm not arguing only about the mainstream. I think everyone is stuck in the Donald Trump circus.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, I have to take issue with you saying \"making fun,\" because \"fun\" is the one word I wouldn't use. But, yes, we did focus on what he had to say. The more the networks broadcast directly what he has to say, this is the information that gets out to the American people, and it is so critical to take on each point. In that case, for example, that immigrants commit more crimes than natural-born Americans, which isn't true. And it's absolutely critical, each time those comments are made, to counter them.\n\nBut let's get to the issue of who populates the network TV shows, which is validating an issue you have criticized for so long and investigated for so long: the national security state.\n\nWILLIAM ARKIN : Well, you know, I've been associated with television for 30 years. I've been a journalist for about the same period of time, but it's not my background. My background was in Army intelligence, and then, thereafter, I wrote books about the military. And I was called upon to be a journalist because there was a desire on the part of the Los Angeles Times , The Washington Post and NBC to have experts helping people to understand an incredibly complex issue-national security.\n\nIn those days, when I started, we used to have civilian experts on the air, people who weren't former government officials, people who weren't retired generals, people who might be university professors or activists who worked in nongovernmental organizations or experts who were associated with think tanks. Something happened post-9/11, something happened in this intervening years, in which those people virtually disappeared from the airwaves, and we don't see as many anymore.\n\nAnd, in fact, we increasingly see journalists who are the commentators on what's going on. Now, that's a tricky position, because journalists are supposed to be unbiased, but also, at the same time, they're supposed to be explaining to the public what's going on with inside information.\n\nBut the end result of it is that we become shallower and shallower in our coverage, particularly in an area like national security. We've just become so shallow that we're not really able even to see the truth, which is that we're at war right now in nine countries around the world where we're bombing, and we hardly report any of it on a day-to-day basis.\n\nSo, to me, the crisis is that we condone perpetual war by virtue of our lack of reporting and investigation, and then, second, we fill the airwaves or we fill the newspapers with stories about the immediate and don't give an adequate amount of space to deeper investigations or what I would say would be net assessment investigations of what really is going on.\n\nI mean, whether we should or shouldn't withdraw troops from Syria, whether we should or shouldn't withdraw troops from Afghanistan, whether we should or we shouldn't improve our relations with Russia, whether we should or we shouldn't pursue denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula-all of these questions deserve a high degree of investigation and reporting, beyond the question of whether or not Donald Trump is a buffoon. And we just don't do it. We're just not doing it.\n\nAnd so, to me, I'm not necessarily interested in prescribing the why. I'm interested in changing the culture so that we can, in fact, better inform ourselves about national security, so that the citizenry can play a more powerful role in influencing our national security policy.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to expand on that. Back in the '70s, the old socialist economists Baran and Sweezy used to talk about the huge percentage of the American population that owed its livelihood directly to the defense industry. Right? And one of the things in your Top Secret America exposés is that the Cold War ended, and the threats, supposedly, in terms of state threats, receded to the United States, but yet, obviously, the military maintains its huge spread across the world. And more importantly, through homeland security, the militarization internally of the country, as you point out, has gotten to the point where people don't even know how extensive the homeland security apparatus is of this country and the number of people that have top-secret clearance.\n\nWILLIAM ARKIN : Yes.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: So, it seems to me that the number of people working for this apparatus has actually grown, despite the fact that the threats, the existential threats, to the United States have receded.\n\nWILLIAM ARKIN : Well, there's no question that the national security establishment has grown and has become far more powerful than it ever was. But here's the change. We've shifted from the Industrial Age to the Information Age. And consequently, we've also shifted from the dominance of the military-industrial complex, if you will, to a much more insidious and much more difficult-to-diagnose information complex. So, the advent of contractors, the advent of a professional military, which means that the military itself touches fewer and fewer lives in America, all of those work together to make the national security state more and more embedded within our society, but yet, at the same time, more difficult to get to, more difficult to understand.\n\nSo, most people would be surprised to learn, for instance, that Amazon is one of the largest defense contractors, that they're building the cloud and they're building the data centers which support the intelligence community and support the military. And there are other civilian companies, that we associate with being civilians, who are also terrific beneficiaries of the military's largesse.\n\nSo, to me, to diagnose properly where we stand today, the point of the Top Secret America investigation was to show the wild growth of all areas of national security and this new invention of homeland security, if you will, but at the same time to point out that it wasn't something that was necessarily segregated from our society, it was more and more embedded within our society, and that that made it more and more difficult to analyze properly and to do something about.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, you talked about the people who populate the networks as pundits, and you've been a fierce critic of the national security state, or at least understanding who it is who is explaining things to us. Reading from Politico , \"Former CIA Director John Brennan ... the latest superspook,\" they said, \"to be reborn as a TV newsie. He just cashed in at NBC News as a 'senior national security and intelligence analyst' and served his first expert views ... on Meet the Press . The Brennan acquisition seeks to elevate NBC to spook parity with CNN , which employs former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director Michael Hayden in a similar capacity. Other, lesser-known national security veterans thrive under TV's grow lights. Almost too numerous to list, they include Chuck Rosenberg, former acting DEA administrator, chief of staff for FBI Director James Comey, and counselor to former FBI Director Robert Mueller; Frank Figliuzzi, former chief of FBI counterintelligence; Juan Zarate, deputy national security adviser under Bush, at NBC ; and Fran Townsend, homeland security adviser under Bush.\" And it goes on and on and on.\n\nThese are now the pundits. And so, when you have a situation like President Trump announcing he will immediately withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and halve the troops that are in Afghanistan, you have this massive attack on him that's actually led by the permanent national security state under the guise of pundits on television.\n\nWILLIAM ARKIN : Well, I think that you've-I mean, what you said stands for itself, Amy. But I would add to it that I think the real crisis is that when we have a panel discussion on television, in the mainstream press, and even in the mainstream newspapers, we don't populate that panel with people who are in opposition. We have a single war party in the United States, and it's the only one that is given voice. And so, really, the crisis is not so much that there are experienced government officials speaking out; the problem is that there aren't critics who are sitting next to them saying that \"You're full of it.\" And so, to me, we need to balance that.\n\nAnd I think that probably because of the phenomenon of Donald Trump-let's just be honest about it-really what we see on TV now is former Obama administration officials masquerading as analysts who are nonpartisan, when in fact they are partisan. And indeed we see fewer retired generals and fewer retired admirals, who sometimes are useful in terms of explaining the profession of arms and the conduct of military operations, in favor of these political figures who have a partisan view.\n\nI just don't think the American public gets well served by the fact that there isn't a broad range of opinions on those panels. I want to see peaceniks. I want to see academics. I want to see historians. I want them to as much have a voice, in terms of understanding what's going on, as I do see a former Obama administration official.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have break, but we're going to come back to this conversation and talk, among other issues, about one of your statements-\"don't even get me started with the FBI : What? We now lionize this historically destructive institution?''-and much more. We're speaking to William Arkin, a longtime NBC reporter and analyst who just left the network, penning a letter critiquing the network for supporting perpetual warfare, his criticism, talking about the creeping fascism of homeland security.

Mohyeldin was kicking a soccer ball around with the boys just minutes before they died. He is a longtime reporter in the region. In his coverage, he reports on the Gaza conflict in the context of the Israeli occupation, sparking criticism from some supporters of the Israeli offensive. Back in 2008 and 2009, when he worked for Al Jazeera, Mohyeldin and his colleague Sherine Tadros were the only foreign journalists on the ground in Gaza as Israel killed 1,400 people in what it called \"Operation Cast Lead.\" We speak to Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept, who has revealed that the decision to pull Mohyeldin from Gaza and remove him from reporting on the situation came from NBC executive David Verdi. Greenwald also comments on the broader picture of the coverage of the Israel/Palestine conflict in the U.S. media.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: NBC is facing questions over its decision to pull its veteran news correspondent out of Gaza. Ayman Mohyeldin personally witnessed the Israeli military's killing of four Palestinian boys on a Gaza beach Wednesday. Mohyeldin was kicking a soccer ball around with the boys just minutes before they died. He's a veteran reporter who has placed the Gaza conflict in the context of the Israeli occupation, sparking criticism from some supporters of the Israeli offensive. Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept has revealed the decision to pull Mohyeldin from Gaza and remove him from reporting on the situation, it came from NBC executive David Verdi.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : NBC executives have reportedly claimed the decision was motivated by \"security concerns\" ahead of Israel's ground invasion, but late Wednesday NBC sent correspondent Richard Engel to Gaza. During the 2008-2009 war on Gaza, Ayman Mohyeldin, who then worked for Al Jazeera, was one of the only foreign journalists reporting from Gaza.\n\nNBC News did not respond to Democracy Now! 's repeated requests for comment on its decision.\n\nFor more, we're joined by  Glenn Greenwald, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. His piece for The Intercept at First Look Media is \" NBC News Pulls Veteran Reporter from Gaza After Witnessing Israeli Attack on Children.\"\n\nWe are also with Democracy Now! correspondent Sharif Abdel Kouddous, who knows Ayman well. Sharif is in Gaza City.\n\nGlenn, talk about what you found out yesterday.\n\nGLENN GREENWALD : Interestingly, Amy, the way that this came to my attention was that there are people inside NBC News, including some very recognizable and high-profile journalists, who were very angry that, first of all, when NBC News with Brian Williams reported on the killing of those four boys on the beach, instead of having their journalist who made this event known to the world and who witnessed it firsthand, Ayman, report on it, they instead had Richard Engel in Tel Aviv do the reporting, and Ayman never appeared at all on the Nightly News broadcast. But that, you can chalk up to sort of standard network news machinations about who's a bigger star and who's more senior and the like.\n\nBut what was really stunning was, later that day, after what arguably was his biggest or one of his biggest events in his journalism career, where he really made a huge impact on having the world understand what's happening in Gaza, they not only blocked him from appearing on the air to talk about it on NBC News, but then they told him to leave Gaza immediately. And when I interviewed NBC executives and the like, none of whom would talk to me on the record but who talked to me on background and the like, they claimed that the reason they told him to leave was because they had security concerns, not specific to him, but just general ones about whether journalists could be safe with the imminent Israeli ground invasion. And yet, as you just said, later that day, they sent into Gaza not only Richard Engel, but also a producer who works for NBC who had never been to Gaza, who doesn't speak Arabic, who doesn't know the area at all, in contrast to Ayman, who's been there for many years, who speaks fluent Arabic and who is a very experienced war reporter. And so it raises very serious questions about what the real reason is that they told him, over his objections, that he had to leave.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Glenn, there have been questions raised about not just whether NBC was concerned about his reporting, but also about his post on social media. Could you talk about that, as well?\n\nGLENN GREENWALD : What happened on the day that he witnessed the beach attacks was he posted some incredible tweets and, as well, some amazing photos and videos on both his Facebook and Instagram accounts about the reaction of the parents of the Palestinian boys learning right that moment that they had been killed-very, very powerful stuff. And he had also tweeted a couple of what I guess in the network news business is viewed as some unusually pointed tweets about the position of the U.S. government. Namely, the State Department spokeswoman was asked about this killing, and she essentially absolved Israel and blamed Hamas, what the U.S. government always does, even in the most egregious cases of Israeli war crimes. And he went onto Twitter and Facebook and posted some very mild comments essentially noting what the State Department had said and then inviting people to comment on it. And later that day, he deleted it. There's speculation that he was either asked to delete it or that that was a cause in why he was removed. I don't know whether that's the case at all, because there's still questions about what the real reason is.\n\nBut certainly, the whole context of what has happened here is that he is a very unique reporter, especially for a network news position. You know, the kind of reporting that-the amazing reporting that we just hear from Sharif usually is not the kind of reporting that you hear on the network news. And Ayman does that kind of reporting. And he's been criticized for it by neoconservative outlets, calling him a Hamas sympathizer and the like. And so, for NBC to remove him at exactly the moment where he brought the humanity of this war and the humanity of Gazans to the world, at the same time that he posted some tweets that in network news land would be considered controversial because it questions the U.S. government and the Israeli position, at the very least, looks awful, and I think, for NBC News's credibility, demands that they provide some answers about what really happened here.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Sharif Abdel Kouddous, I know that you're going to have to leave that area, and I want to ask you about the reporting, overall, of Ayman Mohyeldin, who is very well known around the world for his reporting. Among the tweets he put out, \"Moutaz Bakr, 1 of the boys who survived #Israeli shelling, was shaking w a broken [arm], blood shot eyes, says he saw 3 of his friends killed.\" He also tweeted, \"4 Palestinian kids killed in a single Israeli airstrike. Minutes before they were killed by our hotel, I was kicking a ball with them.\" But talk about the years of his reporting in Gaza. You also know him from Egypt.\n\nSHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS : Well, yeah, Amy, I'm honored to count Ayman as a close friend. He's truly an incredible reporter. And when we're talking about Gaza, literally, I don't think that there is a better reporter in the world who understands Gaza-an international correspondent, that is-who understands Gaza, who has covered Gaza as much. There literally isn't another reporter, international reporter, who has covered all three Israeli assaults on Gaza, the 2008-2009 assault, the 2012 assault and the assault that we're undergoing now. He's connected here. He understands the place. He understands the area. He's always the first guy at the story.\n\nAnd we saw his incredible reporting in these past few days. It was really noted, if you looked at media discussion sites and other columns noting how NBC was totally changing its coverage compared to the other U.S. networks, and this was Ayman's goal all along. You know, when he first left Al Jazeera after 2011 and moved to a mainstream U.S. network, this was what he had in mind, is to bring this kind of coverage that is never or very, very rarely seen on the corporate media in the States. And he was succeeding in doing that. And we don't know the reasons why he was taken out of Gaza. You're taking one of-the most experienced reporter in Gaza out of Gaza. Citing security reasons is just not very credible. So we don't know why they removed him, whether this was a fight about, you know, a bigger star and having Engel come in, or whether it was about that his coverage was really having a serious effect, showing the true side of this assault, the true side of this conflict, and that political considerations came into play.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You talk about that history, Sharif, 2008-'09, right after President Obama was elected. This was the period when the world was talking about the United States and the Israeli assault on Gaza began. Al Jazeera was the only network inside Gaza. And I wanted to go to a film that he and Sherine Tadros made, the documentary that's called The War Around Us , which shows Ayman Mohyeldin and Sherine Tadros reporting from Gaza during that 2008 Israeli war known as Operation Cast Lead, at the time, again, the only Western journalists in Gaza due to the media blockade. In this clip, Ayman reports from the al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.\n\nAYMAN MOHYELDIN : We're actually standing in the orthopedic section of the hospital, because it was made into a makeshift emergency intensive care unit. And I'm going to take you in here and have to warn you, though, that the pictures may be a bit disturbing, but these are some of the cases that are being treated. This woman right here, 55-year-old Fatma, a charity worker, she was working in a building that was adjacent to one of the buildings that was struck. But I have to again emphasize that the place we are standing is not an emergency care facility, nor is it an intensive care or special care unit. This is a makeshift room. All of these appliances that are being put to use here have been put really on an ad hoc base relatively quickly, as the cases were brought in.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to another clip from their documentary, The War Around Us . Here, Ayman Mohyeldin explains how one of the most difficult parts of reporting from Gaza during Operation Cast Lead was challenging Israeli propaganda.\n\nAYMAN MOHYELDIN : You had a propaganda machine that was in full swing to portray the war as a just war, as a necessary war, a war of self-defense. And when you have a PR machine that is portraying everyone in Gaza as a Hamas sympathizer, as a terrorist sympathizer, and that justifies the kind of bombardment, that was the biggest challenge that we had to contend with-reporting the truth in the face of that spin.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was an excerpt of The War Around Us . Again, Ayman Mohyeldin and Sherine Tadros, the only international reporters broadcasting during what the Israeli military called Operation Cast Lead. Over 1,400 Palestinians were killed in that assault.\n\nGlenn Greenwald, if you can talk more broadly now about the U.S. media coverage of what is taking place right now? For that, I wanted to go to a clip for one minute of Diane Sawyer. This is a clip of Diane Sawyer reporting just a few days ago. Diane Sawyer, of course, the news anchor on ABC . Last week, she misidentified scenes of the aftermath of the Israeli missile strikes in Gaza as destruction caused by Palestinian rocket fire.\n\nDIANE SAWYER : We take you overseas now to the rockets raining down on Israel today, as Israel tried to shoot them out of the sky, all part of the tinderbox, Israelis and Palestinians. And here an Israeli family trying to salvage what they can, one woman standing speechless among the ruins.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For our radio listeners, as Diane Sawyer was speaking, there was video footage of a Palestinian family gathering belongings in the smoking debris after an Israeli missile hit their home. Well, on Thursday, Sawyer apologized for misidentifying the victims of that attack.\n\nDIANE SAWYER : On Tuesday evening, we made a mistake, and I want to put up these pictures again, because during an introduction to a story on the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, I misidentified these powerful images. The people in these photos are Palestinians in Gaza in the aftermath of an airstrike by Israel-not Israelis, as I mistakenly described them. And we want you to know we are truly sorry for the error.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Diane Sawyer's apology a week ago. Glenn Greenwald, can you comment?\n\nGLENN GREENWALD : Interestingly, you know, from working in the last several years in media, I've gotten to know a lot of journalists. I've gotten to understand a lot more about how these large media outlets function. I've worked with some of them over the last year in the reporting I've done. And it really is remarkable, and not hyperbole, that there is nothing that makes major media figures and news executives more petrified than reporting on Israel. I mean, the way in which they become so frightened to do any sort of reporting that could make what they call Israel's supporters inside the United States angry really can't be overstated.\n\nAnd that's the reason why this ABC , quote-unquote, \"error\" resonated so greatly, is because one of the things that you almost never see in major American media reporting is anything that shows the suffering of the Palestinians, that shows the brutal savagery of the Israeli military inside of Gaza. It was almost like they showed it by accident there and then just misreported it as being Israeli suffering because that's what they're so accustomed to showing, even though Israeli suffering is so much less than the havoc that is wreaked on the Palestinians.\n\nBut the one thing I will say that I think is actually encouraging is this is one case where social media really does make a difference. You have now Gazans inside of the worst attack zones that are able to go onto Twitter, that are able to go onto Facebook, that are able to upload video imagery, that are able to be heard in their own voices. And you have lots of pushback on social media, as well, toward media outlets and their unbelievably just grotesque pro-Israel bias, in a way that I think has really kind of improved the coverage this time, so that we are now seeing more of the reality of Israeli militarism and aggression. And they're not being able to get away with calling every victim a Hamas terrorist or a Hamas supporter or a human shield, because social media enables the stark reality of what the Israelis are doing to be seen. It's just part of the overall trend where major media outlets are losing their monopoly on how we understand the world, but it is still the case that nothing puts fear into the heart of American journalists-and American politicians-like the word \"Israel.\" It's really remarkable to watch.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Glenn, in terms of this issue of the pressure on these media companies and also the ability of the Israeli government and their supporters to manage news coverage-for instance, the invasion was actually-the stage was set for it when an unnamed, high-ranking Israeli official conducted interviews with The Washington Post , The New York Times , all of whom wrote stories before the invasion began that it was likely to happen, but yet never named the official and, in essence, participated in the trial balloon that was set up for the invasion.\n\nGLENN GREENWALD : American media officials are incredibly subservient to American political officials. That's been-you know, American media figures are. But when it comes to Israeli political officials, it's virtually cringe-inducing to watch how accommodating and deferential and submissive they become. And it really is true that American media outlets play a very similar role when it comes to Israeli military operations as they played in the run-up to the Iraq War, which is that they give constant anonymity to any Israeli military or political official who request it, they launder those claims without the slightest bit of skepticism expressed, and there's never or virtually never the other side presented, which is the views of the people living in those areas that are attacked by Israeli aggression, or the politicians or the military officials who are in Gaza or who are in the West Bank. It's incredibly one-sided, it's propagandistic, and it really is deliberate. I mean, it's so overwhelming and extreme in terms of how one-sided they are. They barely pretend even to be even-handed in their coverage.\n\nAnd, you know, you've seen-I mean, I think one of the most amazing things was, the producer, the longtime producer at CNN , Octavia Nasr, she was there for 20 years, a completely competent, well-liked employee, never had any kind of disciplinary problems. A Shia imam in Lebanon, who had links to Hezbollah, died. He was beloved by millions and millions of Shia around the world. She went on Twitter and very innocuously just expressed condolences, and she was instantly fired.\n\nAnd this has happened over and over, where major media figures have been stigmatized or lost their jobs or had their careers destroyed for the slightest amount of deviation from pro-Israel orthodoxies. And those lessons have been really well learned, just in the same way that American members of Congress are petrified of uttering a peep of criticism of Israel, which is why you see pro-Israel resolutions unanimously passing in the U.S. Congress, even as public opinion is sharply divided around the world or even against the Israelis. I mean, the evidence is just so conclusive, so clear, about all kinds of pressure and intimidation that are put on American media and political figures, such that we have less of an ability in the United States to debate Israel policy than they even do in Israel.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Glenn Greenwald, I want to thank you for being with us, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist. His piece for The Intercept is \" NBC News Pulls Veteran Reporter from Gaza After Witnessing Israeli Attack on Children.\" We'll link to that. His new book is No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA , and the U.S. Surveillance State . When we come back, a Malaysian flight goes down over Ukraine. Who did it? We'll speak with Russian affairs expert Stephen Cohen. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "Donald Trump Snaps At NBC Reporter, Dodges Question With Tactic He's Using More And More\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday once again deployed what's fast becoming one of his go-to responses when faced with uncomfortable questions from the media: \" Who are you with? \"\n\nAs Trump talked to reporters about what he claimed will be the imminent release of 80,000 unredacted files related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy , he was asked about his recent criticism of predecessor President Joe Biden 's reported use of an autopen during his presidency, despite having used one himself.\n\n\"You have criticized President Biden for using autopen in the last few days. Have you yourself ever used autopen, sir?\" the reporter asked.\n\n\"Yeah, only for very unimportant papers,\" Trump responded, before immediately contradicting himself. \"And I don't call them unimportant. When you do letters and people write in, they'd love to have a response. I'll sign them whenever I can, but when I can't, I use an autopen. But to use them for what they've used them for is terrible.\"\n\nAs the journalist attempted to follow up, Trump cut in and asked: \"Who are you with?\"\n\n\"NBC News,\" the reporter replied.\n\n\"I don't want to talk to NBC anymore. I think you're so discredited,\" Trump shot back before waving off the question and moving on.\n\nWatch here:\n\nTrump has claimed without evidence that a mechanical autopen device was used to sign papers on Biden's behalf but without his knowledge, playing into the right-wing narrative of Biden's inexorable cognitive decline.\n\nIn a middle-of-the-night social media meltdown Sunday, Trump used the autopen report to justify nulling pardons issued by Biden , although the legality of such a declaration has been called into question.\n\nTrump has in recent weeks repeatedly sidestepped tough questions by asking ― \"Who are you with?\" ― and then discrediting the reporters or their outlets instead of answering their queries, as part of his ongoing war on media who cover him critically.\n\nTrump used the tactic to dodge a question from HuffPost's S.V. Dáte in February. When told HuffPost, he fired back: \"Oh, no wonder. I thought they, I thought they died. Are they still around? I haven't read them in years. I thought they died.\" (HuffPost is not dead .)\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Chuck Todd Leaving NBC News After Nearly 20 Years\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nLongtime NBC News host Chuck Todd announced Friday that he's leaving the network, indicating he plans to shift away from national media.\n\nTodd shared the news in a memo to staff and on his podcast, \"The Chuck ToddCast,\" saying that Friday would be his last day at NBC News after nearly two decades as a fixture of the network's political coverage.\n\n\"I am leaving a bit earlier, frankly, than we had all originally planned, but there's a reason for it. I'm pretty excited by a few new projects that are on the cusp of going from pie in the sky to near reality,\" said Todd, who slammed his employer on-air last year for hiring former Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel. The network axed McDaniel a week later.\n\nTodd said he will retain his news podcast, but it will be going on a \"little hiatus\" while he looks for a new network to host the show.\n\nOn Friday's episode, he hinted his next career move will involve a shift away from national media.\n\n\"The reason I am ready to move is I think the media has a lot of work to do to win back the trust, and I think, frankly, national media isn't the place that's going to be able to do it,\" he said. \"And this is no indictment of national media as the problem ― I'm a believer that national media is never always that trusted by people. The farther away something is, the more skeptical we are of it.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I do leave feeling a bit concerned about the moment of history that we're living in, but I'm pretty confident that we all sort of understand the challenge ahead of us, including my colleagues at NBC.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "NBC News Tells Staffers Not To Call Steve King's Racist Remarks Racist (UPDATE: NBC Changes Guidance)\n\nFreelance Reporter\n\nUPDATE: 2:15 p.m. ― Shortly after this story was initially published Tuesday, NBC News advised its staffers it was, in fact, fair to describe Rep. Steve King's remarks on white supremacy as \"racist.\"\n\n\"We revised our guidance on Rep. Steve King's comments,\" reads an email from NBC News' standards department that was shared with HuffPost . \"It is fair to characterize King's comments as 'racist,' and point out that he has a history of racist comments, and the context can be shared that others hold that view as well.\"\n\nPREVIOUSLY:\n\nNBC News' standards department sent an email to staffers Tuesday telling them not to directly refer to Rep. Steve King 's recent comments about white supremacy as \"racist.\"\n\n\"Be careful to avoid characterizing [King's] remarks as racist,\" reads the email, which two NBC News staffers shared with HuffPost. \"It is ok to attribute to others as in 'what many are calling racist' or something like that.\"\n\nThe email was sent to staffers by Susan Sullivan, a senior employee in the standards division at NBC News. In a news organization, the standards department offers guidance and issues rules about what is legally and ethically appropriate to report, and about how certain topics should be covered.\n\nNBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article.\n\nKing, an Iowa Republican, has a long history of making racist remarks. The latest controversy came about following the Jan. 10 publication of an interview with The New York Times , where he said: \"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?\"\n\nIn a statement later that day , King said: \"Today, the New York Times is suggesting that I am an advocate for white nationalism and white supremacy. I want to make one thing abundantly clear; I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define. Further, I condemn anyone that supports this evil and bigoted ideology which saw in its ultimate expression the systematic murder of 6 million innocent Jewish lives.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Several of King's fellow conservative politicians have done so as well, including Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who said in a tweet : \" I condemn Rep. Steve King's comments on white supremacy; they are offensive and racist.\"\n\nOn Monday, in a rebuke for his racist comments, House Republican leaders stripped King of all of his committee assignments .\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "NBC Reporter Finds Childhood Home Destroyed By LA Wildfires\n\nNBC News reporter Jacob Soboroff didn't know what to expect when he turned his SUV onto the Pacific Palisades street where he grew up.\n\nWhat he found on Wednesday were smoldering ruins where his childhood home had stood. Only the remnants of a chimney and brick wall remained. It was among the countless number of buildings destroyed in the Los Angeles-area wildfires , where Soboroff is one of many journalists covering the story - and living it.\n\nHis own tale, told across several NBC News platforms Wednesday and Thursday, broke the so-called \"fourth wall\" and gave viewers an intimate experience of what the tragedy felt like.\n\n\"I'm not going to pretend that I'm not a human without my own thoughts and feelings,\" Soboroff said in an interview on Thursday. \"It would almost be a disservice to hide the emotions about what I've seen.\"\n\nAt first, the camera caught him staring blankly and trying to process. \"This is the first time I've seen the house I grew up in and I really don't know what to say,\" he told viewers. Getting out of the vehicle, he pulled out his phone to FaceTime his mother about what had become of the house that he and four siblings lived in until he was 10.\n\nEven if it came as a surprise to Soboroff, it probably wasn't to viewers as they had watched him drive through the community, devastation all around him.\n\n\"What I've seen here is what I would have expected from an earthquake,\" he said in the interview. \"This is what the Big One would have looked like. Not a fire. We've had fires before.\"\n\nSoboroff, 41, lives now in a house near Dodger Stadium with his wife and two children. Everyone is safe, and the house is untouched, he said.\n\nSome journalists weren't so lucky. Ryan Pearson, an entertainment video manager at The Associated Press, covered the fire all day Wednesday before finding that his home in Altadena had burned to the ground. Fire spared the home of Fox News ' Jonathan Hunt in West L.A., but his daughter's high school was destroyed. Other reporters, like KCAL's Rick Montanez, broke down on the air while describing some of what they were seeing.\n\nSoboroff has alternated reporting with personal missions this week. Since telling the story of his childhood home, several people reached out to ask him to check on their own homes, and he's tried to fulfill requests when he can. He went to see if a plaque honoring his father for helping build a local park was still visible. It was.\n\nHe doesn't know who was living now in the home where he grew up, but is trying to find out and reach them.\n\n\"For me it was my memories,\" he said. \"But for them, it was the house they lived in.\"\n\n___\n\nDavid Bauder writes about media for the AP.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nNBC's Brian Williams didn't just exaggerate one anecdote: He serially lied about nearly a dozen events he had covered, and continued to rake in millions after it. He was everything wrong with corporate news.\n\nBrian Williams on NBC Nightly News in 2007. (John C. Chu / Flickr)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nBrian Williams's just-announced resignation from NBC doesn't really matter. Other than depriving MSNBC of a familiar, marketable face at a time of plummeting ratings, and when a number of its major stars have one foot out the door , it's not going to change anything about the network. Nor is it going to change anything about the poisonous, profit-driven dynamics of cable news, easily the most powerful disseminators of misinformation in today's politics, something Williams participated in with relish .\n\nBut it's worth dwelling on, because Williams embodies one of the more noxious and pervasive trends in not just US news media, but American life more generally: the normalization of serious ethical breaches and the lack of any serious accountability for people with wealth, power, or influence.\n\nAs you'll read and hear today in many stories covering Williams's resignation, he was suspended and demoted by NBC in 2015 for \" exaggerating an anecdote about a helicopter ride in Iraq\" or telling \"an inaccurate story about his helicopter's having been hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.\" This is technically true, but the facts of the scandal here are presented so misleadingly that it rivals Williams's own infamous bullshittery.\n\nFor one, Williams didn't just tell a story inaccurately one time , as this phrasing suggests. Williams told the story at least half a dozen times over the years, embellishing its details with each retelling, until he eventually started claiming it was his helicopter that had been fired on, not a different helicopter an hour ahead of his, as was the reality.\n\nSecondly, it wasn't just this one story. When outraged military veterans pointed out that Williams was lying about the incident, a months-long NBC investigation soon uncovered at least eleven other similar self-aggrandizing lies Williams had told about other incidents - which they didn't release publicly, but compiled in a \"lengthy file and video,\" the Washington Post reported at the time. Reporters dug up examples independently anyway: that he was at the Berlin Wall when it fell; that he witnessed a man kill himself in the Superdome during Hurricane Katrina; that an Israeli helicopter he was riding in came under Hezbollah rocket fire ; and more.\n\nThough Williams took himself off his anchor's chair voluntarily, he didn't fully take responsibility. In a statement on the Iraq helicopter episode, he insisted that he had \"told the story correctly for years before [he] told it incorrectly,\" that he \"was not trying to mislead people,\" and that \"it came from a sloppy choice of words.\"\n\nMore importantly, NBC chose to respond to one of their most trusted, well-known anchors publicly discrediting himself with a nonpunishment for the ages. Williams was first suspended without pay from the NBC Nightly News anchor's desk for six months - unpleasant, but less harsh when you remember Williams was making in the ballpark of $15 million a year at that point.\n\nThough he never made it back to the high-rating, prime-time spot, new NBC News chair Andrew Lack decided he would save his friend's career by plopping Williams at MSNBC, a place where, presumably, truth and credibility don't matter. Lack declared Williams's recent scandal was \"ancient history,\" and before long Williams was making between $8 and $10 million a year, a number that's reportedly dropped to somewhere around $6 million in recent years. At a time when the median pay for journalists was less than $40,000, Williams's punishment for publicly lying was to be paid as a multimillionaire.\n\nThe entire episode, instantly forgiven and entirely forgotten within a few years, arguably started one of the more deplorable and damaging trends that's taken hold of US media in the Donald Trump era. It was only in 2004 that decades-long CBS anchor Dan Rather and four others lost their jobs thanks largely to their inability to prove the authenticity of documents they had used in a story charging George W. Bush had secured a spot in the National Guard through political connections before going AWOL for a year. Eleven years after this controversy, outright lying couldn't even get Williams booted from his network.\n\nSince then, with much of legacy media sorting itself into partisan factions serving only one slice of the news-consuming public, the Williams playbook is now the norm. Actually, that's not really true - while Williams's scandal was a major controversy that saw him at least nominally get punished, such scandals now crest and break rapidly, quickly receding from memory, with no consequences whatsoever.\n\nWhen MSNBC anchor Joy Reid's decade-old homophobic blog posts were unearthed in 2018, Reid, instead of owning up to and apologizing for them, as she already had in a separate but identical incident a year earlier, concocted an absurd lie that hackers had painstakingly hacked and altered the Wayback Machine's archives to quietly make her look more bigoted, presumably in case anyone happened to one day look up her since-deleted blog on the site and find them. Not only did she suffer no consequences, but within two years she was promoted .\n\nNothing, too, has happened to CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, despite the raft of ethical lines he crossed when it came to his brother, Andrew, the former governor of New York. First, Chris Cuomo, with the full blessing of his network, performed in a series of faux-adversarial, comedic interviews with his brother over the course of the pandemic, softening the ruthless and authoritarian politician's image while distracting from the mounting corruption and mismanagement scandals bubbling up around his office. Later, the New York attorney general's investigation into his brother's sexual harassment revealed Cuomo had been secretly working with the governor's strategy team on how to respond to the allegations. More recently, Cuomo himself has been accused of sexual harassment .\n\nCNN has stood by Cuomo, refusing to discipline him (though clearly, the people have spoken, because Cuomo's ratings have hit an all-time low ).\n\nOf course, this freedom from accountability for their talking heads isn't evenly applied by the networks, and if you look closely, you can start to see a pattern. Marc Lamont Hill was fired from CNN three years ago over a United Nations speech he'd delivered calling for Palestinian freedom. Rather alleged in a lawsuit that the chairman of Viacom, CBS's parent company, had said a Bush victory would help the company and that it was \"important to Viacom to have good relations with the Oval Office.\" \"Under corporate ownership, when finances are threatened, the media behaved like Exxon or BP or any other big company,\" Rather's former producer said , reflecting on her firing years later.\n\nFigures like Phil Donahue , Jesse Ventura , and Ashleigh Banfield were all removed by CNN or MSNBC for their criticism of Bush's wars, while MSNBC later purged left-leaning hosts Cenk Uygur and Ed Schultz. Uygur says he was told by the network's president to book more Republicans and that \"we're the establishment,\" while Schultz charged he was fired shortly after the network killed his planned broadcast of Bernie Sanders's announcement speech. Meanwhile, think of the countless other, less famous journalists who have been outright fired for far less than what Williams did - the reporters who have lost jobs because of old offensive tweets or past support for Palestinian rights.\n\nThe rules seem clear: Lie publicly or cross major journalistic ethical lines, and as long as you're a well-connected, big-time anchor, you'll keep making millions. Just don't dare take a position outside of these networks' narrow ideological boundaries or do anything that might jeopardize their profits - that would be truly unacceptable.\n\nBrian Williams ushered in our new era of media unaccountability. But of course, this neither begins nor ends with him, nor with the US press. In a world where Bush administration war criminals are rehabilitated as elder statesmen, lawbreakers in the national security state are turned into heroic defenders of justice, and the superrich openly indulge in crimes that they're barely punished for, Williams was just one minor reminder that those in the upper tiers of American life live by a different set of rules than the rest of us.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nMore than a dozen legal groups bankrolled by tens of millions in dark money tied to a conservative judicial mastermind are urging the Supreme Court to kneecap federal agencies' ability to protect consumers and impose vital fees on companies. If the groups are successful, the ruling on a little-known regulation could further constrain federal agencies' power and give corporations free rein to pollute the environment and swindle the average consumer.\n\nOn Wednesday, the justices heard arguments on Federal Communications Commission v. Consumers' Research , which could decide whether federal agencies are still allowed to undertake certain essential government tasks, such as rulemaking and imposing necessary fees on companies and consumers. The defendant in the case, Consumers' Research , and thirteen conservative groups supporting its efforts are all in part bankrolled by a nonprofit connected to Leonard Leo, President Donald Trump's former judicial adviser, who played a key role in constructing the Supreme Court's conservative majority and maintains close ties to two of the justices.\n\nLeo's ultimate goal includes plans to \" crush liberal dominance \" and help establish more conservative values and judges in the federal judiciary. His connections to Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito has prompted ethics watchdog group Accountable.US to call for their recusal from the case.\n\n\"The American people's faith in our justice system and the legitimacy of the Supreme Court depends on justices acting with integrity and abiding by their ethical obligations,\" Accountable.US wrote in a letter to Chief Justice John Roberts. \"Justices Thomas and Alito's numerous conflicts of interest require them to recuse themselves in Federal Communications Commission v. Consumers' Research .\"\n\nConsumers' Research is a nonprofit now dedicated to advancing conservative causes such as dismantling environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing and initiatives for corporations. The nonprofit was originally established as a consumer protection group in 1929 but had become largely dormant until receiving a \" surge in secret funds \" in 2013. The group has opposed air bags in cars and climate change science, plus has helped levy attacks against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to True North Research , a progressive research firm.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2023, Consumers' Research received more than $22 million in funding from Donors Trust, a donor-advised fund affiliated with Leo that's been described as a \" dark money ATM .\" Leo's direct ties to Donors Trust are hard to discern due to secrecy surrounding the group's funding, but in 2022, Leo's 85 Fund gave $92 million to Donors Trust, accounting for roughly 30 percent of its total funding. The next year, the 85 Fund again gave more than $92 million to Donors Trust, more than half of that year's funding.\n\nThat same year, Donors Trust gave more than $25 million to thirteen conservative legal groups that have filed amicus briefs with the high court urging them to side with Consumers' Research in the pending case and gut federal agencies' ability to issue rules and fees, according to the most recent tax documents on record.\n\nThe surge of dark money-funded amicus briefs in the Consumers' Research case comes amid a push by Democratic lawmakers and a panel of federal judges to require disclosure of the funding sources behind such amicus briefs. Some of the most prolific dark money groups, many of which are affiliated with Leo, are urging the panel to kill the rule.\n\nCritics say the surge of shadowy amicus briefs in the Consumers' Research case shows why such transparency is necessary.\n\n\"A Leonard Leo-tied amicus flotilla of this size should set off immediate alarm bells,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said in a statement to the Lever . \"Phony industry front groups are trying to use cases like Federal Communications Commission v. Consumers' Research to turbocharge President Trump and Elon Musk's dismantling of the protections that keep Americans safe from corporate cheaters and polluters.\"\n\nThe Consumers' Research case revolves around the Universal Service Fund , a fee imposed on telecommunication companies by a not-for-profit private company created by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which uses the funds to help subsidize infrastructure in rural communities. Consumers' Research filed a series of similar lawsuits in the Fifth, Sixth, Eleventh, and the DC Circuit Courts challenging the constitutionality of the fund.\n\nConsumers' Research is arguing that it is unconstitutional for Congress to delegate fee structures and collections to a federal agency. The conservative nonprofit previously lost federal court cases in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits on the matter.\n\nIn June, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Consumers' Research, stating that the fund is a \"misbegotten tax\" that violates the Constitution because the FCC is determining fee amounts, collection, and disbursements, when Congress should be the entity in charge of these standards.\n\nThe FCC is suing to overturn the Fifth Circuit decision that ruled the infrastructure service fund is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit ruling was supported by fifteen Republican state attorneys general in an amicus brief filed with the high court. West Virginia's attorney general, the lead filer of the brief, stated that the Universal Service Fund was \"yet another example of a problematic agency undertaking,\" and that Congress should be the entity to delegate the funds, \"not a private band of unaccountable industry participants.\"\n\nFrom 2022 to 2024, the Universal Service Fund provided West Virginia with more than $44 million for broadband internet connection service purposes for 766 schools and 168 libraries, benefiting more than 272,000 students, according to FCC data . West Virginia also received more than $15 million to fund broadband projects for health care providers and more than $55 million to provide high-speed internet services to West Virginia's most rural communities.\n\nAt the heart of the Consumers' Research case is the \" nondelegation doctrine ,\" a conservative legal theory that advocates for strict limitations on Congress' ability to hand off governing functions to federal agencies. The Supreme Court has used this theory twice in the 1930s to rein in sweeping powers handed to the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression.\n\nBut since those two rulings, and even before them, the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress has the ability to hand off certain regulatory actions to federal agencies as long as there is a \"legal framework to constrain the authority of the delegee, such as an administrative agency,\" according to an analysis by congressional researchers.\n\n\"Reviving the doctrine would cripple agencies' ability to govern consumer safeguards, social security, Medicare, and more during a time when the Trump administration has begun to slash federal agencies,\" Accountable.US wrote in a memo detailing the case.\n\nCritics say the Consumers' Research case is the next step in the corporate-conservative movement to gut federal agencies and oversight. Last year, the Supreme Court issued two rulings that dramatically curtailed federal agencies' ability to issue regulations.\n\nIn Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo , the Supreme Court overturned the \"Chevron doctrine,\" a previous high court ruling that required federal courts to defer to federal agencies' interpretations of vague statutes and laws. The ruling gutted environmental protections . Then, in Corner Post v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , the Supreme Court ruling extended the time frame in which parties can challenge a federal rule or regulation.\n\nPublic Citizen, a consumer rights group, also filed a brief with the Supreme Court for the Consumers' Research case, urging the justices to protect Congress's ability to delegate certain tasks to federal agencies, stating that if the high court rules in favor of Consumers' Research, the consequences could be \"extreme.\"\n\n\"Countless statutory schemes confer broad authority on the executive - for example, authority to set natural-gas prices, to regulate product safety, and to calculate appropriate fees for all manner of government services,\" the group wrote . \"A holding that the [Universal Service Fund] scheme violates constitutional separation-of-powers principles would break with long-standing precedent and, in the process, open innumerable statutory enactments to novel constitutional attacks.\"\n\nAmicus briefs, Latin for \"friends of the court,\" have been around for millennia, allegedly dating back to the Roman Empire, and are used to advocate for certain legal theories or on behalf of the parties involved in cases before a judge.\n\nIn recent years, powerful interest groups have used amicus briefs, sometimes funded by untraceable dark money donations, to surreptitiously lobby the courts to rule in their interest. Since 2010, the number of amicus briefs filed with the high court has skyrocketed , with groups filing briefs in 96 percent of Supreme Court cases. In 2023, justices cited these briefs nearly 150 times in their opinions.\n\nThirteen of the conservative groups that filed amicus briefs in the Consumers' Research case - Americans for Prosperity Foundation, Foundation for Government Accountability, Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute, the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, America First Legal Foundation, Southeastern Legal Foundation, Buckeye Institute, the Pacific Legal Foundation, the Reason Foundation, the New Civil Liberties Alliance, the Advancing American Freedom Foundation, and the Mackinac Center for Public Policy - have received funding from Donors Trust, the nonprofit with deep financial connections to Leo. These groups' briefs urge the high court to side with Consumers' Research and gut federal agencies' ability to issue rules and fees.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity , the Foundation for Government Accountability , and the Competitive Enterprise Institute all received Leo-connected funding . These groups are also funded by the Koch Network , a sprawling assortment of think tanks and legal groups founded and/or funded by petrochemical billionaires Charles and David Koch.\n\nIn their amicus briefs pushing the high court to side with Consumers' Research, the three groups urge the justices to rein in the executive branch's ability to issue rules and regulations and prevent Congress from outsourcing its tax-writing power to the executive branch.\n\nLimiting the executive branch and federal agencies' power \"is deeply rooted in our history and tradition and enshrined in the Constitution to guard against tyranny and government oppression,\" Americans for Prosperity wrote in its amicus brief .\n\nDonors Trust gave $85,180 to Americans for Prosperity in 2023. That same year, the trust gave more than $2.5 million to the Foundation for Government Accountability and more than $2.7 million to the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\nThe Cato Institute and the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research filed a joint brief on the case with arguments similar to Americans for Prosperity, claiming that \"Congress has attempted to outsource some of its most important Article I powers: the powers to tax and spend,\" by allowing federal agencies to direct fee collection.\n\nDonors Trust gave more than $4.3 million to the Cato Institute and more than $108,000 to the Manhattan Institute in 2023.\n\nAdditionally, Donors Trust gave more than $5.2 million to the Reason Foundation, $3.1 million to the America First Legal Foundation, $2.9 million to the Pacific Legal Foundation, $2.1 million to the Mackinac Center, $1.2 million to the New Civil Liberties Alliance, $250,000 to the Southeastern Legal Foundation, $142,500 to the Advancing American Freedom Foundation, and $50,000 to the Buckeye Institute.\n\nThe Pacific Legal Foundation has been a key player in the legal fight to overturn campaign finance limits and promote corporate interests at the Supreme Court. In its amicus brief for the Consumers' Research case, the foundation urged the high court to \"just to say that the Constitution requires Congress (not the Commission, or anyone else) to decide the amount of any tax,\" or fee collection.\n\n\"Congress has no power to delegate significant discretionary power to the executive branch at all,\" the foundation wrote. \"At bottom, Congress alone must decide the amount to be exacted from private purses. When Congress tries to subdelegate that power away to the executive branch through nebulous standards, it has violated the Constitution's separation of powers.\"\n\nLeo has a history of directing dark money funds to legal groups in order to fund the production of amicus briefs. In 2014, Leo directed a representative from the conservative nonprofit Bradley Foundation to the Judicial Education Project - a dark money nonprofit founded by Leo that eventually changed its name to the 85 Fund - to finance amicus briefs. The Bradley Foundation paid $150,000 to the project for its work on two amicus briefs, according to a 2021 letter from Sen. Whitehouse and Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA).\n\nLeo is also connected to other deregulatory cases previously considered by the Supreme Court. Nonprofits connected to Leo lobbied the court against consumer protection laws and environmental regulations .\n\nThe dark money funding of amicus briefs currently in front of the Supreme Court comes as Democratic lawmakers and a panel of federal judges are working on a rule requiring public disclosure of the funding sources behind amicus briefs filed in the lower courts. The Supreme Court often enacts similar rules for its own proceedings.\n\n\"Leonard Leo's dark money network is once again stacking the deck, pouring millions into a case that could gut federal oversight,\" said Accountable.US president Caroline Ciccone in a statement to the Lever . \"This isn't a coincidence - it's part of a well-worn strategy to strip agencies of their power to protect consumers and workers.\"\n\nLeo also has deep connections to two Supreme Court justices currently hearing the case. He has known Thomas since the early 1990s , when Leo served as a law clerk for a Washington, DC, appeals court judge. Thomas is the godfather to one of Leo's children and his wife, Virginia, served as president of a nonprofit that employed Leo as a director in 2010.\n\nLeo also traveled with Alito, and the Federalist Society, an influential conservative nonprofit that Leo cochairs, has funded numerous vacations for the justice. Additionally, in his role at the Federalist Society, Leo played a crucial role in confirming all six current conservative justices by helping to select them and advocating on their behalf.\n\nThe justices' ties to Leo are a reason why the Supreme Court needs an enforceable code of conduct, including requirements that compromised justices recuse themselves, said Ciccone with Accountable.US.\n\n\"The Supreme Court simply cannot be trusted to defend the Constitution if it doesn't adopt an obligatory, enforceable code of conduct that cleans up the impropriety that's existed on the court for years,\" Ciccone said in a statement . \"Thomas and Alito must recuse themselves and restore a semblance of integrity to the highest court.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nFreddy Brewster is a freelance reporter and has been published in the Los Angeles Times , NBC News, CalMatters, the Lost Coast Outpost , and other outlets across California.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Some of the most powerful corporate and conservative forces in DC are trying to keep that information secret.\n\nThe US Supreme Court is seen in Washington, DC, March 2, 2025. (Tierney L. Cross / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nDoes the public have a right to know who exactly is paying to lobby judges to deliver favorable rulings? A committee in charge of federal judiciary rules recently said yes, but some of the most powerful corporate and conservative forces in Washington are now saying hell no - and trying to keep the information secret.\n\nAt issue are amicus briefs, expert legal filings designed to sway judges considering cases. Over the past several decades, business interests have built a lucrative industry in which they pay shadowy advocacy groups to author the briefs on their behalf, leaving the public and judges unable to know who sponsored the filings.\n\nThe panel of federal judges overseeing judicial branch procedures recently issued a new rule requiring the filers of these amicus briefs to disclose most of their financial backers and potential conflicts of interest when they file the briefs in lower courts.\n\nBut some of the most prolific dark money groups that routinely file amicus briefs are now urging the panel to kill the rule. These groups claim that donor disclosure rules would violate the First Amendment and a 2021 Supreme Court ruling that allows nonprofits to hide their donors from state regulators.\n\nAt least four groups that have filed comment letters opposing the new rule have financial connections to President Donald Trump's former judicial advisor Leonard Leo, who has used a record-breaking $1.6 billion dark money windfall to reshape the country's political and judicial systems along conservative lines. Several key industry players that have fought to overturn campaign finance laws, including the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce, have also filed comment letters opposing the new rule.\n\nThe current rule requires some financial disclosure, but experts say there is a need for greater transparency, especially regarding dark money groups, nonprofits that are not required to disclose their funders.\n\nThose dark money groups and their corporate allies have \"showed up in force to oppose the changes to the rule,\" said Alex Aronson, cofounder and executive director of judicial ethics group Court Accountability .\n\n\"They really understand the importance of [amicus briefs] as a tool to influence and shape the law, and that's why they're going to the mattresses to push back on the courts from making these changes,\" Aronson told the Lever.\n\nAmicus briefs, Latin for \"friends of the court,\" allegedly date back to the Roman Empire, when interested parties wrote to judges to advocate for certain legal issues or people. The first amicus brief filed in the Supreme Court was in 1823 by former secretary of state and House Speaker Henry Clay.\n\nThe modern version of amicus briefs started in the mid-1900s when the American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights and consumer protection groups began filing the briefs with the Supreme Court and federal courts. In 1971, as left-leaning political groups racked up legal wins, Lewis F. Powell Jr, a corporate lawyer and future Supreme Court justice, wrote a memo to the Chamber of Commerce and other business lobbying groups urging them to hire a \"highly competent staff of lawyers\" to file similar briefs on behalf of the corporate world.\n\nSince then, the Chamber and the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group representing 14,000 companies in a wide range of sectors, have coordinated amicus brief efforts to gut campaign finance laws and promote private sector interests in the courts and Congress.\n\nOver the past fifteen years, amicus briefs have proliferated , with groups filing briefs in 96 percent of all Supreme Court cases. These efforts are getting noticed; in 2023, justices cited amicus briefs in their opinions 145 times .\n\nThis system is fueling a cottage industry. The cost of amicus briefs can range from $15,000 to $80,000 or more, depending on the prestige of the legal groups involved and the stakes of the court case. For Supreme Court cases, the costs can be much higher .\n\nThe vast majority of this spending is done in secret, with little transparency about who is funding these influential judicial pressure campaigns.\n\nFor years, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), has been sounding the alarm on the issue. As he noted in a 2024 letter he coauthored with Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA), dark money interests fund legal groups that seek out certain plaintiffs \"for strategic reasons\" in order to advance the cases through a sympathetic federal court system.\n\nThen, the lawmakers note, additional legal groups \"file amicus briefs aligned with the litigating group.\"\n\n\"Often, they file in orchestrated and harmonized flotillas\" that can range in number from 10 to 55 briefs, Whitehouse and Johnson wrote.\n\nThe lawmakers continued: \"In sum, a robust and coordinated system operates to flood appellate court proceedings with covertly funded amicus encouragement, while denying courts, the parties, and the public essential knowledge to evaluate the true interests behind the briefing and any resulting conflicts.\"\n\nFor these reasons, Whitehouse and Johnson believe that the amicus brief disclosure rule is needed.\n\n\"Without transparency, wealthy donors and corporate interests can covertly fund dozens of seemingly distinct amici - as well as the 'scholarship' and 'studies' those amici cite in their briefs - to create the illusion of credibility and broad support where none exists,\" wrote Whitehouse and Johnson in a comment letter on the rule.\n\nA subcommittee of the Judicial Conference, a panel of senior federal judges including the chief justice of the United States that decides policy for the federal court system, proposed the new disclosure rule in August 2024. The rule would require amicus brief filers in the federal court system to disclose relationships they have with people involved in the case in question. The groups would also have to disclose any money given to them to prepare or submit the brief and \"name any person who contributed or pledged to contribute more than $100 intended to pay for preparing, drafting, or submitting the brief,\" unless they have been involved with the operation for more than a year.\n\nThe rule would also limit briefs to no more than 6,500 words and require groups to disclose who worked on the brief and for how long, among other matters. According to experts, the most consequential part of the rule change is the disclosure of donations earmarked for amicus briefs.\n\n\"Earmarked contributions run the risk that the amicus is being used as a paid mouthpiece by the contributor,\" the Judicial Conference's subcommittee wrote in an explanation for the rule change. \"Knowing about earmarked contributions helps courts and the public evaluate the arguments and information in the amicus brief by providing information about possible reasons for the filing other than those explained by the amicus itself.\"\n\nNow that the comment period for the proposed rule change is closed, an advisory committee will read through the 407 comment letters submitted to the Judicial Conference - including those from a number of high-profile amicus brief filers.\n\nThat includes the Chamber of Commerce, the nation's largest lobbying group , which wrote that the new rule updates are \"unnecessary, counterproductive, and threaten to have a chilling effect on amicus organizations.\" The Chamber also claimed that forcing groups to disclose their donors would violate the First Amendment.\n\nThe Chamber has long been one of the country's most prolific amicus brief filers. In 2023, it bragged that it racked up \"a 78% win rate in decided cases\" where it had filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court. During the last Supreme Court session , the Chamber filed twenty-eight amicus briefs in cases that, among other things , helped criminalize homelessness and roll back environmental protections .\n\nThe National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group representing 14,000 companies in a wide range of sectors, also filed a comment letter , claiming that there is no need for judges and the public to know who is funding amicus operations.\n\n\"The U.S. Supreme Court has described campaign disclosure laws as necessary for voters to know more about a political candidate so that voters can form judgments about how a candidate might act upon assuming office,\" wrote the lobbying group. \"By contrast, courts need not know who contributes to an organization or amicus brief to make the correct decision in a case.\"\n\nBut according to the Judicial Conference committee that issued the rule, courts and judges do have an interest in knowing the identity and funding of the associations behind amicus briefs they read.\n\n\"Some have suggested that information about an amicus is unnecessary because the only thing that matters about an amicus brief is the merits of the legal arguments in that brief,\" the committee wrote in a preliminary draft of the proposed rule. \"At times, however, courts do consider the identity and perspective of an amicus to be relevant. For that reason, the Committee thinks that some disclosures about an amicus are important to promote the integrity of court processes and rules.\"\n\nEven if the advisory committee approves the disclosure rule, it faces an uphill battle for approval. The rule must also be green-lit by another subcommittee as well as the broader Judicial Conference , which has a conservative majority. Then it would be sent to the Supreme Court - which has a conservative majority due in part to Leo's dark money campaigns - and then finally to Congress, which has its fair share of dark money supporters .\n\nIf the rule is approved by everyone involved, it could go into effect by December 2026.\n\nLeo, the judicial power player, has used his network of dark money groups to fund the generation of numerous amicus briefs filed with the federal judiciary.\n\nIn 2014, a representative from the conservative nonprofit Bradley Foundation emailed Leo asking if there was a dark money nonprofit working on Supreme Court amicus briefs that it could donate to. Leo directed the Bradley Foundation representative to give to the Judicial Education Project, a dark money nonprofit founded by Leo that changed its name to the 85 Fund in 2019. The Bradley Foundation eventually paid the project $150,000 for its work on two amicus briefs - one of which was for a case challenging the Affordable Care Act - according to a 2021 letter from Whitehouse and Johnson.\n\nLeo's influence also extends to at least four groups - the American Legislative Exchange Council , the Pacific Legal Foundation , Americans for Prosperity , and Young America's Foundation - that filed comment letters with the Judicial Conference opposing the new amicus brief disclosures, all claiming the rule violates the First Amendment.\n\nDonors Trust , a major beneficiary of Leo's dark money connections, gave nearly $3.5 million to four of these groups in 2023, according to tax filings .\n\nTax filings for 2023 show that the 85 Fund , which has close financial connections to Leo, donated more than $576,000 to the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative nonprofit that distributes model state and federal legislation on behalf of its donors . The Concord Fund , another Leo-connected nonprofit , also donated $100,000 that year to the American Legislative Exchange Council.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, a nonprofit organization founded by right-wing petrochemical billionaires Charles and David Koch, has been at the forefront of the fight to hide nonprofit donors. In 2021, the nonprofit won a Supreme Court decision that struck down a California law requiring nonprofits to disclose the names and addresses of their largest donors.\n\nIn its comment letter on the new amicus brief rule, Americans for Prosperity claimed the disclosure of donors is not in the interest of the public or the government.\n\n\"Mere public curiosity is not a substantial governmental interest,\" the group wrote. \"Further, this informational curiosity is just as likely to misinform as inform the public.\"\n\nThese claims echo similar arguments made by Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), John Cornyn (R-TX), and John Thune (R-SD), who in their comment letter mocked the idea that dark money and financial interests were attempting to persuade the federal judiciary.\n\n\"The Democratic theory is that the federal judiciary - and the Supreme Court in particular - has been the target of a long-standing 'scheme' by private interests to take it over for their personal benefit,\" the senators wrote . \"In short, the Supreme Court doesn't issue originalist rulings because it's majority originalist; it does so because 'right-wing special interests' have 'captured' it.\"\n\nThe senators also issued a warning: \"If this rule is somehow enacted, we encourage affected parties to challenge it immediately in court.\"\n\nOne traditionally liberal civil rights group is also opposed to the Judicial Conference rule. The American Civil Liberties Union, which also supported the 2010 Supreme Court Citizens United decision to allow limitless campaign spending by corporations and unions, believes that the amicus disclosure requirements would \"burden First Amendment associational rights,\" the group stated in a comment letter .\n\nOther groups and lawmakers disagree. They see value in disclosing who is funding amicus briefs and any potential conflicts of interest involved.\n\nCourt Accountability stated in a comment letter that amicus briefs \"can often act as alter egos\" of the parties involved in a case, and that these parties can use amicus briefs to \"misguide a court - and the public - by appearing independent from parties.\"\n\nIn their own comment letter on the disclosure rule, Whitehouse and Johnson note that even corporate interests opposing the rule concede amicus briefs can persuade the courts.\n\n\"Even the Chamber of Commerce, which opposes the amendments, acknowledges that 'assessing the sheer number of amicus briefs filed in a particular case can be useful' to courts,\" the lawmakers wrote in a comment letter . \"Courts can find the number of amici in a case persuasive, and that when amici show up in flotillas to echo the same arguments, it can place a thumb on the scale in favor of the party they support.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nFreddy Brewster is a freelance reporter and has been published in the Los Angeles Times , NBC News, CalMatters, the Lost Coast Outpost , and other outlets across California.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Big Tech's lobbying and strong-arm tactics helped kill the legislation.\n\nA view of Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, on August 22, 2024.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers had a chance to pass first-in-the-nation legislation that would have forced Google, Meta, and other tech firms to pay ongoing fees for earning billions from using news outlets' content while journalism operations have struggled and closed.\n\nBut amid the tech industry's strong-arm tactics, millions of dollars spent lobbying, and allegations of currying favors from power brokers ranging from the California governor to the CEO of a nonprofit news organization, Big Tech scored a backroom deal last month that killed the journalism bills.\n\nInstead of forcing Google, Meta, and other tech companies to cough up potentially billions of dollars in ad revenue, California is moving forward with a smaller, limited-time program whose costs will be split between taxpayers and tech companies - and some of the funding will go toward the development of artificial intelligence tools, a technology that some observers say is an existential threat to the news industry.\n\nIn short, instead of forcing Google and its tech brethren to pay for their stranglehold on California-based news outlets, a California lawmaker ceded to pressure and settled for a slap on the wrist that critics say will do nothing to lessen Big Tech's grip - and may even strengthen it.\n\nThe development comes as the major tech companies report hundreds of billions in 2023 ad revenue, and as Google faces multiple antitrust lawsuits stemming from monopolizing ad sales and online search options.\n\n\"We have this backroom deal where taxpayer dollars have been introduced as a consolation prize because California couldn't execute anti-monopoly policy,\" said Matt Pearce, president of the Media Guild of the West, a union representing employees from the Los Angeles Times , Texas Tribune , and other newspapers in the Western United States.\n\nThe two California bills, Assembly Bill 886 and Senate Bill 1327, would have forced certain tech companies to pay news outlets millions of dollars for using or linking to news content, as well as implemented a tax on user data extracted for advertising purposes, with proceeds going to a newsroom fund.\n\nCalifornia is home to more than 10 percent of the US population and hosts the fifth-largest economy in the world . Legislation passed in the Golden State often sets the standard for legislation nationwide and helps influence federal policy .\n\nThe death of the two bills could be a harbinger for how tech companies will fight similar legislation elsewhere. Other countries have demanded tech firms share ad revenues with news outlets, and earlier this year, Illinois lawmakers introduced a bill similar to California's revenue-sharing proposal. In response, Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, has threatened to \"end the availability of news in Illinois\" on its platforms if the bill passes.\n\nThe California legislation was killed in a backroom deal spearheaded by assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Berkeley), author of Assembly Bill 886, in exchange for a $250 million agreement in which Google will pay $25 million in 2025 and then $20 million annually for the following four years toward two journalism initiatives. The state has reportedly agreed to provide another $70 million in tax dollars in journalism funding.\n\nAlong with concerns about taxpayers having to foot part of the bill, critics of the agreement point out that state tax-dollar spending must be approved by the California legislature, and no bill or other initiative has been introduced. So the funds touted in the agreement are far from a done deal - especially since California is currently facing a massive budget deficit and enacting widespread budget cuts .\n\n\"I see a press release , I see a lot of quotes from publisher lobbies, but what I don't see is anything that's binding, or hard evidence that this thing is going to materialize,\" Pearce said\n\nGoogle will also contribute $5 million annually for five years to create a \"National AI Innovation Accelerator\" that will allow journalists, researchers, and others to \"experiment with AI to assist them in their work,\" according to a press release from Wicks's office. OpenAI, one of the leading artificial intelligence companies, will provide technology resources, according to a fact sheet from Wicks's office.\n\nThe New York Times , Chicago Tribune , and other outlets sued OpenAI earlier this year, alleging that the tech company violated copyright laws by using their news stories to train the AI technology.\n\nThe California deal comes after Meta threatened to remove all California news content from its sites. Earlier this year, Google temporarily removed all California news outlets from its website as a threat to what it would do if the bills passed.\n\nDemocratic California governor Gavin Newsom, who has deep ties to the tech industry, stayed silent on the bills. This leadership is in contrast to other places where similar legislation saw success.\n\nIn 2023, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau advocated for the passage of a Canadian law to force Big Tech to pay news outlets, saying that Google and Meta were using \"bullying tactics\" to block the legislation.\n\n\"You did not see a whiff of that from Governor Newsom,\" Pearce said. \"It's that silence that really takes on an oppressive quality when you're getting closer to making these bills real and you're going around asking lawmakers to take hard votes.\"\n\nGoogle has spent more than $2 million since January 2023 lobbying the California legislature, Newsom's office, and other regulators against the bills and other issues, lobbying disclosures show.\n\nGoogle officials personally lobbied Newsom, senior counsel to the governor Jason Elliot, and secretary of legal affairs to the governor Ann Patterson during an event at the San Francisco International Airport on June 28, 2023, according to state lobbying disclosures . The topics of discussion were not disclosed.\n\nNewsom has received more than $71,000 from Google and nearly $90,000 from Google employees in campaign donations for his various statewide election efforts since 2008, state data shows .\n\nWicks has also received $8,500 from Google and nearly $2,000 from Google employees in campaign donations since 2017. Wicks's office did not respond to multiple interview requests.\n\nGoogle's search engine, launched in 1998, quickly became a go-to resource for users seeking information on a wide variety of topics, including local issues that were once dominated by newspapers. In 2002, Google launched its Google News feature , which involved gathering links and ranking news stories to \"help people search and browse news relevant to them.\"\n\nFacebook launched its social media site in 2004 and grew to become the top news source for millennials and Gen X by 2015. By 2023, Facebook began de-emphasizing news content after multiple scandals and pushback from Republicans alleging that the platform had a liberal bias .\n\nGoogle and Facebook often use news outlets' coverage to provide headlines and short summaries of news developments on their sites, reducing the likelihood that users access the original content and depriving publishers of ad revenue. Earlier this year, Google implemented AI-generated answers to questions users post. Although these answers cite sources and news outlets, they still deprive news outlets of clicks .\n\nSince 2005, as Google and Facebook grew into tech behemoths, more than 2,500 newspapers have ceased publication nationwide, leaving nearly half of all US counties without a local news source, according to a 2023 report from Northwestern University. California has lost nearly one hundred newspapers in the last decade, lawmakers estimate , and the recent bills were an attempt to help save California's rapidly declining newspaper industry.\n\nIn a comment to California lawmakers, Google claimed that news searches accounted for only 2 percent of all queries it received worldwide in 2022.\n\nBut Google and Meta rake in colossal amounts of ad revenue - revenue that previously went to news outlets.\n\nAlphabet, Google's parent company, reported more than $307 billion in revenue for 2023 - and more than $237 billion of that was ad revenue from Google and YouTube. Meta reported more than $131 billion in ad revenue for the same year.\n\nA 2023 study from the Initiative for Policy Dialogue at Columbia University found that if there were a 50-50 revenue split between US news publishers and Google, the tech company would pay publishers between $10 billion and $12 billion annually. Facebook would likewise pay news publishers around $2 billion a year, the study found.\n\n\"The decades of underpayment from platforms to news publishers have helped boost profits for Google and Facebook and increase their respective market (and monopoly) power,\" the authors wrote. \"The market power also means that many governments have become fearful of regulating big tech companies.\"\n\nLast month, a US District Court in Washington, DC, ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by spending billions of dollars to muscle out competitors in online search businesses. The judge noted that Google controls about 90 percent of the search options and spent more than $26 billion in 2021 to ensure that it is the default search option for smartphones and internet browsers.\n\nThere has yet to be a ruling on remedies regarding Google's monopoly status on searches.\n\nGoogle is set to go to trial this week to defend against another antitrust lawsuit from federal prosecutors who claim it has a monopoly on online ad sales. The Justice Department is alleging that Google controls about 90 percent of the market for online ad space, more than 85 percent of the market for the software used for advertisers to place ads, and more than 50 percent of the market for ad exchanges.\n\n\"Google pockets on average more than 30 percent of the advertising dollars that flow through its digital advertising technology products; for some transactions and for certain publishers and advertisers, it takes far more,\" the Justice Department said . \"Google's anticompetitive conduct has suppressed alternative technologies, hindering their adoption by publishers, advertisers, and rivals.\"\n\nSeveral media trade groups lobbied in support of the now-killed California legislation, including the California News Publishers Association , whose members include the Los Angeles Times, the East Bay Times , the Orange County Register , the San Francisco Chronicle , and other major newspapers . The California Broadcasters Association , which represents \"all licensed commercial and noncommercial radio & TV stations in California,\" also lobbied in support of the bill.\n\nMultiple unions representing news employees likewise came out in support of the two journalism bills, including regional chapters of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians as well as the Pacific Media Workers Guild.\n\nBut some small, independent outlets staunchly opposed the legislation - because they didn't want the funds going to hedge-fund- and billionaire-owned news outlets that they say have also helped gut the industry.\n\nAlden Global Capital, a hedge fund, owns more than two hundred newspapers nationwide and has been dubbed \"the grim reaper of American newspapers,\" by Vanity Fair . Alden is known to buy papers, lay off scores of employees, outsource some operations , and sell off valuable real estate . Alden has admitted to diverting hundreds of millions of dollars away from its newspapers and investing in risky real estate .\n\nAlden owns at least thirty newspapers across California , including Bay Area-based East Bay Times , the Orange County Register , the Los Angeles Daily News , the Chico Enterprise-Record , the Eureka Times-Standard , and others.\n\nGannett, which owns the USA Today chain of newspapers and has been accused of union busting and refusing to negotiate on union contracts, owns eight papers in California.\n\nCritics of the California bills highlighted how funds would go to papers based on the number of employees a newsroom had, which would have delivered a disproportionate amount of money to companies known for unfair labor practices and gutting newsrooms.\n\nHank Sims, founder and editor of the Lost Coast Outpost , based in Eureka, California, came out against the bill that would have forced tech companies to pay publishers that link to their stories. Sims thought the legislation would incentivize low-quality news content and clickbait. He was also opposed to sending money to hedge-fund-owned media outlets. (This reporter formerly worked at Lost Coast Outpost .)\n\n\"I built this business based on the fact that hedge funds came in and destroyed the local paper. They've done this throughout the country,\" Sims told the Lever . \"They've decimated it, stripped it for parts, sold all the assets, and are basically keeping it open as a skeleton crew.\"\n\nSims has a crew of five reporters and is looking to hire a sixth right now to cover Humboldt County, a rural county with about 135,000 people in Northern California. He gets some funding from the Google News Initiative , a funding and training program for news outlets, but credits his success to a lively sales team, a partnership with a local radio company, and an active local political scene.\n\n\"There are outlets like the Outpost all across the country trying to figure out what comes next after the age of big capital media, and to infuse a bunch of capital largely to legacy media at a time when I feel like we're doing the work to reinvent media for the twenty-first century, it's kind of like a slap in the face,\" Sims said.\n\nAnnelise Pierce, editor and founder of the Shasta Scout , feels similarly. Pierce, whose outlet received funding from the Google News Initiative, runs a news outlet in Shasta County, a deeply conservative county in Northern California that is still embroiled in a hotbed of conspiracy theories regarding the 2020 election.\n\n\"My biggest concern with the legislation is whether we're going to be giving additional oxygen to forms of news that shouldn't be given additional oxygen right now,\" Pierce told the Lever . \"What I'm talking about is hedge-fund-owned news organizations. I support my legacy reporters in the trenches beside me, but I don't support Gannett, and I don't support the way that they're producing news.\"\n\nThe Local Independent Online News Publishers (LION), a trade association dedicated to growing local independent news outlets around the nation, came out against the bill to make tech companies share revenues with news outlets. But multiple California-based LION members who spoke to the Lever said they had concerns about a lack of disclosure from LION leadership regarding their relationship and discussions with Google representatives.\n\nOn August 17, LION leadership sent an email urging its California members to support a settlement, rather than the journalism bills.\n\n\"Negotiations have become intense over the past couple weeks, and the result is a proposal that would generate tens of millions of dollars from tech companies and from state funds,\" wrote Neil Chase, CEO of California-focused news outlet CalMatters and LION board member.\n\n\"That proposal is close to the finish line, but there's some opposition from people who think it's not enough and that tech companies should be forced to cough up more,\" he continued. \"Our sense at LION, and mine from my perch at my day job, is that this is serious money that'll make a real difference and that it's unlikely we'd get more money anytime soon by scuttling this deal and pursuing legislation that'll be hard to pass and likely challenged in court.\"\n\n(This reporter previously reported for CalMatters . David Sirota, the Lever 's founder, owner, and editor in chief, took a class taught by Chase at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism.)\n\nMultiple California-based LION members who spoke to the Lever said the fact that Google was behind the push for the settlement was never disclosed to them before they were asked to support the deal.\n\n\"The lack of transparency across the board on this should be deeply alarming to everybody, but especially journalists,\" said Alicia Ramirez, publisher of the Riverside Record and LION member. \"We are people who are tasked with holding those in positions of power accountable, and we should demand the same for the organizations of which we are a part.\"\n\nPierce, who is also a member of LION, felt similarly.\n\n\"The original email we received asking us to support the settlement deal didn't even mention that Google was behind that request,\" she said. \"So if you want to really do the right thing and be honest and get people's permission, you should maybe do that with us too as members. Let us know who you're actually speaking for when you contact us.\"\n\nChase said that he sent the email urging LION members to support the agreement on short notice because he was alerted to the settlement agreement on a Saturday and that Chris Krewson, LION's executive director, was away from his computer.\n\n\"LION is a trade association fighting for its members. It's brought in millions and millions of dollars for publishers all over the country through grant programs,\" Chase told the Lever . \"And that's what they do, they try to figure out how to get more resources for publishers. I appreciate there's an organization out there scrambling to do this stuff.\"\n\nAdditionally, Pierce and Ramirez raised concerns about how Chase reportedly \" suggested \" that CalMatters could host the AI accelerator project that is a part of the agreement, which is estimated to bring $62.5 million in funding over the course of five years. The two said this development was not known to LION members until after it was reported in the Wrap , a news outlet focused on entertainment and media reporting, days after the settlement was reached to kill the legislation.\n\nChase said that he had a conversation internally with his staff about the possibility of CalMatters hosting the AI project, but the details of the project have yet to be determined and he has not heard anything about if the AI project will be journalism-focused.\n\nChase told the Lever that he also spoke with staffers from Wicks's office about hosting the AI project.\n\n\"It wasn't like a proposal or anything; it was casual conversation,\" he said. \"If it needs a home, I would be happy to be the home for it. I think using AI to figure out how to do better journalism for everybody is a great idea.\"\n\nCalMatters currently has a site dedicated to using AI to track \"every word spoken in public hearings, every dollar donated to politicians, every bill introduced, every vote cast and more.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't lobby for anything,\" Chase said. \"If there's some announcement that this thing needs a home and what would people do with it, we might create a proposal.\"\n\nChase said he thought the agreement to kill the journalism bills wasn't perfect and doesn't fault publishers for wanting a better deal. But Chase said that time was running out and Wicks had little leverage to force Google and other tech companies to cough up more money.\n\n\"Nobody I know thought that either bill had a really good chance of passing and then getting signed by Newsom and then clearing court hurdles,\" Chase said. \"I wish it was more, but the idea that somehow I, or anybody else, could say, 'No, we don't want this because it's not enough money,' and then what happens? A bill next year and start the whole conversation over again? I mean, it's not realistic.\"\n\nGoogle claims to have donated more than $1 billion to support the news industry through projects like the Google News Showcase, a program in which Google pays publishers to \"editorially curate content on this online experience and to give free of charge user access to select paywalled content.\"\n\nThe tech company also runs the Google News Initiative , a training program started in 2018 that has helped more than 7,000 \"news partners\" in more than 120 countries. LION is funded in part by the Google News Initiative, as well as by sources including the Meta Journalism Project and the Knight Foundation , a philanthropic fund to promote journalism and democracy - all of which highlights how closely intertwined journalism and Big Tech has become.\n\n\"Practically everyone has some kind of conflict of interest, primarily economic,\" said Pearce, with the Media Guild.\n\nA federal bill introduced in 2023 would allow news publishers to bypass federal antitrust laws and form a collective to negotiate ad-revenue sharing with big tech companies. The bill, called the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2023 , was introduced by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and has a sizable bipartisan backing, including many senators allied with former president Donald Trump.\n\nBut the bill has stalled in the Senate and is unlikely to be voted on this session.\n\nGoogle has spent more than $2.7 million since January 2023 lobbying Congress on the federal journalism bill and other matters, disclosures show .\n\nMeta has spent more than $3.7 million since January 2023 lobbying Congress, the US trade representative, the Federal Communications Commission, and other regulators on the journalism bill and other matters, disclosures show.\n\nMeanwhile, around the world, battles are heating up over who's responsible for - and who deserves a cut of - Big Tech's billions in ad revenue.\n\nIn 2021, Australia passed a law that required tech companies to negotiate ad-revenue sharing with news outlets. While both Google and Meta initially agreed to negotiate sharing ad revenue, the latter eventually pulled out and ceased linking news content on its platforms. It remains uncertain if the Australian government will force Meta into arbitration with news outlets.\n\nLast year, Canada passed the Online News Act , a law that requires tech platforms to negotiate revenue sharing with news outlets. Meta refused to negotiate and pulled all Canadian news content from its site. Google agreed to pay $100 million in Canadian currency to a fund that will distribute the money to news outlets. \n\nFunding the news is a tricky situation for many publishers, especially smaller ones, across the United States.\n\nChase, with CalMatters , sees a future that utilizes AI to complement work undertaken by reporters on the ground.\n\nPierce, with the Shasta Scout , said the reason why many corporate-owned outlets are failing is because they have lost touch with the communities they report on and don't produce content that is useful for local residents.\n\nSims, with the Lost Coast Outpost , feels similarly.\n\n\"We're lucky in that we have locally based ownership that really believes in the mission,\" he said. \"They're not looking to make bank off of us. They want us to exist and to do the work we do because they care about the community.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nFreddy Brewster is a freelance reporter and has been published in the Los Angeles Times , NBC News, CalMatters, the Lost Coast Outpost , and other outlets across California.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The revelation should remind us all about the dangers of uncritically reporting government statements.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki baselessly charged that Moscow was planning to \"possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.\" (Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nSometimes a piece of news can be both a major revelation and completely unsurprising. Take the recent disclosure, fed to NBC News's Ken Dilanian by US officials, that much of the \"declassified intelligence\" given to the public over the course of the Ukraine crisis-turned-war was dubious to nonexistent.\n\nEarlier this week, Dilanian told NBC that the Joe Biden administration's claims that Russian president Vladimir Putin was considering using biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine was based on less-than-solid evidence, according to three different US officials he talked to. \"That was based on declassified intelligence,\" said Dilanian. \"But we're also told the intelligence wasn't very clear about what exactly was going on.\" Dilanian also pointed to headline news last month that Russia was requesting military aid from China, something denied by Chinese and Russian officials, as another case of this.\n\nBut if Dilanian's piece is to be trusted, he was actually underselling the news. According to the report, written by Dilanian and three other reporters, those three officials told NBC that \"there is no evidence Russia has brought any chemical weapons near Ukraine.\"\n\nThey went on to acknowledge \"that the U.S. has used information as a weapon even when confidence in the accuracy of the information wasn't high\" and that beyond using \"low-confidence intelligence\" to deter potential actions like a chemical attack, some of it was just US officials \"trying to get inside Putin's head\" or releasing information \"about things that are possible rather than likely.\"\n\nAs examples, the report cites recent claims that Putin was being misled by his advisers, as well as the Chinese military aid claim. \"The U.S. officials said there are no indications China is considering providing weapons to Russia,\" states the report, adding that the White House had merely meant it as a \"warning to China not to do so\" and that the \"charge that Russia had turned to China for potential military help lacked hard evidence.\" Of course, as Antiwar.com 's Dave DeCamp pointed out , that's not how this issue was reported at the time, with reputable outlets like the New York Times , the Telegraph , and the Associated Press reporting the US claims as if they were objective reality.\n\nIf you read between the lines, it certainly seems like US officials are admitting they're simply making things up - or \"sowing disinformation,\" in the parlance of our time - and feeding it to the press, confident reporters will uncritically pass on whatever they tell them. Former MI6 chief John Sawers had suggested as much back in February, telling the Atlantic Council's Ben Judah that he thought US and British claims about Moscow's designs were \"based on a growing understanding and analysis of Putin rather than deep, secret intelligence reports\" and that they were presented as the latter to \"create good stories for the media.\"\n\nIt is worth considering how risky this practice can be. Take President Joe Biden's claim that Putin was planning to use chemical weapons, a reply to Moscow's unproven claims of US biological weapons labs in Ukraine. That flippant line, based as we now know on \"low-confidence intelligence,\" soon heightened the risk of military escalation, when an irresponsible Western press and hawkish politicians demanded that Biden make their use a \"redline\" - a trigger for war on Russia, in other words - before Biden bizarrely threatened to respond to such an attack \"in kind,\" presumably meaning with chemical weapons of his own.\n\nIt's especially worth weighing up these admissions as the Western national security establishment, aided by the press , uses Putin's invasion to claim vindication and restore the credibility it lost after the Iraq War buildup and other fiascoes. It was US and British officials who were, virtually alone , publicly saying from December onward that a Russian invasion was \"imminent.\" Yet \"senior current former US intelligence officials\" told veteran national security reporter James Risen a very different story: that the CIA had, contrary to claims at the time from Biden and UK prime minister Boris Johnson, determined Putin hadn't made a decision to invade in December and January, and that he only decided to do so in February - notably, after Washington had rebuffed his negotiation demands around NATO expansion and other security issues.\n\nObviously, we have no way of knowing whether there's any more truth to that than to the polar-opposite claims we were hearing throughout December and January. All of these are simply assertions from anonymous officials for which we've stubbornly been denied any real substantiation. But this contradiction, paired with the new admissions from US officials, suggest there's still ample reason to apply the same skepticism to Western government assertions that we rightly give to claims by Russian officials. It's also a bitter reminder of the \"what-if\" the world will weigh up for years to come, of what might have happened had Washington agreed to negotiate before the invasion, as a group of former diplomats had urged .\n\nFinally, it's yet another stark case of the double standard around \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation,\" which Western governments and their proxies in the tech sector have ramped up censorship powers to combat, dramatically escalating their powers of information control over the course of this war. There is no drumbeat to ban White House press secretary Jen Psaki from Twitter for, it turns out, baselessly charging that Moscow was planning to \"possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.\" No one is demanding that the mainstream press outlets who reported all this dubious \"intelligence\" as fact be censored by tech companies.\n\nNor should they. We can easily imagine the scary ways these powers and this kind of precedent could be used to curtail press freedoms and stamp out free speech. Yet for some reason Western government officials and mainstream press outlets are entirely exempt from this panic around misinformation, even though the falsehoods and questionable claims they might peddle are vastly more consequential and far-reaching than those of random social media users and small, web-based news outlets.\n\nThe admission that US officials have fed the press \"intelligence\" that may have been nothing of the sort should be a wake-up call to both reporters and the public. Not everything government officials say is a lie; but many of the things they say aren't the truth, either.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

(Allison Robbert / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\n\"House Republicans want to pass massive tax breaks for billionaires and wealthy corporations to benefit the wealthy, the well-off, and the well-connected and to stick the bill with working-class Americans,\" House Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries warned NBC News the day before Donald Trump's inauguration. \"One day into his presidency,\" Senate Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer told the Senate the day after, \"it's clear Donald Trump's golden age is not for the working and middle class. His golden age, rather, is for the special interests, for the wealthy elite, and the corporate insiders he promised to take on as president.\"\n\nThis is all a bit rich. Schumer earned his moniker \" D-Wall Street \" years ago because of his loyal service to the US financial industry, which has repaid his devotion many times over by showering donations on him and the party he is now the de facto leader of. And Jeffries is also very much a creature of the corporate donor class.\n\nAnd we've been here before. Dusting off the party's \"populist\" playbook has been the default move for the Democratic Party in moments of crisis and uncertainty. Take the following quotes.\n\nFrom 1992:\n\nFor more than a decade our government has been rigged in favor of the rich and special interests. While the very wealthiest Americans get richer, middle-class Americans work harder for lower incomes and pay higher taxes to a government that fails to produce what we need: good jobs in a growing economy, world-class education, affordable health care, and safe streets and neighborhoods.\n\nFrom 2000:\n\nThey're for the powerful. We're for the people. . . . I know one thing about the job of the president: It is the only job in the Constitution that is charged with the responsibility of fighting for all the people . . . not just the wealthy or the powerful, all the people; especially those who need a voice, those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up, so they are never left behind. . . [I]f you entrust me with the presidency, I will fight for you.\n\nAnd from 2013:\n\nSince 1979 . . . our productivity is up by more than 90 percent, but the income of the typical family has increased by less than 8 percent. Since 1979, our economy has more than doubled in size, but most of that growth has flowed to a fortunate few. . . . The combined trends of increased inequality and decreasing mobility pose a fundamental threat to the American Dream, our way of life, and what we stand for around the globe. . . . And finally, rising inequality and declining mobility are bad for our democracy. Ordinary folks can't write massive campaign checks or hire high-priced lobbyists and lawyers to secure policies that tilt the playing field in their favor at everyone else's expense.\n\nThese are not lifted from the speeches of Bernie Sanders. These are statements by, respectively, Bill Clinton , Al Gore , and Barack Obama . Each time Democrats' backs have been up against the wall, they've turned to populism - in words only, naturally - for salvation. Trailing behind both George H. W. Bush and Ross Perot early in the summer of 1992, Clinton unveiled his populist \"putting people first\" agenda. The key to the campaign was \"the economy, stupid\" and Clinton, donning his hard hat , was ready to be America's working-class hero.\n\nWhen polls showed Gore losing to Bush by as much as 10 percentage points in 2000, the Gore campaign lurched leftward in rhetoric (much to the concern of his party's conservative wing, who accused him of embracing class warfare). Fearful of what the 2014 midterm elections would bring and with sinking approval ratings, the Obama administration tried to right the ship with a new populist message, declaring income inequality the \"defining challenge of our times.\"\n\nOf course, the records of all three party leaders contradicted the rhetoric. But they didn't let that get in the way.\n\nOccasionally, Democrats have actually been caught trotting out populist rhetoric in public while at the same time assuring investors and politicians that it's all just fodder for the plebs.\n\nIn the 2008 primary election, for example, Obama campaigned against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). But the stump speeches against NAFTA and for fundamentally changing trade policy were a poorly disguised sleight of hand. One of Obama's top economic advisers, Austan Goolsbee, privately reassured concerned Canadian officials that the candidate was an enthusiastic supporter of free trade. In a memo that was quickly leaked , a Canadian official summed up Goolsbee's reassurances. Obama's NAFTA rhetoric \"should be viewed as more about political positioning than a clear articulation of policy plans.\" Criticisms of free trade were a campaign tactic to improve the candidate's standing in the Midwest especially and \"to court the economic populist vote.\"\n\nAfter this news broke, Obama's 2008 primary rival, Hillary Clinton, denounced him for giving Canadians \"the old wink-wink.\" Clinton, her campaign insisted, was committed to a wholesale reworking of NAFTA. Several days later, however, it was revealed that the Clinton campaign may have offered similar private reassurances to the Canadians, campaign rhetoric notwithstanding.\n\nObama and Clinton's double-dealing on free trade had at least one precedent. In 1984, Walter Mondale secured the Democratic Party's presidential nomination by campaigning for new protectionist policies. Concerned European business leaders and politicians objected. Mondale's top advisor and former Democratic National Committee chairman Robert Strauss then explicitly assured a European business audience that Mondale was posturing on protectionism \"for the purpose of getting the nomination of our party.\"\n\nThis kind of opportunistic populism is par for the course in the Democratic Party. But for the labor left, it is also potentially destructive. By periodically employing such rhetoric with no intention of governing along populist lines, Democrats sow a deep-seated cynicism about left-populist politics. At best, it contributes to pessimism: \"It sounds good on paper, but it will never happen.\" But at worst it associates class politics with duplicity.\n\nFor those of us who hope to see an actual left-populist movement rise up and break us out of our Second Gilded Age, unmasking this kind of fake populism is an urgent task. Going along with it - or worse, naively thinking \"maybe this time they really mean it\" - lets Democrats salt the earth for actual left-wing, pro-worker politics in the future.\n\nThere's every reason to think that Jeffries, Schumer, and other Democratic Party leaders are going to be cribbing heavily from the populist playbook this year. No one should confuse it for the real deal. As the Labor Institute's Les Leopold rightly put it : \"Get ready for more faux populism from Democratic Party elites while Wall Street feasts on the riches Trump showers upon them.\" What a time to be alive.\n\nNeal Meyer is a member of the New York City Democratic Socialists of America.

Nearly two-thirds of them came straight from Project 2025, the corporate-backed right-wing policy blueprint that Trump disavowed on the campaign trail.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on January 20, 2025, in Washington, DC.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn his first day back in office, President Donald Trump signed a blizzard of executive orders on everything from the environment to immigration - and nearly two-thirds of them came straight from Project 2025, the sweeping corporate-backed policy blueprint that Trump lambasted during his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nOf the twenty-six formal executive orders Trump signed on Monday, sixteen mirrored at least in part proposals from the Heritage Foundation's nine-hundred-page Project 2025 to reshape the federal government, according to an analysis by the Lever.\n\nThat includes orders that withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Accords, end Biden's electric vehicle mandates, and increase oil and gas drilling in Alaska - all proposals that first appeared in Project 2025 months earlier.\n\nIn 2024, Democrats linked Trump to Project 2025 during the presidential campaign, noting that more than 140 former Trump administration employees worked on the policy agenda released in April 2023 and that Trump's running mate, former Ohio senator J. D. Vance, had been boosting the project's leader. Trump quickly distanced himself from Project 2025, claiming he had \"nothing to do with\" it and declaring that \"some of the things they're saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.\"\n\nMany of the new executive orders, however, seem torn straight from the pages of Project 2025. Some roll back previous executive orders issued by former President Joe Biden that aimed to combat climate change or improve diversity and equity in the federal government. Others reinstate executive orders from the first Trump administration.\n\nThe executive actions are emblematic of how the Heritage Foundation, a conservative nonprofit think tank, and its corporate sponsors have managed to successfully shape the agenda for a second Trump administration. And with Republicans now controlling both chambers of Congress, Trump will be empowered to put its playbook immediately into practice.\n\n\"Project 2025 was the conservative movement's unapologetic blueprint for building an authoritarian presidency,\" said James Goodwin, policy director at the Center for Progressive Reform, a research and advocacy nonprofit focused on climate change, economic issues, and other matters. \"And these day-one actions are the Trump administration's first concrete steps toward realizing that vision.\"\n\nFounded in 1973, the Heritage Foundation has been a driving force behind conservative politics for decades. The nonprofit was able to blend together free market capitalism and Christian nationalism, a fusion that came to define the modern-day Republican Party. The foundation is also a dark money juggernaut - it has collected more than $18 million from shadowy Wall Street-backed charities since 2020.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation has been preparing for a second Trump presidency for nearly two years - issuing policy blueprints, lining up cabinet picks , and filing more than 50,000 Freedom of Information Act requests to reportedly help find federal employees to purge.\n\nSeveral architects of Project 2025 are now filling out the Trump administration. Russell Vought, the former vice president of the Heritage Foundation's sister organization Heritage Action for America - who wrote the Project 2025 chapter on the Executive Office of the President of the United States - was nominated by Trump to lead the Office of Management and Budget, the agency tasked with developing the president's proposed budget and executing Trump's agenda. Vought previously headed the agency during the first Trump administration.\n\nTrump nominated Brendan Carr to head the Federal Communications Commission, the same agency that Carr wrote a chapter about for Project 2025. In the chapter, Carr calls to end the censoring of \"political viewpoints,\" specifically singling out Facebook and YouTube's censorship policies.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook's parent company Meta, recently announced that Facebook would begin promoting political content and end its third-party fact-checking program. Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, YouTube's parent company, attended Trump's inauguration.\n\nNot every executive order that Trump signed on Monday was referenced in Project 2025. The Heritage Foundation's manifesto makes no mention of birthright citizenship , the constitutional right that Trump is trying - likely in vain - to rescind. Nor did it recommend declaring a national energy emergency in order to overhaul US energy policy or designating some drug cartels as terrorist groups , both of which Trump has now ordered.\n\nBut many of his day-one actions strongly mirror Project 2025's recommendations.\n\nTake, for instance, Trump's executive order rescinding the security clearances of fifty-one former intelligence officials. Those officials claimed in 2020 that media reports suggesting a laptop owned by Joe Biden's son Hunter contained evidence of a pay-to-play scheme were Russian misinformation. Those claims proved to be false, as information on the laptop was used in a federal gun case against Hunter Biden. The laptop and alleged efforts to suppress information about the matter became a major Republican rallying point .\n\nThe security-clearance directive explicitly mirrors a Project 2025 directive that mandated that a new administration \"should immediately revoke the security clearances of any former directors, deputy directors, or other senior intelligence officials who discuss their work in the press or on social media without prior clearance from the current director.\"\n\nThe same section of Project 2025 - on the nation's \"Intelligence Community\" - recommends that a new administration \"direct the [Director of National Intelligence] and the Attorney General . . . to conduct a further audit of all [intelligence community] equities of past politicization and abuses of intelligence information.\"\n\nOne of Trump's executive orders does just that: it requires the Attorney General to review the \"weaponization of the Intelligence Community.\"\n\nOther executive orders issued by Trump offer additional benefits to the corporate interests that backed the Heritage Foundation and his presidency. Several will roll back climate and environmental rules, as suggested by Project 2025. The moves are a win for oil and gas interests like Koch Industries, the petrochemical giant that funds the Heritage Foundation through its sprawling dark money philanthropic network.\n\nTrump's executive orders roll back Biden-era limits on oil and gas leasing on federal land, strip energy efficiency standards for household appliances, and eliminate incentives for electric vehicles. These victories for oil and gas interests were proposed in Project 2025, which instructed that a new administration \"must immediately roll back Biden's orders\" on climate.\n\nTrump also followed Project 2025's directives to open up fragile Alaska wilderness to oil and gas drilling - even though the oil industry has been hesitant to take on such a project given the high costs and risks of drilling in far-flung, undeveloped land. In his executive order \"Unleashing Alaska's Extraordinary Resource Potential,\" he reinstated a plan launched during his first administration to allow drilling and development in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve, which had received new protections under the Biden administration .\n\nAs Project 2025's authors had written months prior, \"Alaska is a special case and deserves immediate action.\"\n\nTrump's first-day executive orders are emblematic of his desire to not only expand the power of the executive branch but also to prime the public for more dramatic changes to come, said Goodwin with the Center for Progressive Reform.\n\n\"Like the proverbial frog in boiling water, once this political culture has been introduced to the public, it becomes easier to ratchet up even more extreme exercises of arbitrary power in the future,\" he said.\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nKatya Schwenk is a journalist based in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nFreddy Brewster is a freelance reporter and has been published in the Los Angeles Times , NBC News, CalMatters, the Lost Coast Outpost , and other outlets across California.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nDemocrats just helped Republicans give president-elect Donald Trump the potential power to shut down nonprofits under the guise of fighting terrorism - while GOP lawmakers have quietly revealed a new blueprint for defunding organizations they disagree with.\n\nEarlier this month, the House Energy and Commerce Committee laid out a plan to target environmental justice nonprofits and organizations working to transition the economy away from fossil fuels.\n\nThat report preceded a major House vote on Thursday in which Republicans and fifteen Democrats passed legislation giving the Treasury Department the power to strip nonprofit news organizations, advocacy groups, and universities of their tax-exempt status.\n\nThe Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act was originally proposed last year, ostensibly to prevent US nonprofits from supporting groups like Hamas after widespread protests over Israel's invasion of Gaza. Nicknamed the \" nonprofit killer, \" it gives the president unprecedented authority to go after political opponents. Advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union warned of the bill's potential \"to grant the executive branch extraordinary power . . . based on a unilateral accusation of wrongdoing.\"\n\nAfter an essentially identical bill failed to pass last week, the newly approved bill now goes to the Senate for a vote.\n\nIn the preceding weeks, the House Energy and Commerce Committee's report focused on the Inflation Reduction Act's distribution of federal funding, offering a preview of how the new terrorism legislation could be wielded for political purposes. It also highlighted the kinds of organizations that could be targeted, including those that support clean-energy policies like committing investments to renewable energy, phasing out fossil fuel production and use, and expanding public land conservation.\n\nCriticizing the Biden administration's environmental justice grants for marginalized groups historically inundated by pollution, the report says , \"Enriching nonprofit organizations to spread radical, left-leaning ideology is an inappropriate use of taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nThe plan singles out specific groups that the committee says have pushed a \"radical rush-to-green agenda,\" including Rewiring America, a nonprofit working on electrification, and New York City-based environmental justice group WE ACT. It castigated , for example, a blog post on WE ACT's website \"criticizing 'Republican gas stove culture wars,' and House GOP Members' 'preformative [ sic ], out-of-touch agenda.'\"\n\nThe committee also denounced a 2019 blog post from climate activist group Climate Justice Alliance that criticized racist policies embedded in New Deal government policies from the 1930s. The post emphasized the importance of \"firm commitments to address and erase many of the discriminatory practices of the past in order to secure a regenerative economy that leaves no one behind.\"\n\nThe committee wrote that such opinions should preclude groups like Climate Justice Alliance and WE ACT from receiving taxpayer funding. Federal programs, they wrote, should \"not be funding extremist organizations to advocate for a preferred policy agenda.\"\n\nUnder the new bill just passed by the House, criteria for designations of \"terrorism\" are vague. If it passes the Senate and is signed into law, the Treasury Secretary would have broad discretion in the law's enforcement and wouldn't be required to share related evidence.\n\nThe law could chill free speech by creating financial pressure on organizations that rely on their tax-exempt status to operate effectively. Under the Treasury's discretion, the bill could be wielded against projects backed by political or corporate interests; for example, groups like WE ACT who oppose oil and gas development could be accused of obstructing critical infrastructure.\n\nAs Rep. Angie Craig (D-MN) wrote Wednesday on Twitter/X, \"I've become increasingly concerned that H.R. 9495 would be used inappropriately by the incoming Administration.\"\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , called the bill \"an authoritarian and undemocratic play by Republicans to go after political enemies.\"\n\nVice president-elect J. D. Vance has previously supported revoking the tax-exempt status of liberal institutions. \"We should eliminate all of the special privileges that exist for our nonprofit and foundation class,\" he said at a 2021 conference . Later that year, he told Tucker Carlson on Fox News, \"We are actively subsidizing the people who are destroying this country,\" calling groups like the Ford Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to social justice, \"a cancer.\"\n\nThe \"nonprofit killer\" bill is part of a larger Republican effort to attack what many on the right call \"woke capitalism,\" including environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives to reduce carbon emissions, embrace more diverse workforces, and other efforts. So far this year, conservative lawmakers and their allies have authored legislation that would rollback shareholder rights seeking to hold corporations accountable, leaned on the Supreme Court to gut environmental law , and used dark money donations to help fuel their agenda .\n\nIn the future, as the recent House Committee report notes , subversive activities like \"public outreach\" or \"public education\" will \"demand rigorous scrutiny and meticulous oversight.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nLois Parshley is an award-winning investigative journalist.

(Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen Democratic donors attacked the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris administration's chief antitrust regulator, Lina Khan, during this year's election, Vice President Harris declined to defend her, prompting some critics to say Harris was abandoning a populist message during a heated campaign.\n\nAt the time, the public did not know what was just revealed: Khan's agency had launched a probe of the rideshare giant employing Harris's brother-in-law and top adviser, who helped craft the Democratic campaign's economic pitch to voters and big donors.\n\nLast week, Bloomberg revealed that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) earlier this year opened a probe into Uber's subscription service , looking at whether the rideshare company had violated consumer protection laws.\n\nTony West, Harris's brother-in-law , is the senior vice president and chief legal officer for Uber, the tech company that offers on-demand taxi rides and other services. During Harris's presidential bid, West took a temporary leave of absence from the company and reportedly shaped the Harris campaign's economic policy and messaging . One Biden aide told the Atlantic \"that Harris steered away from hard-edged messaging at the urging of her brother-in-law, Tony West.\"\n\nThe FTC's new probe of Uber is the latest strike by Khan against Big Tech. Under Khan's leadership, the FTC has taken on Amazon, Meta, and Google and promised that gig economy companies like Uber and Lyft would come under scrutiny.\n\nKhan's approach to the position has helped launch a new chapter of antitrust enforcement , winning her praise from antimonopoly and consumer protection advocates and even some Republicans skeptical of big business . But it has also made her many enemies in corporate America.\n\n\"It's nearly impossible to be a key lawyer to the oligarchs without becoming captured by the oligarchs' worldview,\" said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the government watchdog group Revolving Door Project. \"As West was able to become a full-time Harris campaign principal, the campaign's message switched to pablum. I think West played a key role in that tragic transformation from populist to milquetoast.\"\n\nThe Revolving Door Project asserts that President Biden could right now renominate Khan to a new seven-year term as a commissioner, but he has so far declined to do so. Trump will have the ability to select a new chair and will likely select one of the two Republican commissioners to chair the agency once he is sworn into office.\n\nIn July, just days after President Joe Biden dropped out and Harris began campaigning, venture capitalist Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn, openly called for Khan's removal while also backing Harris. Hoffman donated millions to Democrats this election cycle, including $6 million to Future Forward, a super PAC that supported both the Biden and Harris campaigns, and worked to rally Silicon Valley leaders behind the vice president.\n\nHoffman has a personal stake in Khan's fate: in 2016, Hoffman sold LinkedIn to Microsoft for more than $26 billion and has since taken a position on Microsoft's board of directors. Microsoft is facing a Federal Trade Commission probe for acquiring another Hoffman-founded company, Inflection AI.\n\nHoffman's attack on Khan was followed by a similar reproach from media executive Barry Diller, also a Harris supporter whose companies were also reportedly facing an FTC investigation . Meanwhile, the Harris campaign's billionaire surrogate Mark Cuban said Khan was \"hurting more than she's helping.\"\n\nCuban walked those comments back a few weeks later.\n\nAlthough Khan was a Biden appointee - and a major pillar of his legacy - Harris refused to defend her against attacks from Hoffman, Diller, and others. Her campaign paid no lip service to Khan's wins against corporate America, and Harris never appeared with her, despite Khan campaigning with downballot Democrats .\n\nSome critics felt this was a mistake; recent polling data indicate that antitrust actions, including taking on Big Tech or Big Pharma, are popular across the aisle, and they certainly are among the Democratic Party's progressive wing .\n\nNow, the news of the Federal Trade Commission's Uber probe raises questions about Harris's abandonment of Khan and whether President Joe Biden will take steps to reappoint Khan to the agency, allowing her to potentially serve under president-elect Donald Trump.\n\nBefore becoming Uber's top lawyer, West made his career in the Justice Department , working his way up to associate attorney general. In 2014, he departed public service for the private sector.\n\nWest first took a job with soda giant PepsiCo, working as its vice president of government affairs and general counsel. In 2017, he left PepsiCo to become Uber's general counsel. By 2020, he was making $12.3 million in annual compensation at the company.\n\nWhen Harris announced her presidential bid, West took leave from his role at Uber to serve as her campaign adviser, reportedly becoming one of her strongest influences and most important confidants.\n\n\"He should never have been brought into the campaign, especially given the tension between [Democrats] and labor [advocates],\" said Hal Singer, a professor of economics at the University of Utah. \"[Harris] needed to forcefully articulate how she was going to assist labor, including misclassified workers. That couldn't happen with Tony at the helm of policy. That Uber was under investigation by the FTC just makes the conflict worse.\"\n\nWest brought with him close ties to Silicon Valley. As campaign adviser, West participated in fundraisers with a number of billionaires who have called for Khan to be ousted from a potential Harris administration, including Hoffman and Cuban - all while Harris's campaign adopted pro-business talking points to court Wall Street.\n\nAt the same time, it's now clear that Federal Trade Commission investigators were looking into Uber One.\n\nThe rideshare company has been in the crosshairs of the Federal Trade Commission before, reaching a $20 million settlement with the agency over allegedly misleading drivers about their wages in 2018, before Khan's tenure. The agency has since brought a similar claim against rival rideshare company Lyft.\n\nUber has spent more than $4.3 million since January 2023 lobbying Congress and regulators on \"issues related to worker classification and possible anticompetitive activities that could limit consumers access to app-based technologies,\" among other issues, disclosures show .\n\nIn November 2021, Uber launched Uber One, a consumer-facing subscription service that allows app users to pay a monthly membership fee in exchange for rideshare and food delivery perks. While federal regulators have not brought any action yet as a result of the investigation, Bloomberg 's report indicates that the agency's probe stems from customer complaints about being enrolled in Uber One without their consent and how difficult it is to cancel the subscription.\n\nEarly settlement talks between the Federal Trade Commission and Uber's lawyers, according to Bloomberg , had so far been unsuccessful.\n\n\"It's unsurprising that West's Uber was being investigated by the FTC, because I think there has never been a day in the life of Uber in which it wasn't bending or breaking the law in pursuit of growth or profit,\" Hauser said. \"Oligarchs can sincerely advocate for right-wing populism on social issues, but it is nearly impossible for them to identify with working people on economic issues.\"\n\nKhan's term technically expired in September , but she has continued to head the agency. If reappointed and confirmed to the role before Biden leaves office in January, Khan could remain a commissioner for the next seven years . Trump could try to remove Khan, but Hauser said the move would likely trigger a legal battle over a 1935 Supreme Court precedent that restricts a president's ability to fire the commissioners because Congress created the agency.\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nFreddy Brewster is a freelance reporter and has been published in the Los Angeles Times , NBC News, CalMatters, the Lost Coast Outpost , and other outlets across California.\n\nKatya Schwenk is a journalist based in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

He also said he \"couldn't care less\" if car prices rise because of tariffs, saying it could push buyers to U.S.-made vehicles.\n\nBy Erica L. Green\n\nPresident Trump told NBC News on Saturday that he would not fire anyone involved in a group chat that inadvertently disclosed plans for airstrikes on Yemen to a journalist, and said he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raise prices on imports in response to the tariffs he plans to impose because it could change buyer behavior.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with NBC's Kristen Welker, the host of \"Meet the Press,\" Mr. Trump pushed back on reports that some in his circle had encouraged him to fire Michael Waltz, the national security adviser who was at the center of the group chat.\n\nMr. Waltz had seemingly inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to a sensitive group chat on Signal, a commercial messaging app, ahead of U.S. strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi militia in Yemen on March 15.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Saturday that Mr. Trump had spent much of the week consulting with aides about whether he should fire Mr. Waltz amid mounting fallout from the episode.\n\nBut Mr. Trump told Ms. Welker that he still had confidence in Mr. Waltz and in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and he continued to downplay the seriousness of the incident. \"I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\" he said.\n\nMr. Trump also discussed the 25 percent tariff he has promised to impose starting Thursday on imported cars and auto parts, saying that he was not concerned that automakers could raise prices as a result. Experts have insisted the levies will increase prices by thousands of dollars .\n\n\"I couldn't care less,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are going to buy American-made cars. We have plenty.\"\n\nNearly half of all vehicles sold in the United States are imported, as are almost 60 percent of the parts used in vehicles that are assembled in the country.\n\nMr. Trump denied a report that he warned auto executives not to raise prices when discussing the tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump also discussed Greenland, a day after Vice President JD Vance visited an American military base on the island. Mr. Trump reiterated that he would not rule out using force to annex Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, but indicated that he thought he could make a deal to take it instead.\n\nWhen asked what message he believed such a takeover would send to the rest of the world, including Russia, Mr. Trump said, \"I don't really think about that; I don't really care.\"\n\nErica L.

The remarks, to the NBC News host Kristen Welker, were the most serious treatment he has given an idea he has mused about previously.

Read more ›\n\nYan Zhuang\n\nThe United States will not take control of Greenland, the island's new prime minister said on Sunday in response to President Trump's latest assertion that he wants to annex the territory.\n\n\"President Trump says that the United States 'will get Greenland,'\" Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who was sworn in on Friday, said on social media . \"Let me be clear: The United States will not get it. We do not belong to anyone else. We decide our own future.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Trump had told NBC News: \"We'll get Greenland. Yeah, 100 percent.\"\n\nIn an interview with the network, Mr. Trump said he \"absolutely\" had had real conversations about annexing the icebound island, a semiautonomous territory that has been connected to Denmark for more than 300 years.\n\nWhile there was a \"good possibility that we could do it without military force,\" Mr. Trump added, \"I don't take anything off the table.\"\n\nMr. Trump's escalating talk of seizing Greenland reflects an expansionist mind-set in his second term. His administration has also threatened to annex Canada and the Panama Canal.\n\nMr. Nielsen, who at 33 is Greenland's youngest prime minister, was sworn in on the same day that an American delegation led by Vice President JD Vance arrived on the island. The territory's political leaders had seen the trip as an aggressive escalation of Mr. Trump's threats to seize the territory. Some officials complained about the timing of the visit, pointing out that it came just after Greenland held parliamentary elections .\n\nMr. Vance took a softer tone on his trip than Mr. Trump, saying that the United States would respect Greenland's right to self-determination and that using military force - which Mr. Trump has refused to rule out - would not be necessary.\n\nBut the island's government had not invited Mr. Vance or the others in his group, including his wife. The U.S. national security adviser and the energy secretary were also on the trip. And Greenlanders resisted his overtures when he arrived.\n\nThe U.S. delegation's itinerary changed after an earlier announcement was met with a backlash . Initially, Ms. Vance, who had been expected to visit without the vice president, had planned to attend a dog sledding race in southern Greenland. But the organizers of the race made clear they had not invited her. And the outgoing prime minister, Mute B. Egede, said in an indignant statement that there would be no meetings between American and Greenlandic officials.\n\nProtests had been planned in Nuuk, the capital, where Ms. Vance was originally scheduled to visit, before that part of the trip was scrapped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheodore Schleifer\n\nReporting from Green Bay, Wis.\n\ntranscript\n\nLet me first hand out two $1 million checks in appreciation. Thank you. All right. All right. What's happening on Tuesday is a vote for the - which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives. That is why it is so, so significant. And whichever party controls the House, it, to a significant degree, it controls the country, which then steers the course of Western civilization. Thank you, guys. Thank you. \"Not for sale.\" \"Democracy.\" \"Not for sale.\" \"The Supreme Court.\" \"Not for sale.\" The reason I'm here today is mostly for my kids. I don't want them to grow up in a world where billionaires make decisions for people. \"Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Elon Musk has got to go.\" It's just so blatant that he's buying votes. That - It scares me.\n\nHe brought a billionaire friend, $1 million checks and a Packers cheesehead hat. A pastor prayed for him. A superfan begged him for a follow on X.\n\nElon Musk was the star of a 2,000-person rally on Sunday night in Wisconsin - ostensibly for the conservative candidate in a closely watched state judicial race - just 36 hours before polls open on Election Day. Of course he was.\n\nThe billionaire Mr. Musk looked very much like a candidate at this rally, putting himself front and center in the final stretch of an election pitting two rivals against each other, neither of them named Elon Musk: Brad Schimel, the conservative in the race, and Susan Crawford, the liberal.\n\nThe closing moments of campaigns are highly choreographed. Mr. Musk's visit to support Judge Schimel on the eve of the election was voluntary - Judge Schimel did not even attend the event. Mr. Musk appeared comfortable making himself the face of those closing arguments, and living with the results.\n\nNo one forced Mr. Musk to visit the state, obviously. Despite entreaties from Wisconsin Republicans, President Trump declined to make a similar trip, perhaps sensing that the race is one conservatives are likelier to lose than to win, and that the most prominent booster could get tagged with blame.\n\nFormer Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was among those hoping for a Trump visit. He said in an interview that he thought Mr. Musk was insulated to some extent from the politics of credit and finger-pointing.\n\n\"He doesn't care,\" Mr. Walker said. \"It's not like all these consultants on either side who don't want to be pegged as losers.\"\n\nTo hear Mr. Musk tell it, the stakes call for any and all interventions.\n\nWeeks ago, Mr. Musk was only sporadically supportive of Judge Schimel, but his remarks about the race have turned existential. Mr. Musk and allied groups have spent over $20 million to support him, and he framed Tuesday's election in nothing less than apocalyptic terms.\n\n\"What's happening on Tuesday is a vote for which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives - that is why it is so significant,\" Mr. Musk said, referring to the key role that the court could play in congressional redistricting. \"And whichever party controls the House to a significant degree controls the country, which then steers the course of Western civilization. I feel like this is one of those things that may not seem that it's going to affect the entire destiny of humanity, but I think it will.\"\n\nAt a highly produced town hall in Green Bay, already sporting more Packers paraphernalia than normal ahead of the city's hosting of the N.F.L. draft next month, Mr. Musk pushed voter turnout. Republicans believe the key to victory revolves around turning out what Mr. Walker said were about 200,000 Trump voters who are unlikely to vote in an off-month and off-year election. Mr. Musk, despite any anger he stirs up among liberals, is popular among conservatives.\n\nSome in the Green Bay crowd wore Musk paraphernalia and said they wanted an up-close look at someone they had followed for over a decade. \"I'm here for Musk,\" said Michael Labarbera, a 25-year-old who installs solar panels, in a DOGE hat he bought online. John Rosner, a retiree, sported a different Musk hat, bearing the Boring Company name, and said he was here \"basically to meet Elon,\" calling this moment \"the closest I'll ever get to him.\"\n\nRobert Cool, an 81-year-old retiree who was seated in an empty row to the side of the auditorium as he nursed an injury from a fall, said he had decided to make Mr. Musk's event the first political rally he had attended in his life. A Trump rally, he said, \"wasn't as precise.\"\n\n\"I wasn't needed; this one, I felt, I need to be here,\" said Mr. Cool, who has been bothered by the attacks on Tesla, which Mr. Musk himself complained about Sunday. \"I support Musk more than I have anyone else in politics.\"\n\nMr. Musk is known for his belief in himself, and he plainly enjoys the encounters with voters who believe in him. To those in attendance, he is a hero even more so than the last time Mr. Musk was on a similar rock-star tour, in Pennsylvania all of five months ago.\n\nThis is the flip side to the blame game. Should Judge Schimel win, Mr. Musk's activity will surely be given a tremendous amount of credit.\n\nOther Republican groups that might be expected to spend money to support the conservative candidate kept to the sidelines. Mr. Musk's super PAC has waged an ambitious ground game , and a nonprofit previously backed by Mr. Musk spent millions of dollars on television ads that it claims helped Mr. Schimel close the gap. Mr. Musk's defenders like Mr. Walker believe that this race was made a winnable race only thanks to Mr. Musk's spending.\n\nMr. Musk has also brought publicity. A million-dollar sweepstakes for signing a petition - and, for 12 hours, a questionable plan to open the sweepstakes only to Wisconsin residents who had already voted - broke through the saturation of the news cycle in this state. (Just before the rally began, the state's Supreme Court declined to halt the sweepstakes.)\n\nAnd so, as he did in Pennsylvania during the general election last year, Mr. Musk on Sunday brought out oversize checks to hand out to two winners. He trotted out one of his closest friends, Antonio Gracias , to deliver a presentation on what Mr. Gracias called \"outrageous\" fraud in Social Security. And that was all after he took the stage donning a foam cheesehead hat before signing it and tossing it into the crowd.\n\nThe showman does all this even as he concedes that Judge Schimel may very well lose. As Mr. Musk wrapped up his remarks before beginning an extensive question-and-answer session, headgear was once again top of mind.\n\n\"We've got to pull a rabbit out of the hat - next level,\" he said, retelling Judge Schimel's standing in betting prediction markets. \"We actually have to have a steady stream of rabbits out of the hat, like it's an arc of rabbits flying through the air, and then landing in a voting booth.\"\n\nReid Epstein\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, rejected a request from the state's attorney general, Josh Kaul, to block Elon Musk from giving out million-dollar checks to Wisconsinites who signed his petition ahead of Tuesday's election for a pivotal seat on the court. The decision came minutes before a rally with Musk was scheduled to begin Sunday night in Green Bay.\n\nErica L. Green\n\nPresident Trump, who today also threatened to impose \"secondary tariffs\" on Russian oil because he was angry that President Vladimir V. Putin appeared to be thwarting cease-fire negotiations with Ukraine, said there was a \"psychological deadline\" for Russia to agree to a deal. Trump also accused Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, of trying to back out of the deal that would grant the United States a share of its revenues from mining rare earth metals. \"If he does that,\" Trump said, \"he's got some problems, big, big problems.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErica L. Green\n\nSpeaking with reporters aboard Air Force One tonight, President Trump attempted to deflect questions about his statements earlier today that he was open to seeking a constitutionally prohibited third term in office. He kept saying that he didn't want to talk about it, but reiterated that many people have asked him to, and referenced his popularity. When asked if that meant he would not leave office in January 2029, Trump said: \"I'm not looking at that.\"\n\nLivia Albeck-Ripka\n\nThe headquarters of the Republican Party of New Mexico in Albuquerque was damaged early Sunday morning in what the party described as a \"deliberate act of arson.\"\n\nAlbuquerque Fire Rescue confirmed that it had been dispatched to the party's headquarters just before 6 a.m. for a report of a structure fire, which was brought under control within five minutes. No injuries to civilians or firefighters were reported.\n\nThe fire burned the entryway of the headquarters and left smoke damage throughout the building, Lt. Jason Fejer, a spokesman for the fire department, said on Sunday.\n\nHe confirmed that the department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives were investigating the fire as an act of arson.\n\nA spokeswoman for the F.B.I. confirmed that it was investigating but said she could not provide further details because the investigation was ongoing.\n\nThe A.T.F. said on Monday that it was conducting an investigation and had \"recovered incendiary materials at the scene.\" It said that it was not able to provide additional details because the investigation was ongoing.\n\nThe Albuquerque Police Department confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating but did not provide any further information, including whether arrests had been made.\n\nIn a statement, the Republican Party of New Mexico said the fire was \"not an isolated incident\" and was accompanied by the spray-painted letters \"ICE=KKK.\"\n\nIn recent months, ICE, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has deployed agents across the country to carry out what the Trump administration has characterized as a new and more aggressive effort to target illegal immigration and deliver on a key campaign pledge to carry out mass deportations.\n\nThe Democratic Party of New Mexico said on Sunday that it condemned \"any vandalism at the Republican Party of New Mexico headquarters as strongly as possible.\"\n\n\"We firmly maintain that this sort of act has absolutely no place in our democracy, and that peaceful discourse and organization are the only ways to approach political differences in our country,\" the state Democratic Party added. \"We hope whoever is responsible is found and held accountable.\"\n\nAmy Barela, the chairwoman of the Republican Party of New Mexico, said on Sunday that the alarm system at the party's headquarters had gone off around 1 a.m., about four hours before the fire started.\n\nThere had been a separate bomb threat and other acts of vandalism at the headquarters in recent years, she said.\n\nA former Republican candidate for the New Mexico House of Representatives this month was found guilty of hiring people to shoot at the homes of Democratic officials in Albuquerque in 2022 and 2023.\n\n\"We completely condemn violence,\" Ms. Barela said. \"It doesn't matter where it's coming from.\"\n\nThe party was \"deeply relieved that no one was harmed in what could have been a tragic and deadly attack,\" she said.\n\nTalya Minsberg\n\nPresident Trump has said that \"tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented.\" For someone who once called himself a \" tariff man,\" tariffs are the solutions to many economic problems .\n\nHe has argued that imposing tariffs would protect American factories, spur manufacturing, create new jobs and bend uncooperative governments to his will. Since his inauguration, while imposing and then suspending and then imposing tariffs again, Mr. Trump has upended the global trading system .\n\nBut over that time Mr. Trump has also begun conceding that tariffs could cause financial discomfort for Americans. That possibility came up in stark terms in an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\" from Saturday, when Mr. Trump said that he \"couldn't care less\" about the prospect of higher car prices.\n\nThe president repeated the sentiment twice when asked about the 25 percent tariffs on imported cars and auto parts that he has promised will go into effect on Thursday. He told the NBC News host Kristen Welker that the tariffs were permanent, and that he would encourage auto companies and their suppliers to move to the United States.\n\nIn one exchange, Ms. Welker asked Mr. Trump if he was at all concerned with the effect of tariffs on car prices, which experts have said could go up by thousands of dollars . \"No, I couldn't care less,\" he said, \"because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they're going to buy American cars.\"\n\nAfter the interview, an aide to the president told NBC that Mr. Trump was referring to the increase in foreign car prices.\n\nWhile the White House sought to emphasize foreign-made vehicles, the tariffs will affect American companies like Ford Motor and General Motors, which build many of their vehicles in Canada and Mexico. Nearly half of the vehicles sold in the United States are imported, according to S&P Global Mobility data , and almost 60 percent of auto parts in cars assembled in the country.\n\nA study by the Yale Budget Lab , a nonpartisan research center, forecast that tariffs would cause vehicle prices to increase by an average of 13.5 percent - an additional $6,400 to the price of an average new 2024 car.\n\nOn Sunday, Shawn Fain, the president of the United Automobile Workers union, said that the tariffs were indeed a \"motivator\" for carmakers to bring jobs back to the United States. But, he said on CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" they were not an \"end-all solution\" to help American auto workers. If jobs are being brought back to the United States, Mr. Fain said, they need to be \"good paying union jobs that set standards.\"\n\nPeter Navarro, a senior trade adviser to Mr. Trump, defended the tariffs and said they would raise about $100 billion, which would translate to tax credits for people who buy American cars. He, too, told Americans not to worry about the effects of the tariffs.\n\nInstead, he said on Sunday, they should \"trust in Trump.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStephen Castle\n\nPresident Trump and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, spoke by phone Sunday on economic matters as well as the war in Ukraine, according to a summary released by Downing Street. The leaders discussed \"the productive negotiations between their respective teams on a UK-US economic prosperity deal, agreeing that these will continue at pace this week,\" according to the summary.\n\nDevlin Barrett and Maggie Haberman\n\nDevlin Barrett reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.\n\nTwo longtime career prosecutors have been suddenly fired by the White House, in what current and former Justice Department officials called an unusual and alarming exercise of presidential power.\n\nIn recent days, the prosecutors, in Los Angeles and Memphis, were dismissed abruptly, notified by a terse one-sentence email stating no reason for the move other than that it was on behalf of the president himself.\n\nThe ousters reflected a more aggressive effort by the White House to reach deep inside U.S. attorney offices across the country in a stark departure from decades of practice. While it is commonplace and accepted for senior political appointees at the Justice Department to change from administration to administration, no department veteran could recall any similar removal of assistant U.S. attorneys.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.\n\nAsked about the ousters and whether others had been let go in a similar fashion, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said, \"The White House, in coordination with the Department of Justice, has dismissed more than 50 U.S. attorneys and deputies in the past few weeks.\"\n\nShe added, \"The American people deserve a judicial branch full of honest arbiters of the law who want to protect democracy, not subvert it,\" offering no explanation for how either of the two fired prosecutors might have done that. Prosecutors are part of the executive, not judicial, branch of government.\n\nDuring his campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to drastically reshape the ranks of career Justice Department officials, aggrieved by the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia in his first term and the four criminal indictments between his presidencies.\n\nHis allies and advisers have embraced the \"unitary executive theory,\" by which, its supporters argue, the president has sole control of the executive branch. His supporters have spoken openly about seizing pockets of independence in the executive branch. The Justice Department has a post-Watergate tradition of independence, buttressed by civil service laws that for many decades have protected career employees from summary dismissal by political leaders.\n\nAlready, the new administration has aggressively sought to remove the upper level of career lawyers at the Justice Department's headquarters. Some of those firings may end up the subject of lawsuits, but even those dismissals were carried out by senior department officials, albeit Trump appointees.\n\nMr. Trump's team has been screening people across the government, asking a series of questions that appear aimed at testing loyalty to the president and his worldview, including his false claim that he won the 2020 election.\n\nThe two prosecutors had both worked for many years as career officials inside the Justice Department.\n\nOne of the prosecutors, Adam Schleifer, was sitting at his computer Friday morning in Los Angeles, working on a case against Andrew Wiederhorn, the founder of Fatburger, according to two people familiar with the events who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Mr. Wiederhorn is fighting charges of wire fraud and other crimes related to his company.\n\nWhile he was writing, he received an email from a White House official, Saurabh Sharma, saying that he had been terminated, one of the people said. No reason was cited.\n\nShocked and confused by the message, Mr. Schleifer asked supervisors if the email was some kind of hoax, the people said. He quickly discovered his work phone had been reset and he could no longer use office devices.\n\nMr. Schleifer, who worked in the corporate and securities fraud strike force, had spent years working on the Fatburger fraud case. Given that the case has drawn headlines recently and that Mr. Wiederhorn has donated to political action committees supporting Mr. Trump, his colleagues suspected that may have played a role in his dismissal.\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign cycle, Mr. Schleifer ran as a Democrat for Congress in New York. In that period, he occasionally took to social media to accuse Mr. Trump of denigrating the rule of law.\n\nStill, he returned to the Justice Department at the tail end of the first Trump administration, just before Mr. Trump left office. But those social media posts were amplified by allies of the Trump White House last week, as Mr. Schleifer found himself dismissed.\n\nExactly one hour before he received the termination email, the far-right influencer Laura Loomer posted on social media about Mr. Schleifer, calling him a \"Biden holdover\" and referring to a five-year-old message of his in which he praised Adam B. Schiff, now a Democratic senator of California, and criticized Mr. Trump.\n\nMany of Mr. Schleifer's colleagues were fearful about what his dismissal signaled for the tradition not just of Justice Department independence, but of the independence of individual U.S. attorney offices, the two people said.\n\nCurrent and former colleagues described Mr. Schleifer as an accomplished and fair prosecutor.\n\n\"Adam is a very smart, hard-working, impartial prosecutor. He is very dedicated to the job,\" said Consuelo S. Woodhead, a retired federal prosecutor. \"The man is honest. He is the kind of prosecutor one would want in a U.S. attorney's office.\"\n\nA day before Mr. Schleifer's firing, a career attorney in Memphis, Reagan Fondren, received a similar email, saying that she had been terminated, according to a person familiar with events in her office, speaking on the condition of anonymity to publicly discuss the matter. Like Mr. Schleifer, she also was not given a reason. At the time, Ms. Fondren had been serving as the acting U.S. attorney, a situation that is not unusual in the early days of a new presidential administration.\n\nMr. Schleifer's dismissal was earlier reported by The Los Angeles Times and Ms. Fondren's by the Daily Memphian.\n\nWhile it is not unusual for acting U.S. attorneys to lose that position once a new administration selects a permanent successor, a career official like Ms. Fondren would typically return to her regular prosecutor position. In this instance, however, she was fired by the White House.\n\nTalya Minsberg\n\nFew Democrats have responded to President Trump's assertion this morning that he is \"not joking\" about the possibility of a third term , which he has previously treated more like a humorous aside when he repeatedly mused about it . Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, was one of the few to respond, writing in a social media post, \"this is what dictators do.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAishvarya Kavi\n\nAbout 200 members of the Institute of Peace's staff, a majority of the government-funded nonprofit's U.S.-based employees, were fired on Friday night, according to current and former workers. The firings came in mass late-night notices. Two top executives, including one who participated in meetings with DOGE staff in an attempt to negotiate the future of the independent agency, were fired on Saturday night.\n\nErica L. Green\n\nPresident Trump did not rule out seeking a third term in office on Sunday, telling NBC News that he was \"not joking\" about the possibility and suggesting there were \"methods\" to circumvent the two-term limit laid out in the Constitution.\n\nMr. Trump told the \"Meet the Press\" host Kristen Welker that \"a lot of people\" wanted him to serve a third term, according to a transcript of the interview provided by the network.\n\n\"A lot of people want me to do it,\" he said. \"But we have - my thinking is, we have a long way to go. I'm focused on the current.\"\n\nAny attempt to seek a third term would run afoul of the 22nd Amendment , which begins, \"No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice.\"\n\nOn Sunday, after the release of the interview, the White House reiterated Mr. Trump's point that he was focused on his current term, and added that it was \"far too early to think about\" the idea.\n\n\"Americans overwhelmingly approve and support President Trump and his America First policies,\" Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, said in a statement. He added that Mr. Trump was focused on \"undoing all the hurt\" done by the Biden administration and \"Making America Great Again.\"\n\nMr. Trump has often mused about the idea of a third term, particularly in rallies and speeches that have delighted his supporters, though he has often treated it more as a humorous aside. The interview was the first time that Mr. Trump indicated that he was seriously considering the idea. Already he has likened himself to a king , shown an affinity for autocratic leaders and displayed governance tactics constitutional experts and historians have compared to authoritarianism .\n\nMr. Trump's allies have amplified the idea he could serve another term. Three days after Mr. Trump was sworn in for the second time, Representative Andy Ogles of Tennessee proposed an amendment to the Constitution that would make Mr. Trump eligible for a third term. Such a measure would be extraordinarily difficult: Constitutional amendments require approval by a two-thirds vote of Congress and then the ratification of three-fourths of the states.\n\nDemocrats in Congress, concerned about the possibility of such legislation, have introduced a resolution to prevent loopholes to the two-term limit.\n\nIn the interview, Ms. Welker noted that she had heard him joke about serving a third term a number of times. Mr. Trump made it clear he considered it a real possibility.\n\n\"No, no I'm not joking,\" he said. \"I'm not joking.\"\n\nMs. Welker asked Mr. Trump whether he had been presented with plans, and he said that he had not - but added that there were \"methods which you could do it.\"\n\nMs. Welker suggested one possibility: having Vice President JD Vance at the top of the ticket in 2028, only to pass the office on to Mr. Trump after winning. Mr. Trump acknowledged \"that's one\" way it could happen.\n\n\"But there are others too,\" he said. \"There are others.\" Mr. Trump declined to say what those could be.\n\nDerek T. Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame and a scholar in election law, said there has been a dissenting view about the provision of the 22nd Amendment - which focuses on being \"elected\" president without addressing the idea of ascending to the office. However, he said, such a route would be complicated by the 12th Amendment.\n\nMr. Muller pointed out that the 12th Amendment states that \"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States.\"\n\nMr. Muller said he very much doubted that would provide a path to a third term for Mr. Trump.\n\n\"You'd have to have so many pieces fall into place for this even to be practically viable, on top of this complicated legal theory,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking with reporters aboard Air Force One later on Sunday, Mr. Trump attempted to deflect questions about his earlier statements that he was open to seeking a third term. He repeatedly said that he didn't want to talk about it, but reiterated that many people have asked him to.\n\nWhen asked if that meant he would not leave office in January 2029, Mr. Trump said: \"I'm not looking at that.\"\n\nErica L. Green\n\nIn a newly released excerpt of President Trump's interview with NBC News on Sunday morning, the president said he was \"not joking\" about potentially seeking a third term, which is prohibited by the 22nd Amendment but he has mused about anyway. Trump told the \"Meet the Press\" host Kristen Welker that \"a lot of people\" wanted him to do it, but he was \"focused on the current.\" When asked whether he had been presented with any potential plans that would allow him to serve a third term, Trump said he had not, but there were \"methods\" - although it was \"far too early to think about it.\"\n\nErica L. Green\n\nOne possible method, Trump acknowledged during the interview, was Vice President JD Vance running for the office, then passing the baton to him, according to the transcript.\n\nErica L. Green\n\nAllies of Trump have continued to amplify the idea that he stay in office beyond a second term, and three days after Trump was sworn in for the second time, Representative Andy Ogles of Tennessee proposed an amendment to the Constitution that would allow the president to do so. Passing such a measure would be extraordinarily difficult, requiring approval by a two-thirds vote of Congress and ratification of three-fourths of the states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErica L. Green\n\nPresident Trump's senior trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday\" that American consumers did not need to worry about the effects of the impending tariffs, saying that at other points throughout history they didn't cause inflation and recessions, including during Trump's first term. \"We got price stability, and we got prosperity, and we're going to get that again,\" he said.\n\nErica L. Green\n\nNavarro said that the U.S. auto tariffs would raise about $100 billion, which would translate to tax credits for people who buy American cars, and other tariffs would raise $600 billion per year that would allow for a tax cut on middle-class and blue-collar Americans. Asked what the administration would say to Americans who voted for Trump to make the economy better but are bracing for short-term disruptions that even the president has acknowledged, Navarro said: \"Trust in Trump.\"\n\nErica L. Green\n\nPresident Trump leveled his strongest criticism to date against President Vladimir V. Putin on Sunday, threatening to impose \"secondary tariffs\" on Russia's oil if the country thwarted negotiations on a cease-fire deal with Ukraine that would stop the fighting.\n\nThe comments, relayed on \"Meet the Press\" by the show's host, Kristen Welker, reflected a conversation she said she had hours earlier with Mr. Trump, in which he signaled growing impatience with the negotiations. Mr. Trump told her that tariffs of 25 to 50 percent on Russian oil could be imposed at \"any moment\" and that he planned to speak with his Russian counterpart this week.\n\n\"If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault - which it might not be - but if I think it was Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump has previously referred to secondary tariffs as levies on imports from countries that purchase products from a nation he's targeted in his foreign policy. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe comments were notable given the steps that Mr. Trump has taken to align himself with Mr. Putin, despite the United States' support for Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion more than three years ago. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has declined to acknowledge that it was Russia who started the war, falsely declared President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine a \"dictator,\" but not Mr. Putin, and accused Mr. Zelensky of not wanting peace.\n\nMr. Trump's remarks also reflected his increasing promise to use tariffs to compel countries to bend to his domestic and foreign policy goals. In the same phone call, he said he would consider secondary tariffs on Iran if it did not reach a deal with the United States to ensure it did not develop a nuclear weapon, Ms. Welker said.\n\nMr. Trump told Ms. Welker that he was \"very angry, pissed off\" at Mr. Putin for questioning the credibility of Mr. Zelensky, and for discussing the prospect of new leadership in that country. Mr. Trump suggested that such comments could set negotiations back, and that they were \"not going in the right location.\"\n\n\"New leadership means you're not going to have a deal for a long time, right?\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have agreed to a limited truce , but that has fallen short of the complete pause in combat that Trump administration officials have sought, with Ukraine's support. The limited cease-fire remains tenuous as Russia seeks more concessions and Ukraine has expressed doubt that a truce would be upheld.\n\nOn negotiations about Iran's nuclear capabilities, Mr. Trump said officials from both countries were \"talking,\" according to NBC's account of Ms. Welker's call with the president, although he raised the prospect of military action if economic and other measures do not succeed.\n\n\"If they don't make a deal,\" Mr. Trump said about Iran, \"there will be bombing. It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Mr. Trump sent the letter to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging direct negotiations with the government in Tehran on a deal to curb the country's advancing nuclear program. The letter said Mr. Trump preferred diplomacy over military action.\n\nMr. Trump's raising of secondary tariffs on oil from Russia and Iran was the latest example of the president's interest in using the prospect of economic pressure on third-party nations.\n\nLast week, he issued an executive order on Monday to crack down on countries that buy Venezuelan oil by imposing tariffs on the goods those nations send into the United States, claiming that Venezuela has \"purposefully and deceitfully\" sent criminals and murderers into America.\n\nMr. Trump called the new levies he threatened on buyers of Venezuelan oil \"secondary tariffs,\" a label that echoed \"secondary sanctions\" - penalties imposed on other countries or parties that trade with nations under sanctions.\n\nSome trade and sanctions experts said existing secondary sanctions associated with countries such as Russia and Iran already were not well enforced, and questioned whether the United States would have the capacity to pull off new tariff-based penalties.\n\nMinho Kim\n\nMike Turner, Republican of Ohio and a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on ABC that the details of the strike against Houthi fighters that were leaked to a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic, through a Signal chat should be classified. He added that the White House claim that no classified information was leaked might be too \"legalistic\" and suggested that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth could have declassified the leaked information after the Signal conversation became available.\n\nMinho Kim\n\n\"Clearly the subject matter that's being discussed - the status of ongoing military operations - should be considered classified information,\" Turner said. \"The individuals that were discussing this information certainly have the ability to declassify the information.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErica L. Green\n\nJeffrey Goldberg, who has been attacked by the Trump administration as it has sought to deal with the fallout from the Signal leak, said that he and The Atlantic, where he is editor in chief, were not going to be intimidated. \"Even if I had those terrible character traits that they ascribed to me, all I did was simply print what they said,\" he said.\n\nErica L. Green\n\nGoldberg said he wished he were not put in the position of having to publish the entire transcript, but did so because the administration accused The Atlantic of lying about the messages. He said journalists operated in the public interest, and said \"the public needs to know\" that the Trump administration officials on the chat \"don't take national security seriously.\"\n\nErica L. Green\n\nGoldberg also spoke to the fact that the administration has downplayed the sensitivity of the material shared on the group chat, saying that details of military strikes were not considered classified information. \"If that's not the most sensitive information, the most secret information in the world, I simply don't know what the meaning of classified or secret or top secret is,\" Goldberg said, adding that he was \"aghast\" as he watched the messages unfold on the Signal app on his phone. He also called Vice President JD Vance's comments in the chat, in which he openly questioned Trump's judgment, \"fraught.\"\n\nErica L. Green\n\nJeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, who revealed that the nation's top national security officials had inadvertently added him to a group chat where they discussed military attack plans, said during an interview on \"Meet the Press\" that the claims made by the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, that he didn't know how the journalist's phone number got onto his phone were not true. \"He's telling everyone that he's never met me or spoken to me - that's simply not true,\" he said. \"I understand why he's doing it, but you know, this has become a somewhat farcical situation.\"\n\nErica L. Green\n\nWelker said that Trump also told her that he was considering imposing secondary tariffs on Iran if it does not agree to a nuclear deal , and threatened that if Tehran didn't make a deal \"there will be bombing, and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.\" This is not the first time Trump has threatened a country with \"secondary tariffs,\" a label that echoed \"secondary sanctions,\" which are penalties imposed on other countries or parties that trade with nations under sanctions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErica L. Green\n\nAt the start of NBC's \"Meet the Press\" show on Sunday, host Kristen Welker relayed a conversation she said she had hours earlier with President Trump, in which he suggested he was prepared to push back strongly against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia if a Ukraine cease-fire deal is not reached. According to Welker, Trump said that he was \"pissed off\" with Putin about the ongoing war in Ukraine, and threatened to impose secondary tariffs on Russia's oil industry if a deal isn't agreed. The comments, if confirmed, would amount to Trump's strongest criticism of Putin, with whom he had recently taken steps to align himself with against Ukraine, America's traditional ally.\n\nErica L. Green\n\nWelker said Trump told her that 25 percent tariffs on Russian oil could be imposed at \"any moment\" and that Trump planned to speak with Putin this week. Welker said Trump told her he was particularly \"angry\" at Putin for attacking the credibility of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, and for discussing the prospect of new leadership in that country. \"If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault, which it might not be, but if I think it's Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on all oil coming out of Russia,\" the president said, according to Welker.\n\nErica L. Green\n\nPresident Trump told NBC News on Saturday that he would not fire anyone involved in a group chat that inadvertently disclosed plans for airstrikes on Yemen to a journalist, and said he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raise prices on imports in response to the tariffs he plans to impose because it could change buyer behavior.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with NBC's Kristen Welker, the host of \"Meet the Press,\" Mr. Trump pushed back on reports that some in his circle had encouraged him to fire Michael Waltz, the national security adviser who was at the center of the group chat.\n\nMr. Waltz had seemingly inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to a sensitive group chat on Signal, a commercial messaging app, ahead of U.S. strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthi militia in Yemen on March 15.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Saturday that Mr. Trump had spent much of the week consulting with aides about whether he should fire Mr. Waltz amid mounting fallout from the episode.\n\nBut Mr. Trump told Ms. Welker that he still had confidence in Mr. Waltz and in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and he continued to downplay the seriousness of the incident. \"I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\" he said.\n\nMr. Trump also discussed the 25 percent tariff he has promised to impose starting Thursday on imported cars and auto parts, saying that he was not concerned that automakers could raise prices as a result. Experts have insisted the levies will increase prices by thousands of dollars .\n\n\"I couldn't care less,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are going to buy American-made cars. We have plenty.\"\n\nNearly half of all vehicles sold in the United States are imported, as are almost 60 percent of the parts used in vehicles that are assembled in the country.\n\nMr. Trump denied a report that he warned auto executives not to raise prices when discussing the tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump also discussed Greenland, a day after Vice President JD Vance visited an American military base on the island. Mr. Trump reiterated that he would not rule out using force to annex Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, but indicated that he thought he could make a deal to take it instead.\n\nWhen asked what message he believed such a takeover would send to the rest of the world, including Russia, Mr. Trump said, \"I don't really think about that; I don't really care.\"\n\nAmanda E. Newman\n\nThe locations were different, but the scenes were the same: Crowds of people amassed outside of Tesla dealerships across the country, carrying signs and using megaphones, united in their anger at Elon Musk.\n\nSince President Trump took office in January, Mr. Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and the head of the cost-cutting initiative known as the Department of Government Efficiency, has led the elimination of thousands of federal jobs and overseen the gutting of several government agencies. The protests on Saturday were part of the so-called Tesla Takedown movement, a coordinated effort to push back against the actions by Mr. Musk, who is the world's richest man, and encourage people to stop buying Tesla vehicles or to sell the ones they already own.\n\nThe backlash against Mr. Musk's political activities has turned his company into a target. The automaker's stock has tumbled in recent weeks, and protesters have defaced or destroyed Tesla vehicles and damaged company facilities in a handful of places across the country.\n\nPam Bondi, the attorney general, has labeled such episodes acts of \"domestic terrorism\" directed at Mr. Musk, and President Trump has threatened severe punishments, suggesting on social media that anyone convicted of damaging or destroying Tesla vehicles could be sent to prison in El Salvador. The Justice Department said last week that three people accused of trying to torch Tesla products had been arrested and charged with crimes that could lead to years in prison.\n\nOrganizers of Saturday's demonstrations had urged participants to protest peacefully. Gatherings were held across the United States and in parts of Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTim Balk\n\nHouse Republicans have been told by their party's leadership to avoid town halls after Democrats and others began to seize on the events to vent frustration with the Trump administration.\n\nRepresentative Victoria Spartz, a third-term Republican from suburban Indianapolis, decided not to heed the warning this weekend - and was met with fury over cuts to the federal government's services and work force.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, Ms. Spartz hosted gatherings with constituents. And each day, she found herself in hostile territory.\n\nShe was booed, jeered and scolded over the Signal scandal at the Defense Department (she acknowledged that the Trump administration needed to do a \"better job\"), and the Homeland Security Department's efforts to deport immigrants without due process (she declared that unauthorized immigrants were entitled to \"no due process\"). And she was accused of standing idly by as Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency steered cuts to government services (she said the Trump administration was trying to stop fraud).\n\nShe faced chants of \"Do your job!\" At times, the events turned into shouting matches. Some of the exchanges have circulated widely on social media.\n\n\"You don't have to scream,\" she pleaded at a crowded town hall in Westfield, Ind., on Friday night. The event lasted for two interruption-filled hours.\n\n\"I understand there's frustration,\" she said at another point, as she tried to defend Mr. Musk and DOGE.\n\nOne person in the crowd told her she did not understand her role as an elected representative. \"I understand my role very well,\" she said. \"That's why I have these town halls.\"\n\nThe crowd howled when she said she would not call for the resignation of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who shared sensitive U.S. military plans on a Signal chat, apparently unaware that the editor in chief of The Atlantic had been inadvertently added.\n\nMs. Spartz, who was born in Soviet Ukraine, also faced questions about her position on U.S. aid for Ukraine. She said that she did not support the United States sending a \"blank check to anyone\" but that \"Russia has been allowed to get away with too much.\"\n\nOutside the town hall on Friday, protesters who could not get inside chanted, \"This is what democracy looks like.\" Inside, Ms. Spartz threatened to stop hosting town halls.\n\nBut on Saturday, she was back at another one, in Muncie, Ind., facing down more angry voters.\n\n\"She's not fulfilling her congressional duties and upholding the separation of powers,\" said Josh Lowry, the chair of the Hamilton County Democrats, who led protests outside the town hall on Friday. \"She's selling out Hoosiers.\"\n\nMr. Lowry said Republicans like Ms. Spartz had won elections in November by focusing on the cost of living, but have now instead joined in Mr. Trump's campaign of \"retribution.\"\n\n\"They're all worried about Trump endorsing an opponent\" in a Republican primary election, Mr. Lowry said.\n\nRepublicans are also under pressure to hold onto their razor-thin majority in the House. This week, Mr. Trump announced that Representative Elise Stefanik of New York was withdrawing her bid to become the U.N. ambassador. The announcement highlighted worries among Mr. Trump and his party about their ability to win what should be safe Republican seats as Democrats have shown strength in special elections this year.\n\nOn Saturday, Ms. Spartz thanked everyone who had attended her town halls, but claimed that she had been targeted by people on the far left. She said that her staff members had been spat at and that a Trump supporter was punched outside the town hall on Saturday.\n\n\"The radical left is organizing to silence the truth at town halls, but we cannot let it happen,\" she said in a statement. \"It's not pleasant, but I can handle their aggressive behavior.\"\n\nChristine Kassebnia, 62, a self-described swing voter who waited for more than two hours to get into the town hall on Friday, bristled at the suggestion that Ms. Spartz's critics at the events were on the far left.\n\n\"These were not far-anything,\" she said. \"They were just people. And they're upset.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Grynbaum\n\nNBCUniversal has appointed Rebecca Blumenstein, a deputy managing editor at The New York Times, as the president of editorial for NBC News, as part of a far-reaching reorganization of the division.\n\nMs. Blumenstein, 56, has overseen The Times's recruiting efforts and operations as part of the newsroom's top management team and advised the paper's publisher, A.G. Sulzberger. At NBC, she will inherit many of the responsibilities of Noah Oppenheim, who has been president of NBC News since 2017 . He has struck a production deal with NBCUniversal, working on film and TV projects for the company.\n\nWith the appointment, Cesar Conde, who oversees NBCUniversal's news division, is turning over major parts of his marquee news brand to a highly decorated print and digital journalist, but one with little experience in television.\n\nMs. Blumenstein, a Michigan native, is a former foreign correspondent who served as deputy editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal before joining the senior leadership of The Times in 2017 . She will take charge of the network's sprawling reporting operation as it seeks to expand its digital audience amid a long-term decline in broadcast TV viewership.\n\nIn a reorganization led by Mr. Conde, who as chairman of NBCUniversal News Group also runs CNBC and MSNBC, Ms. Blumenstein will oversee household-brand shows like \"Meet the Press\" and \"Dateline.\"\n\nSome significant parts of NBC News overseen by Mr. Oppenheim will now report directly to Mr. Conde, including the network's flagship program, \"NBC Nightly News,\" and the lucrative \"Today\" franchise of morning programming. The cable channels MSNBC and CNBC do not fall under Mr. Oppenheim's portfolio and will continue to be led by their own presidents.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "NBC News Chief Denies Obstructing Ronan Farrow Story, Says It Was \"Not Ready for Air\"\n\nThe chairman of NBC News, Andrew Lack, pushed back Monday against reports last week that questioned whether the network gave in to pressure when it rejected Ronan Farrow's story on Harvey Weinstein's sexual misconduct. In a memo to NBC News employees Monday evening , Lack clearly explained why the news network felt it could not air the allegations against Weinstein, insisting Farrow did not have the goods. Attached to the statement was a long document detailing the reporting process .\n\n\"We spent eight months pursuing the story but at the end of that time, NBC News-like many others before us-still did not have a single victim or witness willing to go on the record,\" Lack said to staffers in the memo. Lack sent the memo shortly after a producer who worked with Farrow told the New York Times that NBC News moved to kill the story, which is what led him to take it to the New Yorker. Separately, the Daily Beast reported that NBC News General Counsel Susan Weiner threatened to \"smear\" Farrow if \"he continued to report on Weinstein.\"\n\nLack, however, insists none of this is accurate. He says that when Farrow objected to NBC News' unwillingness to go forward with the story, the network \"convened an independent group of the most experienced investigative journalists in our organization to review his material with fresh eyes.\" They were all tasked with figuring out what, if anything, could be broadcast. \"But their conclusion was unequivocal,\" Lack wrote, \"this story is not ready for air.\"\n\nLack goes even further, saying it's disingenuous to suggest Farrow merely took the reporting he had done at NBC to the New Yorker. \"Farrow's award-winning New Yorker article about Weinstein-published nearly two months after he left NBC News and five days after The New York Times piece-bore little resemblance to the draft script he produced at NBC News,\" the statement said. While the New Yorker piece cited several victims by name, none of them had been included in the reporting Farrow presented to the higher-ups at NBC News, according to the network.\n\nIn the statement, NBC also detailed the contacts that Weinstein and his representatives had with the network. Although Weinstein and his people did \"repeatedly\" try to contact people at NBC News, none of it had an effect on the reporting. \"They were aggressive and persistent. This is a dynamic NBC News is quite familiar with as a home to investigative journalism and had no impact on the editorial process,\" reads the statement.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "New WSJ/NBC News Poll Puts Biden Lead Over Trump at 11 Points\n\nA new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll out Thursday shows Joe Biden maintaining a double-digit lead in national polling. The survey of registered voters was taken over the weekend, October 9-12, and detected a slight dip in Biden's previous 14-point lead calculated by the same polling outfit last time out. Biden was still able to command a significant advantage, 53 percent to President Donald Trump's 42 percent. A lot has happened over the past several weeks, and the poll manages to encompass much of the tumult-ranging from the first presidential debate (September 29) to a Supreme Court nomination and, of course, Trump's positive Covid-19 test, subsequent bonkers hospitalization, and even more berserk whatever it is you'd call what he's been doing since. With less than three weeks until Election Day, are Americans' opinions about the candidates hardening? It would certainly appear so. The survey also showed an eight-point advantage for Democrats in down ballot Congressional races.\n\nThat's obviously good news for Joe Biden and Democrats, who are embarking upon the scare-the-bejesus out of supporters phase of the campaign in order to avoid a sense complacency and overconfidence. It's hard to imagine a single Democrat having either one of those emotions, but part of campaigning from the front is keeping your support on edge. As such, Biden's campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon took to Twitter to remind Democrats not to believe the hype. The party also turned to its big guns. \"It's going to be close,\" President Barack Obama stressed in a digital video aimed at activating early voters. \"It could come down to a handful of voters just like you. So I'm asking you to bring this thing home. Leave no doubt. Vote early.\"\n\nWant some other deep cut poll trends to keep you up at night? Well, here you go courtesy of the Wall Street Journal's writeup of the poll:\n\nIn addition to the edge on the economy, there were some other positive signals for Mr. Trump. By 12 percentage points, voters view the Republican Party as better suited to handle crime. Voters split nearly evenly on whether they want a president who would confront and challenge the establishment-a hallmark of Mr. Trump's style-or someone who would bring competence and compassion.\n\nPollsters said Mr. Trump's 88% support among Republicans-compared with Mr. Biden's 96% support among Democrats-suggested that the president had room to grow his support in the final weeks before the election. Because the election is based on the electoral map and not the popular vote, the president needs to see gains in only a handful of states.\n\nThen, of course, there's the last ditch GOP strategy of disqualifying as many offending votes as possible.

You shouldn't be sleeping in the first place!\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

The truth looks particularly good on a news anchor, no matter how dashing.\n\nWilliams' problems started with his foggy recollection of whether the helicopter he was traveling in was, or was not, hit by an RPG while he was on assignment covering the war in Iraq in 2003. When it turned out that wasn't-strictly-speaking-\"the truth,\" Williams admitted his error, and ( sort of ) corrected it. Williams gave himself the hook temporarily from his nightly broadcast; NBC promised to investigate.\n\nAfter a days-long (!) investigation , the National Broadcasting Corporation decided Williams should keep his job-but will receive a six-month suspension from the anchor chair without pay. Here's what NBC News President Deborah Turness had to say in a memo about Williams' punishment on Tuesday evening:\n\nWe have decided today to suspend Brian Williams as Managing Editor and Anchor of NBC Nightly News for six months. The suspension will be without pay and is effective immediately.  We let Brian know of our decision earlier today. Lester Holt will continue to substitute Anchor the NBC Nightly News.\n\nOur review, which is being led by Richard Esposito working closely with NBCUniversal General Counsel Kim Harris, is ongoing, but I think it is important to take you through our thought process in coming to this decision.\n\nWhile on Nightly News on Friday, January 30, 2015, Brian misrepresented events which occurred while he was covering the Iraq War in 2003. It then became clear that on other occasions Brian had done the same while telling that story in other venues. This was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in Brian's position.\n\nIn addition, we have concerns about comments that occurred outside NBC News while Brian was talking about his experiences in the field.\n\nAs Managing Editor and Anchor of Nightly News, Brian has a responsibility to be truthful and to uphold the high standards of the news division at all times.\n\nSteve Burke, Pat Fili and I came to this decision together. We felt it would have been wrong to disregard the good work Brian has done and the special relationship he has forged with our viewers over 22 years.  Millions of Americans have turned to him every day, and he has been an important and well-respected part of our organization.\n\nAs I'm sure you understand, this was a very hard decision. Certainly there will be those who disagree.  But we believe this suspension is the appropriate and proportionate action.\n\nThis has been a difficult time. But NBC News is bigger than this moment. You work so hard and dedicate yourselves each and every day to the important work of bringing trusted, credible news to our audience. Because of you, your loyalty, your dedication, NBC News is an organization we can - and should - all be proud of. We will get through this together.\n\nSteve Burke asked me to share the following message.\n\n\"This has been a painful period for all concerned and we appreciate your patience while we gathered the available facts. By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News.  His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate.  Brian's life's work is delivering the news. I know Brian loves his country, NBC News and his colleagues. He deserves a second chance and we are rooting for him.  Brian has shared his deep remorse with me and he is committed to winning back everyone's trust.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Former NBC News Producer Says Network Guilty of \"Massive Breach of Journalistic Integrity\" on Ronan Farrow's Harvey Weinstein Exposé\n\nThe producer who worked with Ronan Farrow on his blockbuster reporting into the alleged sexual misconduct of Hollywood heavyweight Harvey Weinstein told the New York Times that NBC News actively sidelined the story, prompting Farrow to take it to the New Yorker last year to get it published. Producer Rich McHugh, who recently left NBC's investigative unit, called the network's handling of Farrow's reporting, which originated at the network, \"a massive breach of journalistic integrity.\"\n\nFarrow spent months reporting the story, in collaboration with McHugh, for NBC News, but reportedly met resistance within the network as he chased down reporting leads that would implicate the powerful entertainment industry rainmaker in multiple sexual assaults and rapes spanning decades. \"Three days before Ronan and I were going to head to L.A. to interview a woman with a credible rape allegation against Harvey Weinstein, I was ordered to stop, not to interview this woman,\" McHugh told the Times. \"And to stand down on the story altogether.\" McHugh says the order to kill the story came from \"the very highest levels of NBC,\" leading to Farrow seeking permission to take months and months of reporting to the New Yorker. Nearly two months after doing so, the New Yorker published the first of series of stories on Weinstein that were ultimately awarded a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nAround the time of publication, questions swirled about how NBC News let the story slip through its fingers and whether the network had caved to either explicit or implicit pressure to avoid exposing one of entertainment's most powerful men. Farrow hinted as much during an MSNBC interview about the story with Rachel Maddow. \"I think it's fair to say that there was a point in our reporting where I felt there were obstacles to us reporting this externally, and there were obstacles to us reporting this internally,\" McHugh said. \"Externally, I had Weinstein associates calling me repeatedly. I knew that Weinstein was calling NBC executives directly. One time it even happened when we were in the room.\"\n\nNBC News executives dispute McHugh's characterization of how the story was handled, saying even after eight months of reporting, it didn't have sufficient on-the-record testimony for broadcast. \"He was never told to stop in the way he's implying,\" Noah Oppenheim, the president of NBC News, told the Times.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

The outlets had all made the claim after Giuliani's office and home were raided by the FBI earlier this week as part of a criminal probe into his dealings with Ukraine. They were all attributed to anonymous sources.\n\nAll the corrections were pretty similar. \"An earlier version of this article misstated whether Rudolph W.

      "text": "NBC Is Making a Strong Play for CNN's \"Dumbest News Network\" Title Belt\n\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMatt Lauer is getting a lot of heat Thursday-including some anonymous criticism from inside his own company -for his impotent performance at Wednesday night's NBC \"Commander-in-Chief Forum,\" during which he let Donald Trump get away with all manner of lies and nonsense .\n\nLet's consider what else NBC News has contributed to the national discourse lately.\n\n1. It brought back Brian Williams to lead its MSNBC election coverage and has given him his own 11 p.m. show . Perhaps, on his show, Williams will consider interviewing the veterans who say that he still has never told the truth about the 2003 incident in which he claims to have been on board a helicopter that was part of a group of helicopters that were forced to the ground by insurgent fire in Iraq. (Incidentally, if you click that last link, you can see Williams making seemingly false statements about his Iraq story to none other than a credulous, underinformed Matt Lauer.)\n\n2. It renewed its long association with Mark Halperin , America's most proudly asubstantive horse-race journalist , a man who is incapable of considering any issue or event from any perspective other than how it might hypothetically be framed by hack campaign consultants in press releases or attack ads. Here, watch Halperin get a chance to interview Gary Johnson right after the Morning Joe appearance during which Johnson admitted he was unfamiliar with the Syrian city of Aleppo-only to ask Johnson an inane, nonsensical question about whether he felt that it would be fair to respond to the still-largely hypothetical criticism he'd be receiving for the gaffe by arguing that he had been set up by a tricky \"gotcha\" question.\n\n(For the record, it wasn't a gotcha question at all . The question was \"What would you do, if you were elected, about Aleppo,\" and the topic of the city's current plight had been brought up several times on Morning Joe before Johnson's appearance and is a real live issue in this election and in the world.)\n\n3. Its nightly news anchor, Lester Holt, was selected by the Commission on Presidential Debates to moderate the first general-election debate on Sept. 26. As a fan of Dateline , which he also appears on, I have absolutely nothing against Lester Holt. He is an adept TV host. But he is not a political reporter with extensive experience speaking to political candidates or doing politics coverage. He is not someone who is versed in the art of getting the truth out of a politician who is trying not to tell it. Tellingly, Donald Trump likes him :\n\nGOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who is often combative with the media, told radio host Hugh Hewitt in a recent interview that selecting Holt wouldn't be an issue.\n\n\"I think Lester Holt is a good guy,\" Trump said when asked who he thought would be a fair moderator. Trump also told Time magazine earlier this month that \"certain moderators would be unacceptable.\"\n\nIf you're a non-right-wing journalist in 2016 and Donald Trump is a fan of yours , you're probably not being tough enough. And when you hand debates over to amiable hosts who aren't deeply familiar with this year's campaign, you get things like a credulous, uninformed Matt Lauer letting Trump get away with claiming he never supported the Iraq war. (Both the Lauer and Holt selections are particularly frustrating in light of the fact that NBC actually employs a number of more qualified potential moderators, including but not limited to Andrea Mitchell, Chris Matthews, Chuck Todd, Chris Hayes, Rachel Maddow, and Steve Kornacki.)\n\n4. It crumpled against the onslaught of right-wing conspiracy wingnuts who claim that Hillary Clinton is seriously ill and ran a story about her coughing for a few seconds during a rally .\n\nIn summary: Watch out, CNN .\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What the Critical Race Theory Panic Was Really About (and the Data to Prove It)\n\nWhen, this past spring, a succession of stories about communities pushing back, angrily, against the supposed teaching of critical race theory in their school districts began to overtake my social media feeds, I had a hunch that it was a direct result of white fear . But a recent data analysis from NBC News confirms it.\n\nReporters found that the districts hosting some of the most combative debates over diversity and inclusion initiatives-including just teaching about racism-have seen a steady increase in students of color attending their schools. In Gwinnett County, Georgia, where parents have squared off over critical race theory, there has been a 52.4 percent increase in students of color since 1994. And in Loudoun County, Virginia, where the rights of transgender students and teaching racism have become ugly, loud battleground issues, there has been a 29.5 percent increase in that span of time.\n\nIf you've been following how whiteness has evolved since the 2016 election, this isn't surprising . But it is nice to have the numbers to back it up. It reminded one of my colleagues of a similar, equally unsurprising yet very real finding following the Capitol riot. Political scientist Robert Pape, after going through polling and demographic data, discovered that most people who participated in the riots came to D.C. from places where residents were terrified of being replaced by people of color and immigrants. More specifically, as the New York Times put it , \"counties with the most significant declines in the non-Hispanic white population are the most likely to produce insurrectionists.\"\n\n\"If you look back in history, there has always been a series of far-right extremist movements responding to new waves of immigration to the United States or to movements for civil rights by minority groups,\" Pape told the New York Times. \"You see a common pattern in the Capitol insurrectionists. They are mainly middle-class to upper-middle-class whites who are worried that, as social changes occur around them, they will see a decline in their status in the future.\"\n\nSimilarly, in response to NBC's findings on the CRT panic, Stanford University professor Tomás Jiménez said, \"In virtually any community, when there is rapid demographic change you see a backlash.\" (Or as one Black mom told NBC of the pushback in her town, \"Folks like me welcome [diversity], and there are a lot of folks who do not feel that way-I think they feel very threatened.\")\n\nThis is all, of course, part of a much larger and longer pattern. During the Reconstruction era, as Black Americans started to get some rights, domestic terror groups like the Ku Klux Klan, Louisiana's White League, and the Knights of the White Camelia organized in order to stop the progress.* In more recent years, the fear stems back to white replacement theory, or \"the great replacement,\" a racist and delusional ideology devised by French writer Renaud Camus asserting that there's a deliberate plot to rid the world of white people. It's popped up during the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville , in tweets from known white supremacist and former lawmaker Steve King, and in manifestos from racist mass shooters -to name a few. As suburbs become more racially diverse, white families are moving out into whiter communities. And, pretty much every immigration law was constructed to keep America as white as possible.\n\nThe NBC News reporting on CRT backlash is important because it makes clear that the fights currently happening in school districts nationwide are an extension of those desperate grasps to maintain power and limit interactions with people of color. Sure, a white parent shouting at a school board meeting because they don't want their child learning the truth about racial inequality isn't as blatant as the violence carried out by the Klan. But it is motivated by the same desire to protect whiteness, its stature, and the privilege it bestows.\n\nCorrection, Sept. 16, 2021: This article originally misidentified the Ku Klux Klan as the Klu Klux Klan.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

When President Trump was asked, was told that you are a killer, he didn't deny it. When President Biden was asked whether he believes you are a killer, he said, 'I do'. Mr President, are you a killer?\"\n\nPutin laughed but didn't quite say no . The Russian president didn't really answer the question, only saying he had heard lots of these types of accusations during his tenure, \"none of it surprises me,\" he added. Putin got a bit sociological about the question, saying that the \"harsh rhetoric\" was \"an expression of overall U.S. culture\" and he went on to blame Hollywood. \"There are some underlying deep things in Hollywood-macho-which can be treated as cinematic art, but that is part of U.S. political culture, where it's considered normal. By the way, not here, it is not considered normal here.\"\n\n\"Mr. President, are you a killer?\" pic.twitter.com/xiVvUHX9Yl\n\nSimmons pushed back, saying he didn't quite hear Putin deny the allegation and went on to name several of the Russian president's opponents who have been killed in recent years. Putin was none too happy, and he made his feelings clear. \"Look, you know, I don't want to come across as being rude, but this looks like some kind of indigestion except that it's verbal indigestion. You've mentioned many individuals who indeed suffered and perished at different points in time for various reasons, at the hands of different individuals,\" he said.\n\nPutin also recognized that the relationship between Washington and Moscow \"has deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years,\" but he expressed optimism he can work with President Joe Biden ahead of their upcoming summit next week. \"Well even now, I believe that former U.S. president Mr. Trump is an extraordinary individual, talented individual, otherwise he would not have become U.S. president,\" Putin said, characterizing the former president as a \"colorful individual.\" Biden, on the other hand, is \"radically different\" because he is a career politician. \"That's a different kind of person, and it is my great hope that, yes, there are some advantages, some disadvantages, but there will not be any impulse-based movements on behalf of the sitting U.S. president,\" he said.\n\nBiden and Putin will be meeting Wednesday in Switzerland and the U.S. president will hold a news conference by himself afterward. \"A solo press conference is the appropriate format to clearly communicate with the free press the topics that were raised in the meeting-both in terms of areas where we may agree and in areas where we have significant concerns,\" a White House official said Saturday . That will be a contrast from three years ago, when Trump and Putin held a joint news conference after their meeting in Finland.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The $15,000 Interview\n\nThe New York Times spent 1,200 words Monday fussing over the well-known practice at NBC News and ABC News of paying sources for tabloidy stories like those about Anthony Weiner's Facebook correspondent Meagan Broussard and Jaycee Lee Dugard , the young girl in California held captive for 18 years.\n\nThe two networks don't call the payments for stories \"payment for stories,\" of course. They hide behind the fig leaf of \"licensing fees,\" in which they pay subjects for photos, home movies, and whatever else is at hand-and it's not uncommon for these sales, I mean \"licensings,\" to include an interview with the subject.\n\n\"[P]roducers at NBC's Today and ABC's second-place GMA regularly end up in bidding wars for deals for candid and exclusive interviews,\" the Times reports.\n\nJulie Moos at the Poynter Institute writes that networks sometimes pay licensing fees to sources for emails and cellphone records, too.\n\nAs I've written before , the practice of paying sources for information may stink, but it's been around so long that it's hard to smell it. Life magazine paid the Mercury astronauts and their wives $500,000 for their stories ( $3.9 million in today's money ), according to a 1959 Time magazine article . In 1975, CBS News paid H.R. Haldeman between $25,000 and $50,000 for an interview, defending the deal as compensation for a \"memoir,\" According to Time magazine. Other beneficiaries of the CBS News checkbook included Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson (after they had left office), Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Walter Lippmann, and G. Gordon Liddy. NBC News paid Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger, reports the American Journalism Review . It's not an archaic practice, either. Three years ago, filmmaker Errol Morris acknowledged that he paid soldiers who committed offenses at Abu Ghraib to appear in his documentary Standard Operating Procedure .\n\nMy thinking about paying for sources hasn't changed much since I wrote that column. The downside of the practice, as we see in the United Kingdom, where tabloids routinely pay for stories, is that it encourages the idiotic and sensationalistic coverage about celebrities and politicians. One ethicist frets that the practice gives the rich a monopoly on news: If the rich are willing to pay the price, they can inject whatever \"news\" they want into the press and suppress that which they don't want known.\n\nThe problem with most of the ethical handwringing is that it rarely deals with the question of who benefits when news organizations don't pay their sources. It's the news organizations, of course, who get something of value-a captive's story, the saga of an adorable set of sextuplets, the titillation of a sexting relationship with a member of Congress, et al.-for nothing. If it's unethical for NBC News or ABC News to purchase, I mean license, somebody's story, why should it be ethical for Little, Brown or Random House to buy the same story, mix it with the labor of a ghost writer, and put it between hardcovers under the byline of the subject?\n\nPoynter's Moos and other ethicists believe that paying sources for information damages the credibility of journalism because it may, as she writes, \"encourage a source to say things that are untrue and it may encourage them to dramatize the truth.\" But money isn't the only thing that can encourage a source to speak untruths or dramatize. Unpaid sources frequently lie, and many love to dramatize for effect. Even \"reliable\" sources-the usual operators on Capitol Hill, on Wall Street, and at the Pentagon-routinely sell information to reporters, only they don't expect money in return. All sorts of non-cash benefits can accrue to those who provide reporters with information: They can undermine their political or corporate opponents; they can help tip the story to their side; they can win publicity for their causes; and by virtue of appearing as a named source in a story, they increase the chance they'll be called upon later by reporters to provide more information.\n\nOne of the Poynter ethicists counsels that if journalists pay sources, they must disclose how much they paid, what exactly they paid for, and whether a source's travel, lodging, or meals were covered. This sounds great to me, but focusing on cash is an overly narrow conception of benefits. To maintain ethical parity, shouldn't reporters also have to disclose how their sources, named and unnamed, benefited by sharing information with the press?\n\nAlso, if paid news sources are automatically suspect, shouldn't expert witnesses who are paid for court testimony be equally suspect? Shouldn't the police be barred from paying informants for the same reason? (Well, yes. I inadvertently undermine my own case. Please ignore!)\n\nThe taboo against paying sources-and the opprobrium dumped on the news outlets that pay-has more to do with maintaining the status quo for established, old-guard news institutions than it does with protecting journalistic truth. Established news institutions depend on their high status, and the high status of their audiences, to lure and lock up sources. (If you've ever worked a story at the same time and in the same place as the New York Times , you know what I mean.) In practice, old-guard institutions \"pay\" much more for their stories than the outlets that pay sources directly. The main difference is that the old guard's payments go to their far-flung correspondents and to the institution's stockholders, not to sources. The longer the old-guarders can keep the public convinced that it's more ethical to give the old-guarders information for nothing, the better off the old-guarders will be.\n\nWhether a source is paid or not, the information from that source must be vetted, and as one who has repeatedly been lied to by unpaid sources, I don't see why paid sources should be considered less credible than unpaid ones. In fact, you could make the argument that paying a source increases credibility, because if he gives you lies in return for payment, at least you have the legal leverage to sue him for fraud. If an unpaid source lies to you, what can you do? Pound sand?\n\nAuthority has been displaced as the primary arbiter of truth by confirmation, thanks to the Web and, to a lesser degree, the proliferation of cable news. It no longer matters what Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says if, to pose a hypothetical, she is contradicted by a wad of diplomatic cables sold to a news outlet that confirms their essential truth. Confirmation is the new, great journalistic leveler.\n\nAs a creature of the old guard, I'm made itchy by the prospect of sources nickel-and-diming me for information. But the sanctimony of the ethicists gives me full-body chiggers.\n\n***\n\nScratch my itch with email to slate.pressbox@gmail.com or pour calamine lotion on my Twitter feed.

      "text": "Trump's Threats Against NBC Are Totally Empty. But They're Still Frightening.\n\nAfter NBC News reported on Wednesday morning that President Donald Trump had shocked his military advisers by demanding \" a nearly tenfold increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal ,\" our commander in chief did what he does best and lashed out at the press via Twitter.\n\nWith all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!\n\nShutting down critical TV networks is, of course, a favorite move of would-be strongmen the world over-Hugo Chávez was particularly fond of it-and many were aghast to see a U.S. president musing about such an idea on social media. Just in case he hadn't made his point clearly enough, though, Trump told reporters later in the afternoon that he thought it was \"frankly disgusting the press is able to write whatever it wants to write.\" The man is not a fan of the First Amendment.\n\nWhich raises the question: If Trump grows angry enough, could he try to exact revenge on NBC, or any other news networks, by stripping their parent companies' of their broadcast rights?\n\nThankfully, the answer is almost certainly no . But if you're worried about the authoritarian streak rapidly engulfing the American right, Trump's empty threats are still plenty chilling.\n\nTrump's threat is a bit awkward since, technically, NBC does not have a single broadcast \"license.\" That's because it's a television network-it creates programming, which mostly airs across affiliate stations around the country run by other companies. However, NBC's corporate parent Comcast does own 10 NBC stations in major markets, which the company says reach 27 million households, or a little more than a quarter of the American TV viewers. And just like every other broadcaster on the public airwaves, those very valuable stations need to periodically renew their licenses with the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nIn theory, Trump-or one of his political allies-could file an official petition asking the FCC to deny licenses to Comcast's stations the next time they need to be reupped. But to do that, they'd have to find something to complain about other than NBC's critical White House coverage, because the commission doesn't regulate news content. When stations' licenses are challenged, it's typically over technical or cut-and-dry legal issues like whether stations misled the FCC in previous applications. In one famous case from the 1980s, RKO General lost broadcast rights after it misled the FCC about bribery charges it had faced. But that legal battle took almost 20 years to resolve.\n\n\"I really don't see anything [Trump] could do,\" said Angela Campbell, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who specializes in media and telecommunications. \"They [the FCC] don't really deny anyone a license to begin with, but they certainly don't do it because of what was broadcast on a news program, because that would be such a clear content discrimination claim.\"\n\nIf Trump or his friends did find a superficial excuse to challenge one of Comcast's broadcast licenses-that is, something other than \"bad for country!\"-chances are the effort wouldn't go very far. The FCC is an independent body, and while its members are nominated by the White House, the recently confirmed chairman, Ajit Pai, is a by-the-book, business-friendly conservative who served on the commission during the Obama years. Even if you don't like his stand on net neutrality , he probably isn't going to entertain Trump's desire for a political vendetta.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's favorite media punching bag, CNN, is entirely safe from this nonsense, because cable networks aren't regulated by the FCC.\n\nSo, if Trump's threats are toothless, why worry? Because by talking openly about censoring unfriendly news outlets, he's leading the right one step closer to a very dark place politically. As University of Tennessee professor Stuart Brotman pointed out to me, there actually is a historical parallel to Trump's Twitter threats: During the Watergate scandal, Richard Nixon talked about going after the Washington Post Co.'s radio and TV broadcast license.* \"The game has to be played awfully rough,\" he was caught saying on the White House tapes. His political allies eventually filed challenges against broadcast licenses of two Post-owned stations in Florida, both of which failed.\n\nBut even Nixon felt compelled to keep his plotting behind closed doors. With Trump, it's out in the open, performed for millions supporters checking their iPhones. Maybe he's just putting on a show for them. But a lot of those voters are going to come away with the idea that shutting down news stations is a good idea. And that might do more damage to the country than quiet, Nixonian skullduggery ever did.\n\n*Correction, Oct. 11, 2017: This post originally misspelled University of Tennessee Knoxville professor Stuart Brotman's last name.﻿\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

After listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\" Cesar Conde, the NBCU News Group chairman, wrote.\n\nMcDaniel stepped down at the RNC last month and was replaced by two new leaders, including former President Donald Trump's daughter-in-law.\n\nShe defended her time with the party and her views on the 2020 election, Jan. 6 and more in an interview on Sunday on \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nIn that appearance, McDaniel indicated that she was sharing more of her views because she was no longer at the helm of the party.\n\n\"When you're the RNC chair, you kind of take one for the whole team,\" said McDaniel, who was hand-picked by Trump in late 2016 to steer the party until he pushed for new leadership.\n\n\"Now,\" McDaniel said on NBC, \"I get to be a little bit more myself.\"\n\nAmong other topics, McDaniel was pressed on \"Meet the Press\" about her past comments questioning, without evidence, whether President Joe Biden had genuinely won the 2020 election -- and she split from Trump over his support for some of the people convicted for participating in the events of Jan. 6.\n\nShe also defended a Nov. 17, 2020, phone call in which she and Trump were reportedly recorded urging GOP canvassers in Michigan not to sign a certification of the 2020 election results showing that Biden had won.\n\nShe said there had been public backlash to the canvassers as they weighed what to do and, despite what the recording reportedly showed, she told them to \"vote your conscience\" but wasn't \"pushing them to do anything.\"\n\nWhile moderator Kristen Welker said that McDaniel was appearing on Sunday for a news interview, that was overshadowed by NBC's separate announcement that they were hiring her as an analyst.\n\nIn a memo sent Friday about McDaniel joining NBC, executive Carrie Budoff Brown praised her as an illuminating voice in an \"important moment.\"\n\n\"As chair of the Republican National Committee, she spent nearly eight years at the highest levels of American politics ... [S]he will support our leading coverage by providing an insider's perspective on national politics and on the future of the Republican Party - which she led through some of the most turbulent and challenging moments in political history,\" Brown wrote, in part.\n\nBut by Sunday's \"Meet the Press\" interview, the criticism of McDaniel and her relationship to Trump and past comments on the 2020 election was mounting, including from Chuck Todd -- who raised \"credibility issues\" -- as well as MSNBC \"Morning Joe\" hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, Rachel Maddow and others.\n\n\"I mean, you wouldn't hire a wiseguy, you wouldn't hire a made man like a mobster to work at a DA's office, right?\" Maddow said on the air on Monday.\n\nAri Melber, another MSNBC host, commented Tuesday on McDaniel no longer contributing to the network and touched on the broader controversy that erupted internally.\n\n\"If you watch MSNBC, as you probably do if you're listening to me right now, or you follow news media and politics, this has been a roiling debate since that initial announcement was made on Friday,\" Melber said on his eponymous show.\n\nConde, the NBCU News Group chair, touched on the backlash as well.\n\n\"No organization, particularly a newsroom, can succeed unless it is cohesive and aligned. Over the last few days, it has become clear that this appointment undermines that goal,\" he wrote in Tuesday's memo.\n\n\"Our initial decision was made because of our deep commitment to presenting our audiences with a widely diverse set of viewpoints and experiences, particularly during these consequential times,\" he continued. \"We continue to be committed to the principle that we must have diverse viewpoints on our programs, and to that end, we will redouble our efforts to seek voices that represent different parts of the political spectrum.\"\n\nABC News has not been able to reach McDaniel for comment.\n\nTrump reacted to the news of McDaniel no longer being an NBC News contributor, mocking her on his social media platform Truth Social saying she \"only lasted two days ... after McDaniel went out of her way to say what they wanted to hear.\"\n\n\"It leaves her in a very strange place,\" he wrote.\n\nABC News' Soo Rin Kim and Jolie Lash contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Separately, Trump said that \"there will be bombing\" if Iran doesn't make a deal on its nuclear program.\n\n• Musk in Wisconsin: Elon Musk, who has injected himself into the state's high-stakes Supreme Court race, hosted an event Sunday night in Green Bay, where he held million-dollar giveaways and urged voters to support the conservative candidate. The election presents an early test of swing-state reaction to Trump's presidency.\n\nElon Musk handed out $1 million checks to two attendees at a Sunday event in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he warned the \"future of civilization\" hinged on the state's Supreme Court race and urged voters to back the conservative candidate.\n\n\"Everybody's got to mobilize everywhere like crazy for the next 48 hours,\" said Musk, who donned a cheesehead hat for part of the event. \"I think this will be important for the future of civilization. It's that significant.\"\n\nThe appearance was his latest foray into a contest in which he's invested millions of his own fortune. In the closing weeks of the campaign, Musk and his super PAC, America PAC, have reprised controversial tactics used in the 2024 election, including the $1 million cash giveaways.\n\nMusk said he was handing out the checks \"in appreciation\" to two individuals, Nicholas Jacobs and Ekaterina Diestler, who signed a petition against \"activist judges.\"\n\nThe move came hours after the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to hear state Attorney General Josh Kaul's request to stop Musk from doling out the checks.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to hear state Attorney General Josh Kaul's request to stop Elon Musk and his super PAC from offering two $1 million giveaways to attendees at an event in Green Bay tonight.\n\nThe unanimous decision from the court came just minutes before Musk's event was scheduled to begin. The event, which has drawn several hundred people, is delayed due to long lines of attendees snaking outside the convention center.\n\nThe tech billionaire has injected himself into the state's high-stakes Supreme Court race and announced Friday that he would travel to Wisconsin on Sunday to name the winners of million-dollar giveaways orchestrated by his super PAC, America PAC, reprising a controversial tactic he used in last year's election.\n\nKaul, a Democrat, announced Friday that he planned to take legal action against Musk's PAC and seek a court order halting the cash giveaways, set to be awarded to signers of a petition aimed at collecting voter data and boosting turnout.\n\nIn the hours before the decision, attorneys for Musk asked that two justices who have supported the liberal candidate in the race - Rebecca Frank Dallet and Jill J. Karofsky - recuse themselves from hearing the case. Dallet and Karofsky rejected the request.\n\nThe mother of an 11-year-old Texas girl who died by suicide last month after bullying due to her family's immigration status briefly addressed a pro-immigration rally Sunday, calling for reform to the country's immigration system and telling a crowd in Dallas to not let her daughter's death be in vain.\n\n\"It's sad to remember my daughter, especially given the way things happened,\" Marbella Carranza told a crowd in Spanish in front of City Hall on Sunday afternoon.\n\nHer daughter, Jocelynn Rojo Carranza, died on February 8, five days after her mother found her unresponsive at home in Gainesville, Texas, about 70 miles north of Dallas. CNN previously reported that Marbella Carranza said Jocelynn was bullied and taunted at school over her family's immigration status.\n\nCarranza told the crowd she had never participated in a march before, but said she believed \"it's important we fight for this cause,\" especially after \"everything my daughter went through.\"\n\n\"And that's why I'm joining this cause,\" she said. \"Because I believe we all deserve immigration reform.\"\n\nShe asked the community to \"keep fighting, to keep united for this cause, and that my daughter's death not be in vain.\"\n\nHer remarks were preceded by a large march through the streets of downtown Dallas demanding immigration reform. Organizers hoped the event would be one of the largest acts of public dissent against President Donald Trump's administration during his second term.\n\nAhead of Wisconsin's high-stakes Supreme Court race this week, President Trump took to social media Sunday to urge his followers to vote for the conservative candidate, Judge Brad Schimel.\n\n\"Wisconsin Values are perfectly represented by Brad Schimel. He is Conservative, Strong and, above all, SANE,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.\n\nThe president went on to publicly criticize the liberal candidate, Judge Susan Crawford.\n\n\"His Opponent is a Liberal Lunatic who will throw our Country, and the State of Wisconsin, into TOTAL CHAOS. Vote for Brad Schimel!\" added Trump, who was featured in a telephone town hall hosted by Schimel last week.\n\nThe challenge presents an early test of swing state reaction to Trump's presidency, as CNN previously reported.\n\nMusk's event: The president's post comes as his close ally Elon Musk is set to host an event tonight in Green Bay, where the tech billionaire has said he will \"hand over checks for a million dollars to 2 people to be spokesmen\" for a petition against \"activist judges.\" Musk is flexing his growing political influence in the race after his key supporting role in Trump's 2024 campaign.\n\nGOP Rep. Victoria Spartz on Sunday claimed recent town halls - where she faced anger from Indiana voters over her support for the Trump administration - were subject to an \"organized ambush\" by Democratic activists.\n\n\"This town hall, which should be part of the process for us to communicate with our constituents and have dialogue, became really an organized ambush by Democrats and a lot of radical groups to push a false narrative that Republicans are doing something wrong,\" Spartz told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield.\n\nSpartz also claimed the protesters' \"actions were very violent.\"\n\nVideos showed attendees getting emotional at her town halls on Friday in Westfield and on Saturday in Muncie , with one woman who interrupted the Saturday town hall escorted out by police. But there were no reports of violence from either event.\n\nPressed on whether she's disputing that attendees were constituents, Spartz doubled down: \"This is organized by Democrats that did a lot of social media posts.\"\n\nThe big picture: Republican lawmakers across the country have faced a tough reception at an increasing number of town halls , where voters have voiced their displeasure with President Donald Trump's actions during his first 100 days in office.\n\nDemocrats have also faced riled-up crowds over what constituents say is a lack of sufficient resistance.\n\nA crowd of people appearing to number in the thousands marched through downtown Dallas today to protest President Donald Trump's immigration policies and demand the release of several students who have been detained by immigration officials across the country.\n\nDemonstrators carried American flags, which protest organizers had encouraged as a gesture of unity and patriotism. The crowd stretched several blocks through downtown Dallas as marchers trekked from a cathedral to City Hall, where they gathered in front of a pre-set stage.\n\n\"We need to catch the attention of the authorities in a good way, because we're good people,\" one of the marchers, Daniel Beltran, 60, told CNN ahead of the protest. \"Most of us, we come here because we want a better life.\"\n\nSeveral protesters carried signs specifically referencing Mahmoud Khalil , Khan Suri and Rumeysa Ozturk , all foreign national students at prestigious US universities arrested for what the Trump administration claims were activities related to terrorist organizations.\n\nAfter reaching city hall, the crowd recited the pledge of allegiance, and a mariachi performer led the group in singing \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\nHector Flores, a past national president of the League of United Latin American citizens, told the sprawling crowd, \"Latinos are the backbone of this great state.\"\n\n\"We build the buildings. We paint the murals. We cook the meals from every culture and every corner of this country. We are the architects, the artisans, the chefs, the caregivers, the teachers, the scientists,\" Flores said.\n\nHundreds of people have gathered in front of a Dallas cathedral Sunday afternoon ahead of a pro-immigration march that organizers hope will be one of the largest acts of public dissent against President Donald Trump's administration during his second term.\n\nThe march, organized by the League of United Latin American Citizens, is expected to cut a more than mile-long path through downtown Dallas before ending in front of Dallas City Hall.\n\nMarchers were encouraged to carry American flags and wear white to symbolize peace and unity.\n\nAhead of the march, Democratic Rep. Al Green joined several protesters in singing Spanish-language folk songs. Green has become a lodestar for progressive opposition to Trump's policies since he interrupted the president's joint address to Congress and was removed from US Capitol chambers earlier this month.\n\nOrganizers are hoping for more than 10,000 protesters to join the march, but acknowledged that Trump's continued efforts to stifle dissent may prevent many people - especially those still in the process of attaining citizenship - from wanting to join a public protest.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain said he's hopeful President Donald Trump's 25% auto tariffs will bring manufacturing jobs to the US, but he expressed \"great concerns\" about the Trump administration's actions more broadly.\n\n\"Free speech is under attack. Unions are under attack,\" Fain said during an interview with CBS' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, adding that his organization has \"members (in higher education) who are being detained - their rights to free speech being violated.\"\n\nThe president took his most consequential action against federal employee unions yet last Thursday, signing an executive order aimed at ending collective bargaining for government employees whose work includes national security aspects.\n\nFain called the recent action \"despicable,\" adding that it has impacted 700,000 federal workers.\n\nFain said, however, that he's hopeful Trump's tariffs on imported cars and auto parts will bring jobs to the US, and said even the threat of tariffs has started making some manufacturers consider moving back to the country.\n\n\"I've had companies tell us point blank that they're going to have to bring products back here if those tariffs are implemented,\" Fain said.\n\nBut the union head said bringing manufacturing jobs back to the US doesn't mean anything if there's no guarantee of livable wages, Medicaid, free speech and collective bargaining.\n\nSome background: Fain was one of the most prominent union leaders backing Vice President Kamala Harris in last year's presidential election.\n\nDespite his opposition to many Trump policies, Fain applauded Trump's auto tariff announcement last week, saying the president was \"stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades.\"\n\nElon Musk, who has injected himself into Wisconsin's high-stakes Supreme Court race , is set to hold an event in the state tonight, even as a legal battle brews over his actions in the Badger State.\n\nWisconsin's Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul has asked the state Supreme Court to block Musk and his super PAC from offering $1 million awards to voters at this evening's town hall in Green Bay, according to a new court filing .\n\nHow we got here: Musk has said he will \"hand over checks for a million dollars to 2 people to be spokesmen\" for a petition against \"activist judges.\" But that's after the tech billionaire deleted an earlier version of the post, in which he had written he would give the checks \"in appreciation for you taking the time to vote.\"\n\nKaul said last week that he was suing Musk and his organization on grounds that the giveaways violated state election law.\n\nWhere things stand: An appeals court on Saturday denied the attorney general's initial request, so Kaul is now asking the state Supreme Court, where liberals hold a 4-3 majority, to intervene before the event's 6:30 p.m. local start time (7:30 p.m. ET).\n\n\"Resolution of this legal issue is urgent,\" Kaul wrote in the brief filed Sunday. \"If this Court does not take prompt action, and the prizes are awarded, the injury to public confidence in the validity of this election cannot be undone.\"\n\nLet's zoom out for a second: This race is garnering so much attention because it will decide ideological control of the high court, and also serve as a potential bellwether for how voters are receiving President Donald Trump's return to the White House.\n\nMusk has loomed large, both by injecting millions into the race - alongside other megadonors for both sides - and as a prominent target for attacks by supporters of the liberal candidate, Judge Susan Crawford.\n\nWhile the conservative candidate, Judge Brad Schimel, has enthusiastically embraced President Donald Trump's endorsement, he sought to downplay Musk's involvement Sunday, telling Fox News he doesn't control outside spending and he's not \"running for anything for Elon Musk or any other person.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump did not dismiss the idea of pursuing a third term in the White House, despite the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution prohibiting it, claiming in an interview that \"there are methods\" for achieving this and emphasizing he was \"not joking.\"\n\n\"A lot of people would like me to do that. But, I mean, I basically tell them, we have a long way to go,\" Trump said in a phone interview with NBC News that published Sunday. \"I'm focused on the current,\" he added, referring to his current administration.\n\n\"There are methods which you could do it,\" the president responded, when asked if there are strategies on the table to allow him to seek another presidency.\n\nThe term-limited president has teased a third presidency time and time again .\n\n\"I'm not joking,\" Trump told NBC News, but reiterated, \"It is far too early to think about it.\"\n\nRemember: Trump said at a rally in Nevada in late January, \"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice or three times or four times.\"\n\nHe later added: \"No, it will be to serve twice. For the next four years, I will not rest.\"\n\nWeeks later, Trump asked supporters, \"Should I run again?\" at a Black History Month event at the White House, to chants of \"Four more years!\"\n\nThe fallout from the now-infamous Signal group chat about plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen continues to reverberate, days after The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg revealed he had been added to the chain.\n\nOn Sunday, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he believed Israel has \"a right to be this mad about classified information being treated sloppily\" on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" His comments came in response to reporting that Israeli officials were upset about the lack of operational security in a group chat regarding one of their regional foes.\n\nRep. Mike Turner , a former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday he believes the details on strikes in Yemen \"should be considered classified,\" but suggested a watchdog investigation will assess whether Trump administration officials declassified the information.\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee's Republican chair and top Democrat formally requested an investigation into the chat, but it's unclear whether a probe will happen.\n\nSeparately, Republican Sen. James Lankford said \"it's entirely appropriate\" for the Pentagon inspector general to investigate how Goldberg was added to the chat and it wasn't necessary for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to resign.\n\nMeanwhile Goldberg defended himself , dismissing suggestions from national security adviser Mike Waltz that his number had been somehow \"sucked in\" to the chat.\n\n\"My phone number was in his phone because my phone number is in his phone,\" Goldberg said in an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jodey Arrington, who chairs the House Budget Committee, defended President Donald Trump's plan for new auto tariffs Sunday, arguing they could provide a \"reset\" to markets.\n\nTrump last week announced 25% tariffs on all cars shipped to the United States, a significant escalation in his global trade war that would go into effect April 3.\n\nIn an interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Arrington argued that auto markets need a \"reset\" in order for the US to compete more evenly with foreign companies, and said there's no way to reach a reciprocal trade agreement \"without the tough negotiation tactics of President Trump.\"\n\nAsked if Congress would count on tariff revenue to offset Trump's proposed tax cuts , Arrington said lawmakers should focus on reducing spending overall, but added that some of the revenue could be used to help reduce the initial \"sting\" of reciprocal tariffs.\n\nThe Texas lawmaker called the idea \"tariff relief,\" and compared it to how the first Trump administration provided \"market facilitation payments\" to farmers in his state during the early stages of trade battles.\n\nArrington emphasized again, however, that the US needs to reduce its deficit by spending less.\n\nPresident Donald Trump sent a striking warning to Iran of possible bombings and secondary tariffs if the Islamic Republic does not reach an agreement with the United States over its nuclear program.\n\n\"If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing,\" Trump said in a phone interview with NBC News.\n\nIran's president said Sunday that the Islamic Republic rejected negotiations with the US over its fast-advancing nuclear program, offering Tehran's first response to a letter Trump sent to the country's supreme leader.\n\nTrump also mentioned the possibility of reimposing economic pressure, similar to his past actions.\n\n\"There's a chance that if they don't make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago,\" Trump told \"Meet the Press\" host Kristen Welker.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump pulled the US out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, a pact that imposed strict limitations on Tehran's contentious nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says he is \"pissed off\" with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, telling NBC News in a phone interview Sunday that he could impose additional tariffs on Russian oil if Putin doesn't cooperate in ongoing negotiations to end his war in Ukraine.\n\n\"I was very angry - pissed off - when Putin started getting into Zelensky's credibility, because that's not going in the right location, you understand?\" Trump said in the interview with \"Meet the Press\" host Kristen Welker.\n\nTrump referred to Putin discussing the need, in his view, for new leadership in Ukraine.\n\n\"But new leadership means you're not gonna have a deal for a long time, right?\" Trump said.\n\nThe US president warned that failure to reach a deal could result in secondary tariffs.\n\n\"If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault - which it might not be - but if I think it was Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he would talk to Putin this week if the Russian leader \"does the right thing,\" Trump said, \"Yeah.\" He also told Welker that Putin is aware he is angry.\n\nTrump's sharply critical tone stands in stark contrast to his own words on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his own calls for elections for the war-torn country.\n\nOne of President Donald Trump's top economic advisers declined to say Sunday how many countries would be targeted by the president's promised reciprocal tariffs this week and suggested the plans remain fluid.\n\n\"President Trump is going to decide how many countries,\" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said during an appearance on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" with Maria Bartiromo.\n\nHassett appeared to indicate the president has not made any final decisions:\n\n\"President Trump has a long-run vision of the golden age of America, and we're working really, really hard to get it out there in time. But I can't give you any forward-looking guidance on what's going to happen this week. The president has got a lot of analysis before him, and he's going to make the right choice.\"\n\nGetting up to speed? Uncertainty still surrounds the tariffs Trump has vowed to announce April 2, and the president's trade war has been subject to constant whiplash. Catch up here.\n\nOn Trump's tax plan: Hassett also expressed confidence that congressional Republicans will be able to pass the president's tax plan, highlighting Trump's proposed provisions for no taxes on Social Security, tips or overtime pays.\n\nHassett predicted the plan could pass as soon as this summer.\n\nAtlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg is standing by his explanation of how he ended up in a Signal group chat created by national security adviser Mike Waltz last week to discuss secret attack plans.\n\nWaltz said Wednesday that Goldberg's number got \"sucked in\" to his phone, while trying to explain how the journalist got added to the chat.\n\n\"This isn't the matrix, phone numbers don't just get sucked into other phones,\" Goldberg said Sunday in an interview with NBC's Kristen Welker. \"I don't know what he's talking about there,\" he added.\n\n\"You know, very frequently in journalism, the most obvious explanation is the explanation. My phone number was in his phone because my phone number is in his phone. He's telling everyone that he's never met me or spoken to me. That's simply not true.\"\n\nGoldberg also shared his thoughts on the Vice President JD Vance's role in the Signal group chat, expressing that he found the conversation to be \"very fraught\" as he read it in real-time.\n\nNew polling: Meanwhile, a CBS News/YouGov poll released Sunday finds Americans say, 76% to 24%, that it was not appropriate for members of the Trump administration to discuss military plans over Signal.\n\nWhile most Republicans describe the matter as at least somewhat serious, the poll finds that it \"isn't adversely affecting Republicans in their overall evaluation\" of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Trust in Trump\": That's the message from the White House to Americans concerned about tariffs ahead of April 2.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly proclaimed that date \"Liberation Day,\" when he says he'll unveil massive reciprocal tariffs that match foreign countries' import taxes dollar-for-dollar on a variety of products.\n\n\"Tariffs are tax cuts, tariffs are jobs, tariffs are national security, tariffs are great for Americans. Tariffs will make America great again,\" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said during an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nBut with the mid-week deadline fast approaching, there is still plenty of uncertainty surrounding the president's plans:\n\nRecent whiplash: As he has demonstrated before, Trump's \"Liberation Day\" could still turn into yet another tariff retreat , and administration officials have reportedly tried to tamp down expectations that every pledged tariff action will go into effect this week.\n\nTrump himself has sent mixed signals: He said early last week that he \"may give a lot of countries breaks\" on the tariffs, before making remarks yesterday and on Friday that while he's open to deals for other countries, those would come only after his April 2 announcements.\n\nThe auto tariffs: Trump already announced last week that a new 25% tariff on all cars shipped to the US would take effect overnight Wednesday into Thursday. It will also begin to include car parts from other countries \"no later than May 3,\" according to the administration.\n\nHere's an idea of how much it could impact the cost of your next car.\n\nMarket unease: Trump's decision to announce the tariffs on autos ahead of the April 2 deadline caused further unease in financial markets to end the week. US stocks tumbled Friday and a broad selloff gripped Wall Street, driven in part by tariff anxiety, but also slightly stubborn inflation data and weakening consumer sentiment.\n\nRepublican Sen. James Lankford said he'd support the Pentagon inspector general investigating last week's Signal chat debacle , and looking into why national security officials used the platform to discuss attack plans in the first place.\n\n\"It's entirely appropriate for the inspector general to be able to look at it,\" Lankford told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nLankford said there are two issues the independent watchdog should examine: \"One is how to report or get in this conversation. And the second one is, how do members of the administration talk to each other when they're on the road on things that are clearly timely.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers have grappled with how to respond to the incident, which saw The Atlantic's editor-in-chief included on a chain describing strikes against Houthi rebels.\n\nEarlier this week, the Senate Armed Services Committee's Republican chair and top Democrat formally requested an inquiry. But several Republicans on the same committee insisted it's \"time to move on,\" arguing it won't happen again and that Trump officials have learned from their mistakes.\n\nLankford on Sunday said he did not think Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sharing specific details about the military operation was \"much of an issue,\" because Hegseth believed he was in a \"closed circle of conversation.\"\n\n\"I don't see this as an issue of leadership, nor - I've heard some people calling for his resignation. I think that's way overkill,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland slammed President Donald Trump's executive order targeting the Smithsonian Institution - a sprawling organization that encompasses the National Zoo and a collection of museums that anchor tourism in the nation's capital.\n\nMoore called it \"deeply disrespectful that their definition of making America great again is actually challenging some of the things that make America great in the first place,\" in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\"Loving your country does not mean lying about its history\" or \"diminishing those who have helped make this country so powerful and make America so unique in world history in the first place,\" the governor said.\n\nSome context: The order put Vice President JD Vance in charge of stopping government spending on \"exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy.\"\n\nIn particular, the order appears crafted to direct museums to soften or distort forthright discussions about the history and impact of racism in the United States. It follows similar orders that seek to exert the president's will over law firms and educational institutions.\n\nMoore recalled his 2023 swearing-in as governor, when he talked about his experience of marching from the docks in Annapolis, Maryland, to the State House as the state's first Black governor: \"That's not indoctrination, that's history.\"\n\nCNN's Michael Williams contributed to this report.\n\nWe have a fresh slate of reads for your Sunday morning, with the latest on President Donald Trump's first 100 days after another eventful week for the administration.\n\n• Defining DOGE : Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has spawned dozens of lawsuits in its effort to shrink the federal government. The question of whether DOGE is actually a government agency could have major legal ramifications.\n\n• Trump on auto tariffs : Trump said yesterday that he doesn't care if automakers hike prices because of his tariffs, which are set to be imposed at mid-week. In fact, he encouraged them to.\n\n• The president's retribution : Trump is using the power of the federal government to punish potential sources of opposition, from the legal establishment to academia, media, Democrats and beyond. They're struggling to respond.\n\n• Democrat channels Trump outrage : Jon Ossoff, the nation's most endangered Senate Democrat, sees a path for reelection in a state the president won in 2024. He plans to go all out against Trump.\n\n• Marriage and birth rates in red states : Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is using his Cabinet position to pursue a long-stated priority: Incentivizing marriage and birth rates. His policy moves could benefit pro-Trump areas.\n\n• Europe awakes from military slumber : Trump and Vice President JD Vance's dressing-down of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House early this month may have awoken European leaders to their self-defense needs in the Trump era.\n\nTech billionaire Elon Musk is set to visit Wisconsin today, as the state's high-stakes Supreme Court race provides an opportunity to flex his growing political influence.\n\nMegadonors from both parties are directing millions to the contest, which is set to decide ideological control of the battleground state's high court.\n\nThe race comes on the heels of Musk's key supporting role in President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign, and is viewed as a potential bellwether for how voters are receiving Trump's return to the White House.\n\nMusk's visit: Musk will attend an event naming the winners of million-dollar giveaways orchestrated by his super PAC to reward petition signees, reprising a controversial tactic he used in last year's election. He and groups he's funded in the past have poured millions into the race.\n\nMusk's commitment to the Wisconsin contest amounts to a demonstration of the financial firepower he can bring to the 2026 midterms.\n\nAds shape the race: Ads for the liberal candidate, Judge Susan Crawford, have sought to tie the conservative candidate, Judge Brad Schimel, to potentially unpopular policies linked to the Trump administration, including the overturning of Roe v. Wade and Musk's role in Trump's sweeping federal government overhaul.\n\nSchimel and his supporters, meanwhile, have leaned into tough-on-crime messaging and sharp criticism of some of Crawford's rulings.\n\nMeanwhile, a legal battle: Wisconsin's Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul is suing Elon Musk's super PAC over the legality of his million-dollar giveaways under state election law.\n\nIn an interesting twist, Crawford was assigned the case in Dane County Circuit Court, but has recused herself given the ongoing contest.\n\nCNN's Arlette Saenz contributed reporting to this post.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Tom Llamas will take the reins on 'NBC Nightly News' starting this summer, replacing Lester Holt\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFollow:\n\nTom Llamas will replace Lester Holt as the face of \"NBC Nightly News.\"\n\nLlamas is expected to take over the anchor seat as well as managing editor duties this summer, the broadcaster shared on Wednesday . In addition to his \"Nightly News\" duties, Llamas will stay on as anchor of NBC News NOW's weeknight streaming newscast, \"Top Story with Tom Llamas.\"\n\n\"Tom has the winning combination of journalistic excellence, passionate storytelling and unyielding integrity - all characteristics that have long been trademarks of 'NBC Nightly News,'\" Janelle Rodriguez, NBC News' executive vice president for programming, said in a statement. Llamas will be the first Latino journalist to host the weeknight version of \"Nightly News.\"\n\nLlamas' stewardship of the program follows Holt's announcement last week that he would step away from the show this summer after a decade. Though he'll no longer be the face of \"Nightly News,\" Holt will continue to host \"Dateline NBC,\" the network's prime time newsmagazine.\n\nIn a statement, Llamas praised Holt's tenure at the program's helm, calling him \"a great man and one of the most trusted broadcasters of our time.\"\n\n\"Just like Lester, I promise to be devoted to our viewers and dedicated to the truth,\" Llamas said in a statement. \"I look forward to working with the world class journalists at 'Nightly News' and 'Top Story' to bring viewers the most important stories every night.\"\n\nLlamas kicked off his career at NBC News 25 years ago as an overnight production assistant and rejoined in 2021 as a senior national correspondent.

Holt's \"Nightly News\" averaged 6.1 million viewers.\n\nThe \"CBS Evening News,\" which averaged 4.5 million viewers, recently went through its own anchor transition, with Norah O'Donnell departing the newscast and two anchors, John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois, taking the helm.\n\nNBC did not immediately name Holt's successor, but Tom Llamas - who anchors the network's nightly streaming newscast, \"Top Story,\" and frequently fills in for Holt - is in line for the post.\n\nMonday's announcement indicated that Holt had signed a new long-term contract to remain with the network, but as the leader of one program instead of two.\n\nIn a memo to staffers, Holt said \"I'm excited to report I will be continuing as anchor of Dateline NBC, but for the first time in a fulltime capacity whereby I will be expanding my footprint on the broadcast and crafting Dateline hours on subjects I care deeply about.\"\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "NBC News ousts Ronna McDaniel after network's anchors launch unprecedented on-air rebellion\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFollow:\n\nNBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network's top television anchors over McDaniel's role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\" NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \"After listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\"\n\n\"I want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\" Conde continued. \"While this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\"\n\nAhead of the network's decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel's deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said.\n\nThe reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network.\n\nMcDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nAs head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel told the officials , regarding the certification: \"Do not sign it. ... We will get you attorneys.\"\n\nIn the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \"problems\" and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism.\n\nNBC's announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network's journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \"Meet the Press\" with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring.\n\nFollowing the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News' chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \"I think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\"\n\n\"There's a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\" Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \"gaslighting\" and \"character assassination\" when dealing with the news media.\n\nThe following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \"Morning Joe.\"\n\n\"To be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\" Brzezinski said. \"We hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on 'Morning Joe' in her capacity as a paid contributor.\"\n\nNicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC's \"Deadline: White House,\" later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network's decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy.\n\n\"NBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\" Wallace told viewers.\n\nRachel Maddow - the network's biggest star - later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \"inexplicable.\" Maddow took issue with McDaniel's long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \"fake news,\" and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts.\n\n\"We do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\" she said.\n\n\"And so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn't just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\" she said of McDaniel. \"Someone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn't really work. That this last election wasn't a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\"\n\nThe on-air revolt ensnared NBC's top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel's hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn the wake of Conde's announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network's air, praising the move as \"bold\" and \"strong.\"\n\n\"I think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\" Maddow said. \"That leadership was willing to change on this, I'm grateful to them.\"\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "Takeaways from Biden's interview with NBC News\n\nFollow:\n\nPresident Joe Biden sat for an interview with NBC on Monday, his first interview since the attempted assassination of his political rival former President Donald Trump.\n\nSpeaking with Lester Holt, Biden reiterated that he was grateful Trump survived the shooting, but also pointed toward his opponent's role in raising the temperature of contemporary American political rhetoric.\n\nHe also offered his thoughts on Trump's selection of Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate and continued to downplay concerns about his own performance at the CNN debate last month, emphasizing that he was not going to get out of the race.\n\nHere are some takeaways from the interview:\n\nWhile taking care to express how grateful he is that Trump was not seriously wounded in the shooting, Biden also blamed him for intensifying political rhetoric across the United States.\n\nHe in particular pointed - as he often does - toward his comments after the rally of White supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, and his denial of the results of the 2020 election that led to the 2021 insurrection at the Capitol.\n\n\"Look. There's so much violence now. ... There's no place at all for violence in politics in America. None. Zero. And we've reached the point where it's become too commonplace,\" Biden said. \"Not assassinations, but to talk about, for example, January 6, the attack on the Capitol.\"\n\nHe mentioned he only ran in 2020 because of Trump's comments after Charlottesville.\n\n\"The then-president was asked, what did he think, and he said, 'Very fine people on both sides.' Not fine people on both sides,\" Biden added. \"No excuse. Zero.\"\n\nLater he said, \"I am not engaged in that rhetoric. Now my opponent is engaged in that rhetoric: He talks about it'll be a bloodbath if he loses, talking about how he's going to forgive all the actions, I guess suspend the sentences of all those who were arrested and sentenced to go to jail because of what happened in the Capitol. I'm not out there making fun of like when remember the picture of Donald Trump when Nancy Pelosi's husband was hit with a hammer going - talking - joking about it?\"\n\nBiden offered more details on the conversation he had with Trump in the hours after the shooting that left the former president injured. The president characterized the call as \"very cordial.\"\n\n\"I told him how concerned I was and wanted to make sure I knew how he was actually doing,\" Biden told Holt.\n\nTrump \"sounded good\" on the call, Biden added. \"He said he was fine. And he thanked me for calling him. I told him he was literally in the prayers of Jill and me and his whole family was weathering this.\"\n\nThe president declined to say how he felt the shooting will affect the trajectory of the 2024 presidential race.\n\n\"I don't know, and you don't know, either,\" he told Holt.\n\nBut the president added he was focused Trump's health and safety.\n\n\"I've thought less about the trajectory of the case than two things: One, what his health is, that he's secure, number one. And number two, what happens from here on in terms of the kind of coverage that the president and vice president and former president and new vice president get,\" the president said.\n\nBiden defended himself against criticisms over his rhetoric, which has been put in the spotlight in the aftermath of the assassination attempt but said it was a mistake to say it was \"time to put Trump in a bullseye.\"\n\nBiden made those comments during a call with donors on July 8, during which he said, \"It's time to put Trump in the bullseye,\" according to a summary of the call provided by his campaign.\n\n\"It was a mistake to use the word,\" Biden said.\n\n\"I meant focus on him. Focus on what he's doing. Focus on his policies, focus on the number of lies he told at the debate,\" he said.\n\nBiden sought to turn the conversation back to Trump's own words: \"I'm not the guy that said, 'I want to be a dictator on day one.' I'm not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the election. I'm not the guy who said he won't accept the outcome of this election automatically. You can't only love your country when you win. And so the focus was on what he's saying.\"\n\nThe comments come a day after Biden used a rare Oval Office address to urge Americans to cool the political rhetoric on both sides of the aisle. The White House and campaign have followed suit.\n\nStill, Biden's past language under the microscope. Pressed by Holt on whether he has used inciting language, Biden suggested that it was necessary to characterize Trump as a \"threat to democracy.\"\n\n\"How do you talk about the threat to democracy - which is real - when a president says things like he says? Do you just not say anything - because it may incite somebody?\" he questioned.\n\nBiden said he still feels safe under Secret Service protection in the aftermath of the shooting that wounded Trump and that the agency continued to have his \"full confidence.\"\n\nHe said it was an \"open question\" whether the agency should have anticipated the shooting.\n\n\"I feel safe with the Secret Service,\" Biden said.\n\n\"What we did see was the Secret Service who responded risked their lives, who responded. They were ready to give their lives to the president. The question is should they have anticipated what happened? Should they have done what they needed to do to prevent this from happening? That's a question - that's an open question.\"\n\nThe president also pointed to local law enforcement's role in helping protect the former president on Saturday. The efforts of local agencies have come under scrutiny after it was revealed a local police officer saw the suspect before the shooting began.\n\n\"There's a major piece of this relates to domestic, local law enforcement. They play a large role. ... I'm not saying they weren't competent, either. I'm just saying it's a complicated process,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden's interview took place soon after Trump announced Vance as his running mate at the Republican National Convention. Biden suggested he wasn't surprised by Trump's choice.\n\n\"It's not unusual, he's going to surround himself with people who agree completely with him,\" Biden said.\n\nBut he also took the chance to point out the staunchly anti-Trump views Vance held before he became a senator: \"Even though, if you go back and listen to some of the things JD Vance said about Trump. ...\" Biden said, laughing as he trailed off. (Vance once called Trump \"a moral disaster\" and suggested he could be \"America's Hitler .\")\n\nVice President Kamala Harris reached out to Vance on Monday. The Biden-Harris campaign said the vice president is prepared to debate Vance.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN's MJ Lee and Sam Fossum contributed to this report\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "March 29, 2025: Donald Trump presidency news\n\n• Tariffs loom: Anticipation and concern is growing for the major new tariffs President Donald Trump says will go into effect next week. Canada's prime minister warned Trump of retaliatory measures in a phone call as the trade war heightens tensions between the countries . Trump on Saturday expressed some openness to negotiations on the planned levies, but \"only if people are willing to give us something of great value.\"\n\n• Support amid Signal fallout: Trump reiterated his support for his top national security officials in the aftermath of the Signal text chain in which information about a military operation in Yemen was shared with a reporter. CNN has reported that the entire episode has frustrated Trump, who believes it has marred a strong start to his second term.\n\n• White House eyes Greenland: Trump and Vice President JD Vance have ramped up their rhetoric about seizing control of Greenland . A day after Vance visited the semiautonomous territory, Trump said he \"won't take anything off the table\" to obtain the island. Danish and Greenlandic officials reject the administration's claim that it's an issue of global security.\n\nOur live coverage of the Trump administration's transition has moved here.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Saturday he doesn't care if automakers hike prices because of his tariffs. In fact, he encouraged them to.\n\nAsked by NBC News' Kristen Welker in a phone interview about whether he pressured automakers to avoid raising prices after his 25% tariffs on imported cars and parts go into effect, Trump denied that he told CEOs to control costs.\n\n\"No, I never said that,\" Trump told Welker. \"I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American cars.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Trump held a call this month with auto CEOs and threatened them with even heftier tariffs if they raise prices because of the import taxes. But Trump on Saturday said he hopes his tariffs lead to higher prices, because it will encourage automakers to build their cars and parts in the United States and persuade customers to buy American.\n\n\"I couldn't care less,\" Trump said. \"I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty.\"\n\nTrump said the message he delivered to the CEOs was to shift production back to the United States. Foreign and domestic automakers assemble many of their cars and parts in the United States, but they also make vehicles and parts in Mexico and Canada. For decades, a free trade zone in North America has effectively treated the US, Canada and Mexico as one big country.\n\n\"The message is: 'Congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you're going to make a lot of money. If you don't, you're going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff,'\" Trump told Welker.\n\nA Department of Government Efficiency staffer who resigned last month over racist social media posts is back at the agency and has access to sensitive government systems, according to court documents.\n\nMarko Elez's comeback was revealed as part of a lawsuit brought by labor unions that alleges several federal agencies gave \"unlawful\" access of \"protected data\" to DOGE workers, listing Elez as one of the employees.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been back at DOGE since at least March 5 and has been assigned to the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services, according to the filing. He has access to multiple sensitive systems at HHS, including the database that helps states enforce child support orders, the filing shows.\n\nElez's return, first reported by Politico , comes after President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk - who oversees DOGE - called for him to be brought back . Elez, who previously worked for Musk's company SpaceX, resigned in February on the heels of a Wall Street Journal report that linked him to a social media account with posts supporting racism and eugenics.\n\nThat account posted a call to repeal the Civil Rights Act, an endorsement of a \"eugenic\" immigration policy and repeated anti-Indian screeds within the last year, according to archived posts.\n\n\"I obviously disagree with some of Elez's posts, but I don't think stupid social media activity should ruin a kid's life,\" Vance said on X at the time.\n\nPrior to his resignation, Elez was designated as a \"special government employee\" by the executive branch and had access to the computer system used by the Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service to cut more than $5 trillion in checks for the federal government each year, according to lawyers for the Justice Department.\n\nCNN has reached out to the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services for comment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Saturday that he \"won't take anything off the table\" to obtain Greenland, including military force, but that there is a \"good possibility\" it won't be needed.\n\n\"We'll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,\" Trump told NBC News' Kristen Welker during a phone interview Saturday.\n\nTrump acknowledged there is a \"good possibility that we could do it without military force,\" but emphasized, \"I don't take anything off the table.\"\n\nThe president confirmed he has \"absolutely\" engaged in serious discussions about the potential annexation of Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.\n\nSome background: White House officials have argued that the president's fixation with acquiring Greenland has dual benefits, both economic and for national security. Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric in recent months, insisting his administration will acquire the territory despite Greenland and Denmark repeatedly making clear the island isn't for sale.\n\nTrump's remarks came just one day after Vice President JD Vance's controversial visit to the island, where residents voiced resistance and local leaders declared the visit unwelcome.\n\n\"We want to have good relationships with everybody,\" Vance said during a visit to an American military installation high above the Arctic Circle. \"But part of having good relations is showing your strength when you have to,\" he added at Pituffik Space Base, a US Space Force facility on Greenland's northwestern coast.\n\nPresident Donald Trump reiterated some openness to negotiations on tariffs as he plans to unveil significant reciprocal levies on Wednesday.\n\nAsked by NBC News' Kristen Welker on Saturday whether there was room for negotiation on his planned tariffs, the president said, \"Only if people are willing to give us something of great value. Because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there's no room for negotiation.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly proclaimed April 2 to be \"Liberation Day,\" promising massive reciprocal tariffs that match foreign countries' import taxes dollar-for-dollar on a variety of products. The president has long believed in the use - and the threat - of tariffs as a key negotiation tool.\n\nTrump's Saturday comments come a day after he suggested he could ultimately cut deals on tariffs after they go into place.\n\n\"It's possible if we can get something for the deal - but, you know, we've been taken advantage of for 40 years, maybe more. It's just not going to happen anymore. But yeah, I'm certainly open to it,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One when asked whether he was open to making deals with countries such as the United Kingdom that have discussed reducing tariffs on the US.\n\nPressed on whether that would happen before the tariffs are announced, he said, \"No. Probably later.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday reiterated his support for his top national security officials in the aftermath of the Signal text chain in which almost-certainly-classified information about a military operation in Yemen was shared with Atlantic reporter Jeffrey Goldberg. His message comes as some outlets have reported the president privately mulled firing Mike Waltz, his national security adviser.\n\nAsked by NBC News ' Kristen Welker whether he has confidence in Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Trump said, \"I do and I think it's just a witch hunt and the fake news.\"\n\nThose comments run counter to reporting in The New York Times , which said Saturday that Trump has polled allies and advisers inside and outside the White House this week on Waltz, asking, \"Should I fire him?\"\n\nTrump, The Times reported, has been unhappy with coverage of the situation but did not want to be seen as caving to media.\n\nPressed by Welker on whether there had been discussions about firing Waltz or others, a defiant Trump said, \"Nope, I've never heard that. And nobody else makes that decision but me, and I've never heard it, and I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts.\"\n\nCNN has reported that the entire episode has frustrated Trump, who believes it has marred a strong start to his second term, which has otherwise had a unified and robust messaging operation.\n\nHundreds of \"Tesla Takedown\" demonstrations are taking place in the United States, Canada and Europe as activists ramp up their opposition to CEO Elon Musk's efforts to slash federal government staffing and budgets.\n\nA demonstration that began late this morning outside a Tesla showroom in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, DC, drew a crowd of more than 100 people for a \"Tesla Takedown Dance Party.\" Attendees carried anti-Musk signs and danced to disco music as cars drove by honking in support.\n\nCo-organizers Sara Steffens and Melissa Knutson have helped put together similar protests since Musk's Department of Government Efficiency started its work with the Trump administration.\n\n\"There's a very serious and strategic component in what we're doing. This is a way to say we're not afraid,\" Knutson said.\n\n\"They're not just able to do whatever they want,\" Steffens added. \"They can pretend they can, like bullies do, but they can't have power unless we let them.\"\n\nJames Decherd, a DC native, was also at the protest to show his support for federal workers.\n\n\"I'm just afraid for what kind of country this is going to be after these cuts,\" he said. \"The whole country is at risk of becoming a dystopian hellscape. I don't know what's going to happen,\" he added.\n\nAt another Tesla showroom in nearby Arlington, Virginia, 56-year-old Ed Grass, who has muscular dystrophy, was among a crowd of over 150 protesters.\n\nGrass, who held a sign as he sat in his wheelchair, said he worries about the future of health care research for people like him with life-long conditions.\n\n\"There won't be as many (medical) breakthroughs,\" Grass said. \"We have the jewel of the education system and they're destroying it. ... It's a long-term problem. I may be long gone, but my grandchildren may suffer.\"\n\nThe US will purchase \"badly needed\" icebreaker vessels from Finland, President Donald Trump said Saturday, after he spent part of the day golfing with the country's president, Alexander Stubb.\n\n\"President Stubb and I look forward to strengthening the partnership between the United States and Finland,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post . \"That includes the purchase and development of a large number of badly needed Icebreakers for the U.S., delivering Peace and International Security for our Countries, and the World.\"\n\nThe vessels are critical to Trump's efforts to increase the US' presence in the Arctic, as Russia and China have expanded their footprint in the region. The announcement also comes on the heels of Vice President JD Vance's controversial trip to Greenland and the White House's push for US control of the semiautonomous Danish territory.\n\nAccording to a Finnish readout, the meeting, which included breakfast, a round of golf and lunch, was \"unofficial.\"\n\n\"During the visit, the Presidents discussed among other things the relations between Finland and the United States, and current foreign and security policy issues including Ukraine,\" the Office of the President of Finland said.\n\nEmployees at the United States Institute of Peace received termination letters Friday evening as the Trump administration continues to reimagine the role of the US abroad and dramatically dismantle key parts of the federal government .\n\nA vast majority of the non-profit's staff received termination notices Friday evening, according to a source who was terminated and requested anonymity to speak freely without jeopardizing their severance package.\n\n\"Everyone received a personal letter that outlined that they were terminated as of March 28 and that health care would end March 31,\" the source said, noting employees would be paid for work done through Friday, as well as for any remaining vacation time.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order in February taking aim at the Institute of Peace, identifying it as a target for his goal of reducing federal bureaucracy.\n\nThe role of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in gutting the institute is the subject of an ongoing legal battle .\n\nAbout the institute: It was founded during the Reagan administration and \" promotes research, policy analysis, education, and training on international peace and conflict resolution in an effort to prevent and resolve violent conflicts, and to promote post-conflict stability,\" according to a description on usa.gov. Its official website has been taken down.\n\nRepublican Rep. Victoria Spartz faced another testy crowd at a town hall Saturday - just a day after she was grilled by angry voters at a separate event.\n\nAt the town hall in Muncie, Indiana, Saturday, attendees confronted Spartz about the Trump administration's actions and her past vote against aid for Ukraine, as seen on a livestream of the event.\n\n\"I just wonder why that you don't want to support your own people?\" one attendee asked the Indiana congresswoman, who is the first Ukrainian-born member of Congress .\n\nSpartz has been an advocate for US support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, but has been critical of the Ukrainian government and voted against $61 billion in aid for the country last year.\n\n\"My number one job as an American congresswoman is to protect interests, American interests, and make sure that your money, when we give it to any foreign power is -\" she started to say, before the crowd interrupted her. She continued: \"Let me answer the question ... that all of the money that we are spending for any causes has a proper strategy.\"\n\nSpartz was repeatedly interrupted by shouting throughout the rest of the event.\n\nIt was the second time in as many days Spartz faced angry constituents. This was the reception at a town hall the previous night in Westfield when she responded to a question about the Trump administration's Signal chat debacle :\n\nRep. Victoria Spartz (R-IN) received an overwhelmingly negative reaction to her answer about whether she will call on Pete Hegseth to resign as secretary of defense.\n\nMore context: Republican lawmakers across the country have faced a tough reception at an increasing number of town halls , where voters have voiced their displeasure with President Donald Trump's actions during his first 100 days in office. Democrats have also faced riled-up crowds over what constituents say is a lack of sufficient resistance.\n\nTourists strolled the National Mall on Saturday as the famous cherry blossoms reached peak bloom. But the trees weren't the only thing changing, as President Donald Trump sets his sights on the Smithsonian museums and America's culture wars.\n\nIn an executive order signed Thursday, Trump broadened his influence over American arts and cultural institutions, claiming the institution has \"come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology\" in recent years.\n\nTrump is also targeting upcoming exhibits related to transgender people coming to the American Women's History Museum.\n\nThrough the executive order, Vice President JD Vance was put in charge of cutting government funding on \"exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with\" federal law.\n\nMuseum-goers at the National Mall Saturday expressed differing opinions on the order.\n\n\"I would disagree with the administration's view that there's ideological division promoted by knowing the full truth of our history,\" Todd Shaw, of South Carolina, told CNN's Brian Todd.\n\nAnother attendee, who asked to be anonymous, expressed support for the executive order, saying she doesn't believe American tax dollars should fund an exhibit about oppression of marginalized groups.\n\n\"All lives matter, in my opinion. So that's a way of just dividing into little pockets against each other,\" she said. \"And I don't think we should pay for any of those exhibits as a taxpayer.\"\n\nHundreds of \"Tesla Takedown\" demonstrations are taking place in the United States, Canada and Europe as activists ramp up their opposition to CEO Elon Musk's efforts to slash federal government staffing and budgets .\n\nHow we got here: Working with the Trump administration, Musk has aggressively pushed policies to reduce spending, curb regulations and downsize the workforce as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, all while repeatedly misleading the public about federal spending.\n\nToday's protests: More than 200 demonstrations are planned at US Tesla locations on Saturday as part of the \"Tesla Takedown\" movement, which called for a \"global day of action\" aiming for 500 protests worldwide. The campaign wants people to sell their Tesla vehicles and their shares of Tesla stock as a way to denounce Musk, the world's richest man, whose wealth is overwhelmingly linked to his Tesla holdings.\n\nThe big picture: Since Musk's controversial alignment with the Trump administration, Tesla has transformed from an innovative car brand to a symbol of injustice in the eyes of critics - and a prime target for escalating acts of vandalism and violence .\n\nCatch up on the protests here.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday shared a video on social media of Faye Hall, the freed American woman who had been detained in Afghanistan by the Taliban since February.\n\n\"Thank you for bringing me home. I've never been so proud to be an American citizen,\" Hall said in the video posted by Trump, expressing her gratitude to the president and saying she was \"so glad\" he was in office.\n\nHall also took a moment to acknowledge the women still detained in Afghanistan.\n\n\"They're waiting for you to come and set them free,\" Hall said in her message.\n\n\"Thank you, Faye - So honored by your words!\" Trump's post read , accompanied by the video of Hall.\n\nHall was released Thursday \"following a court order and with logistical support from Qatar,\" which has been mediating on the US' behalf, a source told CNN. She was detained in the country on charges of using a drone without authorization.\n\nHall's release comes after Trump envoy Adam Boehler and former Trump official Zalmay Khalilzad traveled to Kabul to secure the release of American George Glezmann , which was also mediated by Qatar.\n\nCNN's Alireza Hajihosseini and Tara John contributed reporting to this post.\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association is reversing course and canceling its plans to have comedian Amber Ruffin headline this year's annual fundraising dinner in Washington, DC.\n\nInstead, the association says it will celebrate the First Amendment and the free press.\n\n\"At this consequential moment for journalism, I want to ensure the focus is not on the politics of division but entirely on awarding our colleagues for their outstanding work and providing scholarship and mentorship to the next generation of journalists,\" the association's president, Eugene Daniels, wrote in a memo Saturday.\n\nSome context: The change is a tacit acknowledgment of the growing tensions between the association - which represents White House correspondents from dozens of news outlets - and President Donald Trump .\n\nThe association has been under severe pressure this year as the Trump White House has banned The Associated Press from some events and taken control of press pool assignments , all part of a broader effort to assert power and clamp down on independent news coverage. White House correspondents aren't exactly in a celebratory mood.\n\nSome members of the association were privately concerned about the fallout if a comedian who is harshly critical of Trump served as the evening's entertainment, televised and streamed live in prime time.\n\nRead more about the decision here.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly proclaimed April 2 to be \"Liberation Day,\" promising massive reciprocal tariffs that match foreign countries' import taxes dollar-for-dollar on a variety of products.\n\nTrump already announced this week that a new 25% tariff on all cars shipped to the US would take effect overnight Wednesday into Thursday.\n\nBut with the mid-week deadline fast approaching, there is still plenty of uncertainty surrounding the president's tariff plans.\n\nHere's where things currently stand:\n\nRecent whiplash:\n\nThe auto tariffs:\n\nMarket unease:\n\nFederal judges delivered a series of rulings that could challenge President Donald Trump's agenda, with the decisions coming in quick succession yesterday evening.\n\nIf you didn't catch the news Friday, here's what you should know:\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday signed a memorandum aimed at shrinking the Department of Defense's civilian workforce, according to a news release.\n\nThe memo states that the reduction in civilian positions will increase resources to areas \"where we need them most,\" and help \"supercharge our American warfighters.\"\n\nThe move reactivated the deferred resignation program and offered voluntary early retirement for all eligible employees, per the release. Employees were previously offered buyouts and early resignations as part of a program in January.\n\nThe memo didn't specify the number of civilian positions to be cut, but the department announced in February it planned to ultimately let go 5 to 8% of the military's approximately 950,000 civilian employees.\n\n\"Exemptions should be rare,\" Hegseth said in the memo. \"My intent is to maximize participation so that we can minimize the number of involuntary actions that may be required to achieve the strategic objectives.\"\n\nMore on Trump's Pentagon: The president's major military mission at the southern border, focused on reducing immigration and drug flows, has already cost taxpayers more than $300 million , according to sources briefed on data from the Defense Department, even as the administration pursues its goal of trimming the department's budget.\n\nMegadonors from both parties are directing millions to Wisconsin's high-stakes Supreme Court race , which is set to decide ideological control of the battleground state's high court.\n\nTech billionaire Elon Musk is flexing his growing political influence after his key supporting role in President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign, and the race is viewed as a potential bellwether for how voters are receiving Trump's return to the White House.\n\nMusk is traveling to the state: Musk says he'll be in Wisconsin Sunday for an event naming the winners of million-dollar giveaways orchestrated by his super PAC to reward petition signees, reprising a controversial tactic he used in last year's election. He and groups he's funded in the past have poured millions into the race.\n\nMusk's commitment to the Wisconsin contest amounts to a demonstration of the financial firepower he can bring to the 2026 midterms.\n\nAds shape the race: Ads for the liberal candidate, Judge Susan Crawford, have sought to tie the conservative candidate, Judge Brad Schimel, to potentially unpopular policies linked to the Trump administration, including the overturning of Roe v. Wade and Musk's role in Trump's sweeping federal government overhaul.\n\nSchimel and his supporters, meanwhile, have leaned into tough-on-crime messaging and sharp criticism of some of Crawford's rulings.\n\nMeanwhile, a legal battle: Wisconsin's Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul is suing Elon Musk's super PAC over the legality of his million-dollar giveaways under state election law.\n\nIn an interesting twist, Crawford was assigned the case in Dane County Circuit Court, but has recused herself given the ongoing contest.\n\nCNN's Arlette Saenz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nThe Danish foreign minister scolded the Trump administration today for its \"tone\" in criticizing Denmark and Greenland , saying his country is already investing more into Arctic security and remains open to more cooperation with the United States.\n\nForeign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen made the remarks in a video posted to social media after US Vice President JD Vance's Friday visit to the strategic island.\n\n\"Many accusations and many allegations have been made. And of course we are open to criticism,\" Rasmussen said speaking in English. \"But let me be completely honest: we do not appreciate the tone in which it is being delivered. This is not how you speak to your close allies. And I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.\"\n\nGetting up to speed? Here's a breakdown of remarks from Vance and President Donald Trump yesterday, which amounted to their most high-profile play to date for control of the semiautonomous Danish territory.\n\nWe have a fresh slate of reads for your Saturday morning, with the latest on President Donald Trump's first 100 days and the reverberations his administration is causing throughout the country.\n\n• The cost of Trump's border military mission : The Trump administration's major military mission at the southern border, focused on reducing immigration and drug flows, has already cost taxpayers more than $300 million, according to sources briefed on data from the Defense Department.\n\n• Families face deportation after decades in US : In the face of Trump's immigration crackdown, some longtime US residents who have visas, work permits or green cards face possible deportation. Though they've been building a life in the country for decades they might soon leave it all behind.\n\n• Trump grapples with Signal chat debacle : As Trump's advisers this week took on the unenviable task of informing him a journalist he loathes was inadvertently added to a group chat discussing secret attack plans, one key detail required further explanation: Before Monday, Trump said he had never heard of Signal.\n\n• The hours following a PhD student's arrest : Tufts University PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk was walking to a dinner where she'd break her 13-hour Ramadan fast when six plainclothes officers suddenly encircled her on the street near her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts. Read this for a deeper look at the hours that followed for Ozturk, and some context on the administration's detention of students from prominent US universities.\n\n• Democratic fundraising platform in the crosshairs : ActBlue, a fundraising juggernaut for liberal candidates and causes, is facing stepped-up scrutiny and criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill and other Trump allies, including Elon Musk.\n\nThe head of the US Food and Drug Administration's department responsible for assuring the safety and effectiveness of vaccines resigned last night, according to a resignation letter obtained by CNN.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, was forced out of his job, having been given the choice to resign or be fired.\n\nThe news of Marks' resignation was first reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal .\n\n\"It has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,\" Marks wrote in his letter, referring to US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nMarks' resignation takes effect April 5.\n\nIn an email, an HHS official told CNN: \"If Peter Marks does not want to get behind restoring science to its golden standard and promoting radical transparency, then he has no place at FDA under the strong leadership of Secretary Kennedy.\"\n\nMarks was instrumental in carrying out \" Operation Warp Speed \" - the federal government's Covid-19 vaccine program. He has overseen the approval of more recent vaccines as well, including the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration, providing a new option for protection against seasonal flu.\n\nYesterday marked the White House's highest-profile pitch to date for American control of Greenland, with Vice President JD Vance making a controversial visit to the island and President Donald Trump backing him up at home.\n\nIf you missed yesterday's whirlwind, here's how it played out:\n\nVance's (unwelcome) visit: What the White House initially characterized as a visit by second lady Usha Vance to learn more about the culture of Greenland quickly became contentious earlier this week, with the outgoing leader of the semiautonomous Danish territory describing the US visit as \"highly aggressive\" in light of Trump's annexation goals.\n\nAs Vance watched the outrage over his wife's trip grow, he decided to join her. The Vances visited the remote US Space Force outpost at Pituffik, 1,000 miles from the capital of Nuuk.\n\nGreeting enthusiastic US troops, the vice president steered well clear of a likely different reception in civilian population centers.\n\nWhat Vance said: In a speech from the base, the vice president said Denmark had neglected the security of its territory and that America could no longer ignore alleged Russian and Chinese designs on the island.\n\nHe repeatedly claimed the island was vulnerable and that the United States had \"no other option\" than to ramp up its presence there - a move he argued would also ensure safety for the island's population.\n\nMeanwhile, at the White House: Addressing reporters, Trump said Friday that the US has \"to have Greenland\" for the sake of security. Trump argued control over the territory is a matter of peace \"for the entire world,\" not just the United States, given its strategic location and the presence of warships off its coasts.\n\nHow this is being received: Greenlandic politicians have repeatedly signaled they are opposed to annexation, and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has urged Trump to respect \"the fundamental rules of sovereignty.\"\n\nA newspaper poll in January found that 85% of Greenlanders did not want to become part of the US, Reuters reported.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

He informed staff that he will return to \"writing and producing TV and movies,\" which, besides news, Oppenheim described as his \"other love.\"\n\nConde said Oppenheim will develop shows and other longform content with NBCUniversal.

But on Wednesday he also appointed himself as the effective president of NBC News.\n\nAfter Noah Oppenheim - who has led the network during a tumultuous period in the media industry and through Donald Trump's chaotic presidency - told staff that he would vacate the role of NBC News president in favor of returning to screenwriting, Conde disclosed his succession plan .\n\nBut the NBCU News Group boss notably declined to select a single successor to oversee the sizable portfolio of Oppenheim. Instead, Conde moved to split the role up amongst a team of three executives.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nRebecca Blumenstein, a deputy managing editor of The New York Times, will assume a swath of Oppenheim's duties, taking on a newly created role as president of editorial at the network. Blumenstein has a lengthy history working in print, but glaringly lacks experience in television news. She will oversee some of NBC News' television portfolio, such as \"Meet the Press,\" but will not have purview over the two cornerstone programs, the \"Today\" show franchise and \"NBC Nightly News.\"\n\nRelated article NBC News president Noah Oppenheim exits, replaced by new head of editorial and two others in network shakeup\n\nThose duties will fall to the other two executives that Conde has elevated to run the NBC News portfolio: Libby Leist and Janelle Rodriguez, two longtime network executives who both received promotions to executive vice president. Leist will continue to oversee \"Today\" and Rodriguez will oversee \"Nightly\" and NBC News NOW.\n\nAll three executives - Blumenstein, Leist, and Rodriguez - will report directly to Conde, making him the ultimate network boss.\n\n\"The appointments of Rebecca, Libby and Janelle provide a powerful foundation for the News Group as it continues to grow its leadership position,\" Conde said in a press release announcing the news, adding that \"the extraordinary accomplishments of Rebecca, Libby and Janelle and their visions will keep us on the path of continued success.\"\n\nInside NBC News, the announcement puzzled some staffers, according to people familiar with the matter. \"It is certainly leading to some head scratching around the newsroom,\" as one person put it.\n\nOf course, there is another way to look at the decision to divide Oppenheim's portfolio amongst three executives: linear television is dying and the days in which a heavyweight, singular television news executive reigned over a fiefdom are rapidly coming to a close.\n\nAs one former television news executive put it Wednesday evening, the industry has a case of the \"incredible shrinking news president.\"\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Trump responded that \"that's one\" method.\n\n\"But there are others, too,\" Trump added.\n\nAsked to share another method, Trump simply responded \"no.\"\n\nAmending the Constitution to abolish the two-term limit would be exceedingly difficult, requiring either a two-thirds vote of Congress or two-thirds of the states agreeing to call a constitutional convention to propose changes. Either route would then require ratification from three-quarters of the states.\n\nThe president pointed to his poll numbers, saying that \"a lot of people would like me to\" hold office for a third term.\n\nTrump has previously commented on running for a third term in office, though Republicans have seen these comments as jokes or the president trolling his critics.\n\nRep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., crafted a resolution calling for the extension of presidential term limits, which would allow Trump to seek another term in office.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump ally Steve Bannon said in an interview on News Nation that he believes Trump will \"run and win again in 2028.\" Bannon said in the same interview that he thought \"we'll have a couple of alternatives\" in determining how Trump could seek a third term despite the two-term maximum for holding the presidency.\n\nThe White House has amplified Trump's comments likening himself to royalty, posting a picture of a fake magazine cover depicting the president with a crown after the administration shot down congestion pricing in New York City.\n\nThe White House's post to X quoted Trump's previous comments on Truth Social: \"LONG LIVE THE KING!\"\n\nKristen Welker is the moderator of \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nMegan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

It's another shutdown week in Washington. We have the latest on where things stand ahead of Friday's government funding deadline. Plus, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy headed to Saudi Arabia, Alexander Smith examines how the country has become an unexpected diplomatic force.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n- Adam Wollner\n\nStop me if you've heard this one before: Congress is racing to avoid a government shutdown days out from the funding deadline.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson released a stopgap bill over the weekend to keep the government's lights on through the end of September. The measure, which Democrats had no part in crafting, includes an increase in military spending and a reduction in nondefense money, as Sahil Kapur, Scott Wong and Frank Thorp V report .\n\nIt will need to pass the GOP-led House and Senate and be signed into law by President Donald Trump before midnight Friday to avert a shutdown.\n\nThere are two major questions that will determine whether that becomes a reality.\n\nCan Johnson unite House Republicans? Johnson is eyeing a Tuesday vote in the House on the continuing resolution - and says he's relying solely on the support of Republicans to pass it.\n\nThat's a tall order in the House, where Republicans hold a 218-214 majority. That means Johnson can afford only one defection, assuming all Democrats oppose the bill and all members are present. And he's already likely lost one vote: Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., has made clear he won't support the stopgap bill.\n\nThe challenge for Johnson will be keeping other conservative fiscal hawks in the fold, as well as Republicans who would prefer to see a bigger boost for defense spending. As he did during his speaker's race and the budget resolution vote earlier this year, Johnson has a key voice in his corner: Trump, who has publicly urged congressional Republicans to support the continuing resolution.\n\nSome House Democrats could end up supporting the bill and give Johnson more breathing room, but the party's leaders in the chamber are against the measure.\n\nWill Senate Democrats vote for it? If the bill manages to make its way out of the House, the pressure would then fall on Senate Democrats.\n\nRepublicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they will need support from Democrats to cross the 60-vote threshold. And like in the House, a Kentucky Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, has already said he will vote against it.\n\nDemocrats have demanded guardrails on Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk's attempts to slash federal spending, and they are under pressure from their base to more forcefully stand up to the administration.\n\nThe stopgap funding bill is one of the few major pieces of legislation they will have some leverage on this year in GOP-controlled Washington.

Vote in our poll:\n\nSaudi Arabia will host a key summit Tuesday between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is trying to repair relations with Washington following his disastrous Oval Office bust-up with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.\n\nIt's another soft-power coup for a country that has deliberately cultivated a reputation as a diplomatic go-between. Whether it's hosting American officials for negotiations to end the Ukraine war, orchestrating talks about the future of Gaza or rolling out the red carpet for Trump's first foreign trip, Saudi Arabia has emerged in recent years as an unlikely global powerbroker.\n\nLess than five years ago, then-presidential hopeful Joe Biden called the kingdom a \"pariah\" and, even after significant reforms, rights groups say the authoritarian Gulf state still has an \"abysmal\" human rights record.\n\nTuesday's summit comes as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is attempting to transform Saudi Arabia's image from a deeply conservative, oil-rich theocracy whose officials murdered the American-based Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, into a regional giant built on diplomacy, business, tourism, entertainment and sports.\n\nTrump revealed last week that the first foreign visit of his second term would be to Saudi Arabia, just as it was during his first administration. As then, he said that, in return, the Saudis had agreed to invest a bonanza sum in American businesses, this time $1 trillion.\n\nThis relationship has raised questions about ties between Riyadh and the Trump family. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the former chair of the Senate Finance Committee, last year raised \"obvious conflicts of interest concerns\" about Saudi Arabia's $2 billion investment in a fund run by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has denied any such conflict.\n\nRead more →\n\nMore on the Russia-Ukraine war: Courtney Kube, Kristen Welker and Carol E.

      "text": "Tokyo marks 80th anniversary of U.S. firebombing that killed 100,000 in a single night\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nTOKYO - More than 100,000 people were killed in a single night 80 years ago Monday in the U.S. firebombing of Tokyo . The attack, made with conventional bombs, destroyed downtown Tokyo and filled the streets with heaps of charred bodies.\n\nThe damage was comparable to the atomic bombings a few months later in August 1945, but unlike those attacks, the Japanese government has not provided aid to victims and the events of that day have largely been ignored or forgotten.\n\nElderly survivors are making a last-ditch effort to tell their stories and push for financial assistance and recognition. Some are speaking out for the first time, trying to tell a younger generation about their lessons.\n\nShizuyo Takeuchi, 94, says her mission is to keep telling the history she witnessed at 14, speaking out on behalf of those who died.\n\nOn the night of March 10, 1945, hundreds of B-29s raided Tokyo, dumping cluster bombs with napalm specially designed with sticky oil to destroy traditional Japanese-style wood and paper homes in the crowded \"shitamachi\" downtown neighborhoods.\n\nTakeuchi and her parents had lost their own home in an earlier firebombing in February and were taking shelter at a relative's riverside home. Her father insisted on crossing the river in the opposite direction from where the crowds were headed, a decision that saved the family. Takeuchi remembers walking through the night beneath a red sky. Orange sunsets and sirens still make her uncomfortable.\n\nBy the next morning, everything had burned. Two blackened figures caught her eyes. Taking a closer look, she realized one was a woman and what looked like a lump of coal at her side was her baby. \"I was terribly shocked. ... I felt sorry for them,\" she said. \"But after seeing so many others I was emotionless in the end.\"\n\nMany of those who didn't burn to death quickly jumped into the Sumida River and were crushed or drowned.\n\nMore than 105,000 people were estimated to have died that night. A million others became homeless. The death toll exceeds those killed in the Aug. 9, 1945, atomic bombing of Nagasaki.\n\nBut the Tokyo firebombing has been largely eclipsed by the two atomic bombings. And firebombings on dozens of other Japanese cities have received even less attention.\n\nThe bombing came after the collapse of Japanese air and naval defenses following the U.S. capture of a string of former Japanese strongholds in the Pacific that allowed B-29 Superfortress bombers to easily hit Japan's main islands. There was growing frustration in the United States at the length of the war and past Japanese military atrocities.\n\nAi Saotome has a house full of notes, photos and other material her father left behind when he died at age 90 in 2022. Her father, Katsumoto Saotome, was an award-winning writer and a Tokyo firebombing survivor. He gathered accounts of his peers to raise awareness of the civilian deaths and the importance of peace.\n\nSaotome says the sense of urgency that her father and other survivors felt is not shared among younger generations.\n\nThough her father published books on the Tokyo firebombing and its victims, going through his raw material gave her new perspectives and an awareness of Japan's aggression during the war.\n\nShe is digitalizing the material at the Center of the Tokyo Raids and War Damage, a museum her father opened in 2002 after collecting records and artifacts about the attack.\n\n\"Our generation doesn't know much about (the survivors') experience, but at least we can hear their stories and record their voices,\" she said. \"That's the responsibility of our generation.\"\n\n\"In about 10 years, when we have a world where nobody remembers anything (about this), I hope these documents and records can help,\" Saotome said.\n\nPostwar governments have provided 60 trillion yen ($405 billion) in welfare support for military veterans and bereaved families, and medical support for survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nCivilian victims of the U.S. firebombings received nothing.\n\nA group of survivors who want government recognition of their suffering and financial help met earlier this month, renewing their demands.\n\nNo government agency handles civilian survivors or keeps their records. Japanese courts rejected their compensation demands of 11 million yen ($74,300) each, saying citizens were supposed to endure suffering in emergencies like war. A group of lawmakers in 2020 compiled a draft proposal of a half million-yen ($3,380 ) one-time payment, but the plan has stalled due to opposition from some ruling party members.\n\n\"This year will be our last chance,\" Yumi Yoshida, who lost her parents and sister in the bombing, said at a meeting, referring to the 80th anniversary of Japan's WWII defeat.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

He has served as principal anchor of \"Dateline\" since September 2011.\n\n\"A smile comes to my face when I think that with Nightly News, and Dateline, I have now anchored two of the most successful and iconic television news programs in broadcast history,\" Holt wrote in a note Monday to \"Nightly\" and \"Dateline\" staffers. \"As a 20-year-old radio reporter on the police beat chasing breaking news around San Francisco, I could never have imagined my career path would unfold in the way it has. What an amazing ride.\"\n\nIn his 10 years at the helm of \"Nightly News,\" Holt covered the defining events of the era, including the political rise of President Donald Trump, the Covid pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel and the war in Gaza.\n\nIn recent months, Holt co-anchored the network's coverage of election night, traveled to Iran for an exclusive interview with President Masoud Pezeshkian and helmed a \"Dateline\" special about the devastating 2025 Los Angeles wildfires.\n\nHolt's interviews with world leaders regularly made headlines and set the news agenda. He spoke one-on-one with Trump, former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Barack Obama, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other key figures.\n\nHolt frequently traveled to areas hit by deadly hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and mass shootings.\n\n\"He has led the network during some of the country's most fraught and challenging times in the past decade,\" Janelle Rodriguez, executive vice president of programming for NBC News, wrote in a message to staff. \"Quite simply, Lester is the beating heart of this news organization.\"\n\nHe has been named the \"most-trusted television news personality in America\" two consecutive times, according to polls from The Hollywood Reporter and Morning Consult. \"Nightly News\" is consistently a top television show each week, averaging around 7 million viewers.\n\nHolt also anchors \"Nightly News: Kids Edition,\" an Emmy-nominated digital newscast geared toward informing and educating children.\n\nHolt, who joined NBC News in 2000, took the helm of \"Nightly News\" from veteran broadcaster Brian Williams, who exited the show after drawing intense criticism for embellishing the details of a helicopter attack in Iraq. Holt was named permanent anchor of the flagship program on June 18, 2015.\n\nHolt arrived at the network after more than a decade at the WBBM-TV station in Chicago, where he served as the afternoon and evening news anchor. He started his television journalism career as a reporter at WCBS-TV in New York in 1981. The following year, Holt moved to Los Angeles to report for KCBS-TV (then known as KNXT) before heading back to WCBS in 1984.\n\nHe has received various industry honors, including Emmy Awards and, in 2019, the esteemed Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.\n\nDaniel Arkin is a national reporter at NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

He pointed, though, to the success of the networkâs free streaming news channel, NBC News Now, as evidence of consumer demand for high-quality video.\n\nNBCâs roots, Conde said, are in âfree journalism for mass audiences â thatâs not going to change.â And he stressed that the âbest journalismâ will remain free.\n\nâBut in addition to that, we think thereâs an opportunity to provide a premium experience for subscriptions here,â Conde added.\n\nConde oversees the NBC network at its most unstable point in years. NBCUniversal is in the midst of a yearlong spinoff of its cable and broadcast assets, a task that reduces NBCâs reach in television, but allows parent company Comcast to keep itself from being dragged down by the rapidly declining cable TV business.\n\nAnd while NBC has attempted to improve its image among right-leaning viewers â it lobbied hard to host a Republican primary television debate â its programming decisions, such as the hiring and subsequent firing of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, alienated some conservatives and Democrats.\n\nIn a social media post earlier this month, US President Donald Trump went after Comcast chief Brian Roberts, calling him a âlowlife,â and vaguely suggested that he should be punished for the content on the broadcast networks.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

      "text": "Media\n\nWelcome to Semafor Media, where Iâm currently laid over at OâHare en route â sorry! â from Des Moines to Davos in the Swiss Alps, where the weather is better.\n\nThe Hotel Fort Des Moines, where I began writing this essay, is the old center of the Iowa caucus media scene. Here the Washington Starâs Mary McGrory fired off goofy telegrams while covering the â56 campaign, Bob Dole stomped around in â88, and Bill Clinton dropped into the lobby Chequers Lounge on New Yearâs Eve 2008. But by then the grand hotelâs only remaining charm was that you were allowed to smoke in the guest rooms. It closed a few years later, and the media scene migrated to a soulless Marriott lobby.\n\nBut 20th century glamour is back in fashion, and the Fort Des Moines reopened recently as a splendid monument to its old glory. Think Rockefeller Center surrounded by frozen parking lots.\n\nItâs again the center of the caucus media crowd diminished by the bleak news business, the bleak weather, and the bleak primary season.\n\nStill, things felt almost normal. Friday night, the Washington Post crew (motto: âDemocracy Dies In Darknessâ) dined at the hotel restaurant with Donald Trumpâs garrulous co-campaign manager, Chris LaCivita. Saturday, two low-profile women running Nikki Haleyâs campaign sat quietly in the lobby while a crowd gathered for Trump himself to sweep in out of the cold, then wave and ignore questions. That evening, LaCivita could be seen trying to extricate himself from conversation with the pro-Trump influencer Laura Loomer, who then dined a couple of tables away from DeSantis Twitter warrior Christina Pushaw, exchanging angry tweets.\n\nReporters milled around the lobby and basement bar, filing, drinking, buttonholing accommodating campaign officials. Like any other campaign year, really, only a little lower stress, a little nicer, because everyone seems to assume Donald Trump will walk to victory.\n\nOne top Trump campaign official did tell Shelby Talcott and me he thought Trump had an 85% chance at the nomination. That prompted me to get back on a recent hobbyhorse and start ranting again in the direction of a Post Democracy Team scout that I wish the media would spend a bit more energy covering the small-d democracy of Haleyâs run, even if that means postponing stories about the risks to big-D Democracy of an allegedly inevitable Trump victory.\n\nAnd now off to Davos, where we global financial elites hope to placate right-wing populists by tiptoeing away from the decade of promises about climate, race, and economic inequality they made to placate progressives. Sign up for the Semafor Davos Daily to peer into the place.\n\nAlso today: Podcasts. (Scoop count: 5)\n\nSemafor will be in Davos this week, again producing the definitive daily newsletter for the global power elite and everyone who loves to hate them. Sign up here.\n\nIf you read one thing about the future of political media , make it this piece by Semaforâs Dave Weigel and Shelby Talcott on how Ron DeSantisâ disastrous relationship with the media was an early, deliberate experiment in cutting out the traditional media. Unsuccessful, but likely a sign of things to come. But when?\n\nTHE NEWS\n\nApple has quietly tightened its reporting of how many people listen to podcasts, sending shock waves through an embattled audio industry still reeling from the end of the COVID-era production bubble.\n\nThe shift, Apple wrote in a blog post, was technical: The dominant podcasting platform had begun switching off automatic downloads for users who havenât listened to five episodes of a show in the last two weeks.\n\nBut while few users noticed the shift, some of the biggest podcasts in the world saw their official listener numbers drop dramatically. Long-running shows that publish frequently were hit particularly hard. A user who listened to a show like The New York Timesâ The Daily a few times, subscribed, but stopped listening would continue to count as a download indefinitely. Even better under the old rules: For people who listened to a show, dropped off for a while, but started listening again later, Apple would automatically download every show in between. The arrangement drove big download numbers, a crucial metric for ad sales and a sign of the vast reach of podcasts as a medium.\n\nFor instance, The Daily and Dateline both publicly touted reaching over a billion total downloads . But representatives for these shows would not say if those numbers or other impressive daily or weekly download stats are still accurate, though several of the biggest podcasts acknowledged privately to Semafor that they had seen noticeable declines, and were still trying to determine the actual size of their audience following the change.\n\nThe shift came with no immediate warning. People who work on audio at The New York Times, NPR, and other major publishers told Semafor they were surprised by the September change, which had been years in the making but came with no advanced warning from Apple. One podcast network told Semafor it had seen its downloads drop between single digits and low double digits depending on the show. Another well-known podcaster and executive said for some shows, the decline in downloads was as high as 40%.\n\nâNearly every podcast that regularly publishes got an enormous haircut,â one podcast industry insider said.\n\nRead on for what podcasters are saying and Max's View . â\n\nRead on for what podcasters are saying and Max's View . â\n\nJohn OâNolan is the founder of the publishing platform Ghost, a technically powerful, non-profit-owned operation that had apparently been eclipsed by Substack, but has benefitted from the fights over content moderation currently roiling the venture-backed Substack.\n\nRace team cut: Last week, we reported that NBC News quietly laid off several dozen staffers . Among those on the chopping block were three employees comprising the companyâs Racial Equality and Justice vertical which was established in the wake of George Floydâs murder by police in 2020. According to two people with knowledge of the cuts, the outletâs three-person REJ team were all dismissed on Thursday.\n\nItâs the latest indication of corporate media backing away from the diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives taken in the months after Floydâs killing in 2020 (a trend that NBC News has covered ).\n\nA spokesperson for NBC strongly disputed this framing, pointing out that the news outlet continued to invest heavily in its diversity verticals including NBCBLK, NBC Asian American, NBC Latino, and NBC Out. The spokesperson noted that other TV news networks such as CBS and ABC didnât come close in terms of commitment to telling stories about minority and marginalized communities. âOur coverage of race, inequality, justice and culture issues has evolved and grown immensely over the last few years and is a central editorial focus of NBC News. We have reporters, editors, and producers throughout our newsroom covering these issues every day, including more than a dozen in our four diversity verticals â NBC Asian America, NBCBLK, NBC Latino and NBC Out â which have produced more than 2,000 articles in the last year, totaling an average of 100 million page views. Thatâs in addition to the award-winning and high impact reports on these issues by our enterprise and national reporting teams and our digital documentary unit.â\n\nContested âvictory tourâ: HuffPost and the White House have been engaged in a tense back-and-forth over a spokespersonâs comment that quotes in a recent HuffPost story about a potential Gaza peace deal were âmade up.â On Friday, Akbar Shahid Ahmed reported that White House official Brett McGurk has been pitching national security officials on a plan that would normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia and incentivize aid from Gulf countries to rebuild Gaza, in exchange for Palestinian leaders agreeing to ratchet down criticism of Israel and form a new government for both Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nAfter the story was published, the White House issued a statement attributed to National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson saying that Ahmedâs story was ânot trueâ and included âmade up quotes from U.S. officials.â In a note to White House National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby obtained by Semafor, HuffPost executive editor Whitney Snyder said that he was âdeeply dismayedâ by the NSCâs assertion, and asked for a retraction and apology.\n\nâThis is an outrageous and false allegation,â he wrote. âHuffPost takes seriously the perspectives of the subjects of our reporting. Wrongly accusing us of professional malpractice is completely inappropriate and raises serious questions about the credibility of the White House and its statements to the press.â\n\nOn Sunday, an NSC spokesperson told Semafor that HuffPost had misunderstood its response. The spokesperson clarified that the White Houseâs comment specifically referred to one element of the story in which the online news outlet cited a document outlining a plan for a âvictory tourâ if the U.S. is able to help normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nâThe article in question purports to characterize what the reporter describes as a âTop Secretâ document,â the spokesperson said. âIt also quotes from that purported document, ascribing those quotes to a senior U.S. official. Those quotes appear nowhere in any document that we have prepared and have never been stated by anyone at the National Security Council. We stand by our comment.â\n\nStill, that clarification didnât satisfy HuffPost. In a response shared with the White House and obtained by Semafor, Snyder said the NSCâs clarification on Sunday was a âmarked departure from yesterdayâs comment, which was a broad rejection of HuffPostâs entire story and an allegation that Akbar fabricated multiple quotes from multiple officials. To suggest that we misunderstood the plain language of that response defies common sense. It is deeply disappointing to see you stand by such a damaging statement. HuffPost stands by this story, including our sourceâs description of a document outlining a plan for a Gaza-related Saudi-Israeli pact.â\n\nCold feet: Aside from the Hotel Fort Des Moines, the hottest place to be in Iowa is the REI store in Des Moines. Reporters and politicos unprepared for the freezing temps and blizzard conditions have descended on the outdoors shop over the past several days, looking for snow boots and more to get them through the week, one attendant told Semaforâs Shelby Talcott as she (also unprepared) blew $104.93 on a nice warm pair of boots she swears she would never otherwise wear and is now trying to expense. Weâre on the fence about it.\n\nReexamination: The Washington Examiner has been doing a lot of reexamining of its latest web rollout. Last week, the conservative media publication debuted a major web redesign intended to modernize its online layout. But sources told Semafor that the move was plagued by bugs and mishaps. Staffers were frustrated as major scoops disappeared from the site and 404 error pages appeared for prominent author pages, including those for Sen. Tom Cotton and former Vice President Mike Pence. The new update also appeared to misattribute bylines in absurd ways: Articles attributed to Ronald Beaty were actually written by writer Jesse Adams, and the site credited an obituary written about P.J. OâRourke toâ¦Rep. Jim Jordan. As of Saturday evening, the masthead page labeled every staffer ânickmidtc.â\n\nAccording to people with knowledge of the situation, the site doesnât appear poised to have the issues fixed before the Republican presidential primary caucuses next week. In an internal Slack channel on Friday, a Washington Examiner staffer asked Managing Editor Chris Irvine if he knew when the author pages were going to be fixed. âNo,â Irvine said. âI will let you know when they are.â\n\nIn a note to staff on Friday, Irvine acknowledged that it had been a âdifficult week adjusting to a new publishing system that has had significantly more gremlins in it than there should have been, quite frankly.â\n\nTrade cuts: On Thursday, Arizent quietly laid off a number of employees across its trade publications, including American Banker and Financial Planning. In an internal email obtained by Semafor, the company said that it had âscaled back operation expenses wherever possible,â and made a number of cuts in order to refocus its business. âWe anticipate accountable performance and healthy growth going forward,â the companyâs CEO Jeff Mancini wrote.\n\nToo bad: The founder of Instagram built a beautiful news app, fell into a pointless slide toward UGC, and decided that âthe market opportunity isnât big enough to warrant continued investment in this way.â True, of course. Still, Iâd hoped Artifact join the cadre of apps â Apple News, SmartNews, Flipboard, et al. â building business on top of professional journalism, but itâs just not in the water out there.\n\nStill Xing: Despite their protestations about Elon Muskâs conduct, Democrats continue to spend money on advertising on X. A new ad transparency report released by the company showed that it brought in over $5 million in revenue last year from political advertisers. Of the top 50 biggest spenders , according to the digital political tracker FWIW, 14 were left-leaning, including Sen. Jon Tester, Rep. Ruben Gallego, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and Rep. Adam Schiff.\n\nCruise control: Popbitch reports that Tom Cruiseâs friends are disappointed that he no longer gives his âsignature gift,â a coconut cake from Doanâs Bakery in LA, shipped via his private jet. âMaybe heâs developed more of an eco-conscience, but Tomâs pastry largesse appears to have been curtailed a little of recent,â the British gossip newsletter reports. After watching The Motive And The Cue at the Noel Coward Theatre last week, he merely sent the cast some doughnuts from nearby Soho.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

      "text": "NBC braces for the backlash to the backlash after hiring and firing top Republican\n\nSign up for Semafor Media: Mediaâs essential read. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nNBC Newsâs dramatic hiring and firing of a former RNC chairwoman this week threatens to undo years of repositioning itself as friendly to Republican officials and viewers.\n\nNBCUniversalâs news division announced Friday it had hired Ronna McDaniel as an on-air contributor who would appear on NBC and MSNBC. On Tuesday NBCUniversal News Group chief Cesar Conde announced that heâd decided to end the networkâs deal with McDaniel after an open revolt by his stars over hiring someone who had played a role in Donald Trumpâs attempt to contest the 2020 election he lost.\n\nBut while the abrupt reversal was cheered by some MSNBC staff, other NBC News journalists said they believe the move will only continue to strengthen complaints by Republicans that the network doesnât want to hear their perspectives.\n\nNow, NBC staffers are bracing for Republican backlash, fielding texts from angry GOP sources.\n\nâPolitical reporters here didnât take part in the backlash, nor did they get to give input on the hire,â one NBC News journalist said. âBut theyâll be the ones who have to pick up the pieces with sources who are now dismayed with the organization.â\n\nFour NBC News staffers expressed concern that instead of fixing the problem, hiring and then firing McDaniel had only alienated liberal viewers while confirming Republican fears. Two Republican aides told Semafor theyâd texted their NBC News contacts to express their anger with the decision.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe conflict over McDaniel threatens to reverse some of the gains that top network figures believed that it had made to establish some credibility with members of the Republican Party. NBC lobbied hard behind the scenes for a GOP primary debate, dispatching anchor Lester Holt to meet with the RNC as part of the networkâs pitch. It worked: NBC was the first non-Fox outlet to secure a debate. And throughout the GOP presidential primary, the television news organization and its digital counterpart broke a number of major stories about the contest, including the news of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantisâ campaign announcement with Elon Musk, and infighting within the major super PAC supporting DeSantis for president.\n\nMcDaniel, who was elevated then discarded by Donald Trump, makes an unlikely martyr for a MAGA right that viewed her with suspicion even after she stopped using her middle name, Romney. But even critics like former candidate Vivek Ramaswamy took the opportunity to lambaste the network.\n\nâI would have hoped for a decision other than that one for her first move to be instantly taking a contributorship with that network,â Ramaswamy told Semafor, âbut I think itâs very lame of NBC to cower to a mob of people after they did make a decision to not give somebody who they thought was worth giving a voice to. You could debate that question, but once theyâve decided to do it, I think itâs rather lame and pathetic of them to pull it before she had a chance to contribute whatever they thought she had to contribute.â\n\nStephen Moore, a former top Trump economic aide now at FreedomWorks, called it a âgood day for our team, because it makes [Democrats] look ridiculous.â He added that he has no particular view on McDaniel, whom he referred to as âRonna McDonaldâ several times during a short telephone interview.\n\nFormer Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney called the firing âa great move for NBC. It allows them to completely shed their image as a legitimate news outlet, once and for all.â\n\nMcDaniel herself was shocked by her abrupt reversal of fortune. One person familiar with the situation told Semafor that CAA warned her on Monday that she likely would need to hire a lawyer to prepare for a contentious exit from the network. It was awkward timing for the former RNC chair, who was traveling for an interview for a separate high level corporate board position which could also be imperiled by the unfolding network drama. Another person close to McDaniel said she did not hear from NBC all day, and learned about her firing from media reports.\n\nNBC will have to manage its brand with Republicans as it attempts to repair what insiders see as a management failure as much as a political blunder. Running a talent-heavy television newsroom is a legendary exercise in internal politics, and executives typically keep stars close, consult them often â and try not to surprise them. Stars, in turn, can occasionally exercise an effective veto on management decisions, as the company found this week. Veterans of the network were shocked that top talent had apparently not been consulted in advance on the move.\n\nâItâs a star system and thereâs no bench,â said one former top NBC executive.\n\nThe move also deepened tensions between NBC News and MSNBC leadership, which have strained at moments throughout the last several years. Some senior NBC News figures privately expressed frustration at MSNBC president Rashida Jones, who did not oppose McDanielâs hiring, but reversed course Saturday afternoon amid backlash from top talent. For its part, top figures at MSNBC expressed astonishment that the network didnât seem to grasp how strong the backlash to the decision would be internally.\n\nNBC did catch one break. McDanielâs lack of popularity among top members of her own party may not make her a true martyr among Republicans. Her former institution, the Republican National Committee declined to comment on her firing, and Trump himself posted a mocking tweet directed both at McDaniel and âweakâ NBC. Said one senior Republican aide: âNo one really cares about Ronna.â\n\nNBCUâs Conde wrote that the company is âcommitted to the principle that we must have diverse viewpoints on our programs, and to that end, we will redouble our efforts to seek voices that represent different parts of the political spectrum.â\n\nMcDaniel began her career as a unifiying figure, but is now âmarooned on the other side of a line she crossed with her behavior following the 2020 election, if not before,â CJRâs Joe Allsop wrote .\n\nJoseph Zeballos-Roig and Ben Smith contributed to this article.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

      "text": "Led by NBC, U.S. corporate media is learning to live with Trump\n\nSign up for Semafor Media: Mediaâs essential read. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nFor weeks before NBC News journalists exploded into open revolt Sunday over the networkâs hire of a top Donald Trump supporter, the media company that controls three of the top U.S. news networks had been quietly rebuilding its ties to the former president.\n\nNetwork insiders noticed on March 5, when, during MSNBCâs Super Tuesday broadcast of Trumpâs primary wins, host Rachel Maddow indicated to producers off-camera that viewers had heard enough from the former president. MSNBC president Rashida Jones told production staff that she wanted to stay with his speech. Maddow mused live about the challenges of taking Trumpâs comments on the fly and âallowing somebody to knowingly lie on your air.â\n\nSix days later, CNBC welcomed the former president back to Squawk Box for a phone-in interview primarily conducted by right-leaning host Joe Kernen.\n\nAnd while those decisions were handled cordially inside the network, tensions flared when NBC News told the New York Times on Friday that it had hired former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as an on-air commentator. The move was the culmination of a few weeks of discussions spearheaded by NBC News senior political vice president and its editorial president Rebecca Blumenstein, with signoff from MSNBC leadership and NBCUniversal news chief Cesar Conde, according to a company official.\n\nThe hiring was despite McDanielâs previous public criticism of MSNBC and NBC Newsâ coverage of Trump and Republican politics. Her team at the RNC refused to let MSNBC simulcast the 2024 GOP primary debate hosted on NBC News.\n\nâOur bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation,â former Meet The Press host Chuck Todd said to his successor, Kristen Welker, of the McDaniel drama during Sundayâs broadcast.\n\nThe rings of leadership involved in approving McDaniel is an indication that they knew hiring her would be a controversial move that the network would have to defend. Liberal viewers have created memes mocking the decision, and media critics said the network was further whitewashing McDanielâs role in the events that culminated in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nMcDaniel acknowledged on Meet the Press that the 2020 election was legitimate.\n\nâJoe Biden won. Heâs the president,â she said. âHeâs the legitimate president.â And yet, she added: âI have always said and I continue to say there were issues in 2020.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nMcDanielâs move from politics to news isnât unusual by standards of American television history. MSNBCâs biggest rising star is Jen Psaki, Bidenâs loyal former White House press secretary. And while there are big personalities at play, this 2024 story has less to do with old-fashioned NBC personnel drama and more with inexorable political and economic forces.\n\nBehind the move is the reality that is sinking in for U.S. corporate media, and corporate America in general: They may soon be dealing again with a Trump administration, willing to use the tools of government to reward allies and punish enemies. For the great publicly traded conglomerates like NBCUniversal Mediaâs parent, Comcast, that may leave little choice but to extend an olive branch to the former president.\n\nCompanies like Comcast, Disney, and WarnerMedia, which dominate U.S. television, got an object lesson in presidential revenge during the last Trump administration. Trump reportedly demanded that the Justice Department sue to block the merger of AT&T and Time Warner. (The lawsuit failed, though the merger also quickly unraveled.)\n\nExecutives are concerned at the possibility that Trump could take revenge on the company, a high-profile NBC employee told Semafor.\n\nLate last year, the former president explicitly raised the prospect of taking regulatory or investigative action against NBC and Comcast. While he characteristically did not provide specific details about how he would go after the company, antitrust questions aside, the government can slow or stop mergers, or attack parent companiesâ other interests, as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis did when he went after Disneyâs local tax and regulatory arrangements.\n\nWhile all that speculation may seem far-fetched,Â itâs worth stepping to ask why NBC would take a risky, dramatic step that could alienate much of its audience and staff.\n\nAll of the cable networks have taken a post-Trump administration ratings dip. But MSNBC has been able to weather the storm better than CNN, maintaining decent audience ratings in its primetime hours. Still, NBCU leadership seems willing to test the loyalty of its viewers and its hosts and staff by putting Trump on the air and paying McDaniel.\n\nOver the weekend, Jones and her deputies fielded calls and texts from nearly all of the networkâs personalities, and reassured them that despite the New York Times article saying that McDaniel would appear on MSNBC to talk about the election, she in fact would not be featured on the channel. Two people familiar with the conversations said that she told senior network staff that there was âno expectationâ that McDaniel would appear on the network. NBCU officials have sought to slightly re-interpret Jonesâ private comments, telling the Washington Post and Deadline that network executives called anchors to âreassure them that they maintain editorial independence over their shows and are free to book â or not book â whatever guest pundits they please.â\n\nNBC and MSNBC are not alone in their struggles with how to cover Trumpâs ascent back to the top of the Republican party post-Jan. 6 âÂ a choice that may be partly about mollifying Trump, and partly about re-evaluating whether blacking him out has actually made their audiences better informed. CNN has begun taking Trump live on television again, while new Twitter owner Elon Musk welcomed back the former president to the since-renamed platform X.\n\nEarlier this year, Semafor first published the story reporting that ABC News president Kimberly Godwin emailed staff privately, saying that Trumpâs recent comments about Black people were âas racist as they come.â But when Semafor reached out to the network about Godwinâs remarks, a spokesperson walked them back, saying they were âpart of a larger editorial conversationâ about how to cover Trump. When the network discussed Trumpâs comments on- air, it was more cautious, saying the remarks were âwidely criticized as racist.â\n\nFox News, in fact, has kept Trump at armâs length. After forking over $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems as part of a defamation settlement, the network aired pre-taped interviews with Trump (in recent months, the network began taking the former president live again).\n\nAn earlier version of this story misstated the title of Cesar Conde, the Chairman of the NBCUniversal News Group. Also, McDaniel did not delete tweets critical of NBC, which are still on X .\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nNBC News has demanded that Donald Trumpâs campaign remove a video that includes audio deceptively edited to seem like it comes from an NBC correspondent after the third presidential debate, two people familiar with the exchange told Semafor.\n\nThe video in question, shared by a top Trump adviser, opens with authentic footage of NBC News senior Capitol Hill correspondent Garrett Haake previewing the debate for the network. It soon cuts to video of each candidate as a voiceover â in Haakeâs voice â makes disparaging comments about the candidates.\n\nâThis is Ron DeSantis: An establishment RINO that wears insoles in order to look taller,â the voiceover says. âAnd this is Nikki Haley: Nobody really gives a shit about Nikki Haley.â\n\nThe video was shared by Trump senior adviser Chris LaCivita, who tweeted: âNow this is reporting!â Shortly after posting the video, LaCivita followed up : âTo keep @NBCNews Lawyers off my ass, please noteâ¦. THIS IS A PARODY!â\n\nA Trump spokesperson highlighted LaCivitaâs follow-up tweet but declined to comment further. An NBCUniversal spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThis video is likely another example of the AI-assisted fakes that have grown more popular in the political world in recent years. In June, DeSantisâ campaign shared fake images of Trump embracing Dr. Anthony Fauci, prompting outrage among Trump supporters online.\n\nWhile there have been relatively few high-profile examples so far, AI experts and lawmakers have been sounding the alarm that fake videos and imagery could upend campaigns.\n\nAnd while itâs clear to much of the media world that this audio is not actually Haake, casual observers might not immediately realize itâs fake â prompting legitimate concerns about what this type of content could mean for journalistsâ careers and reputations.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

But the catastrophe also exposed a ravaged Los Angeles media ecosystem. In my multiple text chains was the constant question: Whatâs the best place to get information?\n\nThe answers were a hodgepodge of new apps and websites (Watch Duty! Genasys! Wildfire Viewer!), Google Docs shared by neighbors about what burned down, rogue drone footage, and Instagram Reels.\n\nNot once did anyone cite a Los Angeles media outlet, save for old-school local broadcast news channels, primarily watched through their websites â a heroic resource for seeing footage, catching the latest and hearing press conferences.\n\nBut people desperate for information eventually will go rogue: To learn what happened to their homes in the now-destroyed Pacific Palisades, people snuck in past police barriers. One friend offered a bounty for anyone who could deliver footage of his house. My husband rode his bike into the Palisades wearing an N95 mask and took apocalyptic footage to confirm to friends that their homes had burned down. Our old place, where we had lived for 10 years and raised our children, was gone too.\n\nAs the fire now spreads into Encino and Brentwood, where I now live, and new gusts of wind are coming, mistaken evacuation notices sent through phones have rattled residents. Many remain unsure about what water is safe to drink, and vigilante homeowners are chasing arsonists and looters through a blur of rumors, all while social media apps like conspiracy hub X overflow with ill-informed analysis and speculation.\n\nAs haze, ash and destruction remain, the decline of standard-bearer legacy media â in a metropolis with a newspaper whose series of hapless owners long ago destroyed its audience (despite excellent work from its reporters), and the rise of niche-ification (including that of The Ankler ) â has been laid bare. Los Angeles is always on the knifeâs edge of natural disasters. Now the raging fires in the second-most populous city in America have exposed a manmade disaster: an information wasteland.\n\nIn todayâs scoop-heavy newsletter: Ashlee Vanceâs new company, the Washington Postâs traffic crash, Melania Trumpâs Amazon doc, Telegraph pathos, This American Life layoffs, Chuck Toddâs future, and secrets of the Pulitzer Prize board revealed. ( Scoop count: 6 )\n\nIn this wild moment merging Washington and Silicon Valley, you can follow Semafor Principals and Semafor Tech . And you can sign up with our friends at The Ankler for coverage of Hollywood through and after the fires.\n\nThe prolific Bloomberg tech journalist Ashlee Vance has left to start a new media company that will carry his curious, generally optimistic inquiries into technology and science. Core Memory , Vanceâs new company, has the unusual ambition of producing high-end documentaries along with the typical âdigitalâ products: a YouTube show, a podcast, and a Substack newsletter. That range matches Vanceâs own career, which spans feature writing, hosting Bloombergâs globetrotting Hello World show, writing a bestselling 2015 biography of Elon Musk, and producing independent documentaries, most recently Donât Die on Netflix.\n\nâIâm convinced thereâs a way to live in both worlds and do it successfully,â Vance said of documentary filmmaking and digital journalism.\n\nRead about Vanceâs plans and Benâs View. â\n\nRead about Vanceâs plans and Benâs View. â\n\nThe Pulitzer Board, facing a lawsuit from Donald Trump over its Pulitzer prize for stories on Russian election meddling in 2016, based its decision to stand by those stories on a confidential review by former Reuters editor-in-chief Stephen Adler. The review, which Adler confirmed to Semafor that he wrote, and which the board had fought to keep secret, is now at the heart of Trumpâs attempt to literally relitigate media coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 election in an Okeechobee, Florida, court.\n\nâThe Pulitzer Board takes concerns about the Prizes very seriously. In the case of President-elect Trumpâs challenge to the 2018 national reporting prizes, we chose an independent reviewer who is highly respected with impeccable credentials, unimpeachable integrity, and deep familiarity with the Pulitzer Prize standards and history,â the board said in a statement.\n\nThere are technical, legal reasons that the Pulitzers wanted his report to stay confidential â but the debate over the Russia coverage is painfully short on careful, disinterested evaluation, and perhaps both Trump and his critics will benefit from reading the report when it, nearly inevitably, becomes public.\n\nRead views on the case from First Amendment lawyers. â\n\nRead views on the case from First Amendment lawyers. â\n\nThe venerable podcast This American Life is poised to reduce staff for one of the few times since its founding in 1995, Semafor has learned. In recent weeks, host Ira Glass has quietly discussed the likely cuts with the showâs top leadership.\n\nThis American Life has been a beacon of success for its popular but labor-intensive style of storytelling, and the showâs fortunes have long been seen as a bellwether for the health of quality audio journalism in the industry as a whole. And while the show remains one of the most popular weekly podcasts and radio programs in the country, it recently split from The New York Times, which sold its ads for several years following the Timesâ acquisition of Serial .\n\nTAL was one of many that faced a significant drop in downloads when Apple stopped automatically downloading new episodes of podcasts to the devices of subscribers who hadnât listened to several episodes. Last year, the show quietly changed its âaboutâ page, revising its listenership from 4 million each week, broken out into 1.6 radio listeners and 2.6 million podcast downloads, down to 3 million between radio and digital, a shift in line with industry-wide declines. TAL did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe would-be buyer of The Telegraph, Dovid Efune, expressed concern to Telegraph CEO Anna Jones over how he is being portrayed in its pages. The Telegraph has called Efune a âminnowâ who is âknown for his robust Zionismâ and has treated his financial plans with skepticism. But Efuneâs outreach to Jones doesnât seem to have helped.\n\nThis week, his would-be employees welcomed his latest prospective partner, Leon Black, by describing him in a headline as a âWall Street billionaire ousted over Epstein links.â In another move that the hardened Londoners see as a bit naive, Efune has told associates he sought guidance from Times owner Rupert Murdoch â The Telegraphâs chief rival â on whether he was overpaying for the title. Murdoch assured him $550 million was a great price.\n\nStill the sellers, the Abu Dhabi-based IMI â whose bid the same Telegraph staff scuppered â are sticking with Efune and appear confident heâll round up the cash.\n\nWashington Post subscribers quit the paper en masse following owner Jeff Bezosâ decision to withhold its endorsement of outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris. But the Postâs audience problems extend beyond angry former subscribers.\n\nOver the last four years, web traffic has cratered. According to internal data shared with Semafor in recent weeks, the Postâs daily traffic last year reached a nadir of just a quarter of what it was at its peak in January 2021. That month, the Post had around 22.5 million daily active users. But by the middle of 2024, its daily users hovered around 2.5-3 million daily users.\n\nLast year, Washington City Paper noted that the Post had stopped publicly disclosing its traffic numbers in press releases, after a 60% decline in monthly traffic. On Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Postâs revenue fell from $190 million in 2023 to $174 million last year.\n\nChuck Todd has quietly been meeting with Washington media organizations about his post NBC-future. The former host of Meet The Press has told top editors and leaders from other media organizations that he plans to leave NBC when his contract is up this year, and has discussed potential roles outside the network both in broadcast and digital media.\n\nTodd was once a key part of NBCâs broadcast offerings, hosting Meet The Press and a daily Meet The Press politics program on MSNBC and writing for its website. But while NBC announced that Todd would focus on longform projects after stepping down from Meet the Press in 2023, he has been a far less visible presence across the news network and its cable counterpart.\n\nTodd publicly criticized NBC over its decision to hire former Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel last year. The network immediately backpedaled, but the incident led some staffers to question Toddâs future there.\n\nMelania Trump, as we reported last Sunday, will participate in (and reportedly get paid handsomely for) an Amazon documentary directed by Brett Ratner. While the producers wouldnât tell us much, Trump herself will offer some detail in an interview with Fox & Friendsâ Ainsley Earhardt to air Monday.\n\nâWe started the production in November and we are shooting right now. So, itâs a day-to-day life, what Iâm doing or what kind of responsibilities I have,â Trump said. âPeople they donât really know and they will see it. Itâs day-to-day, from the transition team, to moving to the White House, packing, establishing my team, the first ladyâs office, moving into the White House, what it takes to make the residence your home, to hire the people that you need.â\n\n(Itâs a topsy-turvy world out there. Amazon, to Benâs enduring fury, front-ran his scoop on the documentary last Sunday with Fox. Fox â just to calm him down, apparently â shared this exclusively.)\n\nWhat do the big tech leaders want, and where will they push the media in 2025? The Consumer Electronics Show introduced a range of new gadgets, screens, and robots, but will these innovations actually transform how we consume media? Or will the real shifts come from Washington, where tech giants like Meta and Amazon are directing their focus?

On Tuesday, the Washington Post announced that it would be laying off 4% of its staff, resulting in days of unrest and protest within its D.C. offices. Semafor was also first to note this week that Vox also laid off staff, many of which were based in Washington.\n\nHeaded out: More notable Politico staff plan on leaving the publication in the coming days, Semafor has learned. Natalie Allison and Lauren Egan have separately told Politico in recent weeks that they have accepted new roles elsewhere or will be leaving the Rosslyn-based outlet for personal reasons. Allison is joining the Washington Post, while Egan will join the digital media startup the Bulwark.\n\nItâs the latest in a string of major staff changes for Politico, which has also recruited several top journalists from rivals such as Axios and NBC News. As Semafor previously reported, the outlet in recent weeks has been discussing bringing in Jack Blanchard, the author of its London Playbook, to helm its flagship DC edition, and has nabbed a few younger up-and-coming journalists from rivals including NBC News and Axios. Blanchard appears likely to join the Politico team, along with current author Eugene Daniels and other unannounced staff.\n\nOn guard: NewsGuard sponsored the Washington Examiner this week, presumably as a way of continuing to position itself as a nonpartisan misinformation watchdog willing to support some conservative media.\n\nGrim: The Rootâs management sent out a surreal email to staff asking them to pick up the slack for a colleague who had died just a few days earlier, Semafor first reported on Wednesday.\n\nWintour travel: Anna Wintour lands in Dubai later this month amid a bitter feud with the previous publisher of Vogue Arabia, who is accusing CondÃ© Nast of stealing the title back.\n\nGood fortune: Despite declines in overall television ratings, viewership is slightly up for Wheel of Fortune since Ryan Seacrest took over hosting the iconic evening gameshow.\n\nNo escape: The LA fires this week didnât stop the entertainment press and paparazzi, who attempted to follow celebrities through the fires in Malibu and the Palisades.\n\nRight-hand man: Over the last week, Meta has executed a public relations campaign unlike anything in recent memory. The company has rolled out policy changes, personnel announcements, interviews with ideologically-aligned media figures, behind-the-scenes briefings with conservative influencers, and events aimed at generating news (like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerbergâs meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, first reported by Semafor) â all with the purpose of signaling to the new administration and right-leaning users that the company is open to doing business.\n\nAll together: The Democratic National Committee is hosting its first ever candidate forum chair led by creators. Chorus, a left-leaning digital nonprofit that weâve covered in this newsletter, will host an event on Tuesday featuring video creators, TikTokers, and podcasters interviewing the major candidates seeking to lead the DNC.\n\nWith the progressive âresistanceâ quiet ahead of Donald Trumpâs second term, congressional Democrats are making their own shift: Theyâre turning away from past portrayals of Trump as a human wrecking ball and toward more potential collaboration , Semaforâs Burgess Everett reports.\n\nâItâs just accepting the reality that Trump won. And us just saying heâs a chaotic guy goes nowhere. Thatâs just baked into peopleâs consciousness,â Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., told Everett of the partyâs strategy.\n\nFor more on the latest happenings in American politics, subscribe to Semaforâs daily Principals newsletter. â\n\nFor more on the latest happenings in American politics, subscribe to Semaforâs daily Principals newsletter. â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

The leak could have âlegal implications and make allies wary of sharing intelligence â with the US, Foreign Policy wrote.

Signal, an encrypted messaging app that nevertheless has the potential to be hacked, has been widely embraced by government workers since Donald Trumpâs reelection, including staffers at the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, The Washington Post reported, â as a tactic to shield communications .â Aside from the national security risks, federal workersâ use of such âsurveillance-dodging tactics of spiesâ also presents a blow to efforts to document real-time history and public transparency in governance, one expert told The Post.\n\nIn the Signal group chat, Vice President JD Vance railed against Europeâs âfree-loading,â laying bare the extent of the Trump administrationâs â disdain for European allies ,â Bloomberg wrote. Swedenâs former prime minister said Vanceâs texts underscored his â deep anti-European resentment ,â and Politico noted that one of the officialsâ main preoccupations in the chat were â how to make Europe pay for it .â The messages point to a growing transatlantic schism: European powers are â rethinking their dependence on American weapons systems ,â The Washington Post noted, while calls are growing to strengthen Europeâs nuclear deterrent , according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

      "text": "Trump agrees to third debate as NBC scrambles to catch up with rivals\n\nSign up for Semafor Media: Mediaâs essential read. Read it now .\n\nDonald Trump agreed on Friday to a third presidential debate hosted by NBC News as the network continued to scramble to secure a televised debate slot.\n\nThis week, the Biden and Trump campaigns announced that they were circumventing the longtime organizer of presidential debate contests, the Commission on Presidential Debates, and agreed to two debates in June and September respectively.\n\nBut on Friday, the former president announced on Truth Social that he had agreed to participate in an additional debate, this one hosted by NBC News and Spanish-language network Telemundo.\n\nThe third proposed debate caught the Biden campaign by surprise, and was the result of behind-the-scenes discussions between the Trump campaign and NBC News without the Biden teamâs participation.\n\nAccording to one person familiar with the talks, NBC News reached out to the Biden campaign on Wednesday saying it was interested in hosting a debate. It came after the presidentâs team sent a letter formally withdrawing from participation in the contests hosted by the Commission on Presidential Debates, and suggesting that he would take part in two debates.\n\nBut the network was slower than broadcast rivals CNN and ABC News, which within less than two hours had submitted formal requests that were accepted by both campaigns. One person familiar with the discussions told Semafor that the Biden team did not receive an offer from NBC until after the campaign had already agreed to debates with CNN and ABC, and that the offer was not as detailed as those submitted by CNN and ABC.\n\nNBC then turned its attention to seeing if it could secure the broadcast rights for the vice presidential debate, and held what were described by one source as âserious discussionsâ with Kamala Harrisâs team about hosting the contest. But NBC was concerned that potential dates could conflict with its planned Summer Olympics broadcasts, and the network was beaten again after the Biden campaign accepted an offer from CBS News. That debate, however, remains shrouded in uncertainty: Two sources familiar with the discussions told Semafor that the Trump campaign has not accepted the vice presidential debate, hoping to see if it can angle for a contest hosted instead by Fox News.\n\nPuck reported on Wednesday that NBC staff were âblindsidedâ by the whirlwind sequence of events that left the network without a debate. But the network wasnât done trying to secure its place at the table. NBC News held unilateral discussions with the Trump campaign about the potential for a third debate, which was quickly accepted by the Republican presidential nominee. It came as a surprise to the Biden campaign, which learned about the proposed debate on Twitter, according to one person familiar with the situation.\n\nIt seems unlikely that the proposed NBC debate will actually take place. When asked about it, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign pointed to its letter on Wednesday saying that the president would only participate in two televised contests.\n\nTrumpâs announcement Friday seems to serve two purposes. For his campaign, itâs an opportunity to needle Biden, and make the president appear like he is unwilling to debate. As he tries to court nonwhite voters, Trump could point out that the president is unwilling to accept a debate hosted on a Hispanic network. For NBC News, itâs a Hail Mary attempt to secure its own debate slot, lest the network be forced to simulcast the CNN or ABC News debates, which both networks have offered. In the eyes of some at NBC News, the uncertainty around the vice presidential debate and the Trump campaignâs willingness to participate in future contests has left the door open for the network.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

      "text": "Inside Megyn Kellyâs YouTube success\n\nSign up for Semafor Media: Mediaâs essential read. Read it now .\n\nWhen then-host Megyn Kelly was pushed out of NBC News in 2019, many television network insiders thought her broadcast career was likely over. Instead, now Kelly is nearly as popular as ever.\n\nAccording to audience figures highlighted by Kellyâs team for Semafor, Kellyâs show is now not only one of the most listened-to programs on SiriusXM, but itâs also one of the top ten podcasts in the country and its viewership is eclipsing that of some mainstream news outlets on YouTube.\n\nKelly boasts that despite the fact that she only has six staffers, she has managed to get numbers that put her in the range of the accounts of legacy media outlets. The Megyn Kelly Show âs YouTube channel, which has 2.3 million subscribers, had 116.8 million views in July â more views than the official channels for NBC News (78 million) CBS News (83 million), Sky News (87 million), the BBC News (72 million) and CNBC (17 million).\n\nâOn-camera is how people are used to getting their news from me, so it likely feels familiar,â Kelly said of her growth on YouTube. âI am also half Italian, half Irish, so if you choose to watch the show, you will definitely glean something from the hand gestures and facial expressions that you might not always pick up on from listening alone. With the news what it is these days, sometimes an eye-roll, forehead slap, or pen-throw is absolutely required.â\n\nIn an interview with Semafor last year, Kelly said that after she was forced out of NBC News, she met with the conservative pundit Ben Shapiro, who suggested she turn to podcasting. But she was scared that she wouldnât be able to find an audience in digital media.\n\nThe post-cable independent route has given a second life to some other former personalities whoâve found themselves without a home on linear television. Former MSNBC anchor Mehdi Hasan left the network to start his own publication, Zeteo, which has quickly garnered a strong subscriber base and nearly 370,000 subscribers on YouTube since launching less than six months ago. While his post-CNN tenure has been a bit bumpier, former anchor Don Lemon has proved that he can still attract big-name guests and audience attention with his interview-focused YouTube show. Update: A source notes that the the social media tracking firm ListenFirst puts Kelly at 105 million views to NBC Newsâs 180 million.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

      "text": "Trump says he 'couldn't care less' if some car prices rise due to tariffs: 5 takeaways from new interviews\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he \"couldn't care less\" if his signature tariffs raise the prices of foreign vehicles for Americans in an interview with NBC News on Saturday.\n\nThe president on the campaign trail vowed to lower prices for consumers, but some experts have warned that the cost of tariffs will ultimately be passed along to Americans. While Trump and his administration have argued the costs will spur people to buy products made in the U.S., even American car companies aren't making every part or assembling all their vehicles here.\n\nThe president also told the outlet he doesn't plan to fire anyone involved in the Signal group chat where top intelligence officials discussed military attack plans in front of a journalist. In another interview on Sunday, he said he was \"pissed off\" over Russian President Vladimir Putin 's recent criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy .\n\nHere's what to know about Trump's wide-ranging conversations with NBC News.\n\nTrump said he \"couldn't care less\" if foreign car prices go up after he imposed 25% tariffs on imported automobiles earlier this week.\n\n\"The message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you're going to make a lot of money,\" Trump said on his bottom line to auto executives. \"If you don't, you're going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"\n\nThe tariffs also apply to to some imported auto parts, including engines and transmissions, but vehicles that fall under the umbrella of imports protected in the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement aren't subject to the full tariff rate . Instead, the U.S will only levy tariffs on the foreign parts that make up vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico.\n\nCar companies, including those that assemble vehicles in the U.S., typically use parts sourced from around the world. And many American brands like General Motors have assembly plants in other countries. Both factors may push the price of vehicles up .\n\n\"I couldn't care less,\" Trump said, his team later clarifying to NBC that he was referring specifically to foreign car prices. \"I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty.\"\n\nTrump also told NBC he does not plan to fire any of the top security officials involved in a leaked Signal group chat where plans to attack the Houthis in Yemen were discussed.\n\n\"I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\" Trump said, adding that the security mishap \"shouldn't be talked\" about.\n\n\"We had a tremendously successful strike. We struck very hard and very lethal. And nobody wants to talk about that,\" he said. \"All they want to talk about is nonsense.\"\n\nOn Monday, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg revealed he was inadvertently included on a Signal group chat by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security advisor. The chat included Vice President JD Vance , Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth , Secretary of State Marco Rubio , Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe , among others.\n\nOn the chat, Hegseth shared detailed plans for an attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen, including strike times and weapons details , raising concerns about how the administration is handling sensitive national security information. The White House has repeatedly said no classified information was shared.\n\n\"I have no idea what Signal is. I don't care what Signal is,\" Trump told NBC on Saturday.\n\nTrump also told NBC that he has had serious conversations about annexing Greenland, the Arctic island that is currently a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.\n\nThere's a \"good possibility that we could do it without military force,\" he said, but \"I don't take anything off the table.\"\n\nThe comments come the day after Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, visited the Pittufik Space Base in Greenland , where he said to Denmark: \"You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland.\" His visit was scaled back after residents and officials said they would protest.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he wants to acquire the Arctic territory, despite resistance from Greenlanders. \"One way or the other, we're going to get it ,\" he told Congress in a joint address earlier this month.\n\nAsked by NBC what message acquiring Greenland would send to Russia, which has sought to expand its own territorial footprint , and the rest of the world, Trump said: \"I don't really think about that. I don't really care. Greenland's a very separate subject, very different. It's international peace. It's international security and strength.\"\n\nGreenland wasn't the only foreign nation Trump addressed during the interviews. He also told NBC he was \"pissed off\" when Putin criticized the credibility of Zelenskyy's leadership.\n\nThe president said he would impose secondary tariffs of 25% to 50% on all Russian oil if he feels Moscow is blocking his efforts to end the war in Ukraine, and they could be imposed within a month if there is no ceasefire . He said the tariffs on Russian oil would come within a month without a ceasefire deal.\n\nTrump also threatened Iran with bombings and secondary tariffs if Tehran did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear program. He said U.S. and Iranian officials were talking but did not elaborate.\n\n\"If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing,\" Trump said. \"But there's a chance that if they don't make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago.\"\n\nTrump also did not rule out running for a third term , even though its prohibited by the U.S. Constitution, adding that he was \"not joking.\"\n\n\"A lot of people want me to do it,\" Trump said. \"But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it's very early in the administration.\"\n\nTrump said he's \"focused on the current\" term, but asked whether he wants a third term he said: \"I like working.\"\n\n\"I'm not joking,\" he said when asked to clarify. \"But I'm not - it is far too early to think about it.\"\n\nThe 22nd Amendment to the Constitution bars people from being elected to the presidency more than twice.\n\nThere are only two ways to change the Constitution: An amendment can be proposed by Congress with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and Senate, or two-thirds of state legislatures can call a constitutional convention. Then three-fourths of the state legislatures or conventions (38 of 50) must ratify it.\n\nContributing: Reuters"

      "text": "Trump says U.S. will 'get Greenland,' military force may not be needed but not ruled out\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump refused on Saturday to take military force off the table in his quest to acquire Greenland, saying he had an obligation to pursue ownership of the Danish territory that has rebuffed his advances.\n\nA day after members of his administration, including Vice President JD Vance , visited a U.S. military installation there, Trump , in an interview with NBC News, said he'd \"absolutely\" had conversations about annexing Greenland.\n\n\"We'll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,\" Trump said, according to the news outlet.\n\nVance heaped criticism on Denmark during his Friday visit, accusing the country of lagging on security and leaving Greenland open to invasion from Russia and China. He encouraged the people of Greenland to break away from Denmark to create space for the United States to have a conversation with the territory about acquiring it.\n\nHe told reporters after that he was not signaling a change in the administration's policy. Rather, he said, he was emphasizing that Trump does not believe military force is needed for the United States to take over Greenland.\n\n\"We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary,\" Vance said at Pituffik Space Base.\n\nAsked about the comments during the NBC interview, Trump recommitted to taking control of the island but said there's a \"good possibility\" that the United States can do it without the assistance of the military.\n\n\"No, I never take military force off the table. But I think there's a good possibility that we could do it without military force,\" Trump said. \"We have an obligation to protect the world. This is world peace, this is international security. And I have that obligation while I'm president. No, I don't take anything off the table.\"\n\nVance's visit with Trump administration officials and his wife, Usha, replaced a multiday trip that the second lady had planned to make without her husband. The original schedule was scrapped after Greenland's former prime minister called the move \"highly aggressive\" and a \"provocation,\" and the government said the U.S. delegation was not invited to tour the island.\n\nThe vice president and U.S. officials, including Trump's national security adviser Michael Waltz, instead visited the military base.\n\nIn his remarks, Vance said Denmark had \"underinvested\" in the security of Greenland.\n\n\"Our message to Denmark is very simple. You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,\" he said. \"That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, this is why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"\n\nDenmark's foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, hit back at Vance on X after the visit, saying in a video on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that his country can take criticism but does not \"appreciate the tone\" of the Trump administration's comments about his country.\n\n\"This is not how you speak to your close allies,\" he said.\n\nHe invited the United States to work with Denmark to enhance its military presence in Greenland.\n\nGreenland's new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, also said the comments showed a \"lack of respect\" for the island.\n\nDenmark is a NATO ally and Greenland's residents say they are opposed to becoming a part of the United States.\n\nStill, the U.S. president has pressed ahead. \"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security. We have to have Greenland,\" he said on Friday at the White House.\n\nAsked by NBC what message acquiring Greenland would send to Russia, which has sought to expand its own territorial footprint , and the rest of the world, Trump said: \"I don't really think about that. I don't really care. Greenland's a very separate subject, very different. It's international peace. It's international security and strength.\"\n\nTrump also said Saturday that he still has confidence in his national security team following the explosive revelation that Waltz inadvertently included the editor of The Atlantic in a text chain where officials discussed an attack on Houthi militants in Yemen before it happened.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details of the strike in a group chat on Signal, an encrypted text messaging app, with Waltz, Vance and other senior officials in Trump administration.\n\n\"I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\" Trump told NBC News Saturday.\n\nThe administration has acknowledged that a journalist was accidentally added to the conversation but denied that any of the information discussed was classified.\n\nThe U.S. president also said he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raise vehicle prices because of his 25% tariff on imports - saying \"people are gonna buy American-made cars\" if the prices on foreign vehicles increase.\n\nHe also said he would move ahead with far-reaching duties due to take effect April 2 unless affected countries offer him something in return.\n\n\"Only if people are willing to give us something of great value. Because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there's no room for negotiation,\" Trump said.\n\nContributing: Riley Beggin"

      "text": "Donald Trump's approval ratings at all-time high: Here's what the latest polls say\n\nRoughly two months into his second term, President Donald Trump's approval ratings continue to rise, even after a somewhat chaotic start with a flurry of executive actions , rising tariffs , and escalating trade wars . However, recent polls show his ratings have reached an all-time high.\n\nThe national NBC News poll reveals Trump's approval rating at 47%, his highest yet. The poll also shows that more registered voters now feel the country is heading in the right direction than at any point since early 2004. That said, most Americans still feel the country is on the wrong track, with 51% of voters disapproving of his performance as president, according to the report.Despite higher disapproval numbers compared to Trump's overall job performance, the margin between approval and disapproval is closer than it has been at any point during his first term.\n\nThe poll also noted that a growing number of Republicans are aligning with MAGA (Make America Great Again) and supporting his immigration policies focused on deportation. Additionally, Americans seem to support the general concept behind the Department of Government Efficiency and Trump's efforts to cut government jobs and spending, though concerns remain about the department's \"rapid-fire execution.\"\n\nThe poll indicates that voters are split on the 2026 midterm elections. The Democratic Party, with historically low approval ratings, is struggling to respond to Trump's policies. Only 27% of registered voters view the Democratic Party positively.\n\nIn a White House press release issued on Monday, the administration highlighted the poll results, stating, \"Trump ties for highest approval he's ever had - as more Americans say the U.S. is on the right track than any time in 20 years.\"\n\nOther presidential approval rating polls have also shown a favorable trend for Trump. Despite growing concerns over a potential recession, a volatile stock market, and rising tariffs, Trump's approval remained steady at 44% 50 days into his second term, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll . This rating exceeds approval numbers from his first term and surpasses former President Joe Biden's ratings.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Trump's approval rating at a steady 44%, but opinions on certain aspects of his job performance have shifted. For instance, his handling of the economy dropped from 43% in late January to 39% this week. Meanwhile, 57% of those polled agreed that Trump's economic moves are too erratic, and 53% felt that tariffs would do more harm than good. Regarding tariffs, 32% thought they were a good idea, while 53% disagreed.\n\nA president's approval rating reflects the percentage of Americans who approve of their job performance. Factors such as legislation, executive actions, and elections influence these ratings. According to ABC News , approval ratings gauge public sentiment and can impact election outcomes and a president's ability to push policies through Congress.\n\nIncludes reporting by the USA Today network"

      "text": "Donald Trump approval rating today: Here's what polls say after two months on the job\n\nPresidential approval ratings provide a glimpse of how Americans really feel on any given day , often times driven by his handling of the issues at hand . Here's how Trump is polling after his first two months in office.\n\nDespite the chaotic start to his second term, mired with the high price of eggs , mass firings of government workers, the onslaught of tariffs and trade wars , and the Zelensky meeting fiasco , and mounting fears of a recession, Trump's presidential approval rating have overall remained steady and in some cases - his highest rating yet.\n\nAccording to this week's most current polls, Fox News reported that 49% approve of Trump's job performance compared to 51% that do not. Among Democrats polled, a whopping 92% disapproved compared to 8% that did approve. The exact opposite showed from Republicans with a 92% favorability.\n\nIt may be most noteworthy that among independents in this poll , 38% approve of Trump's presidential job performance compared to 61% that do not.\n\nThe poll also found that 68% of Americans are concerned about Trump's use of executive orders - over 90 in the first two months - compared to 31% that were not.\n\nAnother faction of the poll showed Vice President JD Vance's approval ratings at 45% compared to 53% that disapproved. DOGE architect Elon Musk had a 40% approval rating compared to 58% that disapproved and Secretary of State Marco Rubio was even with a 47% rate of approval and 47% rate of disapproval.\n\nHere's what the most current polls show about Trump's presidential ratings right now.\n\nThe national NBC News poll shows Trump's approval rating at 47% with more registered voters seeing the US as heading in the right direction than at any point since early 2004. Albeit, the majority of Americans still say the country is on the wrong track and he holds a higher rate of 51% that disapprove of his performance as president right now, according to the report.\n\nThe poll shows that despite the slightly higher disapproval numbers over Trump's overall presidential job performance, the margin is closer than at any other point during his first term. Other noteworthy results of the poll include an increased number of Republicans identifying with MAGA, more Americans \"have come around\" on his deportation-focused immigration policies and they like the general concept behind the Department of Government Efficiency and Trump's efforts to cut government jobs and spending.\n\nOne poll result in particular showed that voters are quite evenly split on the future 2026 midterm elections as a divided Democratic party, facing record-low popularity , is trying to figure how to respond to Trump. That record low shows just 27% of registered voters viewing the Democratic party positively, among a total that included 59% of self identified Democrats.\n\nThe most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll , shows that despite a steady 44% approval rating since taking office, other areas of his job performance have changed. Americans' view on his handling of the economy, for example, have gone from 43% in late January to 39% this week.\n\nWhen questioned whether Trump's moves to shake up the economy were too erratic, the polls show 57% concurred. When questioned on tariffs, 32% thought they were a good idea versus 53% who thought they were bad. And 53% of those polled felt that tariffs will do more harm than good, while 31% didn't.\n\nIn a SSRS/CNN poll , 45% approve of his job as president versus 54% who disapprove. There was some notable difference in approval on more specific topics, such as 51% approved of his immigration handling, 48% approved of his handling of the federal budget and 45% approved of how he was handling the economy.\n\nTrump's struggle in the poll showed up in his handling of tariffs with a 39% approval versus 61% that disapproved.\n\nRealClear Polling which encompasses 13 different pollsters, including those mentioned above, shows Trump favorability at 47.9% versus 48.8% that disapprove, as of today.\n\nNote: Polls are constantly changing and different pollsters ask different varieties of the population. These numbers were reflected as of Monday, March 21, 2025 at 9 a.m."

      "text": "Joy Reid and Lester Holt join ranks of TV news anchors exiting their roles\n\nThe television news landscape is going through some significant changes.\n\nIn recent months, almost a dozen high-profile anchors and television hosts have stepped away from their gigs at major networks, including CBS, NBC, MSNBC, Fox News and CNN.\n\nThe latest shakeup occurred at MSNBC, which confirmed Monday that Joy Reid is exiting the network and that her show has been canceled. Hours earlier, NBC announced that Lester Holt is signing off at \"NBC Nightly News\" after a decade on the air, a month after a competing nightly news anchor also left her role.\n\nAnthony Adornato, chair of broadcast and digital journalism at Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Public Communications, previously told USA TODAY that news organizations are now putting \"less of an emphasis on those big-name anchors who are making a ton of money\" as news consumption habits change and younger audiences engage with non-traditional content.\n\nHere's a look at all the TV anchors and hosts who have recently left their roles.\n\nIn a memo to staff on Monday , Lester Holt confirmed he will exit as anchor of \"NBC Nightly News,\" a position he has held since 2015. But Holt said he would remain at NBC and move into a full-time role as anchor for \"Dateline.\"\n\n\"A smile comes to my face when I think that with 'Nightly News,' and 'Dateline,' I have now anchored two of the most successful and iconic television news programs in broadcast history,\" Holt said. \"As a 20-year-old radio reporter on the police beat chasing breaking news around San Francisco, I could never have imagined my career path would unfold in the way it has. What an amazing ride.\"\n\nHolt will continue anchoring \"NBC Nightly News\" until early summer.\n\nMSNBC on Monday announced numerous changes to its lineup, which included the cancellation of Joy Reid's show \"The ReidOut.\" Reid, who had hosted shows at the network for over a decade, also left MSNBC.\n\nThe network said that Reid's 7 p.m. time slot would, for the time being, be filled by a rotating series of anchors before being replaced by a show anchored by Symone Sanders-Townsend, Michael Steele and Alicia Menendez.\n\nChief political analyst and former \"Meet The Press\" moderator Chuck Todd announced in January that he would leave NBC News.\n\n\"There's never a perfect time to leave a place that's been a professional home for so long, but I'm pretty excited about a few new projects that are on the cusp of going from 'pie in the sky' to 'near reality,'\" he said in a memo to staff. \"So I'm grateful for the chance to get a jump start on my next chapter during this important moment.\"\n\nHe went on to say, \"I leave feeling concerned about this moment in history but reassured by the standards I and others at NBC have worked so hard to set.\"\n\nCNN chief domestic correspondent Jim Acosta announced his exit from the network on the air in January. He told viewers that \"after giving all of this some careful consideration and weighing an alternative time slot CNN offered me, I have decided to move on.\"\n\nAcosta, who had been with CNN since 2007 and was known as a critic of President Donald Trump, also said in his farewell message, \"It is never a good time to bow down to a tyrant. I have always believed it's the job of the press to hold power to account.\"\n\nNorah O'Donnell signed off as anchor of \"CBS Evening News\" in January. She previously announced in the summer that she would leave her role after the presidential election but would remain a contributor at CBS.\n\n\"I have spent 12 years in the anchor chair here at CBS News, connected to a daily broadcast and the rigors of a relentless news cycle,\" she said in July. \"It's time to do something different.\n\n\"This presidential election will be my seventh as a journalist, and for many of us in this business, we tend to look at our careers in terms of these milestone events.\"\n\nHoda Kotb officially left the \"Today\" show in January after announcing her exit in September.\n\nKotb said that when she turned 60 last year, she realized it was \"time for me to turn the page\" and \"try something new,\" adding that her kids deserve a \"bigger piece of my time pie.\" Kotb had served as \"Today\" co-anchor with Savannah Guthrie since 2018 after Matt Lauer 's was fired due to sexual misconduct allegations. She also hosted the show's fourth hour since 2007.\n\nKotb was replaced on the \"Today\" show by Craig Melvin .\n\nNeil Cavuto announced in December he would leave Fox News after almost three decades. Cavuto, who had been with the network since its 1996 launch, anchored \"Your World\" at 4 p.m on weekdays.\n\nAt the time, a source familiar with the situation but unauthorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY that Cavuto's contract was up at the end of 2024. The source also cited an \"evolving\" news business that has led to salary cuts across the industry.\n\nCNN anchor Alisyn Camerota announced her exit from the network in December. She joined CNN in 2014 and formerly served as anchor of the \"New Day\" morning show.\n\nIn her final broadcast, Camerota said it had been \"an honor to have been in your homes this past decade through some of the biggest stories of our lifetimes,\" adding, \"I'm always touched when a viewer comes up and tells me that I helped them get through these challenging times.\"\n\nDays after the 2024 presidential election, Chris Wallace confirmed he would exit CNN after more than two years. He joined the network after almost two decades at Fox News. Wallace told The Daily Beast he planned to move to streaming or podcasting.\n\n\"We want to thank him for the dedication and wisdom he's brought to all his work at CNN and to wish him the very best for the future,\" CNN CEO Mark Thompson said.\n\nAndrea Mitchell announced in October that she would end her MSNBC show \"Andrea Mitchell Reports,\" which she had hosted since 2008. She remained a chief foreign affairs correspondent and chief Washington correspondent for NBC News.\n\n\"As we prepare to cover a new administration, Andrea's expertise and reporting are more needed than ever,\" NBC News leaders said in a staff memo at the time. \"Please join us in congratulating Andrea on 16 years at the anchor desk at MSNBC and for her continued work with NBC News as we prepare to cover this historic election.\"\n\nIn September, \"Noticiero Univision\" co-host Jorge Ramos announced his exit from Univision after 40 years. He continued anchoring \"Noticiero Univision\" through December.\n\n\"I am deeply grateful for these four decades at Univision and very proud to be part of a team that has established strong leadership over the years,\" he said. Ahead of his final broadcast, Ramos posted on X , \"It's been quite a ride. So grateful.\"\n\nContributing: Jay Stahl , Taijuan Moorman"

Real journalists, who anchor a real newscast. Folks like Jake Tapper and Bret Baier don't count. They're on cable news.\n\nWith apologies to David Muir at ABC, chances are you might have come up with Lester Holt, the anchor and managing editor of \"NBC Nightly News.\"\n\nMake that former anchor and managing editor.\n\nHolt, in a surprise move, announced Monday that he is leaving the job but will continue to host \"Dateline.\"\n\nThe news comes a day after reports broke that MSNBC, which, like NBC, is owned by Comcast, was axing Joy Reid's show , \"The ReidOut,\" amid reports that other changes are coming.\n\nTo the extent that people still have faith in the nightly news, Holt's exit is a blow to that trust.\n\nIn a note to \"Nightly News\" and \"Dateline\" staff, Holt wrote, \"A smile comes to my face when I think that with Nightly News, and Dateline, I have now anchored two of the most successful and iconic television news programs in broadcast history. As a 20-year-old radio reporter on the police beat chasing breaking news around San Francisco, I could never have imagined my career path would unfold in the way it has. What an amazing ride.\"\n\nHolt joined NBC News and took over as anchor of \"Nightly News\" in 2015 after Brian Williams was found to have misrepresented stories of his being in a helicopter that took fire while he was covering the Iraq war. Holt filled in as a temporary replacement at first but eventually was named permanent anchor. He was the first Black solo anchor of a nightly newscast.\n\nHolt just looks and sounds like a news anchor, with a deep voice and a steady cadence to his delivery. And with all of the changes in media, it seems like he's been there a lot longer than 2015.\n\nThis isn't the only recent shakeup among broadcast news networks. In January, Norah O'Donnell stepped down as anchor of the \"CBS Evening News\" and was replaced by Maurice DuBois and John Dickerson. (O'Donnell remains at the network.) All of this comes at a time when the public holds the media in low regard, and more and more outlets are either unwilling to stand up to President Donald Trump or out-and-out cower before him.\n\nAll things considered, in other words, anchoring the network news isn't what it used to be, at least in terms of ratings and cachet (though ratings are still relatively high).\n\nA 2024 poll found Holt the most-trusted nightly news anchor, with Muir not far behind (and ABC News leads in the ratings). But this is not a Walter Cronkite situation, where news anchors not only reported the news but, thanks to the outsized trust audiences had in them, helped shape the public's opinions on it, too.\n\nHolt was named the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism by ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication during Trump's first term in 2019. In an interview then, asked how to break through at a time when media was under constant attack from the White House (it's only gotten worse), he said, \"I think you just keep doing your job. At some point, it's not our job to have an impact on societal behavior. We're there to inform.\"\n\nNBC News didn't name a replacement for Holt. His last broadcast as anchor will be in summer of 2025.\n\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com . Facebook: facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm .

Kennedy , he was asked about his recent criticism of predecessor President Joe Biden's reported use of an autopen during his presidency, despite having used one himself.\n\n\"You have criticized President Biden for using autopen in the last few days. Have you yourself ever used autopen, sir?\" the reporter asked.\n\n\"Yeah, only for very unimportant papers,\" Trump responded, before immediately contradicting himself. \"And I don't call them unimportant. When you do letters and people write in, they'd love to have a response. I'll sign them whenever I can, but when I can't, I use an autopen. But to use them for what they've used them for is terrible.\"\n\nAs the journalist attempted to follow up, Trump cut in and asked: \"Who are you with?\"\n\n\"NBC News,\" the reporter replied.\n\n\"I don't want to talk to NBC anymore. I think you're so discredited,\" Trump shot back before waving off the question and moving on.\n\nWatch here:\n\nTrump has claimed without evidence that a mechanical autopen device was used to sign papers on Biden's behalf but without his knowledge, playing into the right-wing narrative of Biden's inexorable cognitive decline.\n\nIn a middle-of-the-night social media meltdown Sunday, Trump used the autopen report to justify nulling pardons issued by Biden , although the legality of such a declaration has been called into question.\n\nTrump has in recent weeks repeatedly sidestepped tough questions by asking ― \"Who are you with?\" ― and then discrediting the reporters or their outlets instead of answering their queries, as part of his ongoing war on media who cover him critically.\n\nTrump used the tactic to dodge a question from HuffPost's S.V. Dáte in February. When told HuffPost, he fired back: \"Oh, no wonder. I thought they, I thought they died. Are they still around? I haven't read them in years. I thought they died.\" (HuffPost is not dead .)\n\nOnly last week, Trump slammed NBC as \"one of the worst networks on television\" ― but he was fast reminded by the reporter of his work with the organization via his long-running reality TV show \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nStephen Miller Throws On-Air Tantrum After MSNBC Analyst Dares To Question Trump\n\nCNN Data Chief Hits Democrats With A 'Horrible, Horrible, Horrible' Reality Check\n\n'Shocking, Insulting': Karoline Leavitt's France Remark Stuns Critics\n\nTrump Claims In Middle-Of-The-Night Meltdown That Biden's Pardons Are 'VOID'"

      "text": "Trump stands by national security adviser Mike Waltz despite disclosure of military plans, saying he's 'learned a lesson'\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump stood by his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, after The Atlantic's editor-in-chief was accidentally added to a private, high-level chat on the messaging app Signal in which military plans were being discussed.\n\n\"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,\" Trump said Tuesday in a phone interview with NBC News.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nTrump's comments were his first substantive remarks since Th e Atlantic broke the story, which detailed how journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently added to a group chat on a private messaging app in which plans for military strikes in Yemen were discussed. Goldberg said he was added to the discussion after he received a request from a user identified as Waltz.\n\nAsked what he was told about how Goldberg came to be added to the Signal chat, Trump said: \"It was one of Michael's people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there.\"\n\nTrump said Goldberg's presence in the chat had \"no impact at all\" on the military operation.\n\nHe expressed confidence in his team, saying he was not frustrated by the events leading up to The Atlantic's story. The situation, Trump said, was \"the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one.\"\n\nWaltz said in a Fox News interview Tuesday night that he takes \"full responsibility\" for organizing the text group, and that a staffer was not to blame for Goldberg appearing in the group.\n\n\"I take full responsibility. I built the - I built the group,\" Waltz told host Laura Ingraham. \"My job is to make sure everything's coordinated.\"\n\nThe Atlantic's article sent shock waves across Washington on Monday. Democratic lawmakers demanded answers from the White House in multiple letters, with one from a group of Senate Democrats calling the situation \"an astonishingly cavalier approach to national security.\"\n\nTop Democrats on the House Armed Services, Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees wrote a separate letter, pushing for answers about other instances in which senior officials discussed national security issues \"using the Signal messaging service or any other messaging service application that has not been approved for the transmission of classified information.\"\n\nWhite House officials defended the chat, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claiming Monday that \"nobody was texting war plans.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday also claimed that war plans were not discussed and that \"no classified material was sent to the thread.\"\n\n\"As the National Security Council stated, the White House is looking into how Goldberg's number was inadvertently added to the thread,\" she added.\n\nIn a statement about the incident, the National Security Council said the thread \"is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security.\"\n\nTrump and Waltz spoke Monday about The Atlantic's story, according to two sources familiar with their conversation.\n\nThe group chat mishap was disclosed 10 years ago to the month after it was revealed that Hillary Clinton used a private email server at times during her tenure as secretary of state in the Obama administration. That revelation prompted staunch criticism from Republicans, several of whom appeared to be part of the Signal chat, according to The Atlantic.\n\nGoldberg reported that he was skeptical about the Signal chat's authenticity at first. But when bombs began falling in Yemen at the time officials in the group chat had discussed it, he concluded that the chat was \"almost certainly real\" and left shortly afterward.\n\nTrump briefly responded to a question about The Atlantic's story Monday, saying \"I don't know anything about it\" and noting that the reporter asking him about the story was \"telling me about it for the first time.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

      "text": "Trump says he feels 'very badly' for fired federal workers but 'many of them don't work at all'\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he feels \"very badly\" for the thousands of civil servants who have lost their jobs in recent weeks but that \"many of them don't work at all.\"\n\nAsked by NBC News whether he feels responsible for so many people losing their jobs , Trump said: \"Sure I do. I feel very badly ... but many of them don't work at all. Many of them never showed up to work.\"\n\n\"When we cut, we want to cut, but we want to cut the people that aren't working or ... not doing a good job,\" he told reporters at an Oval Office meeting with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin. \"We're keeping the best people.\"\n\nTrump referred to the drastic reduction in employees the administration is making at the Education Department this week. Education Secretary \"Linda McMahon is a real professional ... very sophisticated businessperson, and she cut a large number, but she kept the best people, and we'll see how it all works out,\" he said. \"But our country was run very badly. I mean, whether it was that or contracts that were signed, that was so bad, so obviously bad.\"\n\nTrump said billions of dollars of \"fat and waste and fraud and abuse is being taken out\" of the federal government.\n\n\"We have a dream. And you know what the dream is? We're going to move the Department of Education, we're going to move education into the states, so that the states, instead of bureaucrats working in Washington, so that the states can run education,\" he said.\n\nTrump's claim that many federal employees don't show up to work is baseless. A report compiled by the White House budget office said that as of May 2024, 54% of the 2.28 million civilian federal workforce worked in person while 46.4% were eligible to work remotely. The report said that 10% of civilian personnel actually worked in remote-only positions.\n\nBacklash has grown in recent weeks over the scale of cuts, led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Musk, the world's richest man and Trump's biggest campaign donor, said this week that DOGE is working in \"pretty much\" every federal department and plans to double in size.\n\nThe firings have affe cted workers throughout the federal government - in both Washington and across the country.\n\nIn addition to the Education Department's workforce being cut in half, all employees at the Department of Health and Human Services were offered voluntary buyouts last week, and other more recent job cuts or cancellation of government contracts have taken place at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nLast week, White House adviser Alina Habba made negative comments about federal employees , saying: \"I really don't feel sorry for them. They should get back to work for the American people, like President Trump and this administration.\" She also said military veterans affected by the DOGE-led layoffs may not be \"fit to have a job at this moment.\"\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

Backlash from the network's best-known journalists over her hire caused NBC to cut ties with the former Republican National Committee chief and apologize to its employees.\n\nLoading...\n\nMarch 27, 2024, 11:27 a.m. ET | New York\n\nNBC News cut ties March 26 with former Republican National Committee chief Ronna McDaniel less than a week after hiring her as an on-air political contributor, a decision that followed a furious protest by some of its journalists and commentators.\n\nIn announcing the decision in a memo, NBC Universal News Group Chairman Cesar Conde apologized to staff members who felt let down by the hire, acknowledging he had signed off on it.\n\n\"No organization, particularly a newsroom, can succeed unless it is cohesive and aligned. Over the last few days, it has become clear that this appointment undermines that goal,\" Mr. Conde said. But he said the network remained committed to centering \"voices that represent different parts of the political spectrum.\"\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Ms. McDaniel, who stepped down as RNC leader just over two weeks ago. She found out she lost her job through media reports, not from NBC directly, said a person close to her who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about it publicly.\n\nNBC announced March 22 that Ms. McDaniel would contribute commentary across network platforms. It said it wanted the perspective of someone with inside knowledge about the Republican Party and former President Donald Trump heading into the 2024 election, in which Mr. Trump is seeking a second term.\n\nThe response from journalists and others within the network was swift - and public. Former \"Meet the Press\" moderator Chuck Todd criticized his bosses on the air March 24 for the hire, saying he didn't know what to believe from her after she supported former President Donald Trump in \"gaslighting\" and \"character assassination\" following the 2020 election.\n\nAn extraordinary succession of MSNBC hosts - Joe Scarborough, Rachel Maddow, Joy Reid, Nicolle Wallace, Jen Psaki, and Lawrence O'Donnell - all publicly protested the decision to hire Ms. McDaniel on their shows March 25.\n\nRepublicans countered that the protest indicates that people at NBC News, particularly at MSNBC, were unwilling to countenance opposing viewpoints. The hiring, and quick firing, represents one of those rare instances likely to unite the left and right - in anger. \"NBC caving in to the censors,\" Elon Musk, owner of X, formerly Twitter, posted on his platform.\n\nOn his Truth Social site, Mr. Trump said, \"These Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY, and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK.\"\n\nThose who protested her hiring claimed that it wasn't because Ms. McDaniel is a Republican, but it was because she helped promote Mr. Trump's lies about the 2020 presidential election and assisted in efforts to overturn the results.\n\nEfforts by news organizations to hire former politicians is hardly new. NBC News hired Ms. Psaki directly from her job as press secretary to President Joe Biden, and another former Republican National Committee chairman, Michael Steele, hosts a weekend show on MSNBC.\n\nBut there are concerns that the episode with Ms. McDaniel may make it difficult for networks to find voices this year that can provide insight into Mr. Trump and his campaign. Former Trump chief of staff Reince Priebius is an ABC News contributor and Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former White House communications director during the Trump administration, is a CNN commentator.\n\nMr. Conde said that NBC News remains committed to the principle that there must be diverse voices on the network. \"And to that end, we will redouble our efforts to seek voices that represent different parts of the political spectrum.\"\n\nMs. McDaniel's tenure at NBC may have lasted less than a week, but a mess surrounding it could last much longer. She was dropped March 26 by Creative Artists Agency, who she hired to negotiate her TV deal, and has been consulting with lawyers since learning that deal had ended.\n\nThe succession of MSNBC stars who denounced Ms. McDaniel and the hiring reached its apogee during the weekly show by Ms. Maddow, the network's most popular personality who spent nearly half an hour on the issue. She called her hiring by NBC News \"inexplicable.\"\n\nMs. Maddow appeared March 26 on Ms. Reid's show. Ms. Reid said she was grateful for the decision to oust Ms. McDaniel, and Ms. Maddow echoed that.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

NBC Universal News Group Chairman Cesar Conde announced a goal of having a 50% minority staff, saying \"it's the right thing for any business that wants to grow.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nJuly 10, 2020, 12:15 p.m. ET | New York\n\nNBC News leader Cesar Conde, in one of his first public acts in the job, has committed to building a workforce at the news organizations he supervises where at least half of the employees are minorities.\n\nThe staff is currently nearly 27% minority, including 8% each of Black, Latino, and Asian workers. Mr. Conde set no deadline for achieving his \"50 Percent Initiative.\"\n\nHe also wants women to comprise half the employees at NBC News, MSNBC, and CNBC, and he's already nearly there.\n\nThe plan, first reported by the Los Angeles Times, makes Mr. Conde a leader in the current movement to diversify the news business. That conversation has spread throughout the industry since George Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police in May.\n\nFor example, the top editor at the Philadelphia Inquirer resigned after Black reporters objected to a racially insensitive headline. Black reporters at The New York Times said an opinion piece on protests by Sen. Tom Cotton made them feel unsafe; the Times later said the column should not have run without changes and the opinion editor stepped down.\n\n\"It's not just the right thing to do,\" Mr. Conde said in an interview Thursday. \"It's the right thing for any business that wants to grow in the United States.\"\n\nMr. Conde, a former Telemundo executive, was appointed in May as NBC Universal News Group chairman, filling Andrew Lack's role.\n\nThe networks' on-air record is mixed. Lester Holt, who is Black, has the most prominent anchor role at NBC News. But until Thursday's appointment of Joy Reid to host the 7 p.m. show on MSNBC, the liberal-leaning network's evening cast featured five white men and one white woman.\n\nA more diverse workforce will be able to spot stories that might otherwise be missed, Mr. Conde said.\n\n\"We are a news organization that I think has a unique responsibility to reflect and represent the various communities we serve,\" he said. \"In order to do that, we wanted to make sure that we attract the best and the brightest from all walks of life.\"\n\nMs. Reid says she wants to bring some different perspectives to MSNBC's evening lineup - lots of them.\n\n\"We are going to try to fire out of the gate with whatever is the most important thing that's happening that night, and try to frame it and contextualize it,\" Ms. Reid said in an interview. \"Hopefully, I have a very unique frame.\"\n\nAs a Black woman, Ms. Reid addresses a somewhat embarrassing lack of diversity at a news and talk network aimed at a mostly liberal audience.\n\n\"She's earned this, spot on,\" said Mr. Conde. \"I happen to think she's the right person for the right moment in time.\"\n\nA news junkie growing up, \"It almost didn't even sink in until I was older that I was watching a parade of white men tell me what's happening in the world, explaining the world to me,\" said Ms. Reid.\n\nShe naturally brings a different perspective to stories, particularly with the current debate over policing.\n\nMs. Reid has also sought, like MSNBC predecessors Melissa Harris-Perry and Ed Schultz, a greater variety of sources for stories. Instead of bringing in a frequently-seen Harvard professor for a story on the economy, why not find an expert from Morehouse College, for instance?\n\n\"It's kind of like a family dinner table in a really interesting family, a crowded dinner table in a family that adopted multiracial children from all around the world,\" she said.\n\nMinority hiring will be one factor in how managers at the news organization are judged, along with finances and ratings at the shows they supervise, Mr. Conde said.\n\nThat's important, since it will force managers to focus on the issue both in hiring and in retaining minority employees, said Doris Truong, director of training and diversity at the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank. Ms. Truong said NBC News should also set goals for minority representation in leadership.\n\nMr. Conde and Ms. Truong have both suggested paid internships to attract young people of different economic backgrounds.\n\nGiven where NBC currently stands, particularly with Black employees, Ms. Truong said she understands why the initiative has no deadline and is glad that progress will be checked regularly. But she said Mr. Conde needs to ensure his initiative outlasts him.\n\n\"What I would like to hear is whether other people at NBC are committed to this moving forward,\" she said.\n\nMr. Conde told his staff that NBC plans to seize the moment of awakening in the United States.\n\n\"This is the right moment for NBC Universal to not just wait for change to happen but to take the lead in it,\" he told the AP.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Are company officials trying to push him out?\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated April 26, 2015, 8:29 p.m. ET\n\nFormer NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams is half-way through his six-month suspension for inflating stories he told about his reporting.\n\nBut based on a shower of leaks - apparently from company insiders privy to the network's in-house investigation - Mr. Williams may be under pressure to leave NBC sooner rather than later.\n\nAccording to reports in the Washington Post, the New York Times, and CNN Money, NBC has found as many as 11 instances when Williams embellished his recounting of events - including after Hurricane Katrina, when he was covering the Iraq War, covering Israel's military action against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and at Cairo's Tahrir Square during the Arab Spring uprisings.\n\nIn such cases, the anchorman (as is common practice among networks and cable channels) races to the scene of a big story, then vies with his or her competitors to give the most gripping on-the-ground report.\n\nWilliams's embellishment, it seems, often came in later interviews, including appearances on The Daily Show and other entertainment venues.\n\nSome NBC staff reportedly questioned Williams's tales of reporting derring-do, but such questions became public when a former United States Navy SEAL disputed Williams's claim that he flew with SEAL Team Six during the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and that he'd later been given a piece of a helicopter used in the SEAL raid into Pakistan in 2011 that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nHis recounting of events covering hurricane Katrina in 2005 - seeing a body floating in the street from his hotel window in the New Orleans French Quarter - was called into question as well.\n\n\"We have concerns about comments that occurred outside NBC News while Brian was talking about his experiences in the field,\" NBC News president Deborah Turness said in announcing the suspension in February. Among those concerns: His coverage of the demolition of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and his story about meeting Pope John Paul II when Williams was a student at Catholic University in 1979.\n\nLeading his daily \"Politico Playbook\" Sunday (a daily morning must-read for Washington insiders), Mike Allen explains what's behind the string of leaks:\n\n\"Longtime broadcast executives say a triple crown of leaks about Brian Williams late last week appear to be an effort by NBC News to shame him into resigning, to avoid the messiness and possible additional expense of the firing. The brutal leaks were designed to send the message to Brian Williams and his superlawyer, Robert Barnett: 'You're dead. Now negotiate.'\n\n\"Williams was reported to be under a contract of as much as $50 million (five years, at up to $10 million each). Speculation is that he'll get $20 million to $30 million to leave. The $20 million camp says that he's so weak, he'll get less than 50 cents on the dollar. The $30 million camp says Brian has plenty of ways to embarrass the bosses and colleagues who threw him under the bus, and NBC should stop the bleeding/leaking. 'He knows things, too,' a wise man pointed out.\"\n\n\"In private conversations, TV agents and other industry veterans have speculated that the investigation's findings could be useful in a negotiation,\" CNN Money reported Saturday. \"NBC could offer to keep the investigation under wraps, or threaten to release it, depending on Williams's willingness to leave.\"\n\nBut Politico's Allen also reports: \"NBC insiders say his return is still possible. Look for a resolution over the next several weeks.\" During Williams's exile, Lester Holt has been anchoring the NBC Nightly News.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It's a blow to his credibility, but the nature of network news has been evolving.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Feb. 05, 2015, 10:15 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nBrian Williams has said in public in recent years that he came under enemy attack while covering the invasion of Iraq in 2003. He was riding in a Chinook helicopter that was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, he's said. In the NBC News anchor's account the crew was forced to land the aircraft, hard, in hostile desert south of Najaf, where they remained stranded for several days.\n\nProblem is, the central part of that story is false. Mr. Williams admitted on Wednesday that in this incident he did not experience hostile fire. He was in a different helicopter, following the one damaged by the RPG. He arrived at the scene about an hour later.\n\n\"I would not have chosen to make this mistake,\" Williams told the military publication Stars and Stripes on Wednesday. \"I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.\"\n\nHow big a blow is this to network news?\n\nLet's explore the background a bit before we chew on that question. In 2003, Williams accurately reported what had happened on-air. In several subsequent references he told the same story, according to a tick-tock of his comments assembled by CNN .\n\nAfter that, the tale began to grow in the telling. Williams first said that he'd experienced an attack in a 2008 blog post. In a 2013 appearance on the David Letterman show, Williams said flatly that the four helicopters in his flight were hit by ground fire, \"including the one I was in.\" He repeated that assertion last Friday on the news as part of a tribute to an Army veteran who'd helped protect the grounded helicopters and their passengers.\n\nLater he accompanied the Army soldier to a hockey game, where the announcer repeated the shot-at tale.\n\nThat led to crew members from the fated flight grumbling on social media that the whole thing was a blowhard exaggeration. Stars and Stripes reporter Travis Tritten picked up this thread, and the rest is now history.\n\nWilliams retracted the story on-air on Wednesday after the Stars and Stripes report. He's posted a mea culpa on Facebook. But at the moment he's getting pummeled for his error on social media. There are lots of gleeful folks on Twitter posting images of Williams Photoshopped into O.J.'s famous white Bronco, and so forth. Social media is notoriously cruel, but that's still not a good sign for someone whose job rests on his credibility.\n\nConservatives want the anchor out. They already think NBC and MSNBC are the most liberal of the legacy networks.\n\n\"Brian Williams has to go,\" tweeted right-leaning media critic Brent Bozell .\n\nSome on the right charge that liberals are already forming a protective circle around Williams, excusing his mistake as a trick of memory. If Sarah Palin made such a whopper, writes Sean Davis in the right-leaning The Federalist , she \"would've been chewed up and spit out by the exact same people who are now\" defending Williams.\n\nHowever, the breakdown here is not all along predictable ideological lines. At the leftish Washington Monthly, Ed Kilgore writes that if he were Williams he'd \"get out the resume or check the retirement portfolio\".\n\nAnd media reporters for mainstream publications have been scathing. NPR's David Folkenflik called the Williams admission \"stunning.\" The Baltimore Sun's David Zurawik repeatedly referred to the NBC anchor as a \"liar\" and wrote that \"if credibility means anything to NBC News, Brian Williams will no longer be managing editor and anchor of the evening newscast by the end of the day Friday.\"\n\nPersonally, we're interested that so many people are concerned about the credibility of the network evening news. Network news execs long ago shifted the way they thought about evening news anchors, and \"credibility\" was not primary virtue they sought.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

That was supposedly going to destroy the credibility of NBC as it was then known, and that was 1982.\n\nThe point here is that it's a show. The biggest problem of the evening news is not credibility: it's the destruction of its financial model by cable news and the web. If NBC execs think Williams remains a draw for the remaining network news core audience, he'll probably stay. But it's possible that if they see this as an opportunity to reinvent something they've been planning to drastically change, he'll be out. Or at the least take a very long leave of absence.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

Chelsea Clinton will be a special correspondent on NBC's 'Nightly News.'\n\nLoading...\n\nNov. 14, 2011, 12:26 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nChelsea Clinton, who for years was sheltered from the news media by proud and protective parents, has taken a major step to boost her public profile, signing on with NBC News as a special correspondent.\n\nNow in her 30s, the daughter of the former president and the current secretary of State will work on stories for the \"Making a Difference\" series, which appears on the top-rated \"Nightly News.\" The series focuses on people who are helping others through volunteer action. Ms. Clinton will also appear on \"Rock Center With Brian Williams,\" a newly launched newsmagazine.\n\nClinton discussed her move on Facebook , where she has had a page for the past several weeks. \"What inspires me most are people who imagine and implement solutions to challenges in their own lives, in their communities, in our country and around the world,\" she wrote. \"Through their 'Making a Difference' franchise, I am excited to work with NBC News to continue to highlight stories of organizations and individuals who make their communities and our world healthier, more just and more humane.\"\n\nThe newly minted journalist said she will donate most of her earnings to the Clinton Foundation and to George Washington University Hospital in the nation's capital.  Both donations, she said, are to honor her grandmother, Dorothy Rodham, who passed on earlier this month. Her grandmother \"remains my inspiration for this new work as in all things,\" Clinton said.\n\nIt is rare for someone to start a network news career on the network's flagship programs. But life is different for the children of former American presidents. NBC News president Steve Capus told The New York Times that an intermediary for Clinton contacted him in July to let him know that she \"was kicking around what she wanted to do next.\"\n\nClinton joins two other well-known political offspring who launched their journalism careers in prominent roles at NBC News. Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of former President George W. Bush, is a correspondent for NBC's \"Today\" program, the perennial leader in morning news-program ratings. And Meghan McCain, daughter of Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona, a former presidential candidate, is a contributor to MSNBC.\n\nEarly signs of Clinton's emergence came when she campaigned for her mother during Hillary Rodham Clinton's 2008 run for the White House. Chelsea Clinton's public activities include serving on the board of the School of American Ballet in New York and the Weill Cornell Medical College, also in New York. Last week, she appeared at a New York Historical Society event to interview her father about his new book, \"Back to Work: Why We Need Smart Government for a Strong Economy.\" Press reports said she turned in a highly intelligent and poised performance speaking before several hundred attendees.\n\nClinton, who has worked for the McKinsey management consulting company and the Avenue Capital hedge fund, brings strong academic credentials to her new journalism job. A 2001 honors graduate of Stanford University in California, she has a master's degree in public health from Columbia University in New York and is currently working toward a doctorate at Oxford.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The petition writer Guillermo Castaneda Jr. praised Univision for deciding \"to see principles as a priority instead of business.\"\n\nWhen ABC News asked Trump if he regretted his comments, he said he had not be referring specifically to Mexicans. \"I love the Mexican people. I have great respect for Mexico,\" he added.\n\nIn contrast, NBC released a statement following Trump's comments saying, \"Donald Trump's opinions do not represent those of NBC, and we do not agree with his positions on a number of issues, including his recent comments on immigration.\"\n\nCastaneda identifies himself as an immigrant in the petition. \"I am working for the community everyday as well as being an outstanding citizen,\" he says. \"I am not a rapist, I have never taken drugs, and the worst thing I have ever done is going fast on the freeway from time to time.

But it may not have been good journalism.\n\nLoading...\n\nOct. 10, 2014, 8:30 a.m. ET\n\nThe New Yorker's Gabriel Sherman reports that NBC tried to get \"Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart to host Meet The Press before ultimately settling on Chuck Todd as the replacement for David Gregory :\n\nBefore choosing Todd, NBC News president Deborah Turness held negotiations with Jon Stewart about hosting Meet the Press , according to three senior television sources with knowledge of the talks. One source explained that NBC was prepared to offer Stewart virtually \"anything\" to bring him over. \"They were ready to back the Brink's truck up,\" the source said. A spokesperson for NBC declined to comment. James Dixon, Stewart's agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nIt makes sense that NBC would make a run at Stewart. The comedian-cum-media-critic possesses something that broadcast executives covet: a loyal, young audience. And it's not the first time NBC tried recruiting him. According to sources, NBC Entertainment courted Stewart several years ago for a 10 p.m. variety show (the slot ultimately went to Jay Leno). This April, CBS announced Stewart's Comedy Central colleague Stephen Colbert will replace David Letterman next year.\n\nThough not a traditional journalist, Stewart can be a devastatingly effective interrogator, and his Meet the Press might have made a worthy successor to Tim Russert's no-bullshit interviews. During the home stretch of the 2012 campaign, Stewart grilled Obama for his wan presidential debate performance, asking: \"Do you feel you have a stronger affirmative case for a second Barack Obama presidency or a stronger negative case for a Romney presidency?\" And last October, Stewart's clinical dissection of HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius laid bare the disaster of the Obamacare rollout, from which Sebelius never recovered.\n\nOn some level, I suppose that I can see NBC's logic in eyeing Stewart to fill the anchor chair on the longest running television series in American history. The Sunday morning genre has been rather staid and, well, boring , for decades now and bringing in fresh blood like Stewart could have potentially been a game changer that would have remade the entire genre. No, we would not have seen a Sunday morning version of The Daily Show , but a Sunday show with Stewart at the helm would have likely been quite different from what we're used to seeing and, if those shows are going to continue to exist, then maybe that would have been a good thing. Additionally, these shows tend to bring in a largely older demographic while Stewart does an excellent job of attracting younger viewers. Obviously, if they had made the move, NBC would have been banking on the idea that many of The Daily Show's younger viewers would have followed Stewart to his new gig, much like CBS is hoping that many of Stephen Colbert's will follow him when he takes over for David Letterman on \"The Late Show\" next year. Personally, I'm not so sure how likely it would have been that millennials and others would start watching a Sunday morning show that they weren't watching to being with. At the very least, given their viewing habits, it doesn't seem likely that they would have been watching it on Sunday. Looking at it from NBC's perspective, though, it may have made sense. David Gregory's lackluster time at the helm had left the show mired in third place, where it still currently stands, notwithstanding a ratings bump during Todd's first week on the job, and this might have been a way to change the game significantly. At the very least, Stewart would have been quite a contrast to Bob Schieffer on CBS, George Stephanopolous on ABC, Chris Wallace on Fox, and Candy Crowley on CNN.\n\nAs The Washington Post's Erik Wemple notes, though, it's hard to see how this would have been a good deal for Stewart:\n\nWemple has a good point here. In many of the reactions I've seen to this report since it broke last night, people have pointed to several of the hard-hitting interviews that Stewart has done on The Daily Show over the years, including an interview of former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that was, arguably, more direct and forceful about the agency's failures in setting up the PPACA exchange website than anything we saw from the \"mainstream\" news. Although, to be fair, Kevin Drum points out that Stewart is not as good an  interviewer as that Sebelius interview makes him out to be, and the interview segments on The Daily Show seldom get into serious detail. What makes The Daily Show , though, is the commentary on pop culture, media, and political and social issues that is disguised as direct and biting satire, usually using language that would never be allowed on Sunday morning on the flagship program of NBC's news division. If Stewart couldn't bring that part of his talents to the show, then what would really be the point for him? Interviewing the same guests on the same topics week after week isn't necessarily the most interesting job in the world unless you're a political nerd, which is one reason why Chuck Todd was a good choice to replace Gregory to begin with, but I'm not sure how interesting Stewart would find it when his own show seems like a lot more fun to do.\n\nOn a final note, I'm not sure this would have been a good move overall. Say what you will about the Sunday shows, but they are not supposed to be entertainment: They are supposed to be informative. The problem that they suffer from isn't that they aren't more \"fun\" to watch, but that they keep recycling the same conventional wisdom over and over and over again week after week. Bringing in someone like Stewart to host would have either continued that formula, in which case Stewart's particular talents would have been wasted, or it would have changed the show into something less serious, which defeats the entire point of the genre. There's a reason, after all, that Stewart's show is on Comedy Central and not a news network; it is, in the end, a comedy show, not a news program, and it's probably a good idea that we maintain the difference between the two.\n\nIn any case, a move like this would have been a Hail-Mary-pass-type move by NBC, and that's exactly how it would have been seen and reported in that segment of the media that covers the media. As critical as I am of the Sunday shows, I'm not even sure that it would have been a good idea, and, had it failed, it would have been been a disaster of epic proportions from which the show may not have recovered. The Sunday shows are boring and conventional, but that strategy still works for them because there is an audience for it and, because for better or worse, what happens on those shows drives the news cycle for the new weeks. Changing it up might have been fun, but it may not have been good journalism.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Politico magazine reported earlier this year that NBC was paying her $600,000 a year.\n\n\"I loved watching the \"Making a Difference\" stories about remarkable people and organizations making a profound difference in our country and our world,\" Clinton said in a statement posted on her Facebook page. \"I am grateful NBC gave me the opportunity to continue this important legacy.\"\n\nShe was initially hired to do stories for Brian Williams' \"Rock Center\" newsmagazine, but that program was canceled. Her work occasionally appeared on NBC's \"Nightly News.\"\n\nTwo Clinton stories that aired in January were on education programs targeting the underprivileged. She's done stories on a school program for jailed teenagers named after Maya Angelou, an Arkansas tutoring program and a restaurant chain that donates leftover food to the needy. Her last story appeared on Aug. 1.\n\n\"Chelsea's storytelling inspired people across the country and showcased the real power we have as individuals to make a difference in our communities,\" said Alex Wallace, senior vice president at NBC News.\n\nHer exit removes some potential awkwardness for the network if her mother runs for president in 2016. NBC made certain to keep Clinton off the air around the time her mother was making media appearances to promote a book, to avoid any appearance of conflict. NBC also received some criticism when stories about her salary appeared; the network didn't comment on the reports.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.

Read on to learn more about Llamas, including his background at NBC, his family life, and more.\n\nHolt announced his departure from NBC Nightly News in February, explaining that after 10 years as anchor-17 if including his time on the weekend editions-it was time to \"step away\" from the role. \"It has truly been the honor of a lifetime to work with each of you every day, keeping journalism as our true north and our viewers at the center of everything we do,\" he wrote in a note to staff.\n\nIn the coming months, Llamas will take on the iconic anchor role previously held by only three others: Holt, Brian Williams, and Tom Brokaw. In addition to becoming the youngest anchor of any network evening news broadcast, he will also make history as the first Latino to host the weekday edition of NBC Nightly News , according to NBC News .\n\nJanelle Rodriguez, NBC News' executive vice president of programming, praised Llamas in a statement on Wednesday, stating that he \"has the winning combination of journalistic excellence, passionate storytelling and unyielding integrity - all characteristics that have long been trademarks of NBC Nightly News .\"\n\nHere's everything to know about the upcoming Nightly News anchor.\n\nNEW YORK, NY - MAY 18:  Jennifer and Tom Llamas attend The Paley Center for Media's Tribute To ...

(Photo by Santiago Felipe/Getty Images)\n\nLlamas, 45, is a broadcast journalist and the anchor of Top Story with Tom Llamas on NBC News Now. He resides in Westchester County, New York, with his wife, Jennifer, 43, and their three children: daughters Malena, 11, and Juju, 8; and son Tomas, 7. Llamas's parents were Cuban refugees who fled the country during Fidel Castro's regime.\n\n\"Cuban culture a big part of my life. I listen to music from Cuba every single day. I speak Spanish almost every single day,\" he wrote in a 2021 essay for TODAY in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month. \" Usually when I meet you, within the first few minutes I will tell you that I'm Cuban American. It's something that I'm very proud of and it's something that I was taught to be very proud of.\"\n\nLlamas was born and raised in Miami and later moved to New Orleans to attend Loyola University. There, he graduated in 2001 with degrees in broadcast journalism, drama, and speech. At Loyola, he also met his wife, Jennifer, a New Orleans native who has worked as a producer for MSNBC.\n\nThe news anchor told The New York Times in 2024 that his faith plays a significant role in his family. \"My wife and I are both Catholic, and our faith is a big part of our life. We go to church at Resurrection in Rye and will try to hit the 8:30 a.m. Mass, but if we're dragging a little, there are a couple of other opportunities at 11:15 a.m. and 12:30 p.m,\" he said. \"When my kids aren't in sports, we're going to the 5 p.m. weekend Masses on Saturdays, which are good for families because they're a little quicker.\"\n\n\"We'll come back home and pop out to the backyard for an hour of family playtime,\" he continued. \"My son has become obsessed with baseball, so we're hitting lots of balls, going over his swing. Sometimes the girls come by and want to hit balls, too, or Juju and Malena will play together on the trampoline.\"\n\nTODAY - Pictured: Tom Llamas on Monday, November 13, 2023 - (Photo by: Nathan Congleton/NBC via ... More Getty Images)\n\nLlamas has more than 25 years of experience in broadcast journalism. He began his career as an intern at Telemundo before holding positions at NBC News, WTVJ, and WNBC. He served as the weekend anchor of ABC World News Tonight from September 2014 until his final broadcast on January 31, 2021. He returned to NBC later that year.\n\nSince rejoining NBC, Llamas has served as the network's Senior National Correspondent and anchors Top Story with Tom Llamas on NBC News Now , which airs weeknights at 7 p.m. ET. He has also filled in for Holt on NBC Nightly News .\n\nLlamas will continue to anchor Top Story while stepping into his new role as the full-time anchor of NBC Nightly News on weeknights. \"Anchoring NBC Nightly News is a profound honor and one that carries tremendous responsibility,\" he said in a statement. \"I look forward to working with the world-class journalists at Nightly News and Top Story to bring viewers the most important stories every night.\"\n\nHe added that his predecessor \"is a great man and one of the most trusted broadcasters of our time. Just like Lester, I promise to be devoted to our viewers and dedicated to the truth.\"\n\nLlamas' promotion comes after Page Six reported that he and NBC Nightly News Sunday anchor Hallie Jackson were the frontrunners to lead the widely watched evening news program. \"It's def Tom,\" an NBC insider told the outlet at the time. \"It's basically a race between Tom and Hallie Jackson, but Tom is 99 percent.\"\n\nTODAY - Pictured: Tom Llamas on Thursday, October 20, 2022 - (Photo by: Helen Healey/NBC via Getty ...

More Miami last month.\n\nWhen the Republican candidates for president-not, of course, including Donald Trump-took the stage last month in Miami for the fourth GOP debate of the 2024 presidential cycle, NBC's live streaming coverage on NBC News Now saw a massive spike in eyeballs, climbing 650% above the platform's average viewership.\n\nViewership \"continues to defy gravity\" said NBC News Executive Vice President of Programming Janelle Rodriguez. \"Where the fracturing of audiences has led to most network shows lucky to come out flat for the year, we've benefited from double-digit growth.\"\n\nNBC News Now launched in 2019, and quickly established itself as the country's fastest-growing streaming news network, with average monthly viewership hitting 34 million hours in 2022 (representing an increase of 55% from 2021). \"We would have expected to level off at some point,\" Rodriguez told me, but instead, NBC News Now has kept flying-finishing 2023 as the streamer's best year on record.\n\nHallie Jackson on the set of 'Hallie Jackson Now' on NBC News Now\n\nNBC's success is striking, especially as other established media brands have struggled to expand into streaming, with the implosion of CNN+ taking its spot as one of the most spectacular media failures ever.\n\nUnlike CNN's failed bet that viewers would sign up and pay for CNN+, NBC News Now has always been free. \"Early on we made the bet to be everywhere that our audiences are, and to be high quality and free,\" Rodriguez said. \"And I think that has been the winning combination for us.\"\n\nZinhle Essamuah and Kate Snow on the set of 'NBC News Daily,' which streams on NBC News Now and is ...

The possibility of a rematch between Donald Trump and Joe Biden could deliver one of the most intensely followed elections in history.\n\nBut NBC also has the Summer Olympics in Paris, which will dominate broadcast prime time and allow NBC to flex more of its ability to offer content across a wide array of platforms. \"We're just going to keep at it,\" Rodriguez said. \"I think 2024 is going to be a massive year for us once again.\""

He will replace ... More Hoda Kotb early in 2025.\n\nNBC has named Craig Melvin as the replacement for Hoda Kotb as co-host of the network's iconic Today show, elevating a well-known and liked member of the show's on-air family to sit alongside Savannah Guthrie. In September, Kotb announced she would be leaving the morning show in early 2025.\n\nGuthrie announced the news to viewers , describing Melvin as \"talented, wonderful, hard-working, most worthy,\" before hugging him as the on-air team gave him a round of applause-the same reaction the show's production team had, Guthrie said, when they learned the news earlier Thursday morning. \"This is one of the most popular decisions NBC News has ever made.\"\n\n\"I am beyond excited and grateful,\" Melvin said, thanking \"NBC and the folks here who deemed me worthy.\" He said he had \"enjoyed a lifetime of blessings, and this is the latest in a long line of blessings.\"\n\nMelvin talked about his family, many of whom had to work more than one job-including a grandmother who supported her family \"running numbers and liquor\" who went to prison, where Melvin's father was born. \"That didn't define him, he overcame addictions in his life and he's become one of my favorite human beings.\"\n\nTODAY - Pictured: Craig Melvin, Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Al Roker on Tuesday, August 20, 2024 ...

From breaking news coverage in the field, to presidential interviews, to multiple Olympics and Super Bowls, Craig's shown he has the talent and the range to cover all that we do here at Today . And he does it without ever losing that Southern charm.\"\n\nMelvin will ascend to the anchor chair as the Today brand has expanded hugely beyond its decades-old roots in broadcast television. The show's producers describe it as a lifestyle brand with podcasts, special programs and events, digital, streaming and e-commerce.\n\nAs Kotb told me last year , \"I feel like we get the best of all of it,\" said Kotb. \"If you'd like things to slow down, we've got you covered, man. We've got you totally covered.

Melvin currently hosts the third hour of Today , and previously served as the show's weekend co-host. He will continue in his role in the 3rd hour alongside Al Roker, Dylan Dreyer and Sheinelle Jones.\n\nKotb will stay with NBC, but decided earlier this year that she was ready to step back from the demands of anchoring a television fixture like Today . \"I realized that it was time for me to turn the page at 60, and to try something new,\" she said in an emotional message to viewers back in September.\n\n\"I remembered standing outside looking at these beautiful bunch of people with these gorgeous signs, and I thought, 'This is what the top of the wave feels like for me.' And I thought it can't get better, and I decided that this is the right time for me to kind of move on.\"\n\nAt the time, Melvin said of Kotb, \"you've been the heart of this show for a long time, and there's no replacing that.\"\n\n\"People in this business, when that little red light, it goes off, they're different people,\" he said. \"We've worked with all these people before. You're the opposite. That little red light goes off, you are exactly like people see you in the morning - just the biggest heart.\"\n\nTODAY - Pictured: Craig Melvin on Wednesday, October 23, 2024 - (Photo by: Nathan Congleton/NBC via ...

Beginning January 13, the show will be called Today with Jenna & Friends , featuring a rotating group of co-hosts alongside Jenna Bush Hager, who has hosted the show with Kotb since 2019.\n\nNBC expects to name a permanent co-host in the next few months."

NBC News Now will end 2022 with a daily lineup of more than 10 hours of live programming-more than any other streaming news network-and a slate of original programming including 52 specials and documentaries.\n\nBack in March, NBC News Now became the first U.S.-based streaming news network to secure international distribution in Europe, where viewers can watch NBC News Now programming via Sky and Virgin Media in the U.K.\n\nRodriguez believes NBC News Now's growth will continue in 2023, and 2022 may have been a turning point-the year when NBC established itself as the dominant player in the streaming news. \"We're not going to pull back,\" she told me. \"I think while other people are really struggling to figure out both the economics and the editorial programming in this space, we are really clear about what we want to do. And I think the audience has responded to that.\"\n\nAn advertisement for CNN+ is displayed in Manhattan on April 21, 2022 in New York City. Only three ... More weeks after its launch, CNN announced that it's new streaming service would be shut down. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nThe success of NBC News Now suggests that it wasn't the business case that killed CNN+, it was the execution. CNN's vision for streaming involved making a bet that with the right programming-and the established CNN brand-the network could find enough viewers willing to pay for one more subscription service. The network predicted CNN+ would turn a profit within four years-with an investment over that time of about $1 billion.\n\nThat was ultimately money CNN's new owners were not willing to pay, and soon after the Warner Bros. Discovery merger was finalized, all further investment in CNN+ ended. CNN had already spent an estimated $300 million in splashy programming like Stanley Tucci eating his way around Italy and Eva Longoria exploring the history and culture of Mexico. The network had also hired hundreds-correspondents, producers and technical staff-along with high profile hosts like NPR's Audie Cornish and Fox News' Chris Wallace.\n\nBut for all the money spent, the message just wasn't clear to consumers: was this news? Or what, exactly? CNN+ promised shows featuring Anderson Cooper and Jake Tapper, but Tapper's show would be about books, and Anderson Cooper Full Circle would involve the AC360 host \"interviewing authors, entertainers, mindfulness experts and community leaders, while highlighting the stories happening outside of Washington.\"\n\nNBC News Now isn't confusing people about what it's mission is. This is NBC News, period. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd has a show on NBC News Now, but it's not about cooking or books-it's about politics, and it's called Meet the Press Now . You'll also find the network's NBC Nightly News franchise represented, with programs like NBC Nightly News Special: Inside Ukraine , which built on and expanded reporting first aired on Lester Holt's evening newscast.\n\nAs an NBC promotional effort back in February made clear, NBC News Now was bringing NBC's journalists to you anywhere and anytime-without having to sign up and pay for another streaming service:\n\nOutdoor advertising for NBC News Now in New York's Times Square\n\n\"The breadth and depth of NBC News and the journalists we have is just incredible, so it gives us that extra space to really go deep on topics as we travel the world in our normal reporting,\" Rodriguez told me, stressing that NBC News Now offers viewers everything NBC News is known for, just delivered in a way that younger consumers expect: when they want it, and how they want it. NBC News Now viewers, the network said, watch an hour at a time and tend to be significantly younger than the older viewers watching cable and broadcast news.\n\n\"There's a huge audience out there that's been under-served by the national networks,\" Rodriguez said. \"And that's the space where we live. And what we've found is that once people find us, they come back. So our three, four or five-day-a-week viewer rate is very high.\"\n\nNBC News correspondent Tom Costello, whose documentary, \"Battlefield Space,\" debuts tonight on NBC ... More News Now\n\nFor longtime NBC journalist Tom Costello, whose special, Battlefield Space: To The Moon and Beyond debuts tonight, NBC News Now offers a chance to bring his reporting not to new viewers, but also to people who know his reporting and want more. \"The beauty is that NBC News Now gives us the forum to go deep and not necessarily be constrained by the clock that is always ticking when you're doing a spot for Nightly News or Today,\" he told me. \"It gives us the opportunity to reach out to an audience that is very keenly interested in these subjects and will stick with us as we try to provide all the details and the nuance and all the layers to this kind of story.\"\n\nA graphic for the NBC News Now documentary \"Battlefield Space: To The Moon and Beyond\"\n\nIt also means a story like Costello's special on space won't vanish, but will continue to be available to viewers who want to stream it, whether that's this week, next year, or beyond. \"That's the beauty of doing a documentary that's online, it's always there,\" he said. Those who do watch tonight may be surprised by China's plans to build a permanent base on the moon by 2030. \"They may well eclipse the United States within the next 20 years,\" he said. \"Military leaders are very concerned about that.\""

      "text": "Vance Says TikTok Will 'Almost Certainly' Reach Deal To Avoid U.S. Ban Next Month\n\nVice President JD Vance told NBC News on Friday \"there will almost certainly be a high-level agreement\" that stops TikTok from being banned in the U.S. this April, expressing optimism a deal could be reached that addresses national security concerns about the Chinese-owned social media app.\n\nVance commented on the deal Friday. (Photo by JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nVance told NBC he believes a deal will be struck that \"satisfies our national security concerns\" and \"allows there to be a distinct American TikTok enterprise.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order immediately after taking office this year that pushed TikTok's initial January ban to April 5, giving the administration time to find an American buyer for the app.\n\nVance did not share details about potential buyers with NBC and said clerical issues could cause the deal to be finalized after the deadline, adding, \"The question is whether we can get all the paper done.\"\n\nThe vice president also said the Trump administration would like to get a deal done without another extension, but noted concerns about how equity ownership of the app would be split up and the volume of legal paperwork needed to enforce it could be an impediment.\n\nVance said he believes TikTok will remain operational in the U.S. and \"also operational in a way that's protective of Americans' data privacy and America's national security.\"\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts : We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nTrump said last week he would \"probably\" extend the deadline for TikTok's potential ban, adding \"we have a lot of interest in TikTok... so hopefully China will approve of the deal.\"\n\nA handful of billionaires and large companies have been eyed as potential buyers for TikTok since its future in the U.S. came under question-though it's unclear who could buy the app, especially since its owner, ByteDance, has opposed selling it. Trump said in January he hoped a \"bidding war\" would materialize for TikTok, suggesting Microsoft, which made an offer for the app in 2020, was one of the companies interested in acquiring TikTok. Computer software giant Oracle has also been pegged as a potential buyer that would take a majority stake in TikTok while ByteDance keeps a minority stake. Billionaire Frank McCourt 's internet advocacy group Project Liberty announced a formal offer for TikTok in January backed by Guggenheim Securities, \"Shark Tank\" investor Kevin O'Leary and others. Jimmy Donaldson, who has the most subscribers on YouTube and is better known as MrBeast, joined an investor group led by tech entrepreneur Jesse Tinsley that made an all-cash offer for TikTok in January. Chinese officials have reportedly discussed letting ByteDance sell TikTok to pro-Trump billionaire Elon Musk, though Musk says he isn't planning on buying it.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan law last year forcing TikTok to find an American buyer or face a ban in the U.S. by January. Trump, who championed the app in the latter days of his presidential campaign despite previously supporting a nationwide ban, vowed to save the app from a ban last year. At the heart of the law against the app was national security concerns from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who claimed China could use the app to spy on Americans and influence discourse in the U.S. TikTok has denied accusations it compromises Americans' data privacy and allegations it is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party. Reporting from Forbes found ByteDance had spied on journalists , stored some creators' data in China, mishandled advertiser data and allowed staff to view unsecured information on celebrities and politicians . Some 170 million American users are on TikTok, according to the app.\n\nTikTok Ban Timeline: TikTok Returns To U.S. App Stores-For Now (Forbes)\n\nThese Billionaires, Companies And Investors Could Buy TikTok-As Trump Eyes 'Bidding War' With Microsoft (Forbes)\n\nOne Community.

Since joining NBC from ABC in 2021, he has served as Holt's primary fill-in on the broadcast and has become the de facto lead anchor for NBC News Now, where he hosts the one-hour \"Top Story\" newscast.\n\nHolt, who announced last week that he is stepping down after a decade at \"Nightly News,\" will remain at NBC to focus on \"Dateline NBC.\"\n\nLlamas said in a statement, \"I look forward to working with the world class journalists at 'Nightly News' and 'Top Story' to bring viewers the most important stories every night.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Lester Holt is a great man and one of the most trusted broadcasters of our time. Just like Lester, I promise to be devoted to our viewers and dedicated to the truth.\"\n\nWith Llamas taking over \"Nightly News,\" ABC's David Muir now stands as the longest-serving evening news anchor, leading \"World News Tonight\" both in tenure and ratings. Meanwhile, CBS News made a major shift earlier this year, replacing Norah O'Donnell with a co-anchor team of John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois.\n\nWhile television news has evolved significantly since the days of Walter Cronkite, when millions tuned in at dinnertime, the ABC, CBS, and NBC evening newscasts still collectively draw more than 10 million viewers each night. The anchors remain the defining faces of their respective news divisions.\n\n\"Tom has the winning combination of journalistic excellence, passionate storytelling and unyielding integrity - all characteristics that have long been trademarks of NBC 'Nightly News,' said Janelle Rodriguez, NBC News' executive vice president of programming.\n\nLlamas will be the first evening news anchor to simultaneously retain a streaming role. His \"Top Story\" broadcast will air on \"NBC News Now\" each weeknight following \"Nightly News.\"\n\nReporting by the Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nThis is a developing news story and will be updated as more information is available.\n\nUpdate: 3/5/25, 3:54 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nGabe Whisnant is a Breaking News Editor at Newsweek based in North Carolina.

It has truly been the honor of a lifetime to work with each of you every day, keeping journalism as our true north and our viewers at the center of everything we do,\" Holt said in a memo to staffers Monday.\n\n\"But before we play the walk off music, I have another announcement. I'm excited to report I will be continuing as anchor of 'Dateline NBC,' but for the first time in a full time capacity whereby I will be expanding my footprint on the broadcast and crafting 'Dateline 'hours on subjects I care deeply about. I am thrilled to be able to work more closely with my enormously talented friends at Dateline as the broadcast continues to grow and attract new viewers in new places.\"\n\nLester Holt began his career in broadcast journalism at local CBS television stations in California. He covered community news and events in the Sacramento and Bay Area markets.\n\nHolt has been with NBCUniversal for a quarter century, joining MSNBC in 2000.\n\nHolt, the first Black male solo anchor for a major network newscast, became anchor of \"Nightly News\" in June 2015, after eight years steering its weekend editions and 12 years co-anchoring \"Weekend TODAY.\"\n\nHolt was named the permanent anchor of \"Nightly News,\" four months after former host Brian Williams was suspended for exaggerating his experiences.\n\nHe has been the principal anchor of \"Dateline\" since September 2011.\n\nHolt's assignments have included extensive international reporting from conflict zones and major global events. In addition, Holt has moderated presidential primary and general election debates for NBC.\n\nAccording to NBC, \"Nightly News\" now reaches roughly 7 million viewers each week. The network traces its flagship program's origins back to 1948, when it first began broadcasting nightly, regularly scheduled news, although the \"NBC Nightly News\" title was only established in 1970.\n\nNBC's \"Dateline\" series, now in its 33rd season since its 1992 debut, has become well-known for its true crime coverage-a segment that has also led to a top-rated podcast and scripted television projects, including a spinoff of \"The Thing About Pam.\" In addition to true crime, \"Dateline\" features a mix of breaking news, investigative journalism, and human interest stories.\n\nJanelle Rodriguez, executive vice president of programming for NBC News, said in a statement, \"Because of Lester's steady and thoughtful leadership, Nightly News has sustained its perch as a trusted and top news destination for millions of viewers across America. He has led the network during some of the country's most fraught and challenging times in the past decade, most notably during the early days of the pandemic when Lester's voice was a source of comfort each night for so many. He's taken viewers to the frontlines of every major story and sat down with world leaders, skillfully eliciting answers on consequential issues. Quite simply, Lester is the beating heart of this news organization.\"\n\nHer statement continued, \"He's earned deep respect and reverence from our newsroom, industry colleagues and, most importantly, viewers. What's equally remarkable is how Lester has masterfully filled this esteemed role with extraordinary grace and humility. He's proven time and time again why he stands among the great legends of broadcast news.\n\n\"Lester will continue with NBC News for years to come leading another iconic and number one show- Dateline.\"\n\nLester Holt's announcement comes just weeks after Norah O'Donnell delivered her final broadcast on \"CBS Evening News,\" where she had been the network's top anchor since 2019.\n\nNBC also saw a change on its dayside programming when Hoda Kotb concluded her tenure as one of the lead anchors for \"Today\" on January 10.\n\nMeanwhile, MSNBC is preparing for its own transformation by set to end its corporate connection with NBC News once a spinoff is finalized later this year.\n\nThe network is also revamping its prime-time lineup amid these changes.\n\nIn a Monday memo to staff, MSNBC's new president Rebecca Kutler announced that Joy Reid would be leaving the network, effectively ending her show, \"The ReidOut.\"\n\nUpdate: 2/24/25, 12:12 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate: 2/24/25, 12:32 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate: 2/24/25, 2:01 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate: 2/24/25, 3:18 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate: 2/24/25, 3:47 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nThis is a developing news story and will be updated as more information is available.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nGabe Whisnant is a Breaking News Editor at Newsweek based in North Carolina.

These include NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt, who recently announced his exit after a decade behind the desk.\n\nHolt, who has been with NBC News since 2000, became the full-time anchor of NBC Nightly News in 2015 after the departure of Brian Williams. Over the years, he has covered major global events, presidential elections, and high-profile interviews, cementing his status as one of the most visible figures in American journalism.\n\nAs networks adapt to evolving audience habits, industry changes, and the growing influence of digital media, many are rethinking their news lineups.\n\nHere's a list of all the major anchors leaving in 2025.\n\nLester Holt, who has anchored NBC Nightly News since 2015, is stepping down. His departure was officially announced on February 24, with Holt set to remain with NBC as the main anchor of Dateline, a show he has worked on for nearly 15 years. NBC has not yet announced his replacement.\n\nHoda Kotb officially left the Today Show on January 10 after 17 years on air.

Mitchell, who has been a central figure at NBC News since the 1970s, will remain with the network as a senior political correspondent.\n\nJim Acosta, who has been with CNN for nearly 20 years, had his last show on the network on January 28. Acosta reportedly turned down an offer to host a new late-night show at CNN, instead choosing to leave.\n\nAcosta had been a high-profile presence at CNN, known for his direct confrontations with former President Donald Trump , during which he famously had his White House press pass revoked.\n\nChuck Todd, former moderator of Meet the Press and NBC News chief White House correspondent, announced in January he would be leaving the network after nearly two decades.\n\nTodd stepped down from Meet the Press in 2023 but remained with NBC in a senior role. Now, he is moving on to explore other opportunities outside the network.\n\nTodd's exit marks a significant shift for NBC's political coverage, as he has been a key figure in the network's White House reporting.\n\nAyman Mohyeldin's weekend show on MSNBC was canceled in February, marking another shake-up at the network.

Nonetheless, former Trump administration official Steve Bannon , who hosts a popular right-wing podcast, suggested in an interview with NewsNation this month that it's a real option on the table.\n\nTrump was asked directly about a third term in a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday morning.\n\n\"A lot of people want me to do it,\" Trump said. \"But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it's very early in the administration.\"\n\nTrump went on to say that he likes \"working\" and that's he's \"not joking\" about a possible third term.\n\n\"But I'm not-it is far too early to think about it... There are methods which you could do it,\" he said.\n\nMost legal analysts say there is no constitutional path to a third term for a president. The 22nd Amendment reads: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"\n\nSome have suggested unconventional paths for Trump to get around the Constitution, as repeal of the amendment is believed to be all but impossible given current political dynamics. One idea floated by some is for Trump to be the vice-presidential nominee, and then whoever serves as president could step aside after winning.\n\nHowever, legal analysts believe even this would be constitutionally tenuous and would likely be blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court . Others have warned that Trump could just ignore the Constitution and simply remain in office, with no clear way to force him out.\n\nTrump, in an April 2024 interview with Time magazine, said he would not be in favor of changing the 22nd Amendment.\n\n\"I wouldn't be in favor of it at all. I intend to serve four years and do a great job. And I want to bring our country back. I want to put it back on the right track,\" he said.\n\nSenator John Curtis, a Utah Republican, to NBC News last Sunday when asked about a possible third Trump term: \"I wouldn't have supported a third term for [former President] George Washington ,\" he responded, laughing. \"That's a no, yeah.\"\n\nSteve Bannon to NewsNation earlier this month: \"I'm a firm believer that President Trump will run and win again in 2028, so I've already endorsed President Trump. A man like this comes along once every century, if we're lucky. We've got him now.\"\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Newsweek on Thursday : \"Aside from the potential vice president loophole, there is no legal path for Trump to run for a third term. Politically, he doesn't have the votes to repeal the 22nd Amendment, either in Congress or the states.\"\n\nRepresentative Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously told Newsweek in a January statement : \"By now, Donald Trump's pattern is predictable: 'joke' about something unconstitutional or authoritarian; normalize the 'joke'; allow sycophantic Republicans to adopt the 'joke' as a serious idea until it becomes MAGA orthodoxy.\"\n\nUpdate, 3/30/25 at 1:32 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nJason Lemon is a Senior Politics Editor at Newsweek based in Brooklyn, New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nTom Llamas, set to replace Lester Holt as anchor of NBC's Nightly News this summer, was called a \"sleaze\" by former President Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign.\n\nNBC News announced Wednesday that Llamas will take over as anchor of Nightly News this summer, replacing Lester Holt.\n\nTrump has a tenuous relationship with the press, often using the phrase \"fake news\" to dismiss unfavorable coverage. He has been outspoken in his support for and criticism of specific outlets and journalists.\n\nShortly after taking office again , Trump implemented media changes affecting the press pool and access. The media shake-up celebrated by Trump has raised concerns among some in the industry who fear that access to reporting the truth will become increasingly difficult as credentials are revoked and outlets too favorable of the president may not provide full coverage.\n\nIn 2016, Llamas, who was a weekend anchor of ABC World News Tonight, asked then-presidential candidate Trump about conflicting Iowa fundraising reports.\n\n\"What I don't want is, when I raise millions of dollars, have people say - like this sleazy guy right over here from ABC; he's a sleaze in my book,\" Trump replied to Llamas' question.\n\nLlamas responded, \"Why am I a sleaze?\" To which Trump said, \"You're a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well.\"\n\nThe journalist posted on Twitter at the time that, \"Trump just called me a 'sleaze.' Should be an interesting week.\"\n\nTwo years later, in 2018, Llamas sat down for an exclusive one-on-one interview with then-first lady Melania Trump.\n\nLlamas, 45, is a Miami native and the son of Cuban immigrants. He lives in Purchase, New York, with his family.\n\nHe has a journalism career spanning more than 20 years, with reporting roles at MSNBC , ABC, and NBC.\n\nSince joining NBC from ABC in 2021, he has served as Holt's primary fill-in on the broadcast and has become a de facto lead anchor for NBC News Now , where he hosts the one-hour Top Story with Tom Llamas .\n\nJanelle Rodriguez, NBC News' executive vice president of programming described Tom as possessing the \"winning combination of journalistic excellence, passionate storytelling and unyielding integrity-all characteristics that have long been trademarks of NBC 'Nightly News.'\"\n\nThe journalist told The New York Times that he collects records, around 200 of them.\n\nLlamas and his wife, Jennifer, share three children, two daughters, Malena and Juju, and one son, Tomas, according to The New York Times .\n\nJennifer is a native of New Orleans, and is also a journalist by training, having worked at MSNBC as an executive producer of NewsNation with Tamron Hall.\n\nShe graduated from Loyola University New Orleans with a bachelor of arts in broadcast journalism in 2003, according to her LinkedIn profile .\n\nBoth Tom and Jennifer are Catholic. They attend church in Rye, New York, per The New York Times.\n\nHolt announced in February that he will step down from his role this summer. It is unclear which summer month Llamas will take over yet.\n\nLlamas has called his new role a \"profound honor\" and said it carries \"tremendous responsibility.\"\n\nHolt said on Wednesday that he is \"happy for Tom and his family - and crush it my friend.\"\n\nUpdate 3/6/25, 8:07 a.m. ET: This article has been updated to include Llamas interviewed Melania Trump.\n\nMandy Taheri is a Newsweek reporter based in Brooklyn.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe American public is becoming more dissatisfied with how President Donald Trump is handling the economy, with one poll showing a majority disapproval for the first time ever.\n\nAn NBC News survey of 1,000 registered voters found that 54 percent said they disapprove of Trump's job performance on the economy . The poll was conducted between March 7 and 11, and the results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nThe news network said this was the first time Trump has received a majority negative view of his handling of the economy in national NBC News polling.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the White House for comment via email.\n\nVoters trusting Trump to handle and improve the economy over former Vice President Kamala Harris was seen as pivotal to the Republican 's 2024 election victory. The polling suggests there is public frustration that the president is not following through with his campaign promises amid fears of a potential recession and ongoing major tariff plans on international imports.\n\nThe NBC News poll, released Sunday, shows that while Trump's overall approval rating of 47 percent is among the highest ever scores for him as president, voters are concerned about the state of the economy.\n\nMore than half (54 percent) said they disapprove of how Trump is handling the economy, compared to 44 percent who approve. More voters also expressed disapproval of how the Republican president is handling inflation and the cost of living (55 percent) against 42 percent saying they approve.\n\nThe poll also shows that 18 percent of voters believe the economy is currently in a \"good\" or \"excellent\" state. In comparison, 43 percent believe the economy is in a poor state and nearly four in 10 (39 percent) of poll respondents said they think the state is in a \"fair\" condition.\n\nOther polls have suggested that voters are becoming more concerned with Trump's handling of the economy since he reentered the White House on January 20.\n\nA CNN poll, released March 12, found that 56 percent of the public disapproves of his handling of the economy. This figure is higher than at any point during Trump's first term in office, according to CNN polling.\n\nThe CNN survey was conducted by SSRS from March 6 to 9 among 1,206 U.S. adults. The results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.\n\nA recent YouGov/Economist poll showed that 43 percent of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of jobs and the economy, compared to 47 percent who disapprove. In a previous late January poll, nearly half (49 percent) said they backed Trump's handling of the economy, while 37 percent disapproved.\n\nBetween the two polls, there has been a 10-point increase in those expressing disapproval of Trump's handling of the economy in just over a month.\n\nThe latest YouGov/Economist poll was conducted March 9-11 among 1,699 U.S. adults. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.\n\nKristen Hopewell, an economist and director of the University of British Columbia's Liu Institute for Global Issues, previously told Newsweek: \"There's no state that won't be harmed by Trump's tariffs-but some will be hit even harder than others. Tariffs on steel and aluminum will raise costs for manufacturers across the U.S., undermining their competitiveness. This will hurt the biggest hubs of American manufacturing-California, Texas, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Wisconsin, and North Carolina-hardest.\"\n\nMark A. DiPlacido, policy adviser at conservative think tank American Compass, wrote in a March 17 opinion piece for Newsweek : \"The tariffs President Trump levied under his first administration raised more than $230 billion in revenue while reducing U.S. dependence on tariffed goods and avoiding inflation. Given the persistence of the U.S. trade deficit, President Trump is right to take tariffs to the next level. Whether through a simple global tariff of 10-20 percent-which could raise as much as $2.2 trillion in revenue over 10 years-or a wider set of reciprocal tariffs based on our trade balance with each foreign nation, the United States must assert its economic interests against the unfair practices of our trading partners.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, responding to a question about a potential recession on NBC News' Meet the Press on Sunday, said : \"There are no guarantees. Like, who would've predicted COVID? I can predict that we're putting in robust policies that will be durable. And could there be an adjustment? Because I tell you that this massive government spending that we've had, if that had kept going, we would have to wean our country off of that.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in a February 2 post on Truth Social, wrote: \"THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA! WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID. WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE - AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!\"\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that Trump's tariff plans against Canada and Mexico will harm U.S. GDP growth.\n\nThe OECD said Monday that U.S. economic growth is projected to be 2.2 percent in 2025 and 1.6 percent in 2026. These figures are down from previous forecasts of 2.4 percent and 2.1 percent respectively.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nEwan Palmer is a Newsweek News Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on US politics, and Florida news.

Nonetheless, the staffer was investigated, asked to take a polygraph and was told the agency intends to revoke her clearance.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a senior DHS spokesperson told Newsweek via email on Thursday night, \"If a DHS employee gives unauthorized information on an ICE operation as our officers face a 320 percent increase in violence against them, we will take appropriate personnel action to keep our officers safe.\"\n\nShe has reportedly worked across multiple DHS agencies since the George W. Bush administration and remained in service throughout the entirety of President Trump's first term.\n\nMeanwhile, t he White House and Trump officials have maintained that the information shared via Signal with The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was not classified.\n\nBut Democrats and former national security and intelligence officials have challenged that claim, pointing out that the group chat included messages outlining specific plans for an imminent strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nThe use of Signal, rather than a secure government platform, to discuss classified military plans has also sparked widespread criticism , with some experts saying it may have violated the Espionage Act.\n\nTrump officials now face a lawsuit filed in the U.S. Court for the District of Columbia by the nonprofit watchdog American Oversight. The suit accuses several senior administration officials involved in the Signal chat of violating the Federal Records Act and the Administrative Procedure Act by conducting government business on a platform designed to erase communications.\n\nLegal experts and former officials told NBC News the DHS incident highlights an apparent double standard in how career employees and political appointees are treated for similar mistakes.\n\nHouser told NBC News: \"Targeting a career official who dedicated her service to protecting public safety and enforcing the law - while excusing political appointees who leaked sensitive war plans - shows this administration punishes integrity and protects recklessness. That doesn't just betray her, it weakens every public servant who risks their career to do the right thing.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said at a press conference on Wednesday: \"Obviously, someone made a mistake.

      "text": "Biden advisers bristle at Gavin Newsom's plan to debate DeSantis\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - California Gov. Gavin Newsom is increasingly being viewed as a nuisance to some of President Joe Biden's political advisers, according to four people familiar with the matter.\n\nThough Biden's camp no longer sees Newsom as a wannabe challenger - and some in Biden's orbit praise him for acting as a top campaign surrogate - Newsom's plan to debate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on television carries more risk than potential reward, these people say.\n\nThat has caused consternation within Biden's operation and among Vice President Kamala Harris' allies.\n\nSome Biden advisers have complained privately that the planned debate, which Fox News host Sean Hannity would moderate, could make voters think Newsom is running a shadow 2024 campaign at a time when most Democrats say they'd prefer a different candidate at the top of the ticket. They also argue that it could elevate DeSantis, whom White House advisers initially perceived as a greater threat to Biden's re-election hopes than the GOP front-runner, former President Donald Trump. (Others have insisted that there is no harm in their debating and that, in fact, it could be a net positive.)\n\nHarris allies take particular umbrage at what they see as Newsom's attempt to position himself for the 2028 Democratic presidential primarily at her expense.\n\n\"It's disrespectful,\" an outside adviser to Harris said. \"Joe Biden is running with Kamala Harris. That's the Democratic ticket.\"\n\nIt's not clear yet that the debate will actually go forward: The two camps have been haggling over proposed rules since DeSantis accepted Newsom's standing challenge this month. But the specter of the two governors going head to head has highlighted the degree to which Biden's interests aren't always clear and can diverge from Harris' interests.\n\nNewsom is expected to be a top surrogate for Biden's campaign at the second Republican presidential primary debate in Simi Valley, California, in September, said a Democratic aide familiar with the plans.\n\nJust as some Biden advisers are irked by Newsom's move, others see potential benefit in a high-profile Democrat's defending his record and agenda against a prominent Republican hopeful.\n\n\"What he's doing here is appropriate for a surrogate. It would not be appropriate for the president or the vice president,\" said a Biden adviser who lauded Newsom for taking on DeSantis and for sharing a donor list with Biden's re-election campaign.\n\n\"We're in close touch with him,\" this adviser said. \"This is the kind of thing we want surrogates to do.\"\n\nNewsom didn't respond to a text message seeking comment on what he learned about DeSantis from Wednesday's Republican primary debate and whether he thinks the two men will end up debating.\n\nKevin Munoz, a spokesman for Biden's re-election team, said the campaign is on board with the debate.\n\n\"Governor Newsom is a strong partner and surrogate for the Biden-Harris campaign,\" he said in a text message. \"We coordinate closely on campaigning, whether it's fundraising or media. When he brought the debate idea to us, we endorsed it.\"\n\nMunoz declined to say specifically when the endorsement came or who gave it.\n\nIt isn't the first time the White House has had to contemplate whether Biden and Harris are collateral damage in Newsom's efforts to elevate himself.\n\nLast year, Biden advisers closely tracked Newsom's national political activity, concerned that he might be laying the groundwork to run in 2024. He reassured then-White House chief of staff Ron Klain that he was \"not interested\" in a 2024 bid, said a person familiar with the conversation.\n\nWith many Democrats looking for an alternative to Biden, who turned 80 in November, some of Newsom's maneuvers into the national spotlight were perceived as promoting him at the cost of stoking concerns about the president.\n\nBut since Biden announced his re-election campaign in April, Newsom has become a top surrogate, and most of Biden's advisers have welcomed his help. One set of Biden's advisers is content with a potential Newsom-DeSantis showdown, seeing political upside for Biden and the party if DeSantis falters, people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nOn the other hand, a strong DeSantis showing could strengthen him and weaken Democratic arguments. DeSantis exchanged barbs with Harris this summer as she harshly criticized a state education mandate to teach Florida schoolchildren about the \"benefits\" of slavery.\n\nShe declined DeSantis' entreaty last month to engage with him directly on the issue, and then he agreed to debate Newsom. Though the challenge had been issued much earlier, Newsom's decision to move forward came in the shadow of Harris' arm's-length back-and-forth with DeSantis.\n\nWhile the two governors tussle over the rules and timing of a debate - it could happen this fall, possibly in November - DeSantis is trying to gain traction in his uphill fight to beat Trump for the 2024 GOP nomination.\n\nDeSantis and Newsom already have sparred over a variety of issues, including crime, Covid, abortion rights, education and migrant policy. Newsom has run ads in Florida targeting DeSantis' positions.\n\nA Biden adviser bristled at the message the possible debate sends about Harris and about the early jockeying for the 2028 nomination.\n\n\"It could either look one of two ways: like he tried to defend her because she couldn't defend herself or that he was being thirsty for attention or to get in the fight,\" the Biden adviser said. \"And it was at a time when the VP had completely dismissed and won the fight with DeSantis, and I think Gavin gave him a second life.\"\n\nJonathan Allen is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News.\n\nCarol E.

      "text": "In 'a good sign,' immigration negotiations move to a new phase: funding\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - Senate negotiations to impose tougher immigration and asylum laws have moved to a new phase as the group is now working with key senators to finalize the funding provisions in the deal, three sources familiar with the talks said.\n\nThe immigration group is working with the Senate Appropriations Committee on how to craft the funding language to match the policy changes the negotiators have largely agreed to.\n\nThere are varying levels of optimism among senators and aides that the development could mean the group has locked in an agreement. But shifting the conversation to appropriators demonstrates that negotiators have made progress toward an agreement on border provisions.\n\n\"We're at the point of drafting and finalizing text. We don't have an enormous amount of work left to do,\" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, the chief Democratic negotiator, said Monday afternoon.\n\nHe added that \"it's possible\" the Senate would start voting on the bill this week. \"You can't just change policy,\" Murphy said. \"You've also got to fund the policy.\"\n\nA source familiar with negotiations said the major policy sticking points are largely resolved, but another source noted that nothing is agreed to until the full package is finalized.\n\nThe lead negotiators - Murphy and Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., and James Lankford, R-Okla. - met virtually Monday morning before the Senate returned to Washington, a source said.\n\n\"It will be, by far, the most conservative border security bill in four decades,\" Lankford told NBC News.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who chairs the Judiciary Committee, which oversees immigration, said he doesn't expect the emerging deal to go through committee, which would have slowed the process.\n\n\"It goes directly to the floor,\" he said, adding that he expects senators will have \"a day or two\" to read it over and that the Senate can pass it \"in a week\" once an agreement is finalized.\n\nDurbin said it's \"a good sign\" that appropriators are reviewing the emerging pact, though he said he also still needs to see the details.\n\n\"I want to see the policy,\" he said.\n\nThe immigration provisions, demanded by Republicans, are poised to be attached to a national security supplemental bill that includes new U.S. aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The package, which is expected to exceed $100 billion, will be separate from a broader government funding bill, which is being crafted on a separate track, ahead of new shutdown deadlines in early March .\n\nThe appropriators have a significant role in finalizing the immigration deal, because the policy changes under discussion will need to be adequately funded to be implemented properly. A source said the process of crafting funding bills can be complicated and require further finessing of policy details, particularly on thorny issues like curtailing the president's power to use \"parole\" to admit asylum-seekers.\n\n\"We've come a very long way since talks began two months ago,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday. \"All of us on the Democratic side are serious about getting something done.\"\n\n\"We remain hopeful, but it's certainly not a done deal yet,\" he said. \"There are a handful of issues that have not yet been agreed to.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday the group was working to \"finalize the most substantial border security policy in 30 years,\" adding: \"This agreement would come not a moment too soon.\"\n\nAs the Senate left Thursday, Lankford said the release of text this week was his \"target\" and sounded confident that negotiators would resolve the parties' differences over parole, which had dragged out talks. He declined to reveal details but cautioned members against criticizing the deal before it is done.\n\n\"Wait till you see the bill,\" he said. \"People want to be able to see it. They have fair criticism. They're getting all these rumors and things that are false. They just want to see the text.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who would need to sign any deal into law, expressed willingness Friday to agree to \"significant policy changes at the border.\"\n\n\"I think next week we're going to be able to work out something, at least in the Senate, and I'm hopeful it's going to be a bipartisan package the Senate is going to pass, God willing,\" he said. \"I'm ready to solve the problem. I really am. Massive changes, and I mean it sincerely.\"\n\nFrank Thorp V is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the Senate.\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nKate Santaliz is an associate producer for NBC News' Capitol Hill team.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Two House GOP members announce runs for speaker after McCarthy's removal: Highlights\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nRebecca Kaplan\n\nIt's a question for any of the candidates hoping to succeed McCarthy as speaker of the House: How many votes do they need to win?\n\nThe speaker is elected by a majority of those in attendance and voting when the election happens on the House floor.\n\nThere are currently 433 House members - Democrat David Cicilline of Rhode Island and Republican Chris Stewart of Utah resigned in recent months. That means a majority of the House is 217 if every single one of its members votes that day.\n\nIf a member votes \"present\" instead of for a particular candidate, the vote does not count against the total number used to calculate a majority. So if 33 members were to vote \"present\" today in a floor vote, the total number voting would be 400, and a majority would be 201 members.\n\nMcCarthy was elected with 216 votes - 428 were cast in total: 216 for McCarthy and 212 for Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, and six lawmakers voted \"present.\"\n\nThe number of House members isn't expected to dip below 433 in the coming weeks unless a member dies or resigns unexpectedly. The special election to fill Cicilline's seat will be Nov. 7, and the election for Stewart's seat is scheduled for Nov. 21. Still, it's not uncommon for some lawmakers to be absent for other reasons, as some were yesterday during the vote to remove McCarthy as speaker.\n\nJonathan Allen\n\nIt was inevitable that giving Rep. Matt Gaetz the procedural bazooka he demanded would end in McCarthy's political annihilation.\n\nFor Gaetz - a 2020 election denier, a defender of the Jan. 6 insurrection and the subject of an ethics investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and more - rules seem to matter most when they benefit him. The animating tenet of his political ideology - a strain of the broader conservative bent against taxation and spending - is that the federal government works against the public interest because it is corrupt. Chaos feeds his narrative.\n\nMcCarthy's substantive sins were avoiding a national default and a federal shutdown, which interfered with Gaetz's ability to demonstrate that the government is broken. So Gaetz, R-Fla., used his procedural weapon - the \"motion to vacate\" - to do the next best thing: He aligned with Democrats to throw the House into a state of anarchy. For one day, at least, Gaetz and his seven followers ruled the 433-member House.\n\n\"To do this on the floor is embarrassing and does not give the American public much confidence in Republicans being able to govern,\" former Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., said in a text message. \"This small group just voted WITH the Democrats while ousting the speaker because the Democrats voted WITH the speaker and the majority of Republicans to keep the government open.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nEmma Barnett\n\nZoë Richards\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis had positive things to say today about Scalise and Jordan when asked about their respective speaker bids, but he stopped short of saying who he would prefer to see in the top House post.\n\n\"I know both of those guys,\" DeSantis, a Republican presidential candidate, said of his former House colleagues. \"They're both good guys.\"\n\nIn his remarks to reporters at an event in Greenville, South Carolina, DeSantis spoke in broad terms about what the next speaker needs to do.\n\n\"You can't just say, continue business as usual. You got to be somebody that understands we need a fundamentally different path here,\" he said.\n\nDeSantis went on to say that GOP leaders are often out of step with their voters compared with Democrats.\n\n\"I think the Republican Party for a long time has had problems with leadership that's not reflective of the voters that put them there. Whereas on the other side, the Democrat leadership is representative of where their voters are in a lot of issues.\"\n\nZoë Richards\n\nRebecca Kaplan\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., issued a statement today on McCarthy - more than 24 hours after the California Republican was ousted as speaker.\n\n\"Since January, Kevin and I have had a respectful, communicative and forward-looking relationship. On many occasions, we strongly disagreed with each other. However, we agreed to disagree without being personally disagreeable in order to find common ground whenever possible,\" Jeffries said.\n\n\"I wish Speaker McCarthy, his family and dedicated staff Godspeed as he begins the next chapter in his public service and professional journey.\"\n\nJeffries highlighted McCarthy's work to begin addressing artificial intelligence and an effort to form a select committee on strategic competition between the U.S. and China, urging the continuation of both initiatives.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Jeffries said that Democrats would vote in favor of McCarthy's removal and called on his GOP colleagues \"to end the House Republican Civil War.\"\n\nSahil Kapur\n\nZoë Richards\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., today had nothing but good things to say about Reps. Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise when asked about their respective bids for House speaker.\n\n\"I am thrilled with them. I am certain that under the stewardship of either Mr. Scalise or Mr. Jordan, the House of Representatives will be in far better stead than we were with Mr. McCarthy,\" Gaetz told NBC News.\n\nAsked what either lawmaker would do that McCarthy didn't, Gaetz said, \"A budget.\"\n\nHe also said that Scalise or Jordan would pass appropriations bills that McCarthy had been unable to pass during his nine-month tenure.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nRep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., said in an interview with \"Meet the Press NOW\" that he supports House Majority Leader Steve Scalise for speaker.\n\n\"I'm a Scalise guy,\" Womack said. \"He's the next in charge. He's got an operation already built. He's been tried and he's been tested.\"\n\n\"I think we need the kind of leadership that Steve can bring us. There's no question about his conservative bonafides,\" Womack added. \"He is an absolutely thoughtful conservative, and I think he has the potential to get McCarthy-style support within our conference.\"\n\nKyla Guilfoil\n\nRep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y., told Andrea Mitchell this afternoon on MSNBC that \"an egomaniac named Matt Gaetz decided to take out personal issues with the speaker on the House floor.\"\n\n\"Now we have to deal with, over the next week, going to conference, finding new leadership, finding a new speaker, electing one, and then getting back to the people's business,\" D'Esposito said.\n\nThe New York Republican went on to say that Gaetz, R-Fla., is \"getting in my way\" of fulfilling duties to constituents.\n\n\"This is not what the people of the 4th Congressional District sent me here to do. They sent me here to govern, and that's exactly what I want to do. But Matt Gaetz is getting in my way,\" he said.\n\nD'Esposito said that \"egotistical maniac\" Gaetz's moves to oust McCarthy were a \"personal vendetta.\"\n\n\"What happened yesterday is literally going to put the American government to a halt until we find a speaker, and that should never happen again at the hands of one lunatic,\" D'Esposito said.\n\nRebecca Kaplan\n\nRep. Garret Graves, R-La., one of McCarthy's top allies who helped negotiate his ascendancy to the speakership in January and the debt ceiling deal this year, said he has \"no interest at all\" in a leadership position.\n\n\"I enjoy doing the behind-the-scenes work. I love the policy. But no interest in\" a leadership post, Graves told NBC News' Ryan Nobles.\n\nGraves is not yet backing any of the GOP lawmakers who have formally declared their candidacy for speaker, and said it would be a \"mistake\" to commit right now given the tension in the caucus after yesterday's events.\n\n\"I think the first step at this point is actually letting folks go home and cool down a little bit. There's some really raw emotions. I think if we hung around here right now you would probably see some folks breaking out in a fistfight,\" he said.\n\nGraves is among lawmakers who are calling for Republicans to re-examine their rules that allow for just one member to call for a vote to oust the speaker.\n\nKyle Stewart\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nThe House has adjourned until Friday at 10 a.m. ET. McHenry, who is the temporary speaker, took no questions from reporters outside of the House chamber.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nRep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., said in an interview on MSNBC's \"Andrea Mitchell Reports\" that McCarthy didn't ask Democrats for their help in saving his role as speaker.\n\n\"He didn't ask for our help,\" Slotkin said, adding that some Democrats who have close relationships with Republicans were waiting for them to make a deal and McCarthy never got to that point.\n\nSlotkin also criticized McCarthy for blaming Democrats for the position he and Republicans are in, arguing that Democrats just worked with GOP lawmakers to keep the government funded and prevent a shutdown.\n\n\"So, if I'm speaker of the House and I just depended on Democrats to pass a bipartisan bill for the good of the country...then I wouldn't turn around the next day and try to blame Democrats for the situation that he was in.\"\n\nKyla Guilfoil\n\nLiz Brown-Kaiser\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters this afternoon at his weekly leadership news conference that he hopes \"whoever the next speaker is gets rid of the motion to vacate.\"\n\n\"I have no advice to give to the House Republicans except one,\" McConnell said. \"I hope whoever the next speaker is gets rid of the motion to vacate.\"\n\nMcConnell said the motion to vacate \"puts whoever the speaker is in a hammerlock of dysfunction.\"\n\n\"I think it makes the speaker's job impossible and the American people expect us to have a functioning government,\" McConnell added.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nAs Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., spoke to reporters this afternoon, the emergency alert system interrupted the Senate GOP leadership news conference.\n\nSomeone asked, \"When does it stop?\" This came as people's devices blared loud sirens.\n\n\"That's what they're asking over there: When does it stop?\" Capito said as she seemed to motion in the direction of the House.\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nBiden addressed the ousting of McCarthy at the top of his planned remarks on student debt relief, acknowledging that while finding a new speaker may take time, \"we have a lot of work to do, and the American people expect us to get it done.\"\n\nThe president also cautioned against future \"brinksmanship\" as the government's funding dries up next month, and he said he was grateful that leaders, including McCarthy, worked to keep the government open last weekend.\n\nHe also called for more bipartisan cooperation.\n\n\"More than anything we need to change the poisonous atmosphere in Washington,\" Biden said. \"You know, we have strong disagreements, but we need to stop seeing each other as enemies. We need to talk to one another, listen to one another, work with one another, and we can do that.\"\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nRebecca Kaplan\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise announced this afternoon that he plans to run for speaker.\n\nHe was expected to jump into the race to fill the top post in the House. Scalise, 57, nearly died after being shot in 2017 at a congressional baseball practice for Republicans . Scalise has since recovered.\n\n\"I firmly believe this Conference is a family. When I was shot in 2017, it was Members of this Conference who saved my life on that field. When I made it to the hospital and my family was told my chances of surviving were low, it was the prayers from all of you that carried us through,\" he wrote in a letter to House Republicans.\n\n\"When I was in the hospital for nearly 15 weeks, it was the possibility of getting back to work with all of you that kept me motivated to get better,\" Scalise said.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nRep. Carlos A. Gimenez, R-Fla., said in an interview late Tuesday that he had heard about some possible speaker candidates being floated, but said so far, \"Nobody has my vote.\"\n\nThe next speaker must commit to holding a floor vote that would change how the motion to vacate happens, he said on CNN. Gimenez, the former mayor of Miami-Dade County who came to Congress in 2021, said the next speaker should also allow for changing other House rules.\n\nReferring to the current rule allowing one person to call for a motion to vacate vote, Gimenez said, \"I think it's a little bit insane. ... We cannot continue to govern this way.\"\n\n\"I don't expect the next [speaker's] race to be easy,\" said Gimenez, who noted that his conference has divisions.\n\nHe said the eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy as House speaker aren't \"actually true Republicans,\" calling them \"a fringe group.\"\n\nInyoung Choi\n\nRep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., floated the names of one Democrat and two Republicans - Reps. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Tom Cole of Oklahoma - as potential choices to fill the vacant speakership in the House.\n\n\"I think that their leader Scalise, I know he is having some health problems,\" Clyburn said in an interview with \"Morning Joe\" this morning, referring to the majority leader's treatment for blood cancer . \"But, Steve Scalise is a great guy.\"\n\n\"I think that Cole would be a sort of the kind of tone that we would like to see,\" he added.\n\nClyburn, the assistant Democratic leader and former majority whip, also added that McCarthy made it \"virtually impossible\" for Democrats to save him from being ousted because of his on-air criticisms of them the day after they voted to support his effort to pass a short-term government spending bill. Clyburn said nearly all Democrats went ahead and voted for the bill even though it didn't address some of their key priorities, like Ukraine aid.\n\n\"So, the next morning, he goes on TV and blamed Democrats for everything that went wrong the day before and blamed us for wanting to shut down the government, made it impossible for Democrats to find some area of commonality,\" Clyburn said.\n\nSahil Kapur\n\nIn an interview, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, told NBC News: \"Jim's a good friend. And I think he'd be great speaker. Most importantly, he'd make a great speaker for the people of Ohio. Obviously, I have no idea what the House dynamics are, and I won't pretend to know, but if he won, I'd be very happy about it and I plan to help him. But I don't know how much I can offer from this side.\"\n\nAsked if that's an endorsement, he said: \"Sure. Of course, it's an endorsement.\"\n\nHe added: \"Look, there a lot of people, I'm sure, good people who are going to run, but Jim's the guy that I know the best. ... He's a good guy who would do a good job.\"\n\nAli Vitali\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nJim Jordan, who said today that he plans to run for speaker, told reporters that he is against another government spending measure that provides additional assistance to Ukraine.\n\n\"I'm against [a Ukraine package],\" he told reporters. \"What I understand is, at some point, we're gonna have to deal with this appropriations process in the right way, and we're probably gonna do that in the next 41 days. The most pressing issue on Americans' minds is not Ukraine, it's the border situation and crime on the streets. So let's address those.\"\n\nKyla Guilfoil\n\nKyle Stewart\n\nRep. Garret Graves, R-La., said the House of Representatives is \"frozen\" because of \"clowns like Matt Gaetz.\"\n\n\"If we're going to continue to have clowns like Matt Gaetz as part of the Republican conference, as part of this Congress, then you're going to have to have rules in place that prevent him from doing his charade every single week,\" Graves said.\n\nGraves said that he is \"not backing anyone right now\" as speaker, saying it would be a \"mistake\" to \"just give everybody one rung of promotion.\"\n\n\"That is premature. We've got to address some fundamental issues. ... I think we need to do a deeper dive and look at the accountability of the leadership team,\" Graves said.\n\nGraves added that he sees a scenario in which Rep. Patrick McHenry maintains his role as interim speaker for \"an extended period.\"\n\n\"I think we need to be very thoughtful about the role, the responsibilities and the authority that he can exercise in that position, because I would love to find us, to be in a situation, where we can move forward on appropriations bills and other things right now,\" Graves said.\n\nDiana Paulsen\n\nIn a post on X , Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland wrote that \"Congressman Byron Donalds should be considered as the next Speaker of the House.\"\n\nDonalds, a Florida congressman who's seen as a rising star in the Republican Party, was one of the names put forth by the Republican House members who voted against McCarthy during the speakership battle in January. Donalds, who is Black and a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, is considered a possible candidate for speaker in this election.\n\nHarris was among those who voted against McCarthy in January but voted against the motion to vacate that ousted him from office.\n\nRebecca Kaplan\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nScalise, the House majority leader, is one of several Republicans meeting with Texas House Republicans today.\n\nThe delegation is the largest in the House Republican Conference, with 25 members who have a range of ideological views.\n\nOther Republicans meeting with the delegation include Jordan and Hern.\n\nAli Vitali\n\nKyla Guilfoil\n\nMajority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters that he would be sending a letter seeking support for his speaker bid.\n\n\"We haven't sent anything out formally, but we will,\" he said outside of a closed-door huddle with the Texas delegation this morning.\n\nScalise acknowledged Rep. Jim Jordan's bid for the job, telling NBC News, \"Look, I'm sure a lot of people are going to look at this - as they should. This is really important that we get this right.\"\n\nScalise added what he told the Texas delegation: \"Texans, like the rest of our conference, we all have strong passions about getting our border secure, about getting our spending under control and about fighting for families who are struggling.\"\n\nInyoung Choi\n\nDemocratic Whip Katherine Clark said her caucus would support the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to fill the vacant speakership.\n\n\"We're clear who our leadership is, Hakeem Jeffries,\" Clark, of Massachusetts, said on CNN when asked to comment on the likely Republican contenders for the job.\n\nIt is unlikely that a Democrat could win enough votes to become House speaker. With 221 Republicans and 212 Democrats, the GOP holds the majority in the House.\n\nAli Vitali\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, sent a letter to the members of his conference asking for their support in his bid for speakership.\n\n\"The problems we face are challenging, but they are not insurmountable,\" he wrote. \"We can focus on the changes that improve the country and unite us in offering real solutions. But no matter what we do, we must do it together as a conference. I respectfully ask for your support for Speaker of the House of Representatives.\"\n\nThe far-right congressman also pointed to his work on immigration legislation and his role heading the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"With other committee chairs and the members of the Judiciary Committee, I am doing the oversight and holding the Administration accountable,\" Jordan said in the letter. \"And I have been among the leaders in pushing for fiscal discipline my entire career.\"\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., laid into House Republicans in remarks on the Senate floor today, arguing that until the GOP stops its \"infighting,\" work cannot get done.\n\n\"We find ourselves in a dangerous situation, with about 40 days to go before the government shuts down,\" he said. \"The House has ground completely to a halt.\"\n\nIf there were to be a national crisis that demanded \"immediate action,\" the House would be \"unable to quickly respond,\" Schumer said.\n\n\"Let me say this to the next speaker of the House, whomever that may be: Think carefully about what happened to your predecessors before trying to coddle the hard right,\" he said.\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nInyoung Choi\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., lauded Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on his tenure as House speaker.\n\n\"He had all the qualities of an effective representative and speaker,\" McConnell said Wednesday.\n\nMcConnell credited the former House speaker for averting a government shutdown by getting a short-term spending measure passed over the weekend, telling reporters that McCarthy \"made sure that the people's House was once again open to the American people.\"\n\n\"And he can rest assured that his colleagues, myself included, will continue to draw on his talents and optimism in the days that lie ahead,\" McConnell said.\n\nSahil Kapur\n\nInyoung Choi\n\nRep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy, declined Wednesday morning to comment on Jordan's bid for House speaker.\n\n\"I have no reaction at this point until I see who all the candidates are,\" Buck said.\n\nMeanwhile, Buck said in an interview with \"Meet the Press NOW\" on Monday that he had no intent of stepping forward as a candidate for speaker, calling it the \"worst job in America.\"\n\n\"I guarantee you, Ken Buck and Matt Gaetz is not one of those people,\" Buck said when asked if he would run. \"I might get three votes.\"\n\nJulie Tsirkin\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nRep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., said he is \"all in\" on Jordan as the next speaker.\n\n\"We need a conservative fighter to stand up strong to the Biden White House and Democrat Senate, and I can't think of anyone better than Jim Jordan,\" Banks told NBC News.\n\nBanks also posted his support on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, writing, \"He never backs down and has my full support.\"\n\nKyle Stewart\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nMcCarthy arrived at the Capitol moments ago and entered the speaker's office.\n\nWhen asked by NBC News how he was feeling, he responded, \"Great!\"\n\nMcCarthy did not stop to answer any other questions.\n\nJesse Rodriguez\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nChris Christie referred to McCarthy's removal as \"political assassination\" in an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\n\"Matt Gaetz doesn't like Kevin McCarthy and was intent upon executing this type of, this type of assassination. And that's what he did,\" Christie said. \"It was a political assassination yesterday of Kevin McCarthy.\"\n\nWhen asked where the GOP goes next, Christie said there was \"no obvious choice\" for the next speaker.\n\n\"I think, you know, Steve Scalise, Tom Emmer are some of the names, Jim Jordan, but there's no obvious choice here, the same way that even though McCarthy was the obvious choice because of his history, everyone knew the problems going in,\" Christie said. \"I think you've got to play hard to get.\"\n\nSahil Kapur\n\nAli Vitali\n\nGarrett Haake\n\nRyan Nobles\n\nScott Wong\n\nRebecca Kaplan\n\nLast Wednesday, three days before a widely feared government shutdown, far-right Rep. Matt Gaetz stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and issued a categorical threat.\n\nIf House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., relied on Democrats to keep the government open, said Gaetz, R-Fla., there would \"very likely\" be \"a motion to vacate that the speaker would face.\"\n\nJust hours before the government would run out of money to keep operating, McCarthy decided to defy Gaetz and did just that : He avoided a shutdown by putting forward a bill that Democrats would support.\n\nFast-forward three days. McCarthy is now the first speaker in history to have been voted out of his job - 216 to 210 - with a mere eight Republican detractors in the wafer-thin majority sealing his fate and siding with Democrats to oust him.\n\n\"A lot of them I helped get elected, so I probably should have picked somebody else,\" McCarthy quipped Tuesday evening of those eight conservative members.\n\n\"My fear is the institution fell today,\" he said.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nOlympia Sonnier\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nTrump told reporters that \"a lot of people\" called him about the speaker position. When asked whether he would take the job, he said, \"All I can say is we'll do whatever is best for the country and for the Republican Party.\"\n\nThe former president, who is in New York for the state attorney general's business fraud lawsuit against him and his company, said his focus was \"totally\" on his presidential run. Trump added that the GOP has \"some great people\" for the speakership.\n\n\"I'll do whatever it is to help, but my focus, my total focus is being president and, honestly, making America great again, because we are living in a country in decline,\" he said.\n\nKyle Stewart\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday that he plans to run for speaker of the House.\n\nJordan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who has gained national prominence over the years as an aggressive presence in committee hearings, confirmed his candidacy when asked by reporters if he plans to run for the leadership role, saying, \"Yes.\"\n\nAlex Tabet\n\nRep.

      "text": "Attorney General Garland appoints a special counsel in Hunter Biden probe\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. Attorney David Weiss was appointed special counsel in the ongoing probe of the president's son Hunter Biden, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Friday.\n\nWeiss will be responsible for the \"ongoing investigation\" of President Joe Biden's son \"as well as for any other matters that arose or may arise from that investigation,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. Weiss, who was already overseeing the Hunter Biden probe and is based in Delaware, asked to be appointed special counsel on Tuesday and Garland agreed it was \"in the public interest\" to do so, the attorney general said.\n\nThe move was announced shortly before prosecutors from Weiss's team revealed in a court filing the plea talks over tax and gun charges against the president's son had broken down and the case would likely have to go to trial in California or Washington, D.C. Later Friday, prosecutors suggested they could bring different charges against Hunter Biden in the new case.\n\nDOJ noted that Weiss was nominated by then-President Donald Trump in 2017 and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate in 2018.\n\nGarland said the appointment \"reinforces for the American people the Department's commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters.\"\n\nIn a statement, Hunter Biden's lawyer Chris Clark said, \"Whether in Delaware, Washington, D.C. or anywhere else, we expect a fair resolution on behalf of our client.\"\n\nHe said Weiss \"has diligently been investigating my client for five years and he had proposed a resolution which we fully intend to pursue in court. It is hard to see why he would have proposed such a resolution if there were other offenses he could have successfully prosecuted, and we are aware of none. We are confident when all of these maneuverings are at an end, my client will have resolution and will be moving on with his life successfully.\"\n\nHunter Biden agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor charges related to his failure to pay income taxes earlier this year. But while standing in court last month waiting to enter the plea, the agreement fell apart over confusion about a separate gun charge.\n\nThe judge asked the parties to hammer out the agreement and return later, leaving Hunter Biden to enter a not-guilty plea while it's litigated.\n\nLawyers for Hunter Biden had also indicated they believed that the plea agreement would settle all matters facing the president's son, but prosecutors said that other investigations continued.\n\n\"After the hearing, the parties continued negotiating but reached an impasse. A trial is therefore in order,\" prosecutors said in their Friday filing.\n\nIn another filing later in the day, prosecutors suggested Biden could be facing new charges. \"The Government, in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion, is considering what tax charges to bring in another district and may elect to bring the same charges set forth in the instant information or different ones,\" the filing said.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the situation told NBC News the White House had no advance notice of the special counsel appointment.\n\nDocuments in the failed plea agreement were made public last week.\n\nThe White House declined comment, referring reporters to the Justice Department and Hunter Biden's lawyers.\n\nRep. James Comer, R-Ky., the chair of the House Oversight Committee who's been investigating the Biden family's business dealings, blasted Weiss's appointment as \"part of the Justice Department's efforts to attempt a Biden family coverup.\"\n\n\"The Biden Justice Department is trying to stonewall congressional oversight as we have presented evidence to the American people about the Biden family's corruption,\" Comer said.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, also ripped the appointment despite previously calling for a special counsel .\n\n\"David Weiss can't be trusted and this is just a new way to whitewash the Biden family's corruption. Weiss has already signed off on a sweetheart plea deal that was so awful and unfair that a federal judge rejected it,\" said his spokesperson, Russell Dye.\n\nDye added that \"We expect the Department to fully cooperate with our investigation, including not interfering with the 11 transcribed interviews we have requested\" from DOJ and FBI officials involved in the probe \"and David Weiss upholding his commitment to testify .\"\n\nIn a July 25 letter to House Republicans, Weiss offered to publicly testify before Congress in late September or early October.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., echoed Comer and Jordan, tweeting , \"This action by Biden's DOJ cannot be used to obstruct congressional investigations or whitewash the Biden family corruption. If Weiss negotiated the sweetheart deal that couldn't get approved, how can he be trusted as a Special Counsel?\"\n\nUnder the terms of the now-scrapped deal, Hunter Biden would have pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of failing to pay his taxes in return for prosecutors recommending a sentence of probation. A separate felony gun possession charge for illegally owning a Colt Cobra .38 Special handgun would have been dropped in two years if Biden honored the terms of what's known as a diversion agreement.\n\nIn a plea hearing last month, a Trump-nominated judge declined to sign off on the deal, saying she wanted more information from the two sides about some \"atypical provisions,\" including one that could theoretically have protected Biden from other tax-related crimes.\n\nGarland has named two other special counsels since he took over the Justice Department in 2021.\n\nIn November 2022, Garland named Jack Smith as a special counsel to conduct two investigations into former President Donald Trump: his role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents after leaving office.\n\nSmith has secured two indictments against Trump, the first in a Florida court that accuses him of mishandling national secrets and the second earlier this month in a Washington, D.C. court, which accuses him of defrauding the U.S. in the bid to prevent the transfer of power.\n\nIn January, Garland named Robert Hur to investigate classified documents that were found in President Biden's office and residence. The documents were from his time as vice president.\n\nNBC News reported earlier Friday that the president's attorneys and Hur have been negotiating for about a month over the terms under which he would be interviewed.\n\nDareh Gregorian is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\nRyan J.

Follow live updates here.\n\nIsrael's military said Tuesday that its ground operation in Gaza was at its \"most intense day,\" as it continued an offensive that has expanded to all of Gaza, not just the north of the territory.\n\nTroops were pushing into Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, the Israel Defense Forces said.\n\nIDF Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said it was a \"third phase\" that targeted what he said were Hamas strongholds in the south.\n\nThe United Nations warned that \"an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold\" in southern Gaza. The offensive in the north involved orders for people to evacuate to the south, and the U.N.'s secretary-general said that people have nowhere safe to go.\n\nIn the United States, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that the U.S. believes Israel is not doing enough to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, and he said the roughly 100 trucks of aid and 70,000 liters of fuel are not enough.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a briefing that the only way to end the war is to use \"overwhelming force,\" and he said that Israel's military would be the only force he would accept for the \"demilitarization\" of Gaza.\n\nThe World Food Programme warned that \"resumption of hostilities in Gaza will only intensify the catastrophic hunger crisis that already threatens to overwhelm the civilian population.\"\n\nAbout 1.9 million people have been displaced in Gaza, where health officials say the death toll has now surpassed 16,200 after weeks of Israeli attacks.\n\nThe IDF estimates 1,200 people were killed in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, with around 140 people still held captive in Gaza.\n\nPhil Helsel\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nAn Israeli strike in Lebanon killed one soldier of that country's armed forces and wounded three others, the Lebanese Armed Forces said today.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces acknowledged that it harmed members of the Lebanese Armed Forces and that it was a mistake.\n\n\"The Lebanese Armed Forces were not the target of the strike,\" the IDF said . \"The IDF expresses regret over the incident. The incident is under review.\"\n\nThe militant group Hezbollah operates in Lebanon, but Lebanon's armed forces are not part of the conflict. It appears to be the first report of a killing of a Lebanese soldier since the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks on Israel and the subsequent war against Hamas by Israel.\n\nThe IDF said that its forces were acting against an \"imminent threat\" and that \"the threat was identified within a known launch area and observation point of the Hezbollah terrorist organization, near al-Awadi.\"\n\nAbigail Williams\n\nThe 100 trucks of aid and 70,000 liters of fuel going into Gaza each day for humanitarian purposes is not enough, a spokesman for the State Department said today.\n\n\"They need more humanitarian assistance. They need more food and water,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at a briefing. \"And in that respect, we don't think Israel is doing enough. We think they need to do more to allow humanitarian assistance in.\"\n\nIsrael's military has said it would expand its campaign against Hamas to all of Gaza.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said this week that the U.S. does not want to see a return to the large-scale displacement and civilian deaths that occurred in Gaza when Israel attacked the north of the territory.\n\n\"We have seen them conducting the campaign in some ways in the south in a different fashion than they did in the north,\" Miller said. He said that included Israel's publishing \"more limited evacuation zones.\"\n\nAnna Schecter\n\nNBC News has reviewed evidence that suggests dozens of Israeli women were raped, sexually abused or mutilated during the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks.\n\nIsraeli officials say Hamas militants were instructed to systematically carry out sexual violence on women and children.\n\n\"This was systematic gender-based violence that was so horrific it's hard for me to find the words,\" said Cochav Elkayam-Levy, the chair of a newly created Civil Commission on Oct. 7th Crimes by Hamas Against Women and Children.\n\nOver the last several weeks, NBC News has reviewed five interrogations of captured Hamas fighters, an Arabic-language document that instructed Hamas how to pronounce \"Take off your pants\" in Hebrew, six images of naked or partially naked deceased female bodies, seven eyewitness accounts of sexual violence, including both rape and mutilation, 11 testimonies of first responders and two accounts from workers in morgues who handled the bodies of women after they were recovered from the massacre.\n\nThe evidence, primarily from the Israel Defense Forces and Israeli officials, suggests that dozens of Israeli women were raped or sexually abused or mutilated during the Oct. 7 attacks .\n\nRead the full story here .\n\nMike Memoli\n\nSecond gentleman Douglas Emhoff spoke today to the owner of a Jewish-owned falafel restaurant in Philadelphia that was the target of protests the White House has called antisemitic, offering support amid heightened political tensions over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn the call, Emhoff and Michael Solomonov, the Israeli American chef and owner of Goldie, talked about how food was supposed to bring people together rather than be a source of division. Solomonov told Emhoff he was overwhelmed by the outreach he has received since the protest at his restaurant Sunday and thanked him, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, for their support, according to a source familiar with the call.\n\nThe roughly 10-minute conversation was just the latest of dozens Emhoff has quietly been having during the past two months with both political leaders and ordinary people affected by the fallout of the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. They have been done with little fanfare, often coming about simply because he wants to check in on how the people and groups they represent are doing, making a personal connection at a fraught political moment, according to a source familiar with the calls.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMax Butterworth\n\nSoldiers with an Israeli artillery unit load munitions near the border with the Gaza Strip on Tuesday. Israel pressed on with its expanded ground operation against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, following the expiration of a seven-day truce Friday, after which fighting resumed.\n\nNBC News\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a briefing that the only way to end the war is to use \"overwhelming force\" and called on the international community to \"stand with Israel, stand with civilization.\"\n\nBut Netanyahu also said that the Israeli army is the only one that can demilitarize Gaza.\n\n\"Gaza must be demilitarized, for Gaza to be demilitarized there is only one force that can take care of this demilitarization and that force is Israel's steering army. No international power can be responsible for this,\" he said.\n\n\"I am not ready to close my eyes and accept any other arrangement.\"\n\nGabe Joselow\n\nA person who attended a meeting between the families of Israeli hostages and the war cabinet described it as \"chaotic.\"\n\nAccording to the participant, the main message from concerned families was \"time is running out.\" One family member held up an hourglass to emphasize the point. There was a lot of emotion, crying and raised voices, the participant said.\n\nDisagreements between the families and the cabinet were over the conduct of the hostage categorization process and who would get priority, such as older people, the young women still held hostage and the young men of military age. However, the families were united in wanting everyone back.\n\nThere were also concerns about the resumption of fighting, and whether hostage negotiations would start again. The participant said the cabinet members did not provide a lot of information or concrete answers to these concerns.\n\nIan Sherwood\n\nMirna Alsharif\n\nThe World Food Programme is warning that \"resumption of hostilities in Gaza will only intensify the catastrophic hunger crisis that already threatens to overwhelm the civilian population.\"\n\nThe seven-day truce between Israel and Hamas allowed the WFP \"to scale up relief operations\" and reach approximately 250,000 people in just one week, according to the organization.\n\n\"Tragically, this desperately needed progress is now being lost. The renewed fighting makes the distribution of aid almost impossible and endangers the lives of humanitarian workers. Above all, it is a disaster for the civilian population of Gaza, more than 2 million people, whose only lifeline is food assistance,\" WFP said in a statement.\n\nThe organization stressed that humanitarian staff need \"safe, unimpeded, and sustained access\" so they're able to distribute aid throughout Gaza, and reiterated calls for a cease-fire.\n\nKaetlyn Liddy Kaetlyn Liddy is a newsroom coordinator for NBC News Digital.\n\nKinnan Abdalhamid, one of the three Palestinian students shot in Vermont over Thanksgiving weekend, said he and his friends are \"completely focused\" on the suffering in Gaza as they recover from their injuries.\n\nAbdalhamid and two of his high school classmates, Hisham Awartani and Tahseen Ali Ahmad, grew up in the West Bank before attending separate colleges in the U.S. They were visiting family in Burlington when they were shot.\n\n\"My friends and I are almost unable to focus on ourselves because of what's happening back home,\" Abdalhamid said. \"It's like experiencing this makes us even more connected to what's happening.\"\n\nA GoFundMe account created Saturday to raise money for Awartani's medical expenses revealed he is paralyzed from the chest down after being shot in the spine.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nDaniel Arkin\n\nThe leaders of three elite universities were grilled by House Republicans today during a hearing on campus antisemitism since Oct. 7 and the start of the Israel-Hamas war. In testimony, the trio of college presidents acknowledged a sharp rise in anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim rhetoric and behavior, but insisted they were taking steps to address the issue.\n\nClaudine Gay of Harvard University, Elizabeth Magill of the University of Pennsylvania and Sally Kornbluth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology testified before the Republican-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Gay said her job required a delicate balancing act: simultaneously protecting Jewish students and the rights enshrined in the First Amendment.\n\n\"I have sought to confront hate while preserving free expression,\" Gay told members of the House committee. \"I know that I have not always gotten it right.\"\n\nIn testimony during the sometimes contentious hearing, Gay and her counterparts at Penn and MIT pointed to actions they have taken to combat antisemitism, including condemnations of the Oct. 7 terror attack in Israel and expanded security measures. (Harvard came under particular scrutiny after a coalition of pro-Palestinian students released a letter saying Israel was \"entirely responsible\" for the Hamas assault.)\n\n\"We have reiterated that speech that incites violence, threatens safety, or violates Harvard's policies against bullying and harassment is unacceptable,\" Gay said in her opening statement.\n\nNearly three-quarters of Jewish college students in the U.S. experienced or witnessed antisemitism on their campus since the start of the academic year, according to a survey released last month by the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group.\n\nThe survey, first reported by NBC News and CNBC, found that prior to the Oct. 7 assault, 67% of Jewish students reported that they felt \"physically safe\" on campus, whereas after the terror attack, only 46% said as much. In the first survey, 66% of Jewish students felt \"emotionally safe,\" whereas only 33% said that in the second survey, according to the ADL report.\n\nNBC News\n\nAt a campaign event in Boston, President Joe Biden spoke about reports of Hamas sexually abusing Israeli women - and blamed Hamas' refusal to release female hostages for the end of the recent cease-fire.\n\n\"We had a report early on that Hamas used rape against women in Israel. Reports of women being raped. Abusing their bodies and then murdering them. It's appalling,\" Biden said.\n\n\"The world can't just look away from what's going on. We must forcefully condemn the sexual violence. These women 20-39 that they are refusing to release. Hamas' refusal to release these young women is what ended this cease-fire.\"\n\nBiden's comments echo those made by State Department spokesman Matthew Miller yesterday , although Miller said an independent assessment on the reports of sexual assault has not been conducted. NBC News has not independently verified the reports.\n\nAlexander Smith\n\nYuliya Talmazan\n\nFacing mounting pressure to lessen Palestinian civilians' suffering , Israel has combined its assault on the southern Gaza Strip with an online map dividing the enclave into hundreds of zones, which it says will direct residents to safe areas away from its fight against Hamas .\n\nHowever, this grid-based map has been derided by international aid agencies and people in Gaza. They say it is a confusing system that many inside the densely populated strip will be unable to access because of the intermittent electricity and internet coverage.\n\nFurthermore, Palestinians and international observers of Israel's aerial and ground operation say that - with or without a map - nowhere in this heavily bombarded and besieged enclave is safe.\n\n\"The map isn't usable because the communications are really, really bad,\" Mohammad Ghalayini, who lives in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, told NBC News.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMatthew Nighswander\n\nKatya Ekimov inspects her destroyed bedroom after a rocket attack today in Ashkelon, Israel. Ekimov heard a warning siren prior to the rocket strike and was able to enter a safe room in her apartment.\n\nHamas remains able to fire rockets from Gaza amid Israel's expanded ground offensive and aerial campaign there.\n\nAbigail Williams\n\nMore than 1,000 American citizens, legal U.S. permanent residents and their family members have departed Gaza so far, according to State Department spokesperson Matt Miller.\n\nThere are still around 750 people stuck in Gaza asking for help from the U.S. government to leave, including 220 American citizens, U.S. legal permanent residents and their family members.\n\nJay Ganglani\n\nSatellite images show that orchards, greenhouses and farmland in northern Gaza have been razed, the Human Rights Watch said today.\n\nSince the start of Israel's \"ground invasion,\" there have also been concerns regarding a lack of food and the impact this will have on people's livelihoods.\n\nGaza is suffering a loss of at least $1.6 million daily in farm production, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics .  Amnesty International has stated in a report that knowingly committing disproportionate attacks qualifies as a war crime.\n\nRyan Nobles\n\nThe presidents of Harvard University, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania testified in front of the House Committee on Education on the sharp increase in antisemitic incidents since the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.\n\nNBC News' Ryan Nobles reports on what actions Congress could take to punish or support the universities.\n\nAbigail Williams\n\nMirna Alsharif\n\nThe U.S. plans to impose visa restrictions on extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank and their family members, according to the State Department.\n\n\"Today, the State Department is implementing a new visa restriction policy targeting individuals believed to have been involved in undermining peace, security, or stability in the West Bank, including through committing acts of violence or taking other actions that unduly restrict civilians' access to essential services and basic necessities,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.\n\nBlinken also said that the U.S. will \"continue to engage with the Israeli leadership to make clear that Israel must take additional measures to protect Palestinian civilians from extremist attacks,\" as well as \"engage the Palestinian Authority to make clear it must do more to curb Palestinian attacks against Israelis.\"\n\n\"Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority have the responsibility to uphold stability in the West Bank,\" Blinken said. \"Instability in the West Bank both harms the Israeli and Palestinian people and threatens Israel's national security interests.\"\n\nNBC News\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces are encircling Khan Younis in southern Gaza, according to Chief of the General Staff Herzi Halevi.\n\n\"Simultaneously, we continue to secure our accomplishments in the northern Gaza Strip,\" Halevi said. Many Hamas operatives have been killed in recent days, according to Halevi.\n\nHalevi also addressed the widespread destruction in Gaza as a result of Israeli bombardment. \"Many ask about the destruction in Gaza. Hamas is the address. Sinwar is the address. Our forces find in nearly every building and house weapons and in many houses terrorists, and engage them in combat,\" Halevi said.\n\nNBC News has not independently confirmed claims that the IDF found weapons and terrorists in nearly every building and home in Gaza.\n\nReuters\n\nQatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani called out the international community for its inaction in ending the Israel-Hamas conflict while addressing the U.N. Security Council.\n\n\"It is shameful for the international community to allow this heinous crime to continue for nearly two months, during which the systematic and deliberate killing of innocent civilians continues, including women and children,\" he said.\n\nQatar is pressing for a comprehensive end to the war in Gaza and is working to repair a collapsed truce agreement between Israel and Hamas, Al Thani said on Tuesday .\n\n\"We are constantly working to renew (the truce) and to alleviate the burden of our people in the Gaza Strip, but truces are not an alternative for a comprehensive ceasefire,\" Al Thani said in a speech to Gulf leaders gathered in the Qatari capital Doha.\n\nMirna Alsharif\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog was questioned today about the rising civilian death toll in Gaza as a result of Israel's bombardment of the strip.\n\n\"Under international humanitarian law, if somebody attacks us, or attacks anybody, we have the right to defend ourselves,\" Herzog told MSNBC's Ana Cabrera. \"Now that means that if a terror organization is also all based throughout the terrain of Gaza Strip in houses, in living rooms, in shops, in mosques, then we have to go in.\"\n\nWhen asked if the rising death toll in Gaza is acceptable to him, Herzog said this war isn't only between Israel and Hamas, but a war \"to save Western civilization,\" adding that a \"jihadist network\" comprising of Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis \"wants to conquer the entire Middle East.\"\n\n\"And if it weren't for us, Europe would be next and the United States follows. I remind all about 9/11 and thereafter,\" Herzog said.\n\nMatteo Moschella\n\nHeartwarming video from the Israeli Ministry of Education shows 6-year-old Emilia Aloni being embraced by her friends when she returned to school after seven weeks as a Hamas hostage in Gaza.\n\nJamie Gray\n\nTwo Palestinian Red Crescent ambulances were targeted by Israeli tanks in southern Gaza, the humanitarian group said in an X post today.\n\nOne paramedic was slightly injured and the ambulances were damaged when they came under fire in the Im Al-Thuheir area, south of Deir Al-Balah.\n\nThe PRCS said that the ambulances were transporting injured and dead at the time of the attack.\n\nJamie Gray\n\nThe IDF said its forces have been engaged in \"intense battles\" across Gaza, including in the center of Khan Younis, the Palestinian enclave's second-largest city, and Jabalia in the north.\n\n\"We are in the most intense day since the beginning of the ground operation - in terms of terrorists killed, the number of firefights, and the use of firepower from the land and air,\" Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman said in a statement.\n\nFinkelman added that dozens of Israeli aircraft have carried out two rounds of strikes since the resumption of hostilities.\n\nMax Butterworth\n\nThe wife of Col. Asaf Hamami, commander of the Gaza division's Southern Brigade, holds their son, Alon, during Hamami's funeral at the Kiryat Shaul cemetery in Tel Aviv yesterday.\n\nJamie Gray\n\nThe IDF has said that it relocated troops from Gaza to the West Bank days before the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and added there would be a \"thorough investigation\" into the decision.\n\nThe admission follows a report released Monday by Israeli public broadcaster Kan that said 100 commandos were diverted from the Gaza Strip to Hawara in the West Bank on Oct. 5.\n\n\"Indeed, forces were relocated. And I'm saying this will be dealt with in an operational investigation. There will be a thorough investigation here,\" IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a briefing yesterday.\n\nKan said the decision to divert the forces was made despite warnings of danger in the Gaza Strip before the events of Oct. 7.\n\nCaroline Radnofsky\n\nRecent satellite images appear to show the IDF presence in Deir Al Balah, just north of the embattled town of Khan Younis in southern Gaza.\n\nThe images, taken by Planet Labs on Sunday just after 9 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET) and analyzed by NBC News, show what seem to be scores of IDF armored vehicles, fortifications and significant tire tracks through fields alongside the Salah al-Din road, the major highway that bisects the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsraeli tanks have cut off this main route through Gaza, residents told Reuters.\n\nAvichay Adraee, IDF spokesperson for the Arab media, said in a post on X yesterday that the area around Salah al-Din \"constitutes a battlefield.\"\n\n\"The fighting and military advance of the IDF in the Khan Younis area do not allow the movement of civilians through the Salah al-Din axis in the sections north and east of the city of Khan Yunis,\" he wrote.\n\nAndy Eckardt\n\nFrance is freezing all assets belonging to the Hamas terror group's top leader in Gaza, effective for the next six months. Yahya Sinwar is considered the mastermind of the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel.\n\nA decision published in the Official Journal of the French Republic says that \"funds and economic resources owned, held or controlled\" by Sinwar are being frozen. The total value of Sinwar's assets in France was not provided.\n\nLarissa Gao\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said yesterday that almost 1.9 million people, accounting for 85% of the total population, have been displaced in the Gaza Strip since Oct. 7.\n\nThe report from UNRWA added that 130 of its staff were killed since the war began.\n\nAs of Sunday, around 1.2 million internally displaced people were sheltering at UNRWA installations, and the average number of people in these shelters is four times more than their capacity, the report said.\n\nMax Butterworth\n\nChecking her phone with one hand, a woman carries an assault rifle through the streets of Jerusalem last night. Recent shootings have raised tensions between Israelis and Palestinians in the region.\n\nJamie Gray\n\nSirens sounded in Tel Aviv and other cities in Israel this morning after the latest rocket barrage seemingly fired by Hamas from the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsraeli emergency medical services said that after alarms were heard in central Israel, its paramedics were \"providing medical treatment in the Tel Aviv sector to a 40-year-old man in a minor condition who was hit by shrapnel.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, an IDF spokesman Lt.

      "text": "U.S. 'prepper' culture diversifies amid fear of disaster and political unrest\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nLONGMONT, Colo. - Brook Morgan surveyed booths at the \"Survival & Prepper Show\" in Colorado that were stocked with boxes of ammunition, mounds of trauma medical kits, and every type of knife imaginable.\n\nA self-described \"30-year-old lesbian from Indiana,\" Morgan is one of a new breed of Americans getting ready to survive political upheaval and natural catastrophes, a pursuit that until recently was largely associated with far-right movements such as white nationalists since the 1980s.\n\nResearchers say the number of preppers has doubled in size to about 20 million since 2017. Much of that growth is from minorities and people considered left-of-center politically, whose sense of insecurity was heightened by Donald Trump's 2016 election, the  pandemic, more frequent extreme weather and the 2020 racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd.\n\n\"I'm really surprised by the number of people of color here,\" Morgan said. \"I always went to these shows with my family in Indiana and it was just white people who were my parents' age. There are a lot of younger people here, too. It's a real change.\"\n\nMorgan grew up in a prepper family and still considers herself self-reliant and ready to handle a disaster but she left the prepper world of her youth behind in part to escape the conservatism associated with the movement.\n\nThe diversification of prepping was clear last weekend at the Survival & Prepper show at the fairgrounds in Boulder County, a liberal district which President Joe Biden won in 2020 by nearly 57 percentage points over Trump. Over 2,700 people paid $10 each to attend the show, organizers said, and attendees were varied.\n\nBearded white men with closely cropped hair and heavily tattooed arms were there. But so were hippy moms carrying babies in rainbow colored slings and chatting about canning methods, Latino families looking over greenhouses and water filtration systems, and members of the local Mountain View Fire Rescue team, who in 2021 battled a devastating fire in the region, giving CPR demonstrations and encouraging citizens to be more prepared for extreme events.\n\nAttendees and those running the booths said the show reflected the concerns of millions of Americans who no longer feel that they can always count on the government or private industry to provide the basics, like electricity, water and food.\n\nThey cited the pandemic disruption of supply chains, the 2021 power grid crisis in Texas that left millions without power, and the recent outages for thousands of AT&T mobile users .\n\nChris Ellis is a colonel in the U.S. Army who works on disaster preparedness and recovery and is a leading researcher into the prepper movement who has tracked its growth to 20 million people based on household resiliency data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nHe said that what shapes individual preppers - which he defines as someone who can live for a month with no outside support - is how they react to a single question: \"Do I feel safe?\"\n\n\"People want to regain their agency, their sense of control, and do something to match their fears to their actions,\" said Ellis, who underscored that he did not speak on behalf of the Department of Defense.\n\nPeople motivated by climate change, Ellis said, tend to be homesteaders who grow their own food and move to more \"climate proof\" locations, such as the mild summer haven of Duluth, Minnesota .\n\nOthers whose main fear is lawlessness are frequently the gun enthusiasts stereotypically associated with the prepper movement. The super rich often respond to their fears by spending millions to build bunkers in remote spots.\n\nFor John Ramey, a former innovation adviser to the Obama administration and creator of the prepper website The Prepared, the community has grown to reflect American society at large in terms of political beliefs and demographic categories.\n\n\"The only real unifying denominator among preppers these days is people who are smart enough to be aware of what the world is like ... and they have the gumption to do something about it,\" Ramey said.\n\nBack at the prepper show at the Boulder County fairgrounds, Jennifer Council strummed her thumb against the edge of an ax, balanced it in her hand and said it was perfect for both cutting down small trees and doing the delicate shaving work needed to create tinder.\n\nCouncil, a 50-year-old mom of three adult children and self-described Black urban farmer, lives in a suburban home northwest of Denver.\n\n\"Preppers used to be seen as extreme weirdos,\" Council said. \"Then the pandemic happened and grocery stores were short on food. Then you had the unrest of protests around the police killings of young Black men. Then you had the storming of the Capitol in Washington.\"\n\n\"People are realizing that it's important to be able to depend on what you can do for yourself.\"\n\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter\n\nReuters\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Methane agreement reached at COP28 climate conference panned by some environmental groups\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nSome 50 oil and gas companies worldwide have pledged to shore up leaky methane systems by 2030, a move that could rapidly reduce emissions of the potent gas and forestall some climate change effects - if the companies live up to their word.\n\nThe pledge, which was announced at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai (COP28) by Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber on Saturday, calls for oil and gas companies to dramatically reduce methane leaks to \"near zero\" by 2030. Al Jaber, the conference's president, is the United Arab Emirates' special envoy for climate and the CEO of ADNOC, a state-owned oil and gas company.\n\nThe pledge includes ExxonMobil and Saudi Arabia's Aramco , among the largest oil and gas producers in the world.\n\nSeveral environmental nonprofits and intergovernmental organizations - including the Environmental Defense Fund and the International Energy Agency - have signed on to track the effort and use satellite technology to provide additional accountability measures.\n\nOther environmental groups decried the new agreement, called the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter, as part of a greenwashing effort. More than 300 organizations signed on to an open letter criticizing the effort .\n\n\"Methane emissions and gas flaring are symptoms of a more than century-long legacy of wasteful, destructive practices that are routine in the oil and gas industry as it pursues massive profits without regard for the consequences,\" the groups wrote. \"The only safe and effective way to 'clean up' fossil fuel pollution is to phase out fossil fuels.\"\n\nMethane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Controlling methane, which has been rising in atmospheric concentration for decades, is seen as one of the easiest and cheapest ways to make an immediate impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. And many fossil fuel companies have a natural incentive to reduce leaks, which often cost them money as supply is lost.\n\n\"It's not complicated technology. It's mostly plumbing, simple - you know - tightening the screws, shutting off leaks, stopping the flaring, stopping the venting, which is just wasting gas, burning it off in the atmosphere and doing damage,\" said John Kerry, the United States special presidential envoy for climate, in a briefing about the accountability measures behind the agreement, adding that methane has been responsible for about 30% of the planet's warming. \"It's absolutely essential that we deal with methane.\"\n\nA 2019 United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report estimated that methane's potential contribution to global warming is more than 80 times that of an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide when impacts are measured over 20 years. Methane, which is the primary component of natural gas, accounted for about 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions from the world's energy supply, according to the latest IPCC report. Methane is also produced at landfills, in agriculture and in natural processes like decomposition.\n\nAlso on Saturday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced its final rule on methane pollution , which the agency says will reduce emissions from the U.S. oil and gas industry by about 80% over what could be expected without it. The rule will dictate how the oil and gas industry finds and fixes leaks, strengthening provisions about flaring and enhancing emissions standards for pumps.\n\nA study published this summer in Environmental Research Letters suggests that leaky methane can be just as bad for global warming as coal, which illustrates why world leaders are so animated about the issue.\n\nFred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the oil and gas companies' agreement could be the most helpful environmental action of his career if the companies hold to their commitments.\n\n\"We need to make sure the oil companies deliver, we need to hold them accountable,\" Krupp said in an interview. \"Many promises have been made at COPs that have not been kept.\"\n\nKrupp said EDF analysis suggests that about 2-3% of the natural gas removed from the ground is leaked into the air because of incomplete combustion during flaring, leaky compressor seals or through venting valves. The agreement calls to limit that leakage to near zero, which is defined as .2%, Krupp said.\n\n\"Every piece of equipment, every component, can leak methane along the supply chain,\" said Arvind Ravikumar, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the co-director of its Energy Emissions Modeling and Data Lab. \"The only way to know it is to go look for it.\"\n\nRavikumar, who was not involved in either Saturday announcement, said about 10% of leaks in the oil and gas supply chain create more than 50% of all methane emissions.\n\n\"If you want to address methane emissions, find these super emitters and fix them,\" Ravikumar said. \"There's the economic interest associated in stopping leaks.\"\n\nRavikumar said many publicly traded oil and gas companies are under public pressure to reduce leaks, but that an international agreement is essential to spur private or national companies to take similar action.\n\nEDF is planning to launch a satellite next year that can detect methane leaks. Bloomberg Philanthropies, which coordinates the charitable giving of former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, has committed $40 million to create tools to track methane leaks and expand data tracking and coordination among organizations focused on accountability.\n\nKrupp said the companies will have to report their emissions data for third-party verification and that the organizations monitoring this effort, including EDF, should be able to ensure if they're following through.\n\nEvan Bush is a science reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The objective is to keep the rooms between 73-79 degrees Fahrenheit. The rooms will also be equipped with fans.\n\n\"I want the Paris Games to be exemplary from an environmental point of view,\" Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has said about the plans for the Olympics.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, fewer than 1 in 10 households in Europe has air conditioning, and the numbers in Paris are lower than that. The study said that of the 1.6 billion AC units in use across the globe in 2016, more than half were in China (570 million) and the United States (375 million). The entire European Union had around 100 million.\n\nThe Olympics mark the most important stop on the athletic careers of the 10,500-plus athletes who will descend on Paris, which has led some high-profile countries to undercut environmental efforts for the sake of comfort.\n\n\"It's a high-performance environment,\" Australian Olympic Committee spokesman Strath Gordon explained to The Post.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

In 1989, as Poland implemented free market reforms, advisers to finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz famously told their boss to watch the price of eggs closely . If farmers resumed bringing their eggs to market and prices began to drop, the economy would stabilize. They did and it did (although unemployment increased ).\n\nThe price of eggs has been less kind to Joe Biden and his economic advisers. Even as overall inflation has slowed and overall grocery prices have cooled, eggs have remained stubbornly expensive. Between January 2022 and January 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average price of a dozen Grade A eggs in an American city skyrocketed from $1.93 to $4.82 . During the same period, the annual rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), had fallen from 7.5 percent to 6.4 percent . By September 2024-with the presidential election looming-CPI inflation had slowed to 2.4 percent year-over-year, but egg prices were still stubbornly high at $3.82.* See where this is going yet?\n\nEgg prices quickly caught on as a meme , helping to sustain inflation as a powerful election-year issue, even as actual inflation was steadily dropping. Even Donald Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, eventually tried to get in on the act ( with mixed results ). But how did egg prices get so high, why did they remain that way even after other inflation indexes began to drop? And why, as of January 2025, are grocery stores nationwide experiencing severe shortages?"

      "text": "Assessing Claims That Trump Refuses to Unveil Barack Obama's Presidential Portrait\n\nTrump did not have an official ceremony for the portrait, but it was by mutual agreement.\n\nA viral post claims that President Donald Trump refused to unveil Barack Obama's presidential portrait and won't allow it to hang in the White House. \"This is the official White House portrait of President Obama that Trump refuses to hang and have an official unveiling for,\" the post reads. \"It is the first time in history that a sitting president has been so petty. Trump may not hang it, but can share it and flood the internet with it!\"\n\nThe claim is outdated and includes some inaccuracies. It's true that Trump did not host a ceremony during his first term to unveil Obama's presidential portrait, but the decision appears to have been made mutually by both the Trump White House and the Obamas. The image shown is also not Obama's official portrait, which was eventually unveiled by President Joe Biden in 2022.\n\nSitting presidents traditionally host their predecessor at the White House for a ceremony to unveil an official portrait. In 2004, for example, George W. Bush hosted Bill Clinton for such a ceremony, and in 2012, Obama welcomed Bush. The custom stretches back to 1978 when Jimmy Carter hosted his predecessor Gerald Ford for a portrait ceremony.\n\nIn May 2020, NBC News first reported that a ceremony for Obama was unlikely to occur before the end of Trump's term. However, the break in tradition was not prompted solely by Trump. NBC News also reported that Obama had \"no interest in participating in the post-presidency rite of passage so long as Trump is in office.\" Representatives for both Obama and the Trump White House declined to comment on the story at the time.\n\nIn September 2022, Biden unveiled Obama's portrait at a ceremony in the White House's East Room. The portrait was painted in 2018 by artist Robert McCurdy and depicts Obama against a stark white background.\n\nOfficial White House portraits are different from those shown in the National Portrait Gallery's America's Presidents exhibition. The White House Historical Association assists in funding, acquiring, and donating portraits for the White House collection, while portraits in the National Portrait Gallery are funded and commissioned separately by donors to the Smithsonian.\n\nThe White House Historical Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Trump Has (the) Issues\n\nHe's polling better than Harris on the economy and immigration, but he refuses to stay on message.\n\nRepublican leaders have a clear message for their presidential nominee, Donald Trump: Stick to the issues.\n\n\"President Trump can win this election. His policies are good for America, and if you have a policy debate for president, he wins,\" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told NBC News . \"Donald Trump the provocateur, the showman, may not win this election.\"\n\nThat's the message from old-school Republicans like former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley , New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu , and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy -the same kind of people who have spent nearly a decade pleading with Trump to buckle down and focus.\n\nIt's tantalizing to Republicans because they so often see polls like the latest survey from the Washington Post and ABC News, which show Trump down by 6 points nationally to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris but still leading Harris on some of the most important issues to voters.\n\nThe vice president blew past President Joe Biden's performance in his last month in the race, taking the race from a tie to one outside the margin of error in Democrats' favor, but on key issues, she's not much better than Biden. She's down 9 points to Trump on handling the economy, about the same as Biden. Harris is trailing by 10 points on immigration, which is better than her boss' 14-point deficit, but still pretty bad.\n\nThe economy-particularly inflation-and immigration are consistently the top issues with voters , so how can it be that so many Americans are voting against the candidate who does better on those subjects? If only he'd stick to the issues!\n\nBut when Republicans say Trump should stick to policy points, they mean that he should stick to the policies they like and are broadly popular: low taxes, deregulation, robust national security, tough policies on crime and illegal immigration, etc. Trump frequently does talk about policy, just not in ways that are helpful.\n\nEstablishing criminal penalties for criticizing federal judges who rule in his favor, using cryptocurrency to pay off the federal debt, or pledging to prosecute members of the losing party if he is returned to power are all certainly policies.\n\nWhat traditional Republicans are looking for is that always-just-over-the horizon promise of Donald Trump the disciplined campaigner, Donald Trump the populist pitchman for old-fashioned conservative policies.\n\nThey have certainly seen glimpses of him, most famously when his numbers crashed after the Access Hollywood tape came out in October of 2016 and Trump became willing to stay on message, at least a bit . But usually, no matter how near the transformation may seem , he escapes the clutches of the \"stick to the issues\" crowd.\n\nBut would Republicans really win an election about the issues this year if Trump listened to Graham & Co.?\n\nIt would probably be better, for instance, than posting on social media about a fake endorsement from Taylor Swift . It would definitely be better than making fun of dead and wounded Congressional Medal of Honor recipients in an effort to suck up to a mega-donor. Or attacking the popular Republican governor of must-win swing state Georgia, or claiming to be a better draw than Martin Luther King Jr. was, or, well, you get the idea.\n\nBut look a little closer at those issue numbers. On his best issues-the economy and immigration-Trump is at 46 percent in a poll in which he is getting 45 percent of the popular vote. There are, no doubt, some voters who prefer Trump's policies on those issues but are planning to vote for Harris anyway, maybe even a few more than the 1-point differential suggests. But not that many. Trump's score on the issues isn't different from what it was when he was running against Biden. The former president is winning on the issues because those are the issues that matter most to Republicans and Republicans are overwhelmingly supporting Trump.\n\nHis low ceiling and high floor remain very much intact.\n\nWhere the race has changed isn't on issues, but attributes. Harris leads Trump 56 percent to 26 percent on being \"in good enough physical health to serve as president,\" 46 percent to 37 percent on having \"the mental sharpness it takes to serve as president,\" 41 percent to 26 percent on being \"honest and trustworthy,\" and the killer, she leads 40 percent to 33 percent on \"understands the problems of people like you.\"\n\nThis is where we have to bear in mind that voters who care deeply about issues and have well-formed opinions about the parties' and the candidates' stances on them are unlikely to be persuadable voters. Almost by definition, the persuadable ones are those who haven't staked out strongly held positions.\n\nThose voters, not unreasonably, are going on a candidate's character, personality, and, yes, vibes. So while it would be good for Trump to stick to the issues for these voters, it's not even mostly about the positions themselves.\n\nWhat those Republicans hoping for a Trump transformation really want is for Trump to show a different character to a voting public that has mostly concluded that he is a lout and a selfish one at that. Anything he could do to undercut those notions, including being reborn as a disciplined campaigner, would be helpful. But it would probably be just as helpful if he could stay on any message at all. He could riff on sharks and electric boats or The Silence of the Lambs every day and probably be better off than he is now. Voters don't trust or like him, and that's a problem beyond policy.\n\nChris Stirewalt is a contributing writer for The Dispatch, the politics editor for The Hill and NewsNation, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, co-host of the Ink Stained Wretches podcast, and author of Broken News, a book on media and politics.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nPanelists Ben Levisohn, Jack Hough and Megan Leonhardt break down three topics investors should be aware of on 'Barron's Roundtable.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Saturday that he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raise prices due to the impact of his upcoming tariffs on foreign-made cars, arguing that the move will lead to more purchases of cars produced in the U.S.\n\n\"I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars,\" Trump told NBC News. \"I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty.\"\n\nThe president also said he did not warn auto companies against raising costs in response to the tariffs - pushing back on reports that he made the threats as a way to control the price of cars.\n\nTRUMP'S 25% AUTO IMPORT TARIFFS: THESE ARE THE MOST IMPACTED MANUFACTURERS\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raise prices due to tariffs. (Win McNamee/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nThis comes after Trump announced 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts , sparking concerns about potential price hikes that would impact consumers. The tariffs are part of the president's efforts to promote American manufacturing, as he has argued that tariffs would lead foreign auto producers to move production into the U.S. and boost American jobs.\n\nThe tariffs, which are slated to go into effect on Wednesday, would be permanent, the president said.\n\n\"Absolutely, they're permanent, sure. The world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more,\" Trump said.\n\nThe tariffs on foreign-made cars would be permanent, Trump said. (Oriental Image via Reuters Connect / Reuters Photos)\n\n\"And all we're doing is being fair, and frankly, I'm being very generous,\" he added.\n\nIf the taxes are fully passed onto consumers, the average auto price on an imported vehicle could spike by $12,500, which could impact overall inflation, according to The Associated Press.\n\nTrump said he would only consider negotiating with countries to lower the tariffs \"if people are willing to give us something of great value.\"\n\nTRUMP'S AUTO TARIFFS COULD BE BOON FOR RENTAL CAR COMPANIES\n\nThe tariffs are slated to go into effect on Wednesday.

I'm not a political supporter of the Republicans or of Donald Trump,\" Dershowitz clarified on \" Mornings with Maria .\"\n\n\"I go over to my friend Norm Eisen, who is my former student, my former research assistant. He's in the courtroom, he's a CNN guy. And I said, 'Hey, Norm, how are you?' We have a momentary friendly chat,\" he expanded. \"NBC reports: Dershowitz screamed at Eisen, he's an opponent of his, and made up a whole story.

He brushed his leg next to mine, I was so close to him. Again, I've rarely seen so many lies. He swears under oath that he would not have accepted a pardon. He wouldn't have accepted a pardon.

The social media platform could receive a lifeline from TikTok critic-turned-user President-elect Trump. On Sunday, Trump told NBC News that he would \"most likely\" give TikTok a 90-day extension from the Jan. 19 deadline after he enters office on Monday.\n\nOn Friday, TikTok released a statement on the \"possible shutdown,\" expressing disappointment in the Supreme Court's upholding of the bipartisan-backed law banning the app unless its Chinese-owned parent company sells by Sunday.\n\nThe TikTok logo is seen in this illustration photo taken in Warsaw, Poland on 28 Dec. 2024.

You have a lot of reading. I don't believe we're going to redact anything.\"\n\nTrump's refusal to speak with the NBC News reporter is just his latest spat with members of the press.\n\nOn Monday, he signed an executive order gutting the federal agency that oversees the Voice of America - effectively shuttering the news outlet that for more than 80 years broadcast news into countries where independent reporting is censored.\n\nIn a press release, the White House accused Voice of America stations of \"a leftist bias aligned with partisan national media.\"\n\nLast month, after the Associated Press continued to use the term \"Gulf of Mexico\" - ignoring Trump's proclamation to rename it \"Gulf of America\" - officials barred their reporters from the White House's briefing room and kept them from boarding Air Force One.\n\nThe wire service responded with a lawsuit accusing top White House officials of violating the First and Fifth Amendments.\n\nMembers of his administration and close Trump allies have also called on the White House to \"defund\" public broadcast networks like NPR and PBS.\n\nIn January, FCC Chair Brendan Carr launched a probe into the two networks over their alleged use of \"prohibited commercial advertisements,\" which he argued could be reason enough to yank their federal funding.\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire behind the White House's cost-cutting task force, has also threatened to \"defund\" the public station , arguing \"It should survive on its own.\"\n\nNPR has reported that it receives about 1% of its funding from federal sources annually, and that PBS receives 16% of its funds from the government.\n\nFaced with the threats, public broadcaster PBS last month shuttered its diversity office and fired two staffers, citing a need to comply with Trump's order since the network relies on federal funding.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Lester Holt leaving 'NBC Nightly News' after a decade\n\n\"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Lester Holt announced Monday he will step down after a decade of helming the network's evening broadcast.\n\nHolt, 65, will remain with NBC in a full-time role at \"Dateline,\" where he has been the principal anchor for nearly 15 years, according to a memo shared with staffers.\n\nHolt, who is reportedly earning a hefty wage of around $10 million per year , said he would continue anchoring the evening news until \"the start of summer.\"\n\n\"As a 20-year-old radio reporter on the police beat chasing breaking news around San Francisco, I could never have imagined my career path would unfold in the way it has,\" Holt wrote in a note to staffers. \"What an amazing ride.\"\n\nNBC News did not immediately name a successor.\n\nHolt took the helm at \"NBC Nightly News\" in 2015 as the network was embroiled in controversy - after it was revealed that the evening news' previous anchor Brian Williams had falsely claimed he was aboard a helicopter shot down in Iraq .\n\nFollowing the scandal, Holt filled in for Williams as the disgraced anchor was slapped with a six-month suspension without pay. Holt was officially given the job after it was decided Williams would move to left-leaning MSNBC.\n\nThe evening news has remained firmly in second place in the ratings behind ABC and well ahead of CBS under Holt's watch.\n\nAs of mid-February, NBC's nightly broadcast raked in about 6.7 million viewers, trailing the 8.3 million of ABC's \"World News Tonight\" with David Muir, according to Nielsen. CBS' \"Evening News,\" which is already backtracking on a controversial overhaul to its format after parting ways with Norah O'Donnell , drew 4.5 million viewers, according to Nielsen.\n\nHolt \"has led the network during some of the country's most fraught and challenging times in the past decade,\" Janelle Rodriguez, NBC News' executive vice president of programming, wrote in a note to staffers.\n\n\"Quite simply, Lester is the beating heart of this news organization,\" she added.\n\nSenior national correspondent Tom Llamas could be in line for Holt's anchor chair, The Post previously reported. Llamas has been impatiently waiting for Holt to retire in what looked like a \"slow-motion coup d'état\" at 30 Rock, according to the Ankler.\n\nHolt joins an exodus of veteran journalists at NBC since the start of the year that includes \"Today\" show host Hoda Kotb and Chuck Todd from \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nHis exit also follows a massive shakeup at sister channel MSNBC, which canned rabid anti-Trump host Joy Reid on Sunday, and canceled shows anchored by Ayman Mohyeldin, Katie Phang and Jonathan Capehart, sources told The Post.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Tom Llamas to take over for longtime 'NBC Nightly News' anchor Lester Holt\n\nNBC News on Wednesday tapped Tom Llamas to take over the \"Nightly News\" anchor chair from Lester Holt when he steps down this summer.\n\nLlamas, a senior national correspondent and anchor of \"Top Story with Tom Llamas,\" had been rumored as Holt's replacement after the veteran journalist announced his departure last week.\n\n\"I look forward to working with the world class journalists at 'Nightly News' and 'Top Story' to bring viewers the most important stories every night,\" Llamas said in a statement. Holt, who has helmed the second-place evening news program for a decade, will remain in a full-time role at \"Dateline.\" \"Lester Holt is a great man and one of the most trusted broadcasters of our time,\" said Llamas, who was also given the title managing editor. \"Just like Lester, I promise to be devoted to our viewers and dedicated to the truth.\"\n\nHolt phoned in Wednesday to inform staffers that he told Llamas that anchoring the broadcast was \"not only one of the great jobs, but it's a great staff he's inheriting. I know you all will give him your 100% support as you make the transition,\" according to NBC News.\n\nLlamas, 45, reportedly makes a modest salary estimated at around $2.5 million. NBC did not reveal any financial terms for his new role.\n\nLlamas started his career as an intern at a local Telemundo station before getting hired by NBC News, where he held several roles.\n\nHe jumped to ABC in 2014 and anchored weekend editions of the network's \"World News Tonight\" - before returning to NBC in 2021 as a senior national correspondent.\n\nLlamas has regularly filled in for Holt on \"Nightly News\" and reports often for that program, in addition to the \"Today\" show.\n\n\"Tom has the winning combination of journalistic excellence, passionate storytelling and unyielding integrity - all characteristics that have long been trademarks of 'NBC Nightly News,'\" said Janelle Rodriguez, NBC News executive vice president of programming.\n\n\"Additionally, he's been instrumental in growing NBC News NOW into the leading streaming news network, helping to introduce NBC News to a new generation of viewers,\" she added.\n\nLlamas takes the anchor chair, long held by Tom Brokaw, at a tumultuous time for Comcast-owned NBCUniversal. The media giant said late last year that it would spin off several of its cable channels, including MSNBC and CNBC, but not NBC.\n\nThe change also comes as viewers shift away from watching network news, translating to a softer advertising market.\n\nCBS recently revamped its \"Evening News\" program, ousting its marquee anchor Norah O'Donnell, in favor of less expensive co-anchors Maurice DuBois and John Dickerson.\n\nABC's \"World News Tonight with David Muir\" is the top-rated network news broadcast, averaging about 7.7 million viewers last season, according to Nielsen.\n\n\"NBC Nightly News\" drew 6.44 million and \"CBS Evening News\" 4.65 million.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Trump ties for highest approval he's ever had - as more Americans say US is on right track than any time in 20 years: poll\n\nThree months into his second term, President Trump hit the highest approval rating he's ever had as commander-in-chief - while more Americans say the country is on the right track than at any point since 2004, a new poll found.\n\nThat's the good news, according to an NBC News Poll released Sunday.\n\nThe bad news is that Trump still has not won over a majority of Americans, and 54% said they disapprove of his handling of the economy - the first time he's lost a majority on that issue in NBC's poll.\n\nEven so, the survey found that voters generally feel Trump is bringing \"the right kind of change\" on the key issues - even tariffs.\n\nMore Americans support his changes to trade policy (41%) than oppose them (38%), according to NBC.\n\nThat's despite the stock market selloff last week as Wall Street grappled with Trump's decision earlier this month to slap 25% across-the-board tariffs on Canada and Mexico as well as a 20% tariff on China.\n\nOn many other key issues, voters felt the same way, with Trump's actions on the border being the most popular - 56% said it was a positive change. On government cuts, 47% said his changes were good, compared to just 29% who opposed.\n\nEven on his handling of the Ukraine war and NATO - policies on which he's received significant pushback - more respondents said his actions were good (41%) than opposed his actions (40%).\n\nNBC poll respondents also appear to be cutting Trump some slack on inflation: 40% said his policies are having a positive effect, compared to 30% who said they were having a negative impact, and 28% who said Trump's policies are not changing things at all.\n\nIllustrating how the president remains a political Rorschach test for a deeply divided country, Trump's approval rating among Republicans is 90%, while his figures among Democrats clock in at a paltry 4%, per the poll.\n\nThat's the largest gap in approval ratings between a president's party and the opposition party over the last 80 years, NBC assessed.\n\nSome 47% of voters in the survey approve of Trump - compared to 51% who disapprove, marking an all-time high in the poll. He previously hit 47% in early 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic, and in October 2018.\n\nNBC News' findings mirror most other polling, with the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of polls showing Trump with a 48.2% approval rating on average.\n\nTrump's approval rating is significantly higher than where it stood at this point during his first term (44%), per RCP, though below where former President Joe Biden was during the same time (53%).\n\nIn another boost for Trump, NBC News recorded that a two-decade-high 44% of registered voters believe that the country is on the right track, while 54% believe it's heading in the wrong direction.\n\nWhile still pessimistic, that marks the most positive outlook on the country's direction the poll has found since President George W. Bush was in office 20 years ago.\n\nIt's also a huge swing from the last administration. Last September, just 28% percent of polled voters told NBC News that the country was headed in the right direction - compared to 65% who said it was on the wrong track.\n\nOne of the most significant actions Trump has taken in his second term was to establish the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), something that has sparked protests from government workers and an outcry from Democrats.\n\nWhile DOGE is unpopular (47% negative to 41% positive), voters generally believe it was a good idea (46%), compared to 40% who say it was a bad idea.\n\nTrump has steadfastly stood by DOGE and Elon Musk amid political backlash to the cost-cutting initiative, which is intended to help slim down the federal deficit.\n\nIn a key bright spot for Trump, Democrats' favorability is at an abysmal 27%, with 55% viewing the party negatively, marking the worst numbers for the party in NBC News' polling history.\n\nAnother poll from CNN found a similar result and also pegged Dems with their lowest rating in its polling history, with only 29% viewing the party favorably.\n\nAdditionally, voters displayed skepticism of the media's coverage of Trump, with 46% concluding it's been too critical, while 25% felt it was too supportive, and 24% approved of the media's approach to him.\n\nThe NBC News survey sampled 1,000 registered voters between March 7 and 11 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Trump says new auto tariffs are permanent, 'couldn't care less' about price hikes on foreign-made cars\n\nPresident Trump downplayed concerns that his forthcoming round of 25% tariffs on all foreign-made vehicles will cause prices on those automobiles to spike, arguing that it will be a boon for American-made autos.\n\nLast week, Trump announced plans to slap 25% tariffs against vehicles made outside the US as part of his \"Liberation Day\" push on April 2, in which he intends to pursue a raft of \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\n\"No, I couldn't care less, because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they're going to buy American cars,\" Trump told NBC News in a phone interview.\n\nA Trump aide later clarified that the president's comments brushing aside price hikes were specific to foreign-made vehicles. The auto tariff is set to go fully into effect on April 3.\n\nThe average price of a foreign car is expected to soar between $5,000 and $10,000, according to estimates from financial services company Wedbush. The price increases are expected to start hitting consumers by the summer.\n\nFord Motor and General Motors could shed up to 30% of their earnings, per research from Bernstein, which projected an $110 billion blow to the auto sector, or about $6,700 per vehicle.\n\nLast week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump gathered the top CEOs of automakers and warned them against raising their prices last month. During the conversation, Trump riffed about the benefits of the tariffs and refrained from outlining any specific threat against companies that jack up prices.\n\nFollowing the meeting, several top CEOs were reportedly left nervous about what type of retaliation they might face from the White House if they defy the president's warning.\n\nBut Trump denied ever saying that.\n\n\"No, I never said that. I couldn't care less if they raise prices because people are going to start buying American-made cars,\" he told NBC News.\n\nThe tariffs will also apply to foreign auto parts even if the vehicles are manufactured in the US, according to White House officials. There will be a special consideration for auto parts subject to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump negotiated during his first term.\n\n\"Absolutely, they're permanent, sure,\" he added to the outlet, when questioned about whether the duties will be permanent.  \"The world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more. And all we're doing is being fair, and frankly, I'm being very generous.\"\n\nStill, Trump indicated that there may be some wiggle room, particularly on the timeframe for implementing the tariffs \"only if people are willing to give us something of great value,\" adding that \"otherwise, there's no room for negotiation.\"\n\nThe president did not provide any specifics about what he would like to see from other countries in order to reconsider the scope of the tariffs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump slapped 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico, before later adding temporary one-month carveouts to autos and trade subject to the USMCA. He also imposed a 20% tariff on trade from China.\n\nDuring his forthcoming \"Liberation Day\" tariff spree, Trump is expected to take aim at trade with Europe.\n\nTrump also briefly touched upon Signalgate and his ambitions to acquire Greenland during his wide-ranging interview with NBC News.\n\nThe 47th president vehemently denied reports that he never considered firing national security adviser Mike Waltz over the Signalgate fiasco in which the Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffry Goldberg was added to a private chat where top officials discussed plans to strike Houthi terrorists in Yemen.\n\n\"Nope, I've never heard that,\" Trump said of the reports. \"And nobody else makes that decision but, me and I've never heard it, and I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts.\"\n\nIn public, Trump has steadfastly stood by his deputies, including Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nOn Greenland, Trump said he believes \"there's a good possibility\" that the US will be able to acquire the Danish territory but did not rule out the use of force.\n\n\"I never take military force off the table,\" Trump explained. \"But I think there's a good possibility that we could do it without military force.\"\n\n\"We have an obligation to protect the world. This is world peace, this is international security. And I have that obligation while I'm president.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Todd confirmed his departure.\n\nHis last day at NBC News was Friday.\n\n\"There's never a perfect time to leave a place that's been a professional home for so long, but I'm pretty excited about a few new projects that are on the cusp of going from 'pie in the sky' to 'near reality,' Todd told NBC News staffers in a memo Friday.\n\n\"So I'm grateful for the chance to get a jump start on my next chapter during this important moment.\"\n\nTodd confirmed his departure on Friday. When The Post sought comment from Todd via his NBC work email, the automatic message read: \"Friday, January 31st was my final day at NBC.\"\n\nAccording to the memo, Todd told colleagues that he intends to take his podcast with him.\n\nThe \"Chuck Toddcast\" is \"coming with me,\" according to Todd, who urged colleagues to \"stay tuned for an announcement about its new home soon.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Semafor reported that Todd was plotting his exit from the Peacock Network as his contract was due to expire later this year.\n\nTodd, who was once a key cog in NBC's political coverage, has reportedly been busy lately taking meetings with several media organizations to plan his next steps, according to Semafor.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from NBC News.\n\n\"We're grateful for Chuck's many contributions to our political coverage during his nearly two-decade career at NBC News and for his deep commitment to Meet the Press and its enduring legacy,\" NBC News said in a statement to Variety.\n\n\"We wish him all the best in his next endeavors.\"\n\nThe 52-year-old Florida native joined NBC in 2007 and quickly became a fixture in the network's national political coverage.\n\nIn 2014, he was named moderator of \"Meet the Press,\" the long-running Sunday morning political talk show, replacing David Gregory.\n\nGregory, who hosted \"Meet the Press\" from 2008 to 2014, struggled to maintain the show's dominance after Tim Russert's passing, as declining ratings and criticism of his interview style led to his eventual replacement by Todd.\n\nIn addition to his \"Meet the Press\" gig, Todd hosted a weekday political program, \"MTP Daily,\" on sister cable network MSNBC and contributed to NBC's political website.\n\nIn 2023, Todd announced he would step down as host of \"Meet the Press\" to focus on long-form projects. He was replaced by the current moderator, Kristen Welker.\n\nSpeculation about Todd's future at the network ramped up last year when he was among the voices who criticized NBC News management for its decision to bring Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair, on board as a paid commentator.\n\nIn March 2024, NBC News hired McDaniel as a political contributor.\n\nThe move sparked significant internal backlash, with big-name NBC and MSNBC hosts such as \"Morning Joe\" co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, Rachel Maddow and Nicolle Wallace expressing strong objections due to McDaniel's past support of Donald Trump's claims regarding the 2020 election.\n\nFacing mounting pressure, NBC reversed its decision and parted ways with McDaniel just days after her hiring.\n\nTodd's departure comes during a period of flux at parent company Comcast , which, like other media giants, is grappling with a rapidly changing landscape that has seen a mass migration of viewers away from linear television and toward digital and streaming.\n\nComcast, the $129 billion Philadelphia-based telecoms giant, is making major changes by spinning off several of its cable networks, including USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, E!, Syfy, Oxygen and Golf Channel, into a separate company to give them more financial independence and flexibility.\n\nThe company is also raising prices on Xfinity services, with most customers seeing increases on their bills starting in January, as part of its strategy to adapt to shifting consumer habits and industry competition.\n\nShares of Comcast were up by 1.25% as of 11 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday. The company's stock was selling on Nasdaq at $33.66 a share.\n\nAdvertisement"

National media is not going to fix its credibility on its own.\"\n\nHe added, \"People are craving community.\"\n\nThe podcast is going with Todd, but he has yet to reveal its new home. During Saturday's episode, it wasn't yet clear that Todd had made a decision of where to distribute his show.\n\n\"At my core, I'm an entrepreneur - I spent my first 15 years professionally working for the company that started the political newsletter craze that dominates today. And this is a ripe moment,\" Todd wrote in his email announcing his departure to NBC staff. \"The only way to fix this information eco system is to stop whining about the various ways the social media companies are manipulating things and instead roll up our collective sleeves and start with local.\"\n\nTodd and his family have long lived in the Washington, D.C. area, where the Meet the Press set resides. The former television anchor has yet to say which local arena he plans to work in. Todd also teased leaving television news altogether, as he explained it is often a team effort where other avenues like Substack and TikTok can be one-man ventures.\n\nNBC News thanked Todd for his career with them, and wished him \"all the best in his next endeavors.\" The network did not announce a replacement for Todd."

      "text": "Trump hints at running for unconstitutional third term: 'I'm not joking'\n\nPresident Donald Trump gave his strongest indication yet that he would consider running for a third term as president , saying he's \"not joking\" and suggesting \"there are methods\" to do so.\n\nIn a phone call on Sunday with NBC News, Trump signaled he has received some backing for what would be an unconstitutional third term in the White House, while clarifying it's still early to make a decision and that he's focused on the work of his second administration.\n\n\"A lot of people want me to do it,\" the president said. \"But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it's very early in the administration.\"\n\n\"I'm focused on the current,\" Trump added.\n\nTrump then suggested there are \"methods\" to seek a third term that would not contravene the Constitution, which bars presidents from serving more than two terms. One of these, he indicated, would be if Vice President JD Vance ran in 2028, only to pass the presidency to Trump.\n\nTrump did not list any other way a third term could be constitutional.\n\nA hypothetical third Trump term does have the backing of one of his former aides, Steve Bannon. There is also some movement in Congress to extend the two-term limit. In late January, Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) proposed amending the Constitution to allow a president to be elected to as many as three terms.\n\nAmending the Constitution, however, would be very difficult and require either a two-thirds vote of Congress or two-thirds of the states agreeing to call a constitutional convention to propose changes. Any change would then require ratification from three-quarters of the states.\n\nTrump addressed his earlier comments on Sunday night when asked for clarification by reporters. The president said he's \"not looking at\" staying in the White House past Jan. 20, 2029, when a new president would take office, but quickly launched into \"rigged\" 2020 election claims, adding that any talk of a third term would actually be a fourth term.\n\n\"I'm not looking at that, but I'll tell you, I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election, was totally rigged, so it's actually sort of a fourth term. I just don't want the credit for the second because Biden was so bad, he did such a bad job, and I think that's one of the reasons that I'm popular if you want to know the truth,\" Trump said.\n\nWhen pressed again on the unconstitutionality of a third term for him, Trump said he didn't want to discuss it while also indicating that many people have urged him to run again.\n\n\"I don't even want to talk about it. I'm just telling you I have had more people saying, 'Please run again.' We have a long way to go before we even think about that, but I've had a lot of people,\" he said."

In the encrypted chat were many of Trump's top Cabinet members, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth , national security adviser Mike Waltz , and Vice President JD Vance . Since the national security lapse, calls have come from many figures on the Left for Hegseth, Waltz, or the pair, to resign.\n\nBut Trump shot back at any supposed wavering of his confidence in Hegseth or Waltz in an NBC News interview on Saturday, saying he doesn't \"fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts.\"\n\n\"I think it's just a witch hunt and the fake news, like you, talk about it all the time, but it's just a witch hunt, and it shouldn't be talked [about],\" the president said.\n\nHe further called the story \"nonsense\" that has detracted from the U.S.'s successful strikes against the Houthis, which began in mid-March and Trump characterized as \"tremendously successful.\"\n\n\"All I can tell you is it's just a witch hunt, and it's the only thing the press wants to talk about, because you have nothing else to talk about. Because it's been the greatest 100-day presidency in the history of our country,\" he said.\n\nTrump also dismissed any talk about the app the encrypted chat took place on, Signal, which is now at the center of a lawsuit filed by the left-leaning nonprofit group American Oversight. That complaint alleges the U.S. officials were not properly preserving Signal messages and that some were being erased entirely through the app's auto-delete function, in violation of the Federal Records Act. Judge James Boasberg, now a frequent target of Trump, has since ordered five of Trump's Cabinet members to preserve all Signal messages sent from March 11 to March 15.\n\nThe president said on Saturday that he has \"no idea what Signal is. I don't care what Signal is.\""

Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) explained that President Donald Trump is \"protecting America's future\" with his use of tariffs and that the ones levied on Canada are a matter of creating an \"even playing field\" between the two countries.\n\nMullin was asked on Sunday about Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's assessment of the Trump tariffs against his country when he said Canada's \"old relationship\" with the U.S. is \"over.\" The Oklahoma senator, however, contended that Canada has had its economy subsidized by the U.S. for years, claiming that they are aware of this.\n\n\"What President Trump is saying is enough is enough,\" Mullin explained on NBC News's Meet the Press . \"If you want to have a relationship with the United States, it's going to be an even playing field, a two-way street. We want reciprocal tariffs, we want to be treated the same, we want access to your economy like you have access to us, and if you want to have fair and balanced trade, then that's fine. But our economy is not subsidizing your economy anymore.\"\n\nThe senator continued by saying the U.S. has protected Canada over the years, with Canada also aiding the U.S. in the wars it has faced. However, Canada now wants to keep its \"sweetheart deal\" in being allowed to access the U.S. economy, which Mullin assessed Trump is no longer \"putting up\" with.\n\nSEAN DUFFY SEEMS PRETTY HAPPY HE WASN'T INVITED TO SIGNAL GROUP CHAT\n\nTrump spoke with Carney on Friday in an \"extremely productive\" phone call , confirming that he and the Canadian prime minister will speak again following Canada's election on April 28. Carney also described the call as a \"very constructive conversation about the relationship between our two countries.\"\n\nBeyond Trump's tariffs on Canada, Trump also introduced a 25% tariff on automobile imports, which he said will \"absolutely\" be permanent once they go into effect on Wednesday. These tariffs have been celebrated by the United Auto Workers , which UAW President Shawn Fain defended despite criticizing Trump ahead of last year's election."

Meanwhile, the agency reported there were twice as many disasters in 2023 than in 2016.\n\nFEMA allocated $640 million this year toward its Shelter and Services Program, which has helped migrants find food and housing, which is separate from its $20 million in disaster preparedness funding. The Biden administration has classified any criticisms about this disproportionate spending as \"misinformation.\" NBC News's Kristen Welker echoed the sentiment, referring to any claim of redirected funds as \"debunked.\"\n\n\"This FEMA dollars going to resettle migrants, that is a fact. That is an objective fact,\" Johnson said. \"What he's talking about is not the disaster relief fund, but it's another fund FEMA used to resettle all of the illegal aliens that they let across the open border. Kamala Harris, the border czar, was the engineer of that.\"\n\n\"FEMA funds were not redirected to house migrants. That has been debunked. It's a separate fund. FEMA has said as much,\" Welker interjected.\n\n\"That's right,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"We should note that FEMA funds were actually redirected on Donald Trump's watch to deal with the migrant issue,\" Welker said.\n\n\"No, no, ma'am. No, wait a minute, hold on, wait a minute. Facts are important,\" Johnson said. \"That is a new program that started in 2020 under Joe Biden . That funding wasn't necessary under Trump's administration because we secured the border. We didn't invite illegal aliens and dangerous people into the country. That's a Biden-Harris policy, and everybody knows it.\"\n\n\"It did happen under Donald Trump's watch,\" Welker said.\n\n\"No, it didn't. No, he did not. That is a brand new account,\" Johnson said.\n\nCongress funded the Shelter and Services Program after voting it into effect last year.

Goldberg witnessed the group discuss sensitive matters regarding U.S. plans to strike the Yemeni-based Houthis. Immediately after the news broke, Trump was urged to fire his national security adviser.\n\n\"Half of them saying he's never going to survive or shouldn't survive,\" a senior administration official told Politico . Two high-level White House aides believe Waltz should be fired to prevent Trump from being put in a \"bad position.\"\n\nThe Washington Examiner spoke to more than a dozen senior administration officials and Trumpworld operatives about Waltz's prospects, with the majority suggesting the national security adviser would face very few, if any, consequences.\n\nTwo senior administration officials directly said Waltz would stay on as national security adviser, with one adding that the \"uproar\" voiced by the Trump resistance was making the president \"[want] to close ranks.\"\n\n\"The president has seen more than his fair share of scandals cooked up by the fake news,\" the second official added. \"This one will blow over. They always do.\"\n\nStill, one Republican strategist with close ties to the White House suggested that Waltz could end up being a \"sacrificial lamb\" should GOP lawmakers begin voicing more criticism of the breach, specifically noting that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe are set to testify before the congressional intelligence committees this week.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt similarly stood by Waltz in a statement that took a shot at Goldberg and the Atlantic .\n\n\"Jeffrey Goldberg is well-known for his sensationalist spin. Here are the facts about his latest story,\" she posted. \"1. No 'war plans' were discussed. 2. No classified material was sent to the thread. 3. The White House Counsel's Office has provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"\n\nPublicly, other Republicans and administration officials are also sticking behind Waltz.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) told Politico that Waltz should \"absolutely not\" resign, saying he has \"full confidence in him.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, one of those in the chat who allegedly shared classified information through the unsecured app, downplayed the matter when asked , targeting Goldberg as a \"deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again.\"\n\n\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" he concluded.\n\nGoldberg said that was a \"lie\" and that detailed war plans were discussed, but he decided not to publish the specifics for fear of endangering American service members.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes confirmed the leak's authenticity on Monday. He told the Washington Examiner , \"This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.\"\n\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG SAYS HEGSETH LIED IN DISMISSING INTELLIGENCE LEAK\n\nVice President JD Vance , Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Ratcliffe, and Gabbard were all in the chat.\n\nThe incident has drawn bipartisan outcry from Congress , with Democrats calling for a prompt congressional investigation."

      "text": "An 'aligned' NBC News has no room for Republican voices\n\nThe abrupt firing of former Republican Party Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel from her brand-new paid contributor gig at NBC News is one of the most instructive episodes of the ideological conformity that plagues the legacy media.\n\nMcDaniel, far from among the most controversial voices in the Republican Party, signed a two-year contract with NBC last week that would pay her $300,000 per year to appear on the network and its affiliates. The hiring prompted an outcry from the ideological monolith that is MSNBC, as on-air hosts used their platforms to bash the network for hiring McDaniel.\n\nIn a statement announcing the network was dropping McDaniel as fast as it had hired her, NBCUniversal News Group Chairman Cesar Conde said that \"no organization, particularly a newsroom, can succeed unless it is cohesive and aligned.\"\n\nFor a newsroom that is supposed to inform voters from across the aisle, the message from Conde to viewers and readers is one of exclusion. The newsroom of NBC News so lacks ideological diversity that the mere prospect of a conservative voice on the network or its affiliates is so offensive that it threatens the company's ability to function.\n\nChuck Todd is not a journalist, Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough are not honest anchors, and Rachel Maddow is not a thoughtful and insightful commentator. They are regime propagandists who do the bidding of an oligarchic corporate class that has created a revolving door between government and corporate media with the goal of furthering the interest of both. All one has to do is look at who the personalities are that NBC has seen fit to hire and charged with filling airtime.\n\nSymone Sanders expertly peddled disinformation on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris for a year before decamping to a golden parachute provided by MSNBC, which gave her a weekend show to parrot Biden administration and Democratic Party talking points. Jen Psaki served as the White House press secretary for the first year and a half of the Biden administration, effortlessly spinning the administration's failures to the world press before she, too, took a cushy job at the regime propaganda network and now hosts a show of her own.\n\nWhile having a slanted network agenda is not at all unusual, the hostility to Republican voices and clear favoritism toward Democrats and \"ex-Republicans\" like Liz Cheney and Michael Steele is. Even Fox News has a long list of Democratic Party operatives who are paid contributors for the network. For NBC and MSNBC, Republican voices can only come on the air if their opinions are approved by the network's neoliberal brain trust. McDaniel's voice, however milquetoast for a Republican it may be, was seen as a threat to the permitted order.\n\nThe most welcome development of McDaniel's ouster is the potential it has to harm NBC's ability to report on Republicans. In their rush to silence McDaniel and mainstream Republican voices on the network, the hosts who publicly trashed their bosses on-air made the lives of their not-so-famous colleagues much more difficult.\n\nAccording to Semafor , political reporters who do not have on-air shows and produce most of the news content that NBC puts out are concerned that NBC's defenestration of McDaniel has severely harmed their relationships with Republican sources.\n\n\"Four NBC News staffers expressed concern that instead of fixing the problem, hiring and then firing McDaniel had only alienated liberal viewers while confirming Republican fears,\" the outlet reported.\n\nWhy any Republican aide or staffer is feeding information to NBC is a question in itself. But if McDaniel's firing leads to a realization that legacy media do not deserve information from conservatives, that should at least be considered a small win.\n\nNevertheless, the viewers of NBC and its affiliates will be poorly served by the company's unwillingness to speak to dissenting voices. And that is a great tragedy that will not be corrected anytime soon."

      "text": "NYT, NBC, NPR, Politico Evicted From Pentagon Press Offices In Favor Of Trump-Friendly Outlets\n\nThe innumerable consequences of the 2024 election keep gushing forth at a pace that's hard to keep up with. Here's a new gem: On Friday evening, the Department of Defense told The New York Times, NBC News, National Public Radio and Politico that they have two weeks to vacate their long-held and treasured offices inside the Pentagon.\n\nThree of their four replacements skew decidedly to the Trump-friendly sector of the political spectrum: the New York Post, One America News Network and Breitbart. Throwing a bone to leftists, HuffPost news snagged Politico's old slot. The Pentagon Press Association said it was \"greatly troubled by this unprecedented move by DOD to single out highly professional media.\"\n\nThe short-notice evictions from the hallowed \"Correspondents' Corridor\" spring from the launch of a \"new annual media rotation program for [the] Pentagon Press Corps,\" according to a memorandum sent by DOD spokesman John Ullyot on Friday and posted by CNN Pentagon correspondent Haley Britzky. The program seeks to \"broaden access to the limited space...to outlets that have not previously enjoyed the privilege and journalist value of working from physical office space in the Pentagon,\" said Ullyot.\n\nThe booted outlets will retain their status as full members of the Pentagon Press Corps, entitled to attend briefings and be considered for travel with officials. \"The only change will be giving up their physical workspaces in the building to allow new outlets to have their turn to become resident members of the Pentagon Press Corps,\" wrote Ullyot.\n\nMake no mistake: Those physical workspaces are a big deal. \"Kicking out reporters HURTS coverage. If you can't file your stories from inside the building you are disadvantaged. If you don't have a work space you are disadvantaged,\" wrote former Pentagon Press Corps VP Kevin Baron on X. That commentary was part of a thread condemning the development as \"the erasure of journalism at the Pentagon.\"\n\nThe Pentagon Press Corps comprises more than two dozen outlets. The program calls for one outlet from each press medium to rotate from the premises every year. As if Breitbart's invitation into the Pentagon weren't enough to outrage establishment media types, the fact that it's taking the \"radio\" slot from NPR only compounded the indignation. In a Friday night article, CNN's Brian Stelter called foul:\n\n\"Breitbart - a well-known web site for pro-Trump coverage and commentary - barely has a radio operation of its own. The word 'radio' doesn't appear on its home page at all. The media outlet has a distribution deal with SiriusXM and one big podcast, Breitbart News Daily. Its footprint pales in comparison to NPR, which provides news coverage for local stations all across the country.\"\n\nIn another hilarious, leftist-pummeling swap, One America News Network will be sliding into NBC's slot . Expressing sympathetic disbelief, CNN's Britzky emphasized that NBC \"has an entire booth w/ cameras etc.\" NBC News promised to soldier on, telling Reuters ,\n\n\"We're disappointed by the decision to deny us access to a broadcasting booth at the Pentagon that we've used for many decades. Despite the significant obstacles this presents to our ability to gather and report news in the national public interest, we will continue to report with the same integrity and rigor NBC News always has.\"\n\nFor the many Americans who are still angry about legacy media's aggressive role in working to derail Trump's 2020 re-election bid, Politico's punishment is perhaps the most satisfying . The outlet took the lead in spreading the consequential, Deep State lie that Hunter Biden's \"laptop from hell\" -- first reported by the New York Post -- was part of a Russian misinformation scheme. That lie helped ignite unprecedented censorship of the Post's coverage. Fittingly, the Post -- the country's longest-running newspaper -- is among the outlets graduating to space in the Pentagon.\n\n\"The National Press Club is deeply concerned by the Defense Department's decision to remove certain media organizations from their dedicated spaces in the Pentagon,\" club president Mike Balsamo said in a statement . \"Any action that restricts the ability of journalists to report on the operations of the U.S. government should alarm all who value transparency and press freedom .\" Balsamo pointed to the Pentagon press corps' history of \"diversity,\" yet the announced swaps inarguably increase viewpoint diversity.\n\nThe Pentagon's shot across the bow of legacy media follows Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt's announcement that the White House will significantly broaden media access, with an emphasis on alternative media. \"The Trump White House will speak to all media outlets and personalities , not just the legacy media that are seated in this room,\" she said in her first press conference.\n\nNever a dull moment in Trump II: The Revenge.

      "text": "Dems' Approval Collapses 20 Points In 4 Years As Trump Posts Career-High\n\nDespite all the leftist and mainstream media wailing and gnashing of teeth about the new administration, fresh polling from two major mainstream news outlets paints a truly bleak picture for Democrats and a relatively rosy one for President Trump .\n\nIn the most striking read on the pulse of America, the Democratic Party's favorability rating has collapsed by a whopping 20 percentage points in just four years, and now stands at just 29% , according to CNN. That's the lowest in the history of CNN's poll , which goes back to 1992. NBC News had a similar reading: 27% positive against 55% negative. \"In more than 30 years of this poll, we've never seen either party hit a number this low, in terms of negatives,\" said NBC's Steve Kornacki.\n\nWhile it's different in degree, the dissatisfaction extends to Democrats themselves . Only 63% of Democrats and Dem-leaning independents view their own party favorably, and 52% say leaders are taking the party in the wrong direction. That compares to 79% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who give a thumbs-up to the GOP.\n\nThe sense that the Democratic Party is adrift is further reinforced by Democrats' lack of any consensus whatsoever about who \"best reflects the core values\" of the party . More than 30% drew a complete blank, while the top three people named by respondents were Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (10%), failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris (9%) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (8%).\n\nLike I said, the Democrats have a problem. - New NBC News poll: Democratic Party hits record polling low Just 7% of registered voters have a \"very\" positive of the Democrat Party, 27% say they have \"positive\" views of the party Trump has 47% job approval rating, up 7 points... https://t.co/wCHStJ69iS pic.twitter.com/idYm0iA27U\n\nReadings for Republicans are much better. With the GOP now in control of the White House, Senate and House of Represntatives, NBC News found 44% of registered voters think America is heading in the right direction -- the highest it's been since early 2004 .\n\nAs Democrats hit a record-low in approval rating, Trump his tied his career-high approval rating , with 47% of registered voters content with his performance. That still leaves him with a net-negative, as 51% disapprove. That's lower than any of his four predecessors at this point in their terms, but higher than the 40% approval rating Trump posted in 2017. Then, only 50% of Republicans viewed Trump \"very positively.\" That number has soared to 74% in this month's NBC poll.\n\nAmericans are coming around to Trump's approach to handling border security and immigration, with 55% approving and 43% disapproving. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has a net-positive approval rating, with 46% saying it's a \"good idea\" compared to 40% who say it's a \"bad idea.\" There's a major split about the future of DOGE : 33% say there's \"much more to be done\" while 33% say it's \"reckless and should stop now.\" Elon Musk has a 51% negative-feelings rate, compared to 39% who feel positive about him.\n\nIn a major departure from all of his previous readings, Trump is in the red on his handling of the economy (54% disapprove, 44% approve) and the cost of living (55% disapprove, 42% approve). An overwhelming 82% of voters say the state of the economy is fair or poor, with just 18% calling it excellent. Trump is likewise underwater on foreign policy and the Russia/Ukraine war.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Trump Says Government Likely Won't Be Using Signal After The Atlantic Fallout\n\nAuthored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on March 25 that government officials likely will not be using the Signal messaging app after The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief was inadvertently included in a group chat with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and national security adviser Mike Waltz.\n\nWhen asked about the Signal chat during remarks at the White House on March 25, Trump said: \"A lot of times you find out defects by exactly things like that, but I don't think it's something we're looking forward to using again.\n\n\" We may be forced to use it. You may be in a situation where you need speed as opposed to gross safety, and you may be forced to use it, but generally speaking, I think we probably won't be using it very much .\"\n\nThe fallout came after Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, alleged that he saw a discussion between Hegseth and other officials take place in a group chat he was added to in the Signal messaging app hours before strikes against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen ordered by Trump earlier this month.\n\nThe National Security Council has since said the text chain Goldberg reported \"appears to be authentic\" and that it is looking into how a journalist's number was added to the chain.\n\nHegseth spoke to reporters in Hawaii on March 24 and disputed Goldberg's account, insisting that no war plans were texted in the chat. He also raised questions about Goldberg's credibility. Goldberg, who published an article in The Atlantic about the group chat, later told MSNBC that his article was based on what he saw in the Signal chat. He accused Hegseth of trying to deflect from the allegations.\n\nSignal uses end-to-end encryption for its messaging and calling services, which prevents any third party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. It is considered a popular app for direct messaging, group chats, phone calls, and video calls.\n\nWhen asked about the use of the chat app, Trump said he \"wasn't involved\" but only \"heard about it.\"\n\n\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups,\" he said. \"It's used by the media a lot. It's used by a lot of the military and, I think, successfully, but sometimes somebody can get onto those things.\n\n\" That's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones on, which is always the best, frankly ... the best is to be there. \"\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump told NBC News that Waltz or a member of his staff had added Goldberg to the chat but defended his national security adviser. He echoed those comments during his remarks in the White House on March 25 and said Waltz does not need to apologize. He suggested that news outlets' response to the reports has been overblown.\n\n\" They've made a big deal out of this because we've had two perfect months ,\" Trump said, pivoting to the economy and policies he has initiated since taking office in January. \"We're bringing in business; we have another one announced tomorrow.\"\n\nAfter the recent reports, the president of Signal defended the app, although she did not directly address The Atlantic article.\n\n\"Signal is the gold standard in private comms,\" Signal President Meredith Whittaker wrote in a post on social media platform X in response to a report that compared Signal to WhatsApp. She attempted to differentiate Signal from WhatsApp, which is owned by Meta Platforms.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

Roosevelt was elected four consecutive times. Roosevelt was the only president in U.S. history to be elected to either a third or fourth term.\n\nDays after Trump took office in January, Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) proposed an amendment to the Constitution that could allow presidents to be elected for three terms. However, amending the Constitution would require two-thirds of Congress members to vote for its approval, which would then have to be ratified by three-fourths of state Legislatures.\n\nA reporter just asked President Trump about a third term. Trump: We've got a long way to go-almost four years-but despite that, so many people are saying, 'You've got to run again.' Most importantly, they love the job we're doing. pic.twitter.com/afAXJiDABD\n\nExplaining why he would want to seek a third term, Trump said that, \" You have to start by saying, I have the highest poll numbers of any Republican for the last 100 years.\"\n\n\"We're in the high 70s in many polls, in the real polls, and you see that. And, and you know, we're very popular,\" Trump said.\n\nWhen asked about how he could be elected to a third term, Trump told NBC News there might be ways to do so.\n\nNBC's Kristen Welker then provided him with a hypothetical situation: \"Well, let me throw out one where President Vance would run for office and then would, basically ... if he won, at the top of the ticket, would then pass the baton to you.\"\n\nIn response, Trump said, \"Well, that's one. But there are others, too. There are others.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me another?\" Welker asked Trump. \"No,\" he said.\n\nThe 12th Amendment, which was ratified in 1804, says that \"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\"\n\nAlso in the interview, Trump was asked about why he wants to continue to be president, which Welker described is \"the toughest job in the country.\"\n\n\"Well, I like working,\" replied Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his current term.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n*  *  *\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

This is the only further statement I will make to you.\"\n\nAn affidavit containing the allegation was delivered to Senators on Tuesday, the receipt of which came after Senate Armed Services Committee staffers were in contact with the ex-sister-in-law for several days.\n\nAnd who was it fed to?

This is so wasteful! I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies. Let's rip the waste out of our great nations budget, even if it's a penny at a time ,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social .\n\nTrump is entirely correct about the rising costs associated with coin production. Last year, the US Mint's annual report revealed that it costs 3.69 cents to produce and distribute a penny , resulting in a loss of 2.69 cents per coin for the federal government .\n\nAs of last year, about 250 billion pennies were in circulation in the US, equivalent to about 700 per person.\n\nThe US Mint's total loss on the year for pennies was about $85.3 million .\n\nDon't tell Trump and the DOGE team, but the nickel costs about double its face value to produce and distribute.\n\nIn 2011, Kyle Bass recognized that the metal in a nickel coin was worth well above its face value. He stated then, \"I just bought a million dollars' worth of them.\"\n\nRegarding the legal authority surrounding currencies, Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution indicates: \"The Congress shall have power ... to coin money [and] regulate the value thereof.\"\n\nHowever, Robert K. Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University, told NBC News that the president may have some wiggle room.\n\n\"The process of discontinuing the penny in the US is a little unclear. It would likely require an act of Congress, but the Secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,\" Triest explained.\n\nCost-cutting measures by Trump and DOGE are part of a mandate a majority of Americans gave the president for his second term in office, already winding down a few rogue federal agencies and eliminating thousands of bureaucrats from office.\n\nBack to coins: Australia withdrew its one- and two-cent coins from circulation in 1992, while Canada ceased penny production in 2012.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Maddow Hit With $5 Million Pay-Cut As Musk, Trump Jr Joke About Buying MSNBC\n\nThe left-wing cable news channel MSNBC has reportedly cut the salary of one of its top hosts, Rachel Maddow, by a staggering $5 million as the network suffers from ongoing financial problems and a steep decline in ratings.\n\nAs reported by the New York Post , Maddow saw her salary fall from $30 million to $25 million during her contract renegotiations this month. Her show, \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" airs weekly on Mondays. Her show has been highlighted as one of the few on the network that is still doing well with viewership in the weeks since the 2024 election.\n\n\"This is a difficult time and they needed to keep her,\" said one anonymous executive. \"No one else can do what she does. You can't build a brand like it overnight.\"\n\nAs Eric Lendrum writes at American Greatness, the report comes after the news that MSNBC's parent company Comcast has decided to spin off all of its cable news channels by the end of 2025 , as the cable news sector struggles to earn money in comparison to Comcast's other properties. As such, MSNBC will be split off from NBC News, a move that could force MSNBC to change its name, logo, and headquarters, as well as lay off many employees.\n\nAs part of Maddow's new deal, she will be allowed to continue producing podcasts and documentaries in addition to her weekly show every Monday. She will also be utilized for breaking news segments during other shows, due to her popularity with MSNBC's shrinking audience.\n\nIn the period of just over two weeks since the 2024 election on November 5th, MSNBC's ratings have plunged by 54%. Their Nielsen ratings are down 40% year-over-year.\n\n\"We were so Harris propaganda that when she lost, viewers were shocked,\" said one anonymous MSNBC commentator.\n\n\"It turned into one giant echo chamber. If MSNBC wants to be of service to its viewers, they can't keep them in fantasy land.\"\n\nBut the story has a risible ending, as Donald Trump Jr. and Tesla owner Elon Musk joked around on social media about potentially purchasing MSNBC.\n\n\"Hey @elonmusk I have the funniest idea ever!!!\" Trump Jr. tweeted in response to the news of Comcast spinning off its news units (including MSNBC) .\n\n\"How much does it cost?\" Musk said in response .\n\nLater Musk said that the outcome would be very \"entertaining\" if he actually purchased the outlet .\n\nPopular podcaster Joe Rogan later chimed into the banter, saying he would like to replace news host Rachel Maddow.\n\n\"If you buy MSNBC I would like Rachael [sic] Maddow's job. I will wear the same outfit and glasses, and I will tell the same lies,\" Rogan said .\n\n\"Deal,\" Musk responded .\n\nThe market sees a 17% chance that Musk might buy MSNBC...\n\nElsewhere on MSNBC, \"Morning Joe\" co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski have faced backlash from the far-left for their recent decision to meet with President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nThey expressed an interest in restoring communications with the 45th and soon-to-be 47th President, even despite their ideological disagreements.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "MSNBC Delicately Plots Its Post-Joy Reid Future The network wants to prove it can do real journalism.\n\nF inally free of the scandal-making presence that was host Joy Reid - and rid of the blandly woke Alex Wagner - MSNBC is trying distance itself from the progressive extremism that has defined it for years.\n\nThis month, new president Rebecca Kutler announced the appointment of Scott Matthews, the news director at New York's WABC-TV, to lead a newly established journalism operation. MSNBC is hiring over 100 journalists to work under Matthews.\n\nThe new journalism operation is being formed as MSNBC is spun off from Comcast into a separate company. MSNBC has long relied on NBC News for its news gathering, but that arrangement will likely cease later this year when MSNBC is separated from Comcast.\n\nMany have predicted that, without the assistance of NBC News' journalism, MNSBC would simply fully focus on the progressive opinion content that has defined it for years. Evidently, MSNBC wants to defy those expectations. Its executives have decided that progressive talk shows with no journalistic backbone would be a poor business decision amid a conservative ascendancy.\n\nIn announcing Matthews' new role, Kutler focused on how he would significantly increase MSNBC's journalistic output. Kutler wrote, \"Scott's new role reflects our plans to build out MSNBC's domestic, Washington and international newsgathering operations and expand our presence in the field.\"\n\nThe decision to fire Reid was already a signal that executives wanted to move on from being seen as an extremist network. Reid's show created a scandal for the network with each passing week. This usually related to Reid's pervasive race obsession and opposition to Israel's effort to defend itself. (On race, Reid once said white Christians \"see themselves as the rightful inheritors of this country.\" On the war between Israel and Hamas, Reid stated , \"How does bombing a densely populated land strip filled 50 percent with children constitute self-dense?\")\n\nThe reassignment of Alex Wagner, who hosted a forgettable show in the 9 p.m. slot for several years, also signaled that MSNBC's executives wanted to go in a new direction. Wagner epitomized the woke progressivism that Americans are sick of and that sunk Kamala Harris' chances in the presidential race. The first week that she hosted her show, Wagner traveled to Florida to report on \"Christian nationalism\" and she framed Gov. Ron DeSantis' policies - such as requiring age-appropriate lessons on issues of gender and sexuality in elementary schools - as an affront to LGBTQ rights. In addition, Wagner also denounced laws aimed at keeping boys out of girls' sports as \"anti-trans.\" To top it all off, she held radically progressive views on Israel and seemed to suggest the anti-Israel campus protests were having a positive impact by making Americans question U.S. support for Israel.\n\nAlso on the chopping block this year at MSNBC have been hosts Katie Phang and José Díaz-Balart, both low performers for the network who were possibly kept on out of fear that critics would cry racism if they were removed.\n\nAnd, indeed, cry racism they did indeed.\n\nKeith Olbermann, who previously hosted a show on MSNBC, called the firings \"an MSNBC purge so brutally racist it makes you think it was done by Musk.\"\n\nRachel Maddow, who is hosting the network's 9 p.m. slot Monday through Friday for the first 100 days of the Trump administration, went so far as to denounce the firings on air, saying, \"Personally, I think it is a bad mistake to let [Reid] walk out the door. It is not my call, and I understand that. But that's what I think.\" She pointed out the races of the fired hosts, saying, \"It is also unnerving to see that on a network where we have two - count 'em - two nonwhite hosts in prime time, both of our nonwhite hosts in prime time are losing their shows, as is Katie Phang on the weekend.\"\n\nThe network is trying to move on. In a major win, Kutler brought Eugene Daniels on full-time as her first significant hire. Daniels was formerly White House correspondent for Politico , where he developed a record of major scoops. His hiring signals MSNBC's intention to focus on breaking news. MSNBC has also announced that Washington Post columnists Catherine Rampell and Jonathan Capehart will join Daniels on his new show, giving the appearance (at least) of intellectual substance. MSNBC also announced the hiring of Jacqueline Alemany, a White House reporter for the Washington Post . In contrast, Alex Wagner never wrote all that much on her own apart from a few articles a year for the Atlantic .\n\nWhile MSNBC has no plans to abandon its left-wing identity, the network's effort to build a newsroom indicates at least a desire to distance itself from the extreme left.\n\nThat will be hard for most Americans to believe - particularly given that Rachel Maddow, who will continue to host her show once a week for a salary of $25 million a year once Trump's first 100 days are up, is still the network's face. That's a sum that could hire a substantial number of journalists.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit... Read More\n\nIt's been a busy few weeks for Bernie Sanders, traveling...

      "text": "At MSNBC, Rising Tensions Fuel Fears of Collapse The network has lost half of its viewership and is being spun off into a separate company.\n\nM SNBC's postelection viewership decline has surpassed its executives' worst fears. Several top shows have lost more than half of their viewers since Nov. 5. This includes Rachel Maddow's flagship show, as well as Joy Reid's ReidOut , The 11th Hour with Stephanie Ruhle , All In with Chris Hayes , and Inside with Jen Psaki . Morning Joe has suffered a fate nearly as bad, with hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough losing over 400,000 viewers in the same period.\n\nIn total, MSNBC averaged more than one million viewers during election week, but that number fell to just above half a million two weeks ago. This decline comes even as Fox News is scoring huge ratings, as viewership jumped 21 percent at the network following Trump's win. (RELATED: MSNBC's Attacks on Pete Hegseth Are Not About Trump - It's About Fox News )\n\nThe collapse in viewership alone would be enough to induce panic among MSNBC staffers, but tensions have escalated even more following Comcast's Nov. 20 announcement that it will spin off MSNBC and other channels, including CNBC, USA, Oxygen, and E!, into a separate company. Staffers are fretting that this will decimate the network's journalistic reputability given that MSNBC's relationship with NBC News provides it with a significant proportion of its journalistic resources. For instance, MSNBC utilizes NBC's news bureaus and foreign correspondents to supplement its more opinion-focused staff. Without these resources, MSNBC would be pared back to hosts reading from a teleprompter in New York City or moderating roundtable discussions.\n\nStaffers fear that the spinoff will result in layoffs, lower pay, and potentially even a sale. Under the current arrangement, NBCUniversal cable channels generate only 5.7 percent of Comcast's current revenue, and the declining value of cable TV makes these channels even less appealing. By reorganizing the networks into a standalone company, Comcast may be positioning itself to offload this undesirable segment of its business. It also appears that MSNBC has overly high expenses. Most notably, Rachel Maddow just signed a contract to receive $25 million a year even though she only hosts her show once a week.\n\nLast week, the Washington Post interviewed a number of MSNBC staffers who voiced fears over the network's future. \"We're going to become a guest-driven, fully opinion operation that doesn't even have the appearance of being a news-driven operation,\" worried one MSNBC staffer to the Post . What went unsaid in that staffer's comment is that MSNBC has been steadily cementing its status as a progressive opinion outlet for years, with news programming slowly being replaced by opinion-driven shows. Earlier this year, it seemed that this shift had been successful, as MSNBC had consistently outperformed CNN to stand only behind Fox News in cable news ratings.\n\nThere was even a time when Comcast executives intervened when the ideology went too far. According to the New York Times , Comcast \"took the rare step of conveying its concern\" after MSNBC trotted out guests in the midst of the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack to say that the attacks were the result of Israeli policies. Some on the network also refused to refer to the Hamas invaders as \"terrorists.\" The network subsequently removed three hosts, Ayman Mohyeldin, Mehdi Hasan, and Ali Velshi, from its lineup, but denied that their opinions were the reason for the removal.\n\nIn recent days, MSNBC has been beset by two controversies that show the divisions tearing the already crumbling network apart.\n\nFirst, it emerged that Al Sharpton, who hosts his own show on MSNBC and appears on a number of its programs, had failed to disclose that his nonprofit, the National Action Network, had received $500,000 from Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign before he interviewed her during the presidential campaign on MSNBC. The outlet has continued to feature Sharpton on its shows and has said that it was unaware of the donation. But this decision has riled up staffers who feel the lack of reaction to Sharpton's breach of journalistic ethics damages the network's credibility. According to Fox News , MSNBC colleagues are \"buzzing about the ordeal.\" One MSNBC staffer told Fox News, \"There's a sense of like, 'Ugh, we don't need this. This feels kind of grifty and gross.'\" The staffer continued, \"That kind of money should not be changing hands to people who are cosplaying being a journalist.\"\n\nSecond, Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski received backlash from viewers after they traveled to Mar-a-Lago for a meeting with Donald Trump in order to \"restart communications.\" Scarborough sought to assure viewers that their engagement with the president-elect did not mean they were condoning any of his actions. \"Don't be mistaken,\" he said . \"We are not here to defend or normalize Donald Trump. We are here to report on him and to hopefully provide you insights that are going to better equip all of us in understanding these deeply unsettling times.\" But viewers protested the show after the visit, seeing it as a capitulation made out of fear after years of the pair portraying Trump as a fascist.\n\nInside the network, the hosts' discussion with the Republican president-elect reportedly set off a firestorm of angst. According to the U.S. Sun , one MSNBC journalist said that the \"Trump visit had created a very tense situation,\" with some at the network feeling that they had been \"stabbed in the back.\" The source went on to say that hosts Rachel Maddow, Chris Hayes, and Eri Melber were in particular inflamed about the situation. Meanwhile, MSNBC host Katie Phang publicly stated , \"Normalizing Trump is a bad idea.\"\n\nEven as MSNBC continues to struggle with plummeting viewership, internal discord, and questions about its journalistic integrity - or lack thereof - some executives remain hopeful that a second \"Trump bump\" will return when the former president retakes office come January. Yet there remains a scenario in which the network continues to fall further into irrelevance as its progressive elitism becomes increasingly detached from the common American experience and cable news is increasingly supplanted by independent media. In that case, Comcast could sell MSNBC off to a progressive billionaire who could cement the network's role as a mouthpiece for the Left, abandoning any remaining efforts at journalism and neutrality, but possibly further decreasing its relevance. Or Elon Musk, the world's richest man, could buy the network, as he has suggested , and transform it as he did Twitter. Whatever the case, MSNBC will remain in turmoil.\n\nEllie Gardey Holmes is the author of Newsom Unleashed: The Progressive Lust for Unbridled Power .\n\nREAD MORE from Ellie Gardey Holmes:\n\nIs the Transgender Movement Really Backing Down?\n\nDEI Proponents at the University of Michigan Are Panicking but Refusing to Budge\n\nNewsom Trades Sacramento for $9 Million Luxury Living\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

She reportedly looks to deliver a speech, hopefully conceding defeat and offering a congratulations, at 4 p.m. to the man she labeled a \"fascist\" just a few days ago.\n\nNBC News, which seemed a campaign auxiliary at times, claims both Harris and President Joe Biden plan to call Trump to offer congratulations. But the article noting that the congratulations come in the future implicitly admits that neither politician has bothered to call Trump at this point. Even a prank call would be better than this sore-loser silence.\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton at least displayed conciliation by wearing purple and concede defeat the next morning. This followed , apparently, an uneasy night of object-throwing and creative use of all the four-letter words in the dictionary (and a few not yet found there).\n\n\"Sources have told The American Spectator that on Tuesday night, after Hillary realized she had lost, she went into a rage,\" R. Emmett Tyrrell reported . \"Secret Service officers told at least one source that she began yelling, screaming obscenities, and pounding furniture. She picked up objects and threw them at attendants and staff. She was in an uncontrollable rage.\"\n\nJohn Podesta told supporters that they needed to count all the votes. But one could count all the tears from her supporters to see the end credits.\n\nDitto for the tears at Howard University last night. The networks kept refusing to call various states as the images they displayed showed Harris supporters conceding with their tears. Even when a CNN reporter told a stunned Jake Tapper and John King on the air that Georgia officials reported just 100,000 votes left to count as Trump held a 118,000-vote lead, the network took its time to call that state.\n\nHarris' cheerleaders put it off.

The masochistic Fourth Estate repaid her by alternating coverage between massage and smooch settings. And today they tell us she lost not because of anything she did or did not do but instead because racism and sexism plagues American voters.\n\nHopefully, for both the sake of the country and her political future, she offers a more gracious congratulations to the victors.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Californians Could Seriously Benefit From DOGE in 'Trump-Proofed' California Gov. Newsom's quest to reform-proof the state that needs reform the most.\n\nC alifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has set out to \" Trump-proof\" California , but in one sense he's too late. According to NBC News, 38.3 percent of Californians voted for Trump, by some accounts 40 percent , so as people across the country should know, Newsom's crusade must involve something else. (RELATED: California Voters Reject 'California Values' )\n\nPresident-elect Trump has placed entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked to slim down the bloated government. Californians can easily find state agencies that should be eliminated, such as the Coastal Commission. (RELATED: Restoring the California Dream )\n\nThe unelected commissioners recently made news by opposing an increase in Musk's SpaceX launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County. This was due not to environmental concerns but Musk's participation in the election. Newsom said \"I'm with Elon,\" but the commissioners, some appointed by the governor, are \" friends of mine .\"\n\nIn 2022, the governor's friends rejected a desalination plant that would have provided arid Orange County with 50 million gallons of fresh water a day. Commissioner Dayna Bochco, president of Steven Bochco Productions explained that \"the ocean is under attack from climate change already.\" A CCC commissioner since 2011 , Bochco was reappointed last year.\n\nThe Commission overrides scores of elected city and government officials, all fully capable of handling their own affairs, and runs roughshod over property rights. No governor, including Republicans George Deukmejian, Pete Wilson, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, has attempted to eliminate the CCC, hardly the state's only wasteful body.\n\nBefore they reach students in the classroom, Californians' tax dollars must trickle down through multiple layers of bureaucratic sediment. These include the 58 county offices of education, which serve as \"support systems for their local school districts and as liaisons for the state .\" Like the local districts, the county offices employ superintendents, who absorb huge amounts of taxpayer dollars.\n\nAccording to Transparent California, Los Angeles County Office of Education Superintendent Debra Duardo bags an annual pay package of $508,402 , more than the president of the United States and more than double Newsom's $201,553 . Deputy County Superintendent Maria Martinez Poulin pulls down $343,887, and \"education officer\" Maricela Ramirez is not far behind at $340,458.\n\nIn the Sacramento County office, Superintendent David Gordon draws a total pay of $447,287 and Deputy Superintendent Masami Herota gets $324,921. This is for services that could easily be performed by the local school districts, whose non-teaching officials are also overpaid.\n\nFor example, the Ontario-Montclair school district pays Superintendent Phillip Hammond a stunning $743,596 , empowered by a \" series of opaque perks \" that make Hammond the state's highest-paid administrator. Chief business official Phillip Hillman bags a not-too-shabby $350,619.\n\nBureaucratic bloat is also evident in the state's tax system.\n\nThe Franchise Tax Board (FTB), the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA), and the State Board of Equalization (SBE) are all responsible for the collection of taxes in some form. So is California's Employment Development Department (EDD) \" one of the largest tax collection agencies in the nation ,\" collecting more than $81 billion in payroll taxes in 2018-19 alone. How this revenue is spent is another matter.\n\nUnder the supervision of Julie Su, California's Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) boss, the EDD was responsible for $30 billion in unemployment fraud , with convicts and out-of-state fraudsters alike cashing in. Despite that record, Su was the Biden-Harris administration's choice for Labor secretary, never confirmed by the Senate but still in power at this writing.\n\nIf Californians believed that four tax agencies are too many it would be hard to blame them. In a similar style, eliminating the costly county offices of education could help more tax dollars to reach students in the classroom.\n\nOver in Washington, the federal Department of Education was a payoff to the teacher unions that supported Jimmy Carter for president in 1976. As the 1983 A Nation at Risk report confirmed, the new department did nothing to improve student achievement. Musk and Ramaswamy have a strong case to eliminate the department, one of many expensive and counterproductive bureaucracies.\n\nNothing of the sort is going on in California, and people across the nation should not be fooled. Newsom's push to \"Trump-proof\" California is an effort to reform-proof the state that needs reform the most.\n\nLloyd Billingsley is a policy fellow at the Independent Institute in Oakland, Calif.\n\nREAD MORE from Lloyd Billingsley:\n\nThe Golden State Unleashes the Anonymous Snoop Dogs\n\nUniversity of California at Planned Parenthood\n\nOh Say Can UC?\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

Roughly 18 people were left injured as a result of the plane crash at the Toronto airport, according to CTV News.\n\n\"In terms of the recent string of aviation incidents, Tom, this is going to yet again, raise the concern about FAA staffing - air traffic control staffing,\" Costello said. \"Now, this is a Canadian air traffic control tower and this is under Canadian authority - once it crosses the border and yet, as you know, there has been this talk of maybe staff cuts at the FAA as apart of President Trump's effort to trim down the federal workforce.\"\n\nThe Trump administration recently started \"firing hundreds of employees\" at the FAA, with the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists (PASS) union saying that \"several hundred\" probationary workers had \" received termination notices on Friday,\" according to the Guardian:\n\nMany of the workers were probationary employees, those employed for less than a year and lacking job protections, which make them low-hanging fruit for the Trump administration's streamlining efforts.\n\n\"And, yet, as you also know, the FAA has been complaining for years that they are understaffed in critical job positions, especially air traffic control,\" Costello said, adding that he had spoken with somebody regarding \"whether air traffic control in America is being affected by the staff cuts.\"\n\nThe plane crash at the Toronto Pearson Airport comes after a U.S. Army Black Hawk Helicopter collided with American Airlines Flight 5342 near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in January, leaving 67 people dead.\n\nDays later, a medical plane with six passengers onboard crashed in Philadelphia. As a result of the crash, seven people were left dead, according to CBS News.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

NBC News noted that \"he has been the principal anchor\" there \"for almost 15 years.\"\n\n\"A smile comes to my face when I think that with Nightly News, and Dateline, I have now anchored two of the most successful and iconic television news programs in broadcast history,\" Holt wrote in a memo to staffers.\n\n\"As a 20-year-old radio reporter on the police beat chasing breaking news around San Francisco, I could never have imagined my career path would unfold in the way it has,\" he continued. \"What an amazing ride.\"\n\nNBC News executive VP Janelle Rodriguez wrote in a memo to staff that Holt - \"the beating heart of this news organization\" - has \"earned deep respect and reverence from our newsroom, industry colleagues and, most importantly, viewers.\"\n\n\"What's equally remarkable is how Lester has masterfully filled this esteemed role with extraordinary grace and humility,\" she continued. \"He's proven time and time again why he stands among the great legends of broadcast news.\"\n\nHolt reportedly told Dateline staff that he plans on \"expanding my footprint on the broadcast and crafting 'Dateline' hours on subjects I care deeply about.\"\n\n\"I am thrilled to be able to work more closely with my enormously talented friends at Dateline as the broadcast continues to grow and attract new viewers in new places,\" he continued.\n\nIt remains unclear who will take Holt's place on NBC Nightly News .\n\nWATCH - President Trump: AP Has Been \"Very Wrong\" on Covering Me, Conservatives:\n\nThis comes on the heels of other establishment media changes catching attention, including the cancellation of Joy Reid's MSNBC show, The ReidOut .\n\n\"Lowlife Chairman of 'Concast,' Brian Roberts, the owner of Ratings Challenged NBC and MSDNC, has finally gotten the nerve up to fire one of the least talented people in television, the mentally obnoxious racist, Joy Reid,\" President Donald Trump said in reaction to the news, continuing:\n\nBased on her ratings, which were virtually non-existent, she should have been \"canned\" long ago, along with everyone else who works there. Also thrown out was Alex Wagner, the sub on the seriously failing Rachel Maddow show. Rachel rarely shows up because she knows there's nobody watching, and she also knows that she's got less television persona than virtually anyone on television except, perhaps, Joy Reid. Then there's, of course, the LOW IQ Con Man, Al Sharpton, who has, perhaps, the lowest TV ratings in the history of television. What is he doing to Brian Roberts to stay on the air? This whole corrupt operation is nothing more than an illegal arm of the Democrat Party. They should be forced to pay vast sums of money for the damage they've done to our Country.

      "text": "Trump says 'not joking' about possible third term as president\n\nDonald Trump on Sunday repeated his suggestion he might seek a third term as president, which would defy the two-term limit stipulated in the US Constitution.\n\nIn a Sunday morning phone call with NBC News, Trump said \"I'm not joking,\" when asked to clarify a remark on seeking another term, adding: \"There are methods which you could do it.\"\n\nThe 78-year-old billionaire has a long history of suggesting he might serve more than two terms, but Sunday's remarks - followed by comments to reporters aboard Air Force One - were the most concrete in terms of referring to plans in place to achieve the goal.\n\nTrump has launched his second presidency with an unprecedented demonstration of executive power, using the world's richest man Elon Musk to dismantle swaths of the government, and said his supporters want even more.\n\n\"We have almost four years to go and that's a long time but despite that so many people are saying you've got to run again. They love the job we're doing,\" Trump said Sunday aboard the presidential jet, apparently referring to his political allies and supporters.\n\nTrump appeared to wave off a reporter's question about whether he is planning not to leave office on January 20, 2029, the next Inauguration Day, saying: \"I'm not looking at that, but I'll tell you, I have had more people ask me to have a third term.\"\n\nEarlier in the day Trump told NBC he had been presented with plans that would allow him to seek reelection.\n\nWhen the network asked Trump of a possible scenario whereby Vice President JD Vance would run for president and then abdicate the role to Trump, the president said \"that's one\" method.\n\nHe added that \"there are others,\" but refused to share further details.\n\nAmending the US Constitution to allow a third presidential term would require a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and Senate, which Trump's Republican Party does not have, or a constitutional convention called by two thirds of the states that would propose changes to the charter.\n\nBoth routes appear to be unlikely, given the current number of states and Congressional seats under Republican control.\n\nWhether he goes through Congress or the states, he would then require ratification from three-quarters of all state legislatures.\n\nA constitutional convention has never been successfully called in the United States, where all 27 constitutional amendments have been passed by the congressional method.\n\nIn January, days after Trump took office, Republican Andy Ogles of Tennessee introduced a House joint resolution to amend the constitution to allow presidents up to three terms.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

He's also essentially the lead anchor for the NBC News Now streaming service, hosting the one-hour \"Top Story\" show.\n\nHolt said last week that he was stepping down from \"Nightly News\" after a decade. He plans to stay at the network to work at \"Dateline NBC.\"\n\n\"Tom has the winning combination of journalistic excellence, passionate storytelling and unyielding integrity - all characteristics that have long been trademarks of NBC `Nightly News,' said Janelle Rodriguez, NBC News' executive vice president of programming.\n\nThat leaves ABC's David Muir as the longest-serving evening news anchor at \"World News Tonight,\" as well as the ratings leader. CBS News earlier this year replaced Norah O'Donnell with the team of John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois.\n\nWhile news is a far different environment from the days Walter Cronkite was beamed into millions of homes at dinnertime, the ABC, CBS and NBC newscasts collectively reach more than 10 million viewers a night. The anchors are generally considered the face of the broadcast news divisions.\n\nLlamas will be the first to take that role while retaining his job on the streaming service.

Democrats find themselves adrift, casting about for a compelling messenger,\" the report reads. \" Whoever that is, it's not Biden, many party activists and donors contend. He's tethered to the 2024 defeat and, at 82, is a symbol more of the party's past than its future, they argue.\"\n\nA major Biden supporter who spoke to the outlet on condition of anonymity remarked: \"Who's going to want Joe Biden back in the game?\"\n\nA person close to former first lady Jill Biden told the outlet she and her husband are settling into life in Delaware and that she is also prepared to campaign and raise funds for Democrats. Each of the Bidens has plans to write a book - Joe Biden is working on a theme for his memoir and \"has been consulting former senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior White House advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti,\" according to the report.\n\nThe former president has been back and forth between his home in Delaware and D.C. for meetings in an office space provided by the federal government, the report continues.\n\nThe report emphasized the Democrats are not \"unanimous\" in wanting help from the Bidens, although some party activists still believe there is admiration for the former president.\n\n\"If you were to call any state party chair and ask them if they wanted Joe Biden to be a keynote speaker for their annual dinner, the answer would be yes. He is beloved by the party and beloved by the voters,\" Jane Kleeb, a vice chair of the DNC, told the outlet.\n\nOther Democrats would rather not remind voters of their failed 2024 presidential campaign and instead find a unifying message from younger leaders.\n\nAlan Kessler, a Democratic fundraiser in Philadelphia, told the outlet that there are many people in the party who are \"obviously very frustrated\" with how the election played out, \"but there are plenty of people who still love Joe Biden.\"\n\nKessler argued that Biden could still be an asset to the party at the \"appropriate time\" and could campaign in certain places, like his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. But Kessler said that time is not now, adding that \"it's time to move on with new leadership.\"\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "NBC News Poll Analyst Talks About Kamala Harris Losing 5-Point Advantage\n\nNBC News poll analyst Steve Kornacki explored how Vice President Kamala Harris lost a commanding five-point lead over former President Donald Trump in the race.\n\nSpeaking with NBC Today host Savannah Guthrie on Monday, Kornacki said the race has entered dead heat territory with the polls showing Harris and Trump virtually tied. Just one month ago, however, similar polling showed Kamala Harris not only ahead of Trump in terms of the election but also in terms of favorability rating. Those leads have been virtually wiped out.\n\n\"I mean, the top line is the 5-point advantage that Kamala Harris had in our last poll is gone. What's behind that shift?\" Guthrie asked.\n\nKornacki cited last month's poll that showed Harris leading Trump 48 percent to 44 percent versus this month's poll showing her ahead 49 percent to 48 percent. Kornacki also noted that Kamala's favorability rating has fallen while her negative rating has risen. Last month, Harris had a 48 percent positive rating and 45 negative.\n\n\"Some things that have changed in that time. I think this might be the biggest for Harris,\" he said.\n\n\"We just asked the basic image perception people have, is it positive or negative of these candidates? The Trump number's always been somewhere in this territory,\" he said. \"In fact, this is a little bit high for him, believe it or not.\"\n\n\"But look at Harris, 43 positive, 49 negative. The significance, we polled this a month ago. She was 48% positive and 45 negative. She was above water, as they say. That's completely reversed. It now looks very similar to Trump's. That's a pretty big shift when you're talking about a race this close,\" he added.\n\n\"And then here's the interesting twist. We also asked folks, 'Think back to when Donald Trump was president. Did his policies help or hurt your family?' And look at the difference, 44% helping, 31 hurting. The retrospective, you would say, opinion of Trump's presidency among voters, arguably higher now than when he was president.\"\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

It will take time to count every vote, and there may be swings in the count along the way.\"\n\nAs Breitbart News's Paul Bois previously reported , \"whether or not Americans experience a repeat of 2020 will entirely depend on the margin of the victory from either candidate\":\n\nWhether or not Americans experience a repeat of 2020 will entirely depend on the margin of victory from either candidate. Should either one overtake the other in a landslide victory, Americans could expect to have the winner decided within just a few hours of the polls closing. However, if the election comes down to one or two swing states with tigh margins of victories, the election may very well roll into the following days as precincts collect mail-in and absentee ballots. According to CNN, experts say it is \"unlikely Americans will go to bed on Election Day knowing who their next president will be.\"\n\nAs Breitbart News previously reported , days after the 2020 presidential election, Biden was revealed to be projected winner of Nevada. The call came after several news networks \"determined that Biden had surpassed the 270 electoral college threshold required for victory.\"\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "President Trump Tells NBC News He Is 'Very Angry' And 'Pissed Off' At Vladimir Putin\n\n[Screenshot/Public Domain/The White House]\n\nPresident Donald Trump told NBC News's Kristen Welker early Sunday he took exception to Russian President Vladimir Putin's Friday call for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to be removed from office.\n\nTrump, speaking over the phone, said he was \"very angry\" with and \"pissed off\" by Putin.\n\n﻿\n\nPutin weighed in Friday from the sidelines of the International Arctic Forum in Murmansk in northwestern Russia about the war in Ukraine. He said his country could negotiate with the West \"under the auspices of the UN, the possibility of establishing a transitional administration in Ukraine,\" according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).\n\nTrump told NBC News that Putin's remarks were \"not going in the right location\" and that Russia risked being hit with secondary tariffs.\n\n\"If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault - which it might not be - but if I think it was Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,\" Trump told NBC News.\n\n\"That would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can't do business in the United States,\" Trump added. \"There will be a 25% tariff on all oil, a 25-to-50-point tariff on all oil.\" (RELATED: 'The Only One Who Can Do It': Keith Kellogg Explains Trump's Move Against Putin That He Says Could End The War)\n\nRussian oil imports into the U.S. fell from over 245 million barrels in 2021 to 10,000 barrels in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nPutin also said a transitional government was needed in Ukraine \"[t]o organize a democratic presidential election that would result in the coming to power of a competent government that would have the confidence of the people, and then begin negotiations with these authorities on a peace agreement and sign legitimate documents,\" AFP reported.\n\nUkraine has been under martial law as approved by its constitution since Russia's Feb. 24, 2022 invasion. Zelenskyy's domestic challengers agreed for elections to be suspended until after the war, according to the AFP.\n\nPutin, in power in Russia since the turn of the century, is currently in his fifth four-year term as president and served for one-term as prime minister. Russian elections witness no credible opposition to Putin, who has alleged since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine that the smaller country was not a democracy, AFP reported.\n\nTrump called Zelenskyy \"a dictator with no elections\" in February 2025 and accused Ukraine of starting the war after the Ukrainian leader accused Trump of living in Russia-fueled disinformation, according to the BBC. The criticism occurred around the same time envoys from the U.S. and Russia met to discuss the war. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Zelenskyy would later publicly spar at the Oval Office in Washington, leading to a pause in U.S. military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe Trump administration's efforts to pursue the end of the war between Russia and Ukraine nevertheless continued. A limited ceasefire aimed at guaranteeing safety along the Black Sea shipping route and stopping long-range strikes on energy infrastructure was announced March 25, The Associated Press reported .\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

      "text": "Trump Says He's 'Not Joking' About Running For Third Term, Adds It's 'Too Early To Think About'\n\nPhoto by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump revealed he's \"not joking\" about running for a third term during a Sunday phone call with NBC News's Kristen Welker.\n\n\"A lot of people want me to do it,\" Trump reportedly told Welker, vaguely referring to allies. \"But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go. You know, it's very early in the administration.\"\n\n\"I'm focused on the current,\" the president continued.\n\n\"I'm not joking,\" Trump clarified. \"But I'm not - it is far too early to think about it.\"\n\n\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Trump added, responding to a question on if he has embraced plans to seek reelection for a third term. Seeking a third term, however, is prohibited by the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution .\n\n\"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice,\" the amendment states .\n\nTrump was also reportedly asked if it was possible Vice President JD Vance would run for president and later pass the role onto Trump, to which Trump said, \"That's one\" method. (RELATED: 'Heir Apparent': Here's How JD Vance's New RNC Role Puts Him In Pole Position For 2028)\n\n\"But there are others, too,\" the president reportedly added without elaboration.\n\nTrump has previously made several remarks about running for office again.\n\n\"I've raised a lot of money for the next race that I assume I can't use for myself, but I'm not 100% sure,\" he said to House Republicans days after emerging victorious in the 2024 general election. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again.\"\n\nDemocratic New York Rep. Dan Goldman announced in November 2024 a \"resolution which would re-affirm that the 22nd Amendment is explicit in prohibiting Presidents who have served two full terms from running for the Presidency again.\"\n\nGoldman wanted to further \"condemn [then-] President-Elect Donald Trump's frequent statements suggesting he could serve past the end of his most recent term.\"\n\nGoldman also included an example of Trump's comments in the announcement, quoting the president' saying, \"I suspect I won't be running again unless you say, 'He's so good we've got to figure something else out.'\"\n\n\"The Constitution is clear that no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and any attempt for Donald Trump to circumvent the 22nd Amendment is blatantly unconstitutional. I call on all of my colleagues - Democrat and Republican alike - to stand by the oath we all took to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and confirm the Congress' commitment to this principle,\" Goldman said in the statement.\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

      "text": "Chuck Todd Announces Departure From NBC News\n\nScreenshot/Grabien/NBC News\n\nLongtime NBC News television anchor Chuck Todd announced Friday that he is departing the network after nearly 20 years.\n\nTodd wrote in a Friday memo to staffers that he will be focusing on new ventures and is taking his podcast, ChuckToddcast, with him in order to continue reporting the news. The now-former NBC News host began at NBC News in 2007 as a political director and became chief White House correspondent in 2008, before later becoming the host of \"Meet the Press\" in 2014.\n\n\"There's never a perfect time to leave a place that's been a professional home for so long, but I'm pretty excited about a few new projects that are on the cusp of going from 'pie in the sky' to 'near reality,'\" Todd said. \"So I'm grateful for the chance to get a jump start on my next chapter during this important moment. The ChuckToddcast is also coming with me (thank you NBC). Stay tuned for an announcement about its new home soon. Needless to say, I do plan to continue to share my reporting and unique perspective of covering politics with data and history as important baselines in understanding where we were, where we are and where we're going.\"\n\nMIAMI, FLORIDA - JUNE 27: Moderators Chuck Todd of NBC News and Rachel Maddow of MSNBC talk during the second night of the first Democratic presidential debate on June 27, 2019 in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nThe former \"Meet the Press\" host stated the media needs to start from the \"bottom up\" in order to regain the trust of the American public, who have largely moved away from the legacy media. (RELATED: Chuck Todd Calls Biden 'Selfish' For Presidential Run After Previously Saying He 'Put The Country Before His Family')\n\n\"The media has a lot of work to do to win back the trust of viewers/listeners/readers and I'm convinced the best place to start is from the bottom up,\" Todd wrote in his memo. \"At my core, I'm an entrepreneur - I spent my first 15 years professionally working for the company that started the political newsletter craze that dominates today. And this is a ripe moment.  The only way to fix this information eco system is to stop whining about the various ways the social media companies are manipulating things and instead roll up our collective sleeves and start with local. National media can't win trust back without having a robust partner locally and trying to game algorithms is no way to inform and report.\"\n\nNBC News said they are \"grateful\" for Todd's \"contributions\" to the network in a statement following his announcement, Variety reported .\n\n\"We're grateful for Chuck's many contributions to our political coverage during his nearly two-decade career at NBC News and for his deep commitment to Meet the Press and its enduring legacy,\" NBC News said. \"We wish him all the best in his next endeavors.\"\n\nAfter nine years, Todd stepped down from hosting \"Meet the Press\" in September 2023 and passed the torch to its current host, Kristen Welker. While he still moderated the show, he brought the program into podcasting and launched a film festival in order to reach millennial audiences.\n\nTodd was among the several staffers at NBC News who protested the hiring of former Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor in March over her allegations that the 2020 presidential election was unfair. However, he gave credence to the now-debunked accusations that President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with the Russian government to interfere in the election. The network decided to cut ties with McDaniel just two days after her debut on \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nTodd also vowed to stifle debate about climate change during his run as host of \"Meet the Press.\" During a January 2019 episode of \"Meet the Press,\" Todd announced that he would no longer allow climate change skeptics to appear on the program to debate the contentious issue.\n\nMore veteran media hosts have exited their networks recently, most notably CNN's Jim Acosta, who announced Tuesday that he was departing the network after nearly two decades after being asked to host his program during the midnight time slot.\n\nNBC News did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: NBC Host Presses Biden On His 'Bullseye' Rhetoric Leading Up To Trump's Failed Assassination)\n\n\"As we get closer, I'll of course firm up the date and keep all of you in the loop,\" he shared.\n\nHolt began his NBC career in 2000, anchoring \"Newsfront\" and then his own show, \"Lester Holt Live,\" on MSNBC. He went on to become the weekend anchor for \"NBC Nightly News\" in 2007 before getting the regular anchor position in 2015. Holt took over for then-longtime \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Brian Williams, who was caught lying about details of a story.\n\nHolt is one of many legacy media mainstays to recently transition out of the spotlight. MSNBC reportedly cancelled Joy Reid's nighttime program. CNN also parted ways with anchor Jim Acosta in January.\n\nEditor's Note: The post has been updated to reflect that Holt is leaving the \"NBC Nightly News\" program and not the network altogether.\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

      "text": "NBC Cuts Ties With Ronna McDaniel As Paid Contributor After Backlash\n\n(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nNBC News announced that it decided to cut ties with former Republican National Committee chairwoman (RNC) Ronna McDaniel as an on-air contributor just two days after her Sunday debut on \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nThe network hired her nearly three weeks after she resigned from her top position at the RNC, sparking outrage among NBC and MSNBC pundits and other liberal talking heads. Executives are reportedly deliberating the details of tearing up her contract, and McDaniel is seeking legal representation, according to Puck News' Dylan Byers.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group. After listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\" NBCUniversal Group Chairman Cesar Conde said in an email to staff Tuesday, NBC News reported . \"I want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down. While this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\"\n\nSCOOP @PuckNews : NBC NEWS plans to drop ex RNC-chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor following on-air revolt from NBC/MSNBC talent. Execs are deliberating over details; announcement pending. Meanwhile, McDaniel is seeking legal representation.\n\nFull details, scoops &...\n\n- Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) March 26, 2024\n\nMcDaniel made her debut appearance on \"Meet the Press\" with Kristen Welker Sunday, where she sparked outrage for arguing that President Joe Biden did not win the 2020 presidential election fairly. Welker also pressed her on why she just currently expressed her opposition to releasing violent prisoners present at the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. (RELATED: Trump-Endorsed Candidate Throws Hat In Ring To Succeed Ronna McDaniel As RNC Chair)\n\nLiberals also expressed outrage over McDaniel allegedly engaging in a phone call urging Michigan election officials to not certify the votes cast in the Detroit area, according to CNN.\n\nLongtime NBC News personality Chuck Todd said it can never be certain if McDaniel is sincere as she allegedly changes her views. He called on executives at NBC News to apologize to Welker for booking an interview with McDaniel.\n\n\"I think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation because I don't know what to believe. She is now a paid contributor by NBC News,\" Todd told Welker. \"I have no idea whether any answer she gave to you was because she didn't want to mess up her contract. She wants us to believe that she was speaking for the RNC when the RNC was paying for it. So, she has credibility issues that she still has to deal with.\"\n\nMSNBC's Mika Brzezinski urged NBC News to \"reconsider its decision\" to hire McDaniel over her remarks on the 2020 election, and vowed that she will never be invited as a guest on \"Morning Joe.\" \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin echoed Brzezinski's remarks, calling NBC's decision to hire McDaniel \"despicable.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that journalists have a duty to protect democracy by \"making sure the public knows the truth\" in reference to McDaniel's remarks about the Capitol riot.\n\n\"And the facts and the truth are critical here. I'm not gonna make any comments on that person - on a personnel decision, but as more broadly speaking, it is important. It is a burden on all of us here, right, to be really mindful about that and that the public understands what the facts are and what the truth is,\" she said.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump mocked McDaniel's swift departure from the network.\n\n\"Wow! Ronna McDaniel got fired by Fake News NBC. She only lasted two days, and this after McDaniel went out of her way to say what they wanted to hear,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social late Tuesday. \"It leaves her in a very strange place, it's called NEVER NEVERLAND, and it's not a place you want to be. These Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY, and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK. They were BROKEN and EMBARRASSED by LOW RATINGS, HIGHLY OVERPAID, \"TALENT.\" BRING BACK FREE AND FAIR PRESS - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 2024!\"\n\nMcDaniel served as the RNC chair since 2016 and won her fourth term against her running mates, attorney Harmeet Dhillon and entrepreneur Mike Lindell, in January 2023. Prominent Republicans and many within the RNC grew weary of her leadership when the party failed to reach the expected \"red wave\" in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nThe organization held only $9.1 million in November, the lowest amount of cash on hand since 2015, according to the Washington Post.\n\nFollow Nicole Silverio on Twitter @NicoleMSilverio\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

      "text": "Bernie Sanders Runs For Cover After NBC Host Asks If Dems Should 'Have Done More' To Cut Waste Under Biden\n\n[Screenshot/NBC News/\"Meet the Press\"]\n\nIndependent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders dodged answering if Democrats could have \"done more\" to cut wasteful government spending under the Biden-Harris administration Sunday on NBC News.\n\nHouse Republicans took the first step Tuesday to advance President Donald Trump's first-year legislative agenda with their budget bill, approving up to $4.5 trillion in deficit increases to push for Trump's goal of cutting between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion in spending. On \"Meet the Press,\" NBC host Kristen Welker pointed out the budget bill, mentioning Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson had talked about cutting wasteful spending and that Medicare and Medicaid made billions in spending errors in 2023. (RELATED: Dems Fretting Over Billionaires Have Been On The Billionaire Dole For Years)\n\n\"Let me ask you, Senator Democrats were in charge for four years. Should the Democratic Party have done more to address some of those issues with the insolvency of our entitlement programs?\" Welker asked.\n\n\"And Trump was in power four years before that,\" Sanders responded. \"Look, if there is waste and fraud in the Defense Department, which is the largest single budget item that we fund, which has not been able to fulfill an independent audit in the last seven times, where there's massive waste and fraud, we should go after waste, fraud and abuse in every agency of government. There's no argument about that.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nIn a report published on April 24, 2024, by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), both Medicare and Medicaid were found to be \"susceptible to payment errors\" in 2023, costing taxpayers over $100 billion in \"improper payments.\" The GAO's report stated that, despite testifying before Congress and suggesting recommendations to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, both agencies failed to take action - some of which could have saved Medicare billions, according to the GAO.\n\nSanders went on to claim that Republicans are attempting to make \"massive cuts\" to Medicaid through the budget bill, stating that the cuts would only benefit \"the richest 1%.\"\n\n\"But let us be very clear, what Republicans are trying to do right now is to make massive cuts in Medicaid, over $800 billion, cuts in nutrition programs which feed hungry children,\" Sanders said. \"Why are they doing that? Because they want to be able to use those savings to provide over $1 trillion in tax breaks for the richest 1% for the Elon Musk's and Zuckerberg's and the Bezos's of the world.\"\n\n\"In my view, you don't take food away from children, health care away from struggling people to give tax breaks to billionaires. Do we go after waste and fraud in every agency of government? Yes, we do,\" Sanders concluded.\n\nDespite Democrats' cries over alleged cuts to Medicaid and Medicare, Republicans have refuted their claims, even before the budget moved forward, stating that the GOP budget proposal does not prescribe specific spending cuts.\n\nPrior to the budget's advancement on Tuesday, Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, held a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol, claiming the \"budget represents the largest Medicaid cut in history.\"\n\n\"The reckless Republican budget will hurt everyday Americans who rely on Medicaid, rely on nutritional assistance and rely on veterans' assistance,\" Jeffries said. \"It's not a reality show. This is not a joke. It's not politics as usual. It's a matter of life and death.\"\n\nFollowing the budget's approval, Democrats continued to push their talking points on Medicaid and Medicare, with Jeffries telling Daily Caller News Foundation's Andi Napier Thursday that the budget \"authorizes up to $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid by directing the Energy and Commerce Committee to find those spending cuts.\"\n\nSince Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk announced on Feb. 3 that he and Trump agreed to overhaul the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Democrats have intensified their pushback against the Trump administration's efforts to cut government spending. While reports have revealed that billions of taxpayer dollars were wasted on various USAID programs - some of which aimed to advance a radical leftist agenda globally -Democratic lawmakers have protested Musk and DOGE's involvement and filed dozens of lawsuits .\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

On \"Meet the Press,\" Welker asked the DHS secretary if legal migrants should be worried about potentially being \"wrongfully detained,\" stating she had talked to some people who have \"expressed concerns\" and are carrying their documents with them.\n\n\"I would say that if I've heard that expressed by people that are legal citizens of the United States, it's because the media has perpetuated that fear. The media has said that that's a possibility,\" Noem said. \"There's nothing from this administration, from President Trump or from any of the law enforcement individuals in these communities that has said that they need to walk around and be concerned about that at all.\"\n\nJust six days into the Trump administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents announced their largest arrest day , with 956 arrests on Jan. 26 - significantly outpacing the Biden-Harris administration, which had an estimated average of 310 daily arrests in fiscal year 2024. (RELATED: 'Save Lives': Tom Homan Tells Megyn Kelly Dems Should Cry For Victims, Not Deportations Amid Border Crisis)\n\nWATCH:\n\nNoem went on to state that not only were Americans supportive of the Trump administration's deportation plan, but she also added that she's seen people thank agents for their service.\n\n\"The citizens of the United States are confident that finally, after four long years of having a president in the White House that ignored federal law and endangered their communities, that there's a different man in charge now. There's a man in charge who loves this country, is going to help make their communities safer,\" Noem added. \"These citizens that live here are thrilled.\"\n\n\"In fact, when I was in New York City earlier this week and in several cities since then, the people walking by us on the streets were thanking our officers,\" Noem continued. \"They were thanking these investigators and those that were taking these dangerous criminals out for being there, for making sure that they could walk their kids to school with a new confidence that they could get there safely and that they could do business and have their community back.\"\n\nPrior to heading to the polls in November, voters had consistently polled that immigration was one of their top concerns amid record high illegal migrant encounters during the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nMeanwhile, public support for deporting illegal immigrants has increased in recent years.\n\nIn September 2024 a Scripps News/Ipsos poll showed that a policy of mass deportations had 54% of support. A recent poll conducted by Axios/Ipsos shows that 66% of Americans support \"deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally,\" with 93% of Republicans, 43% of Democrats and 67% of Independents in favor.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and \n\t\t\t\t\tjoining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n\t\t\t\t\tto marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n\t\t\t\t\tsenators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n\t\t\t\t\tto limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n\t\t\t\t\tindependence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n\t\t\t\t\thands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n\t\t\t\t\tOur original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n\t\t\t\t\tthem -- because we won't bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n\t\t\t\t\tour being, and we think she's worth saving from today's craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have \n\t\t\t\t\ttrained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n\t\t\t\t\tspectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There's a good chance they were trained at Daily \n\t\t\t\t\tCaller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n\t\t\t\t\tNewsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n\t\t\t\t\tfair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n\t\t\t\t\tto ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can't do it unless you - \n\t\t\t\t\tthe everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment - have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n\t\t\t\t\tcorporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new \n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration of news reporters who will actually tell the truth.

      "text": "'Just A Witch Hunt': President Trump Says He Won't Fire Anyone Over Signal Incident\n\n\"I think it's just a witch hunt and the fake news, like you, talk about it all the time\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump does not plan on firing anyone over the Signal national security group chat incident, he said in an interview on Saturday.\n\nTrump discussed the matter during brief phone interview with NBC News over the weekend, telling the network: \"I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts.\"\n\nOn Monday, The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg revealed that he had been inadvertently added to a national security group chat in which top Trump officials discussed airstrikes in Yemen. That chat included Vice President JD Vance, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and other members of Trump's inner circle on March 15, as the national security team deliberated launching airstrikes on the Houthis.\n\nAsked by NBC News on Saturday if he still has confidence in Hegseth and Waltz, Trump replied: \"I do.\"\n\n\"I think it's just a witch hunt and the fake news, like you, talk about it all the time, but it's just a witch hunt, and it shouldn't be talked [about],\" Trump told NBC.\n\nHe added: \"We had a tremendously successful strike. We struck very hard and very lethal. And nobody wants to talk about that. All they want to talk about is nonsense. It's fake news.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said that he isn't familiar with the Signal app, when pressed for specifics on whether his team should have been using it.\n\n\"I have no idea what Signal is. I don't care what Signal is,\" Trump said again Saturday. \"All I can tell you is it's just a witch hunt, and it's the only thing the press wants to talk about, because you have nothing else to talk about. Because it's been the greatest 100-day presidency in the history of our country.\"\n\n(Photo by ANDRDW THOMAS/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe White House confirmed Monday that the chat appeared to be authentic, and has since said that no classified information was shared. Hegseth has also pushed back against the notion that \"war plans\" were shared, and the entire Trump team has aggressively messaged that The Atlantic is a liberal, anti-Trump publication and that Goldberg himself is a hack.\n\n\"The National Security Advisor has taken responsibility for this matter, and the National Security Council immediately said alongside the White House Counsel's Office that they are looking into how a reporter's number was inadvertently added to this messaging thread,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week . \"We have said all along that no classified material was sent on this messaging thread. There were no locations, no sources or methods revealed, and there were certainly no war plans discussed.\"\n\n\"There's arguably no one in the media who loves manufacturing and pushing hoaxes more than Jeffrey Goldberg,\" she added.\n\n\"Goldberg is an anti-Trump hater,\" said Leavitt. \"He is a registered Democrat. Goldberg's wife is also a registered Democrat and a big Democrat donor who used to work under Hillary Clinton. This is the same Jeffrey Goldberg who infamously lied about weapons of mass destruction to get us into the Iraq War, which cost trillions of dollars and thousands of American soldiers.\"\n\n\"And how else has Goldberg discredited himself?\" she continued. \"By absurdly claiming that President Trump was Vladimir Putin during the 2016 campaign, by peddling the 'Russia, Russia, Russia' hoax that tried to hijack President Trump's first term, by inventing the 'suckers and losers' hoax to help Joe Biden in the 2020 election, by peddling a hoax about President Trump involving Gold Star families to help Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, which our campaign at the time, vigorously denied.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "website": "https://www.dailywire.com",
      "text": "WALSH: NBC News Says It's Immoral To Have Kids. Here Are 6 Reasons Why That's Insane.\n\nNBC News just posted a lengthy opinion piece explaining why it's \"morally suspect\" to have kids. It argues that human beings are bad for the Earth - what with our carbon emissions, and our pollution, and the electricity that was used to write and publish an article complaining about carbon emissions and pollution, etc. - and the only appropriate response is to have fewer children.\n\nThe author, an alleged \"bioethicist\" and confirmed maniac named Travis Rieder, compares having offspring to freeing a murderer from prison (no, seriously). He says that you would be morally responsible for the future murders the escaped convict commits, just as you're morally responsible for the carbon emissions your daughter emits. When your daughter breathes, selfishly, and melts an ice cap, and a whole family of polar bears drown in the icy depths, you're on the hook, pal. Having one child is tantamount to directly murdering probably 12 polar bears or so, if I have my math right. My wife and I have already slaughtered 36 polar bears according to this equation I just made up. We can't get enough of it. It's pretty disturbing, really, how much we love murdering polar bears.\n\nRieder admits that his view may seem a tad extreme to some of you, but that's only because you're a bunch of dumb, backwards hicks and your \"moral psychology hasn't evolved\" enough to understand and appreciate the brilliance of Travis Rieder. I'm not sure that the term \"moral psychology\" actually means anything, strictly speaking, but that's probably because I'm a dumb, backwards hick, too.\n\nNow, it wouldn't be worth responding to the ravings of this self-loathing madman, except that the ravings were published by a major news organization, and he's articulating an idea that has many proponents on the Left. Whether or not they'd go so far as to compare childbirth to releasing a serial killer from prison, many of them believe that having \"too many kids\" is ethically dubious. I'd like to take a few moments and explain why this view is extremely stupid. There are many more than six reasons but I'll just focus on these six:\n\n1. Overpopulation is a myth.\n\nThis all hinges on the obviously absurd notion that the Earth has some sort of max capacity for human life, and we've almost reached it or already exceeded it. The overpopulation myth is just that: a myth. It was invented out of thin air a few decades ago, around the time that environmentalists and eugenicists were telling us about the imminent ice age, which apparently came and went and destroyed mankind without any of us noticing.\n\nIn reality, the Earth really has no carrying capacity . Or, if it does, we'll never get close to it. As it stands, we have enough room to fit the entire population of the world into Texas and enough resources to feed them all three times over. It's not a coincidence that articles about overpopulation always come accompanied by images of people in Manhattan or Tokyo all crammed together in a train or on a sidewalk. For some reason, they never show you the vast swaths of fertile land where nobody currently lives. They never show you North Dakota or rural China. It's our choice not to live in North Dakota. Perhaps our cities have a population limit - and even that limit is quite flexible - but the Earth is enormous and ancient and resilient, and it can handle us. All of us.\n\n2. Man-made climate change is a myth.\n\nClimate change was supposed to have already brought about the extinction of the human race several times by now. It hasn't, probably because climate change isn't that big of a deal. The Earth has warmed very slightly over the past century and half, it has now stopped warming, and there's no real evidence that human beings contributed to it in any significant way. It's probably for this reason that there really is no \"scientific consensus\" on climate change and never was.\n\n3. Human beings are not commodities.\n\nThe first two points don't matter all that much. I'm sorry for wasting your time with them. Even if it could be proven that an \"excess\" of children may lead to this or that problematic outcome, it still would not be morally justified to treat children as if they can be in \"excess.\"\n\nEither we believe that human life is sacred, and each life holds infinite value, or we don't. If we don't, then I'm not sure why we're having this conversation or any conversation. Life is meaningless, therefore the polar bears and the trees and all the fish in the sea are meaningless, therefore the Earth is meaningless, therefore we may as well kill ourselves and escape this painful nothingness of existence. Certainly, if human life has no intrinsic value then we shouldn't bother ourselves by worrying about silly things like murder, rape, and so forth. Who cares what one worthless, accidental clump of matter does to another? It's all the same in the end. It is only possible and sensible to continue this conversation if we agree that life has value, and that its value is inherent.\n\nSo, if we are moving forward with that understanding, we must agree that each life is worth the trouble it may supposedly, potentially, cause. Life is not a thing that can be measured, counted, or rationed, even by a bioethicist with a PhD and an arsenal of smart-sounding phrases that don't mean anything. Life transcends all of that. If it does not, suicide is the only sensible course of action.\n\n4. Speaking of which, why hasn't Rieder availed himself of that option?\n\nIt's fascinating to note that those who worry about overpopulation never seem to put themselves in the \"over\" category. But if a person truly believed that the surplus of humanity on Earth has become a moral crisis, is that person not morally obliged to minimize that surplus in the only way he really can? Yet Travis Rieder continues to breathe, annihilating another polar bear family as we speak, refusing to lead by example. It's unconscionable.\n\nLet me stipulate that I am not sincerely advocating suicide. I'm only demonstrating the insincerity of Travis Rieder's position. For the record, I hope he lives a long life - I just hope he gets a clue at some point during that process.\n\n5. By the way, why are we still trying to save the panda bears?\n\nI can't make sense of this. On the one hand, environmentalists tell us that carbon emissions are destroying the planet and we must have fewer children to address the epidemic, but on the other hand they say that we must do everything we can to stave off the extinction of pandas and koalas and other effectively useless species who seem to want very badly to die off. We're basically forcing pandas to have sex, we're so desperate to keep them around. Why? They emit carbon too, don't they? Why are humans the ones who need to embrace extinction? If there are \"too many\" biological creatures on Earth, and if we need to curb the expansion of this horrid disease called life, why wouldn't we start with the creatures who are near extinction anyway, and who have less value than human beings?\n\nAll I'm saying is don't tell me to have fewer kids while you're out there artificially inseminating koala bears, for God's sake.\n\n6. It's called selfishness.\n\nWhat lies at the foundation of these attempts to make procreation seem irresponsible, besides nihilism, is selfishness. Rather than admit that they decided not to have kids due to their own materialism and greed, environmentally conscious Leftists have latched onto this rationale. It's all nonsense, of course.\n\nThe \"morally suspect\" thing is to forgo raising a family in favor of pricier vacations and nicer home furnishings. Their attempt to make their shallow, self-interested lifestyle seem noble is pitifully unconvincing. Especially because this excuse is usually trotted out by well off liberals who rarely follow up their \"sacrifice\" of not having kids by sacrificing any of the wasteful luxuries their childless life now affords them. Oddly, they were so concerned about the planet that they bypassed procreation, but not so concerned that they bypassed that trip to the Bahamas, or that third car they don't need, or the eighth pair of shoes in their closet, or the TV in the guestroom nobody sleeps in.\n\nStrange how \"sacrifice\" works with these types.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

The president said that he has \"absolutely\" spoken with top aides about annexing Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory in the northwest hemisphere, and gave \"100%\" certainty that \"we'll get Greenland.\"\n\nOn acquiring Greenland, there is a \"good possibility that we could do it without military force,\" Trump said, but added that \"I don't take anything off the table.\"\n\nAsked about what message the United States acquiring Greenland would send to Russia, Trump dismissed the question.\n\n\"I don't really think about that. I don't really care. Greenland's a very separate subject, very different. It's international peace. It's international security and strength,\" the president said. \"You have ships sailing outside Greenland from Russia, from China and from many other places. And we're not going to allow things to happen that are going to be - that are going to hurt the world or the United States.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has expressed interest in purchasing Greenland from Denmark. Administration officials have said Greenland, with its proximity to Russia and Arctic shipping lanes, represents a key security interest for the United States. Officials have also expressed interest in tapping into Greenland's natural resources.\n\nVice President JD Vance visited U.S. sites on Greenland last week and scolded Denmark for its management of the territory,\n\n\"Our message to Denmark is very simple - you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,\" Vance said . \"You have underinvested in the people of Greenland and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful land mass.\"\n\n\"What we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there,\" he added.\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen posted a video to social media after Vance's visit hitting back at criticism from the White House.\n\n\"Many accusations and many allegations have been made. And of course, we are open to criticism,\" Rasmussen said. \"But let me be completely honest: we do not appreciate the tone in which it is being delivered. This is not how you speak to your close allies. And I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "NBC News: Embryos Are Valuable And Worth Protection (But Only When They Are Wanted)\n\nNBC News' dangerous double standard on the fate of embryos deems life valuable and worth protection only if it is desired.\n\nChampions of assisted reproductive technology (ART) have long defended the fertility industry and its mass destruction and abandonment of countless embryos created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles.\n\nWhen the Alabama Supreme Court issued a ruling last year declaring \"all unborn children,\" including embryos that have yet to be implanted, are considered humans under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act, corporate media jumped to defend the already unregulated Big Fertility industry.\n\nNBC News was one of many corporate media outlets that fearmongered about the implications of the opinion on IVF. Even though the ruling did not nitpick fertility facilities or their operations, NBC News stoked worries that ART facilitators and participants should \"fearfully proceed with IVF after Alabama court rules embryos are children.\"\n\n\"It's not clear when fertility clinics might feel comfortable enough to resume normal operations - or whether patients who intended to discard embryos will have to continue paying storage fees in the interim,\" another NBC News article stated .\n\nJust one year later, NBC News' worries that Big Fertility's freedom to destroy, discard, or indefinitely freeze unlimited \"leftover\" embryos was threatened transformed into fears that when it comes to \"IVF nightmares, patients have few protections.\"\n\nAccording to an NBC News analysis published this week , \"more than 300 lawsuits filed from 2019 to 2024 alleging that embryos, eggs or sperm had been lost, destroyed or swapped.\"\n\n\"The suits were filed against fertility clinics or companies involved in the IVF process across 19 states, and the majority - at least 260 - involved allegations of product or equipment failures,\" the article states, noting that IVF \"isn't governed by the same regulations that hold other medical practitioners accountable for mistakes or safety violations.\"\n\nPress outlets such as NBC News do not bat an eye at the millions of embryos , some of which were likely viable , that are deliberately destroyed due to unreliable genetic testing or sentenced to frigid freezer fates every year.\n\nIn fact, in many cases, corporate media defend the serial creation and destruction of test tube babies as necessary, good, and even trivial as long as the fertility facility and people who commissioned those little lives are on board with throwing them out.\n\nThey apply the same twisted logic to their promotion of abortion. After all, the baby-making and baby-taking industries both hold that life is only valuable and worth protection if that life is wanted.\n\nWhen it comes to the accidental destruction of embryos that IVF customers desperately desire to use, however, NBC News changes its tune. Suddenly, the microscopic humans once deemed disposable have intrinsic value that should come with a right to legal recourse simply because the people who commissioned them did not sanction their harm or elimination.\n\nNBC News is aware of how hypocritical this position is, which is why the outlet concludes its analysis with a warning that \"Reproductive rights advocates also have a reason to be wary of increased IVF regulations.\"\n\n\"They fear amplifying debates about whether embryos are considered babies under the law,\" the article states.\n\nHinting at the need for legal recourse against fertility facilities that mishandle test tube babies without acknowledging the personhood of those embryos is nearly impossible because it requires the law to pick and choose when innocent life is worthy of protection.\n\nThe lack of ART oversight and regulation is certainly concerning and worth a conversation. But that conversation can't come without first recognizing the sanctity of all human life, beginning at the moment at conception, no matter the circumstances of that conception - something NBC News is clearly unwilling to do.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

Here's an @NBCNews fact check of the interview. https://t.co/a9TK0VAo1G\n\nWhen she wasn't using her first time hosting NBC News' activist show \"Meet The Press\" to spread falsities or interjecting to \"fact-check\" the then-presidential candidate, Welker was lying about abortion in an effort to aid Democrats' extreme and unpopular agenda .\n\nAs Federalist Editor-In-Chief Mollie Hemingway noted at the time , Welker's first abortion question \"sounded like it could have been written by Planned Parenthood, in which she pushed the false pro-abortion claim that directly and intentionally killing an unborn child in the womb is sometimes medically necessary for women.\"\n\nHer most egregious behavior in that interview, however, was on full display when she interrupted Trump's true statement about Democrats' abortion through birth aims to deny it on the blue party's behalf.\n\nTRUMP: Democrats that say, after five months, six months, seven months, eight months, nine months, and even after birth you're allowed to terminate the baby -\n\nWELKER: Mr. President, Democrats aren't saying that. I just have to, Democrats are not saying that.\n\nContrary to Welker's insistence, elected Democrats across the U.S. not only routinely call for abortion without limits, but they vote for and hinge their campaigns on it. Some, like former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, have even endorsed letting infants born alive after botched abortions die without resuscitation or intervention.\n\nWelker lying about Dem abortion positions: Trump: \"Democrats that say, after five months, six months, seven months, eight months, nine months, and even after birth you're allowed to terminate the baby -\" Welker (interrupts to lie): \"Mr. President, Democrats aren't saying that.\" pic.twitter.com/On7SJXIhdk\n\nPrior to her 2023 encounter with Trump, Welker used her position as moderator of the second presidential debate of the 2020 election cycle to shut down discussion about the Biden family corruption news that had the potential to change Americans' votes. She let Biden get away with the blatant lie that \"my son has not made money [on] China\" without blinking an eye but ultimately cut off Trump's mention of Hunter Biden's \"laptop from hell\" in order \"to stay on the issue of race.\"\n\nEven before that, Welker made a career out of not just running interference for her preferred party but doing everything she could to distort Trump and Republicans' words, actions, and policies. Her years-long badgering of the president - from the White House press briefing room and MSNBC and NBC sets - wholly disqualifies her from interviewing Trump or any Republican ever again.\n\nGiven Welker's history of being a shameless activist disguised as a journo, it is safe to assume that her pre-taped interview with Trump will only do Democrats favors. Already, her allies at other corporate media outlets like Politico have hinted that she does not \"fact-check\" Trump enough.\n\nTrump and his team did a decent job on the campaign trail icing out corporate media in favor of alternative and conservative media that would treat him fairly. His appearances on podcasts like \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" and \"This Past Weekend with Theo Von\" are even thought to have boosted his performance at the November polls . They would do well to maintain that same approach now.\n\nInstead of giving a known partisan hack the benefit of one of the first corporate media sitdowns since his presidential victory, Trump should tell Welker (and every other press propagandist) that she's permanently fired from interviewing him.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "The 12 Worst Fails Of Media Propagandist And Toilet Paper Bandit Chuck Todd's Career\n\nAs Todd departs NBC, we hope his future plans for full-time employment don't involve an OnlyFans full of seatbelt crotch photos.\n\nAnnouncing his abrupt departure from NBC News on Friday, former \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd admitted the \"media has a lot of work to do to win back the trust\" of its audience. In a great display of self-awareness and humility, Todd helped the corporate media establishment make a great stride toward winning back that trust by removing himself from it.\n\nLike many has-beens who have been before him, Todd will take some time to focus on his podcast. (To his credit, the Chuck Toddcast is not titled The Contrarian and does not employ Jennifer Rubin.) Maybe he'll finally get to achieve his true calling of being a referee . We really hope his future plans for full-time employment don't involve starting an OnlyFans full of awkward crotch photos , or a career in seatbelt marketing.\n\nMaybe he plans to spend his time indulging in his self-admitted habit of going into other people's houses and changing the direction their toilet paper hangs to \"under.\" Whatever the future holds for Todd, here are 11 more times (besides the crotch photo incident) that maybe should have been a hint to retire a lot sooner.\n\nBack in 2017 when Roy Moore was running for an Alabama Senate seat, the controversial candidate expressed a very uncontroversial belief that \"Our rights don't come from government, they don't come from the Bill of Rights, they come from Almighty God.\"\n\nThat was a bridge too far for Todd, who decided such \"fundamentalist views\" meant Moore must not \"believe in the Constitution as it's written.\"\n\nApparently Todd does not believe in the Declaration of Independence as it's written, or he would have remembered that all men are \"endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,\" which \"Governments are instituted among Men\" in order to secure.\n\nDuring an interview with Vivek Ramaswamy during the Republican presidential primary in 2023, Todd couldn't help pushing back on Ramaswamy's suggestion that doctors should not carve up the body parts of children who exhibit symptoms of gender dysphoria.\n\n\"How do you know - are you confident that you know that gender is as binary as you're describing it? Are you confident that it isn't a spectrum?\" Todd asked.\n\nEvidently, Todd is a member of D-list Broadway actress Ketanji Brown Jackson's school of thought when it comes to biology, because he pressed further: \"Do you know this as a scientist ?\"\n\nObviously, it doesn't take a scientist to understand that boys and girls are different. (It also doesn't take a scientist to understand how babies are made , though it apparently does take someone smarter than Todd's fellow propagandist Philip Bump. Hopefully Todd has more knowledgeable colleagues than Bump to explain the birds and the bees to him. Or he can just watch The Kindergarten Cop. )\n\nBefore Kamala Harris and \"60 Minutes\" made it cool, Chuck Todd and \"Meet the Press\" were splicing videos deceptively.\n\nIn 2020, then-Attorney General Bill Barr was asked by CBS how he thought the history books would judge his decision to drop charges against Gen. Michael Flynn. Barr noted with a chuckle that \"history is written by the winners, so it largely depends who's winning the history,\" before adding that \"a fair history would say that it was a good decision because it upheld the rule of law ... and it undid what was an injustice.\"\n\nDeceptively taking Barr's words out of context, Todd showed just the first half - the snarky opener that preceded Barr's actual answer - to his viewers, asking Peggy Noonan if she was as \"struck by the cynicism\" of the answer as he was.\n\n\"He didn't make the case that he was upholding the rule of law,\" Todd added, despite the fact that Barr argued exactly that in his next sentence.\n\nAfter being mocked for the deception, Todd claimed NBC \"did not edit that out\" but \"include[d] it because we only saw the shorter of two clips CBS did air.\" His admission that NBC never thought to check the full transcript or interview was hardly less embarrassing.\n\nLess than two years before Joe Biden issued a 10-year blanket pardon to his son, along with several members of his family, Chuck Todd was arguing that an investigation into Biden family corruption really wasn't all that important.\n\n\"Senator, do you have a crime that you think Hunter Biden committed?\" he asked Sen. Ron Johnson. \"Because I've yet to see anybody explain. It is not a crime to make money off of your last name.\"\n\nThat aged well!\n\nWhen Todd's employer made the unconscionable decision to hire a Republican contributor in the form of former RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, the backlash from McDaniel's new colleagues was so hysterical, NBC dropped her in less than a week.\n\nDuring that time, McDaniel sat for a 20-minute interview on \"Meet the Press\" with Kristen Welker. Afterward, Todd told Welker he thought \"our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\"\n\nTodd has yet to apologize to his listeners for putting them in the unfortunate situation of watching NBC.\n\nThere have been plenty of corruption problems at the Department of Justice - a trend Chuck Todd noticed not when the FBI helped create the Trump-Russia collusion hoax and spied on the Trump campaign based on fraudulent intelligence, nor when the Biden DOJ tried to throw candidate Trump in prison. No, Todd became concerned about politicization at the DOJ when the department, helmed by Barr, recommended a shorter prison sentence than seven to nine years for Roger Stone for lying to Congress.\n\n\"Are we at the point where we cannot trust a political appointee to be in charge of Justice?\" Todd asked. Because obviously, the solution to a bloated bureaucracy with a history of weaponizing its police powers to target political opponents is to make it impossible for the American people to vote those bureaucrats out.\n\nChuck Todd recognized back in 2018 that trust in media was plummeting. But instead of taking responsibility for losing Americans' trust by participating in hoaxes like Russiagate, Todd decided it was all Fox News' fault, and said so in an op-ed in The Atlantic. The problem wasn't with the left-wing media establishment he represented - it was that everyone, led by Fox News and Donald Trump, was meanly attacking journalists!\n\nHis solution, rather than engage in some serious industry-wide self-reflection, was for the media to double down and \"start fighting back\" against their critics. The press, Todd argued, needed to be \"more aggressive.\" I wonder how he thinks that worked out for them.\n\nWhen DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz concluded in 2019 that the Steele dossier - which had been funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and shopped to the FBI to smear Trump - wasn't reliable, it was an embarrassment for the media, who had spread the Russia collusion hoax for years. Most of them tried to salvage the Trump-Russia story by insisting that, even if the Steele dossier was fraudulent, the investigation based on it was still totally legit.\n\nTodd did that too, but first took a slightly more unconventional approach: He hosted the co-founders of the opposition research firm that helped the Clinton campaign commission the dossier on his show to defend the dossier and its author, Christopher Steele. They did so with such profound statements as \"you can't actually catch rabbits without going down some rabbit holes,\" before expressing \"full confidence\" in Steele's ability to, apparently, go down rabbit holes really well .\n\nIt was a weird choice, though perhaps not as weird as Todd's decision to write a piece six months later titled \"No hoax: Why the Russia investigation remains one of Trump's biggest scandals.\"\n\nA full year before the Big Tech-corporate media industrial complex instituted a blackout on the Hunter Biden laptop story in the lead-up to the 2020 election, Chuck Todd was test-driving the approach. Todd refused to air comments Trump made about the Biden family business, despite their extreme relevance to the senior Biden's presidential campaign.\n\n\"We are going further than we've ever gone before to say, we aren't going to play the sound. We aren't going to repeat the president's vicious attacks on Hunter Biden. The president of the United States stood in front of a crowd of supporters and character-assassinated\" the Biden son, Todd claimed. \"We can't in good conscience amplify those attacks.\"\n\nFunny how it didn't prick the consciences of the good people of NBC to amplify untrue attacks like, I don't know, the claim that Trump hired Russian prostitutes to pee on a bed in Moscow?\n\nWhile hosting \"Meet the Press\" in 2019, in the midst of Democrats' crusade to impeach Trump, Todd found himself in the awkward position of having to pretend any House Republican had voted in favor of an impeachment inquiry into Trump when in fact, none had.\n\nIn a graphic purporting to show how many members of Trump's party supported his impeachment, compared to how many Democrats supported President Bill Clinton's impeachment, Todd's \"Meet the Press\" team aired this graphic on television:\n\nThe asterisk is there because the \"Republican\" actually wasn't a Republican at all, but a former Republican who had left the GOP months before NBC aired the incorrect graphic.\n\nTodd even admitted during the broadcast, \"I have one with an asterisk here. I don't know what you do with Justin Amash. It's not a zero. At the same time, he's not a Republican anymore.\"\n\nIn April of 2020, while politicians around the country were shutting down schools, churches, businesses, and dinner parties under the iron fist of Anthony Fauci, Todd suggested it was the better choice to destroy communities in the name of \"caution\" because \"if you're wrong and you've, and you've been overly alarmist, well, nobody's, nobody extra has died.\"\n\nOf course, that wasn't true - a lot of extra people died, from overdoses and suicides driven by isolation and unemployment, and from cancer and heart attacks because they weren't able to get check-ups and screenings. Some research indicates that Covid lockdowns caused more of these kind of \"excess deaths\" than lives they saved from Covid.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Kamala Harris Stands By Big Lie That Joe Biden Is 'Capable' Of The Presidency\n\n'Joe Biden is an - extremely accomplished, experienced, and capable in every way that anyone would want if they're president. Absolutely.'\n\nNBC News aired a one-on-one interview with Kamala Harris on Tuesday night in which the current VP and Democrat presidential candidate reiterated her big lie that President Joe Biden - who was forced out of the race after corrupt media could no longer deny his mental incapacity - was and is fully \"capable\" of performing the duties of his office.\n\n\"Can you say that you were honest with the American people about what you saw in those moments with President Biden, as you were with him again and again, repeatedly in that time?\" asked interviewer Hallie Jackson after noting that Harris \"defended him in the days before and in the days after\" the disastrous June debate while campaigning alongside him.\n\n\"Of course,\" Harris said. \"Joe Biden is an - extremely accomplished, experienced, and capable in every way that anyone would want if they're president. Absolutely.\"\n\nWhen Jackson probed whether Harris had ever witnessed Biden functioning as poorly \"behind closed doors\" as he did on the debate stage over the summer, Harris repeated the obvious lie that \"it was a bad debate. People have bad debates.\" He was just having an off night, folks.\n\nAmericans know that's a lie - as do Harris and Jackson and the rest of the Democrat Party - because there would have been no need for a Democrat coup to overthrow the party's incumbent if Biden's cognitive performance could be explained as one \"bad debate.\" His age and cognitive function were already subject to scrutiny four years prior during the 2020 campaign and only got worse from there. They simply couldn't keep up the charade - or Biden's poll numbers - anymore.\n\nSo when Jackson asked Harris, \"Can the American people trust you in these moments?\" the answer should have been a clear and resounding no - but here was Harris' response:\n\nI have worked with Joe Biden, whether - hours and hours and hours over these four years, whether it be in the Situation Room or the Oval Office. ... I speak with not only sincerity, but with a real firsthand account of watching him do this work. I have no reluctance in saying that. No, of course I don't.\n\nAnyone with eyes and ears knows Harris is full of it. Joe Biden is the man who appears to fall asleep during interviews and constantly slurs his speech incomprehensibly. Who whispers and yells at inappropriate moments and confusedly utters teleprompter cues . Who publicly searched for a deceased congresswoman and couldn't remember when his own son had died . This is the man who had to be herded by foreign leaders when he wandered off at a G7 summit or by staffers dressed up as the Easter bunny when he started babbling about something he wasn't supposed to on the White House lawn. The man who ran his last campaign from his basement and has vacationed for a whopping 40 percent of his presidency. As the New York Post pointed out, that's 48 years' worth of PTO .\n\nWhen Biden was found to have retained classified documents - which was far worse than the Trump lawfare case, given that Biden never had presidential declassification authority and was storing his files next to his Corvette in his not-so-secure garage - the special counsel failed to recommend charges because Biden is \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"\n\nYet after this February report, Democrats and the accomplice media continued to lie that Biden possessed \" strong mental acuity ,\" was \" on his game \" and \" sharp as ever ,\" and that he had \" no impairment .\"\n\nAs for Harris, she said , \"The way that the president's demeanor in that report was characterized could not be more wrong on the facts and clearly politically motivated.\"\n\nIt was a lie then, and it's a lie now. Kamala Harris told it for years because it seemed like her best shot at staying in power. So, no, the American people can't trust her.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Vulnerable Democrat Montana Senator Can't Hide From Harris' Long Left Shadow\n\nJon Tester has refused to endorse the Vice President, but the three-term senator has long stood by the far-left presidential candidate.\n\nSen. Jon Tester , D-Mont., is trailing his Republican challenger, Bozeman businessman and political newcomer Tim Sheehy , by five-plus points (50 percent to 44.8 percent), according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Even a poll earlier this month from the Montana branch of the leftist AARP shows Sheehy ahead of the three-term Democrat by six percentage points (51 percent to 45 percent) in a head-to-head matchup. Older Montana voters, according to the poll, favor the former Navy Seal by a whopping 57 percent to 40 percent.\n\nDespite outraising and outspending the upstart 3 to 1 , Tester and his nervous Senate Democrats have seen the critical - and costly - Montana race slide from a \"toss up\" to \"lean Republican,\" according to Cook Political Report's recent pronouncement.\n\nNo wonder Tester, the lone surviving Democrat to hold statewide office in the Big Sky State, is eschewing anything to do with leftist Vice President Kamala Harris and her presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The Democrat Party's manufactured dream team is running nearly 18 points behind former president Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, in a state expected to play a critical role in helping Republicans take back control of the Senate.\n\nTester has not only refused to endorse the far-left Dem ticket, he skipped last month's Democratic National Convention altogether. Instead, he spent Wednesday evening of the convention, when Walz accepted the VP nomination, at a fundraiser with Pearl Jam's bassist, Jeff Ament, who grew up in Big Sandy, Montana, Tester's hometown, according to NBC News. The senator, first elected in 2006, was Montana's only Democrat delegate of 25 to withhold his vote supporting Harris' nomination, according to Montana Public Radio.\n\nTester's campaign did not return The Federalist's request for comment, but at a press conference last month the senator with the Howie Long flat top insisted he would not endorse anyone in the presidential contest because he was concentrating on his own race.\n\n\"And No. 2, folks have wanted to nationalize this race, and this isn't about national politics. This is about Montana,\" he said.\n\nTester is either delusional or lying. Montana's Senate race, expected to be the most expensive in state history, is being closely watched by opportunistic Republicans and trembling Democrats. According to Open Secrets, the incumbent had raked in nearly $43 million as of June 30, the Federal Election Commission's last reporting period, while Sheehy had raised nearly $14 million. Those numbers were expected to rise significantly over the latest fund-raising period, which wraps up at the end of the month.\n\nTester's Senate seat is among the more vulnerable for Democrats, who hold a narrow 51-49 majority, His defeat could put Republicans back in power and end the far-left reign of Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as majority leader of the upper house. A new YouGov analysis of every congressional race projects Republicans favored to take back the Senate and Democrats with the edge to regain the House.\n\nAs politically moribund PINO (President In Name Only) Joe Biden would say, Montana is a big (expletive) deal.\n\nThe Big Sky State has been turning a deeper shade of red in recent years. While Democrats and their allies have dumped a lot of money into a campaign to vilify Sheehy, the state still boasts a high percentage of self-identified Republicans.\n\nTester is in trouble, and his phony show as a moderate who places country above party isn't selling like it used to, his opponents say. Neither, they assert, is his desperate act to distance himself from Harris, whom he warmly endorsed for vice president in 2020,\n\n\"My friend @KamalaHarris is a proven fighter and an excellent pick for Vice President. As VP, I'm confident she will continue to fight for working families across this country. Looking forward to supporting her and @JoeBiden in November,\" Tester wrote in an August 2020 post Twitter at the time.\n\nMy friend @KamalaHarris is a proven fighter and an excellent pick for Vice President. As VP, I'm confident she will continue to fight for working families across this country. Looking forward to supporting her and @JoeBiden in November. https://t.co/37exYwfVcP\n\nThe Montana senator reportedly encouraged Harris to run for Senate in California. She went on to win, posting one of the most liberal voting records in Congress.\n\n\"Montanans won't forget that Jon Tester recruited Kamala Harris to run for U.S. Senate, endorsed her as Joe Biden's running mate, and voted for her dangerously liberal agenda 95 percent of the time,\" Montana GOP Chairman Don \"K\" Kaltschmidt said in an email response to The Federalist's questions.\n\n\"Not only does Two-Faced Tester stand with Kamala Harris, but Tester also hates President Trump. He voted to impeach President Trump twice, and said President Trump should be punched in the face ,\" added Kaltschmidt.\n\nSheehy's campaign said Tester is committed to the same leftist agenda that Harris has helped lead.\n\n\"His voting record is his endorsement of the failed Harris agenda, and every time Montanans needed him to stop the insanity in Washington, he was the deciding vote to further her progressive Liberal agenda,\" the Sheehy campaign said in an email response to The Federalist. \"That same agenda has made costs for things like groceries and gas skyrocket, it's brought us record high inflation, and has given us a wide-open southern border that has brought crime and deadly drugs into our communities.\"\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "How Donald Trump Can Regain The Support Of Pro-Lifers\n\nTrump can hit far harder on Florida's abortion-until-birth ballot proposition.\n\nOn Thursday, former President Donald Trump generated a firestorm of controversy in pro-life political circles.\n\nDuring an NBC News interview, he was asked about Florida's Amendment 4. This ballot proposition would place a right to abortion in Florida's Constitution and overturn Florida's current law that protects preborn children after six weeks gestation. In response, Trump stated, \"I think the six-week is too short. There has to be more time.\" Many interpreted his comments to mean he would vote in favor of Amendment 4.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Trump campaign went into spin mode. The campaign quickly sent out a press release that stated, \"President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida, he simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short.\" Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America also sent out a press release stating that Trump had a conversation with its president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, in which he indicated that he has not committed to how he will vote on Amendment 4.\n\nLately, many pro-lifers have been frustrated with Trump because he has offered them precious little in terms of commitments on abortion policy. However, this exchange gives Trump the unique opportunity to regain the trust of pro-lifers and provide some valuable assistance in our efforts to defeat Amendment 4.\n\nEven if Trump does not want to publicly oppose Amendment 4, he could still raise concerns about the ballot question. Specifically, he could say he is concerned that Amendment 4 would 1) legalize abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy, 2) repeal Florida's pro-life parental consent law, and 3) possibly require taxpayer funding of elective abortion.\n\nA statement by Trump publicly raising concerns about the radical implications of Amendment 4 would be very beneficial. In other direct democracy campaigns, corporate media outlets have worked overtime to downplay concerns that abortion amendments would strike down common-sense pro-life laws. However, a public statement by Trump would broadcast our strongest and most popular arguments to a wide audience. It would put our opponents on the defensive. During follow-up coverage, pro-lifers could reference other states and discuss how Ohio's abortion amendment has blocked the enforcement of a 24-hour waiting period.\n\nOverall, the campaign over Amendment 4 is the most important statewide election for pro-lifers in 2024. Since constitutional amendments need 60 percent of the vote to pass in Florida, a pro-life victory is within reach. Furthermore, considering Florida's large population and relatively high abortion rate, literally thousands of lives are at stake.\n\nBy simply raising concerns about the full implications of Amendment 4, Trump could win back the support of some skeptical pro-life voters. More importantly, he would be performing a valuable service for pro-lifers in Florida and across the country.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "NBC News' Kristen Welker falsely claims Kamala met with Abbey Gate Gold Star families during dignified transfer\n\nMeet the Press issued a correction after airing the broadcast.\n\nMeet the Press issued a correction after airing the broadcast.\n\nNBC News' Kristen Welker falsely claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris met with Gold Star families who lost their servicemen and women during the Abbey Gate suicide bombing when the bodies of those US Armed Forces members returned home for the dignified transfer of their remains. There's only one problem: Harris was not in fact at the dignified transfer. Welker made the claim in defense of the Democrat presidential candidate during a Meet the Press interview with Senator Tom Cotton on Sunday as Cotton blasted Harris for not meeting with them and not attending a memorial on the 3rd anniversary of their deaths last Monday. GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump was at the memorial and was criticized for that by the Harris campaign. \"All right, let me ask you about another one of the big headlines this week,\" Welker said. \"Donald Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery. You've been talking about this. He attended a wreath laying ceremony, obviously, for the 13 service members who were killed during the US withdraw from Afghanistan. He was invited by those family members. Important to say that he also had campaign staffers with him. Photos, videos were posted on a campaign site. Taking campaign photos and videos at grave sites is forbidden under federal law. You, of course, served at Arlington Cemetery in the Old Guard, so I know that this is a sacred place for you. Bottom line, though, I guess, Senator, is it ever appropriate to make campaign content at military gravesites?\" Biden used photos from the cemetery in his campaign advertising in 2020.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) told Meet the Press host Welker that Harris could have \"honored the sacrifice of those young men and women, but she hasn't. And it's because of her and Joe Biden's incompetence that those 13 Americans were killed in Afghanistan.\" \"There these families, Gold Star families, whose children died because of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's incompetence,\" Cotton responded, \"invited him to the cemetery, and they asked him to take those photos. Because, as they told me yesterday when I spoke to Kelly Barnett and Darren Hoover, the parents of Taylor Hoover, who has Arkansas ties, they don't get to go to the beach on Labor Day. They don't get to have barbecues. This is their one chance to have a memory of their children to commemorate their service and honor, their sacrifice. \"They wanted President Trump there,\" Cotton continued. \"They wanted to take those photos. You know who the families also invited? Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Where were they? Joe Biden was sitting on the beach. Kamala Harris was sitting at her mansion in Washington, DC. She was four miles away, 10 minutes. She could have gone to the cemetery and honored the sacrifice of those young men and women, but she hasn't. She never has spoken to them or taken a meeting with them.\" At that Welker interrupted, saying \"Well they did meet with them during the dignified transfer, they were there with them at the dignified transfer.\" \"It's because of her and Joe Biden's incompetence that those 13 Americans were killed in Afghanistan,\" Cotton said. Harris was not at the dignified transfer of remains in 2021. Biden was there, however, and he was seen checking his watch as he stood, masked, next to First Lady Jill and Department of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Former President Donald Trump honored those 13 Americans at a recent ceremony at Arlington. President Joe Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan has been repeatedly cited as disastrous. The Gold Star families have castigated Harris for not honoring the 13 Americans killed at the Kabul airport and for attacking Trump for doing so, calling it \"false, hypocritical and disgraceful.\" Meet the Press issued a correction after airing the broadcast, saying \"On our broadcast this morning, we incorrectly implied that both President Biden and Vice President Harris attended the dignified transfer of 13 American service members killed during the Afghanistan withdrawal. Biden was in attendance but Harris was not.\"\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) told Meet the Press host Welker that Harris could have \"honored the sacrifice of those young men and women, but she hasn't.

The symbolic act comes after the university caved to the Trump administration's demands to try and restore hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding that was halted.\n\nThe demonstration was organized by the School of International and Public Affairs Alumni for Palestine. It followed Columbia's decision to comply with demands from the Trump administration after the federal government moved to halt $400 million in funding over concerns about antisemitism on campus. The protest also came amid renewed outrage over the recent arrest of Mahmoud Khalil , a Columbia graduate and green card holder who was detained by ICE earlier this month for participating in antisemitic and pro-Hamas protests.\n\nDuring the event, alumni and student speakers gathered to chant slogans such as \"Free Mahmoud Khalil\" and \"Free Palestine\" before collectively ripping up their diplomas.\n\n\"It's not easy to do this,\" said Amali Tower, a 2009 SIPA graduate, in an interview with NBC News . She added that the demonstrators \"took no joy\" in their actions but felt compelled to do so. \"I'm not a proud alumni at all, and instead I want to stand with the students, and I want to stand with Palestinians, and I want to stand with immigrants who are being rounded up and harassed, oppressed and deported as we speak,\" she said. The Trump administration announced the suspension of federal grants to Columbia earlier this month, citing widespread antisemitism on campus following the October 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas. In response, the university agreed to several measures, including increasing campus security by adding 36 officers with arrest powers, adopting a formal definition of antisemitism, and placing oversight on the Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department. Columbia has since parted ways with interim President Katrina Armstrong amid backlash over its decision to comply with the administration's demands.\n\n\"It's not easy to do this,\" said Amali Tower, a 2009 SIPA graduate, in an interview with NBC News .
