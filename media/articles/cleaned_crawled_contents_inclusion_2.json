(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\n\nA number of prominent companies have scaled back or set aside the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that much of corporate America endorsed following the protests that accompanied the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in 2020.\n\nEmboldened by a U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions, conservative activists have used the courts and social media to target workplace programs. They've targeted corporate sponsorships, employee-led affinity groups, and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.\n\nDEI policies typically were intended as a counterweight to discriminatory practices. Critics argue that education, government and business programs which single out participants based on factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unfair and the same opportunities should be afforded to everyone.\n\nThese are some of the companies that have retreated from DEI:\n\nThe retailer said Friday that changes to its \"Belonging at the Bullseye\" strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following Floyd's death in Minneapolis, where Target has its headquarters.\n\nTarget, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles .\n\nThe goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.\n\nTarget also will no longer participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target also said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they're connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.\n\nThe parent company of Facebook and Instagram said it was getting rid of its diversity, equity and inclusion program, which featured policies for hiring, training and picking vendors.\n\nLike other companies that announced similar changes before Meta, the social media giant said it had been reviewing the program's since the Supreme Court's July 2023 affirmative action ruling.\n\nCiting an internal memo sent to employees, news website Axios said the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant concluded the ruling signaled \"a shift in how courts will approach DEI.\"\n\nMeta said it would no longer have a team focused on diversity and inclusion and will instead \"focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.\"\n\nThe change means the company will also end its \"diverse slate approach\" to hiring, which involved considering a diverse pool of candidates for every open position.\n\nJoel Kaplan, Meta's freshly appointed global policy chief, told Fox News Digital that the move will ensure that the company is \"building teams with the most talented people\" instead of making hiring decisions based on protected characteristics.\n\nAmazon said it was halting some of its DEI programs, although it did not specify which ones. In a Dec. 16 memo to employees, Candi Castleberry, a senior human resources executive, said the company has been \"winding down outdated programs and materials, and we're aiming to complete that by the end of 2024.\"\n\n\"We also know there will always be individuals or teams who continue to do well-intentioned things that don't align with our company-wide approach, and we might not always see those right away. But we'll keep at it,\" she wrote.\n\nRather than \"have individual groups build programs,\" Castleberry said, Amazon is \"focusing on programs with proven outcomes - and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture.\"\n\nFour years after launching a push for more diversity in its ranks, McDonald's said earlier this month that it is ending some of its diversity practices, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nMcDonald's said on Jan. 6 that it will retire specific goals for achieving diversity at senior leadership levels. It also intends to end a program that encourages its suppliers to develop diversity training and to increase the number of minority group members represented within their own leadership ranks.\n\nMcDonald's said it will also pause \"external surveys.\" The burger giant didn't elaborate, but several other companies have suspended their participation in an annual survey by the Human Rights Campaign that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.\n\nIn an open letter to employees and franchisees, McDonald's senior leadership team said it remained committed to inclusion and believes that having a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage.\n\nThe world's largest retailer confirmed in November that it would not be renewing a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd, and that it would stop participating in the HRC's Corporate Equality Index.\n\nWalmart also said it will better monitor its third-party marketplace to make sure items sold there do not include products aimed at LGBTQ+ minors, including chest binders intended for transgender youth.\n\nAdditionally, the company will no longer consider race and gender as a litmus test to improve diversity when it offers supplier contracts and it won't be gathering demographic data when determining financing eligibility for those grants.\n\nCEO Jim Farley sent a memo to the automaker's employees in August outlining changes to the company's DEI policies, including a decision to stop taking part in HRC's Corporate Equality Index.\n\nFord , he wrote, had been looking at its policies for a year. The company doesn't use hiring quotas or tie compensation to specific diversity goals but remained committed to \"fostering a safe and inclusive workplace,\" Farley said.\n\n\"We will continue to put our effort and resources into taking care of our customers, our team, and our communities versus publicly commenting on the many polarizing issues of the day,\" the memo said.\n\nIn August, Lowe's executive leadership said the company began \"reviewing\" its programs following the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling and decided to combine its employee resource groups into one umbrella organization. Previously, the company had \"individual groups representing diverse sections of our associate population.\"\n\nThe retailer also will no longer participate in the HRC index, and will stop sponsoring and participating in events, such as festivals and parades, that are outside of its business areas.\n\nIn a post on X in August, Harley-Davidson said the company would review all sponsorships and organizations it was affiliated with, and that all would have to be centrally approved. It said the company would focus exclusively on growing the sport of motorcycling and retaining its loyal riding community, in addition to supporting first responders, active military members and veterans.\n\nThe motorcycle maker said it would no longer participate in the ranking of workplace equality compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, and that its trainings would be related to the needs of the business and absent of socially motivated content.\n\nHarley-Davidson also said it does not have hiring quotas and would no longer have supplier diversity spending goals.\n\nThe parent company of Jack Daniels also pulled out from participating in the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index, among other changes. Its leaders sent an email to employees in August saying the company launched its diversity and inclusion strategy in 2019, but since then \"the world has evolved, our business has changed, and the legal and external landscape has shifted dramatically.\"\n\nThe company said it would remove its quantitative workforce and supplier diversity ambitions, ensure incentives and employee goals were tied to business performance, and review training programs for consistency with a revised strategy.\n\n\"Brown-Forman continues to foster an inclusive work environment where everyone is welcomed, respected, and able to bring their best self to work,\" spokeswoman Elizabeth Conway said in an email.\n\nThe farm equipment maker said in July that it would no longer sponsor \"social or cultural awareness\" events, and that it would audit all training materials \"to ensure the absence of socially-motivated messages\" in compliance with federal and local laws.\n\nMoline, Illinois-based John Deere added \"the existence of diversity quotas and pronoun identification have never been and are not company policy.\" But it noted that it would still continue to \"track and advance\" the diversity of the company.\n\nThe retailer in June said it was ending an array of corporate diversity and climate efforts, a move that came after weeks of online conservative backlash against the rural retailer.\n\nTractor Supply said it would be eliminating all of its DEI roles while retiring current DEI goals. The company added that it would \"stop sponsoring non-business activities\" such as Pride festivals or voting campaigns - and no longer submit data for the HRC index.\n\nThe Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, which sells products ranging from farming equipment to pet supplies, also said that it would withdraw from its carbon emission goals to instead \"focus on our land and water conservation efforts.\"\n\nThe National Black Farmers Association called on Tractor Supply's president and CEO to step down shortly after the company's announcement.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ellen Schmidt, File)\n\nA growing number of prominent companies have scaled back or set aside the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that much of corporate America endorsed following the protests that accompanied the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in 2020.\n\nThe changes have come in response to a campaign by conservative activists to target workplace programs in the courts and social media , and more recently, President Donald Trump's executive orders aimed at upending DEI policies in both the federal government and private sector.\n\nDEI policies typically are intended to root out systemic barriers to the advancement of historically marginalized groups in certain fields or roles. Critics argue that some education, government and business programs are discriminatory because they single out participants based on factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation. They have targeted corporate sponsorships, employee-led affinity groups, programs aimed at steering contracts to minority or women-owned businesses, and goals that some companies established for increasing minority representation in leadership ranks.\n\nWhile hiring or promotion decisions based on race or gender is illegal under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in most circumstances, companies say they are not doing that. Instead, they say they aspire to diversify their workforce over time through policies like widening candidate pools for job openings.\n\nThese are some of the companies that have retreated from DEI:\n\nPepsiCo confirmed that it's ending some of its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, even as rival Coca-Cola voiced support for its own inclusion efforts.\n\nIn a memo sent to employees, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company will no longer set goals for minority representation in its managerial roles or supplier base. The company will also align its sponsorships to events and groups that promote business growth, he said.\n\nLaguarta wrote that inclusion remains important to PepsiCo, whose brands include Gatorade, Lay's potato chips, Doritos, Mountain Dew as well as Pepsi. The Purchase, New York-based company's chief diversity officer will transition to a broader role focused on employee engagement, leadership development and ensuring an inclusive culture, he said.\n\nInvestment firm Goldman Sachs confirmed that it was dropping a requirement that forced IPO clients to include women and members of minority groups on their board of directors.\n\n\"As a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy,\" said a Goldman Sachs spokesman in an email to The Associated Press. \"We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs said that it will still have a placement service that connects its clients with diverse candidates to serve on their boards.\n\nGoogle rescinded a goal it had set in 2020 to increase representation of underrepresented groups among the company's leadership team by 30% within five years. In a memo to employees, the company also said it was considering other changes in response to Trump's executive order aimed at prohibiting federal contractors from conducting DEI practices that constitute \"illegal discrimination.\"\n\nGoogle's parent company Alphabet also signaled things were changing in its annual 10-K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The report dropped a boilerplate sentence it has used since 2020 declaring that the company is \"committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.\"\n\nThe retailer said that changes to its \"Belonging at the Bullseye\" strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following Floyd's death in Minneapolis, where Target has its headquarters.\n\nTarget, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles .\n\nThe goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.\n\nTarget also will no longer participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nPeople stroll Friday, March 21, 2025 in La Defense business district outside Paris. (AP Photo/Thomas Padilla, file)\n\nPARIS (AP) - U.S. government efforts to eliminate diversity initiatives are not going down well on the European continent.\n\nLaurent Saint-Martin, France's minister for foreign trade, said on Monday the country won't compromise after the U.S. State Department said that French companies who have contracts with the U.S. government need to drop diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives . In neighboring Belgium, where some companies received similar requests, the government lashed out at the new U.S. rules.\n\nFrench media reported last week that French companies received a letter saying U.S. President Donald Trump's rollback of DEI initiatives also could apply outside of the U.S.\n\nSaint-Martin spoke to RTL Radio following the reports and said French authorities will seek explanations from their U.S. counterparts about the letter.\n\nThe reported demands included abandoning inclusion policies that are part of French and European Union laws such as equality between men and women, the fight against discrimination and racism or the promotion of diversity to help people with disabilities, he said.\n\n\"All of this is progress that corresponds first and foremost to our French values, we are proud of this and we don't want to compromise on it,\" Saint-Martin said. \"We can't just cancel the application of our own laws overnight.\"\n\nFrench media said the letter was signed by an officer of the U.S. State Department who is on the staff at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. The embassy didn't respond to questions from The Associated Press.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, speaking to reporters at a briefing in Washington, confirmed that letters were sent.\n\n\"This is an effort to comply with the executive order from the president and it is essentially a self-certifying statement to local consulates and embassies,\" she said.\n\nLe Figaro daily newspaper published what it said was a copy of the letter. The document said an executive order that Trump signed in January terminating DEI programs within the federal government also \"applies to all suppliers and service providers of the U.S. Government, regardless of their nationality and the country in which they operate.\"\n\nThe document asked U.S. government contractors to complete, sign and return within five days a separate certification form to demonstrate that they are in compliance.\n\nSaint-Martin said he was \"deeply shocked\" but insisted on the need to have a \"positive agenda\" and maintain a dialogue with the U.S.\n\nIn Belgium, Finance Minister Jan Jambon said Europeans have a \"culture of \"non-discrimination\" that must be continued. \"We have no lessons to learn from the boss of America,\" he told channel RTL-TVi.\n\nIn a joint statement quoted by local media, Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot and Equal Opportunities Minister Rob Beenders regretted the \"step backward\" taken by the U.S.\n\n\"Diversity and inclusion are not just buzzwords, but the foundations of a strong and dynamic society,\" they said. \"They strengthen our economy, foster innovation and allow talent to flourish.\"\n\nIn Spain, Barcelona's mayor said last week that his municipal government will defy Trump's attack on DEI initiatives that have included a cultural program hosted by the city.\n\nTrump issued the executive order to roll back the programs with federal funding, including those receiving U.S. government aid abroad.\n\nThe Barcelona-based program is one of 700 \"American Spaces\" located in 140 countries. They offer English-language and other courses to adults and children, information and materials about the U.S. and counseling for foreign students hoping to enroll at U.S. schools and universities.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nSeveral federal departments removed their DEI-focused webpages after President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order dismantling the federal government's diversity and inclusion programs.\n\nOne of President Donald Trump's executive orders \"directs all departments and agencies to take strong action to end private sector DEI discrimination.\" Dorothy Brown of Georgetown University explains what that could mean for U.S. workforce diversity.\n\nThis U.S. Department of Education website page is seen on Jan. 24, 2025 in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nPresident Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wave as they board Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, Md., Friday, Jan. 24, 2025, en route to Asheville, N.C. (AP Photo/Jess Rapfogel)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Federal agencies have begun removing resources for underrepresented Americans from their webpages following President Donald Trump's executive order cracking down on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nAgencies also have been cancelling staff trainings and shuttering diversity offices to comply with the order from Trump , who has called for all DEI staff to be put on paid leave and eventually be laid off.\n\nDocuments on DEI have been removed from websites at agencies including the Office of Personnel Management, State Department and Department of Homeland Security. Web addresses that once led to DEI pages now display \"Page Not Found - 404\" messages or notes above archived material explaining the change.\n\nAt some agencies, the drive to remove diversity mentions was creating widespread questions and confusion. Lacking clear guidance, Defense Department staff members were pulling websites down in often inconsistent ways.\n\nThe Army, as an example, temporarily removed its sexual assault guidelines - raising questions about what message that might be sending, considering that Trump's defense nominee Pete Hegseth has been involved in sex assault allegations, which he denies. The guidelines were back up late Thursday.\n\nSome of the materials that vanished aimed to help agencies recruit diverse workforces and foster a sense of belonging for employees and students in schools across America. Critics say the rollbacks could result in dramatic shifts in hiring and a return to discriminatory practices of the past.\n\nAmong the sites taken down was a page dedicated to the Inaugural Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity created during the Biden administration. Dorothy Brown, a Georgetown law professor who served on the committee, said the order has far-reaching implications for workforce diversity.\n\n\"Conservatives would say it is wrong to target someone based on their race - but that is exactly what Trump is doing,\" she said.\n\nThe State Department on Wednesday dismantled its Office of Diversity and Inclusion and removed the link to it from its website. The office had been created by former Secretary of State Antony Blinken with fanfare shortly after he took office and had produced reports identifying strategies for attracting minorities and women into the department's workforce.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio sent a cable this week to all U.S. embassies and consulates abroad barring them from flying anything other than the American flag or flags to honor prisoners of war or the wrongfully detained. The directive effectively banned the display of LGBTQ+ pride or Black Lives Matter flags, which had been permitted under the Biden administration.\n\nOn Thursday night, the Education Department announced it had removed or archived hundreds of guidance documents, reports and training materials. The department said it cancelled contracts totaling more than $2.6 million for staff DEI training.\n\nThe pages that were taken down include \"Resources for LGBTQI+ Students,\" an overview of civil rights laws related to \"Race, Color, or National Origin Discrimination,\" and guidance titled \"Avoid the Discriminatory Use of Artificial Intelligence.\"\n\nAn Education Department statement said the deleted pages \"encouraged schools and institutions of higher education to promote or endorse harmful ideological programs.\"\n\nTrump has called DEI programs \"discrimination\" and insisted on restoring strictly \"merit-based\" hiring.\n\nConservative groups have praised the rollback. Parents Defending Education, an organization that has filed lawsuits challenging diversity initiatives at schools, applauded Trump for taking steps \"to root out these programs permanently.\"\n\nAttacks on DEI often target pipeline programs, which do not change the standards of hiring but simply encourage recruiters to look at different hiring pools, said Antonio Ingram, senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense fund. The disparities based on race and gender seen today are a result of the historical exclusion of women and people of color from opportunities, he said, and are not an arbitrary outcome.\n\nThe elimination of programs to ensure a diverse government workforce could be felt for years, he said.\n\n\"There will be generations who don't even know what they missed out on because there has been such an erasure and such a revision and such a redirection of federal resources,\" he said. \"I guess the real tragedy is that there were tools that could have been used to create more belonging, more justice.\"\n\nAt schools, advocates say the crackdown will mean a loss of resources that foster success for students who historically were deprived of adequate learning opportunities, including tools that help teachers address achievement gaps.\n\nThe now-dissolved Education Department bodies include the Diversity & Inclusion Council, established under President Barack Obama, and the Employee Engagement Diversity Equity Inclusion Accessibility Council, which had been housed under its Office for Civil Rights.\n\nThe department's Equity Action Plan has also been withdrawn. According to a snapshot of the plan's former webpage, the initiative intended in part to improve college access, affordability and completion for underserved students.\n\nAlso Friday, the department's Office for Civil Rights announced it dismissed 11 complaints alleging book bans had created a hostile environment for kids. The department said the complaints over restrictions on titles about race or LGBTQ+ issues were meritless. The office also rescinded all guidance that framed book bans as a violation of civil rights laws.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Fatima Hussein, Lolita C.

      "text": "Trump Launches Wild DEI 'Entrapment' Scheme to Punish Government Workers\n\nFreelance Reporter\n\nThe Trump administration has begun to deliver retribution in the Education Department as approximately 55 federal workers who took part in diversity training courses during his first term have unexpectedly been placed on leave.\n\nPresident Trump's decision to punish federal workers for enrolling in DEI programs during his first term is one of his first acts of battle against the size of the federal workforce.\n\nBut the move has left employees confused as diversity councils were set up by Trump's own political appointees.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe letter, which was sent on Friday night, said those placed on leave would continue to receive their salaries but would not have access to their work emails nor be expected to come into the office.\n\nS eparately, at least 14 employees in the Energy Department were placed on leave for jobs in recruiting veterans and using data to improve the workplace.\n\nUnion bosses are furious. Sheria Smith, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, told NBC News that the union is preparing for much worse outcomes ahead after civil rights attorneys and special needs administrators were affected in this first round of Trump's DEI crackdown.\n\n\"It looks like they're entrapping people, because they encouraged people to take these trainings,\" she told NBC. \"Now maybe [they're] using these trainings as a basis to put them on administrative leave.\"\n\nSmith also reportedly said that Trump's anti-DEI tactics were part of an effort to force workers to \"eliminate themselves\" as news site Politico separately reported that changes in the guidance from the Office of Personnel Management forced the hand of civil servants overseeing the department.\n\n\"I think it is a shock and awe. They're trying to send us emails that make no sense and are super confusing to intimidate us or to make us run scared so we quit.\"\n\n\"They're trying to make employees feel like they will soon get fired. And at the same time, they are trying to entice employees with an offer to pay them eight months' salary if they just resign. So it seems as if you're choosing between affirmatively resigning, where they're saying that you might possibly get paid eight months' salary and benefits, or eventually getting fired.\"\n\nThe union for federal workers believes hundreds of employees attended diversity training sessions during Trump's first term.\n\nThe Education Department set a goal in 2019 for training 400 workers as employees were urged to take up 25 available spots on a two-day course \"equipping staff with skills in leading a diverse workforce.\"\n\n\"This effort is essential to sustaining a clear and effective Department-wide program,\" the email said. \"Your positive actions are the catalyst on our journey to achieving ED's diversity and inclusion objectives.\"\n\nOne lawyer representing an Army veteran who was being placed on leave in the Education Department claimed a DEI council was formed during Trump's first term by his own appointees Kimberly Richey and Kenneth Marcus .\n\n\"My client, a veteran, did nothing to violate any executive order,\" Subodh Chandra, the lawyer, said. \"Nor did any of his similarly situated colleagues. He doesn't even run a 'DEIA' project. He was only a member of an inactive committee, on which he was appointed by Trump's own political appointees from the first term.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Brittany Holder, a spokeswoman for the American Federation of Government Employees, said that there were only two employees who had specific DEI briefs, with both being placed on leave.\n\n\"People are worried they are going to lose their jobs,\" she said. \"People are worried and angry.\"\n\nFreelance Reporter\n\nmauriciofca@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

MLB commissioner Rob Manfred last month that although the organization values diversity, it would \"try to comply with what the law is.\"\n\n\"There seems to be an evolution going on here,\" Manfred said. \"We're following that very carefully.\"\n\nThe MLB completely eliminated its webpage for the Diversity Pipeline Program, which sought to cultivate qualified female or minority MLB candidates.\n\nTrump adviser Stephen Miller, who's been criticized for his anti-immigrant stance, founded a legal group called America First that in 2023 filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against the MLB, which alleged its programs were racially discriminatory.\n\nThe MLB is not the first company that America First Legal has filed complaints against over DEI policies. The right-wing group has also filed complaints against NASCAR for discriminating against white men. Miller's group also urged the EEOC to investigate discrimination against white, male, and heterosexual people at \"woke\" corporations like Nordstrom, Tyson Foods, Anheuser-Busch, Morgan Stanley, and several airlines.\n\nEarlier this week, the Department of Defense removed an article dedicated to Black baseball legend Jackie Robinson from its website. It came as federal agencies commanded federal agencies to slash any mentions of DEI, including some mentions of the transgender community and other Black or Native American historical figures.\n\nPentagon Press Secretary John Ullyot at the time echoed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's sentiment that \"DEI is dead at the Defense Department,\" and \"Discriminatory Equity Ideology is a form of Woke cultural Marxism that has no place in our military,\" he told USA TODAY .\n\nThe web page was later restored, and the Pentagon pointed fingers at artificial intelligence for \"mistakenly\" removing the content.\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nkenneal.patterson@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Colleges Shutter DEI Programs in Climate of Fear\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nIn response to President Donald Trump 's executive order directing \"the termination of all discriminatory programs\" associated with diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, many universities are shuttering programs even marginally associated with the progressive slogan, according to The Wall Street Journal .\n\nThe reason: universities do not want to lose valuable federal funding in response to a DEI program that runs afoul of the order, even if the university did not intend for it to.\n\nArizona State, Michigan State, and North Carolina State Universities have all halted various DEI efforts to protect themselves against a backdrop of seemingly blunt and overly broad measures to root out social justice activism from institutions by the Trump administration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThese measures included an offer of a buyout for federal employees, creating a culture of fear around questioning Trump's ideas in executive agencies, and a temporary $3 trillion funding freeze .\n\nThe culture of fear extends to campuses as well. Will Creeley, legal director of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, shared his concerns about possible retaliation against campus leftists by the Trump administration with The New York Times .\n\n\"I think you'll see professors investigated and terminated,\" said Creeley. \"I think you're going to see students punished, and I think you're going to see a preemptive action on those fronts.\"\n\nSome of Trump's directives are directly tied to grants, such as the provision that universities must not have \"programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable federal anti-discrimination laws\" if they want to receive grant money.\n\nUniversities received a whopping $247 billion in federal dollars in 2024, mostly in the form of grants meant for specific research purposes.\n\nJacob Schwartz, the associate director for cancer training and education at the University of Arizona, expressed concern that \"very skilled\" graduate students who may not get federal funding for research cannot be easily replaced. He stressed that unique science \"dies\" under those conditions.\n\nU of A's science program for Native American high-school students was already put on the chopping block by the new presidential administration.\n\nD.C. lawyer Scott Goldschmidt is asking universities to look at how other universities adapted to laws in conservative states that have banned DEI initiatives to figure out how to move forward.\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "What is the DEI rollback and where will it spread next?\n\nWhich US firms have ditched the diversity and inclusion policies opposed by Donald Trump and will UK follow suit?\n\nLast month Donald Trump signed a slew of executive orders overturning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the federal government, in a backlash against measures to help underrepresented groups.\n\nSince then, many large US corporates have followed suit and announced they are dropping or overhauling policies or schemes. Here we examine what has changed and how far the rollback might go.\n\nSo far, the most prominent names to announce changes are from the US finance and tech sectors. This week, the bank Goldman Sachs scrapped a policy that stipulated it would only take on a company's initial public offering if it had at least one board member from a diverse background.\n\nThe consultancy firm Accenture said last weekend it was ending the global diversity and inclusion goals it set in 2017, along with career development programmes for \"people of specific demographic groups\". Earlier this month, Google said it was reviewing some diversity initiatives and scrapping a goal to hire more employees from historically underrepresented groups, and has since removed references to events including Black History Month, LGBTQ+ Pride and Women's History Month from its online and mobile calendars.\n\nNo, rightwing campaigners have been pushing for some time for organisations to scrap the more inclusive policies that were created in response to the protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, claiming they result in \"reverse discrimination\".\n\nThose efforts moved up a gear after a US supreme court ruling in 2023 that banned affirmative action in university admissions decisions, prompting Conservative groups to launch a wave of legal action against companies over their diversity programmes.\n\nLast year, Wall Street banks became some of the first companies to publicly distance themselves from diversity initiatives, including Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, opening up the diversity programmes previously aimed only at people from ethnic minorities.\n\nThe change gathered pace after Trump's election in November, with a swathe of firms dropping DEI in the run-up to the president's inauguration on 20 January, including Walmart , McDonald's , Ford, Amazon and Meta , which also overhauled its content moderation to remove restrictions on topics such as gender and immigration.\n\nSo far the main impact of the changes in Britain have been on users of Silicon Valley-based tech and social media platforms. The policy changes have also prompted some splits within organisations that operate in both countries, as their US and UK arms follow different paths.\n\nThis week, the consultancy and accounting firm Deloitte instructed staff working on contracts for the US government to remove pronouns from their emails , while also announcing the end of its DEI programme.\n\nHowever, the boss of Deloitte UK informed staff its British operations would remain \"committed to [its] diversity goals\". A memo from Richard Houston said changing government priorities in the US would not change its \"commitment to building an inclusive culture\" at its UK arm.\n\nEmployment lawyers have warned that if companies embrace the Trumpian trend they could open themselves up to legal risk in the UK. British companies have \"always had a merit-based approach\" for hiring employees, as affirmative action does not apply, said Lucy Lewis, a partner at the law firm Lewis Silkin.\n\nHowever, she warned that \"it is a big unknown if the federal government will require contractors who they are working with to go further and row back on diversity and inclusion in other ways\", which could create problems when working with some US firms.\n\nUK employers will continue to be required by law to report on certain diversity metrics, such as the requirement to disclose the representation of women and ethnic minorities on the board and in the executive teams of listed companies.\n\nCompanies which announce changes to diversity schemes may also find it harder to recruit younger staff, according to multiple surveys of workers belonging to Gen Z - born between 1997 and 2012 - which have highlighted their desire to work for organisations that align with their values .\n\n\"They only want to join companies which they see pay attention to these issues,\" said Pavita Cooper, UK chair of the 30% Club, which campaigns globally to boost the number of women in boardrooms and in the leadership of companies. \"The war for the very best talent has not gone away, and this is what matters to them.\"\n\nTrade unions oppose the shift but are concerned that international companies may follow US policies, even within their UK businesses. The GMB union said it was worried that \"multinational companies will bring a rightwing, regressive, anti-worker approach to their UK operations\", said Eleanor Saunders, GMB's equality and inclusion organiser.\n\n\"Employer diversity initiatives often don't push hard enough against the causes of workplace discrimination, bias and harassment,\" Saunders said. \"But they are essential for employers to meet their legal obligations and to go beyond the bare minimum to make work accessible, fair and rewarding for all.\"\n\nThe Prospect union, which represents professionals including engineers, scientists, and tech workers, is concerned that the rollback of schemes in large US-based tech companies could have a direct impact on British employees, despite the different legal framework.\n\nIt has written to the chair of the UK parliament's women and equalities committee to ask it to call in tech executives for questioning on the changes.\n\nThe bosses of large companies including Barclays and Unilever have in recent days reaffirmed their commitment to diversity programmes , with Barclays' chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan saying the lender wanted \"to provide equality of opportunity\" and to \"create that inclusive environment\".\n\nMeanwhile, the strategic communications adviser Kekst CNC believes many companies are reassessing, not scrapping, their diversity and inclusion policies.\n\n\"What they're working towards are policies that are better bound to commercial strategy, and so stronger and more durable,\" said Meghan Sheehan, head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability at Kekst CNC."

      "text": "The Guardian view on special needs education: inclusion must be about more than saving money\n\nThe threat of council bankruptcies should focus minds on the need for a failing system to be reformed\n\nT he financial threat hanging over English councils, as a result of the last government's decision to mask special needs overspending with an accounting ruse, is made plain in a Guardian investigation that used freedom of information requests to dig into their accounts. How ministers plan to deal with the £5.2bn debt that will reappear on balance sheets in a year - having been temporarily hidden by the Conservatives - is unknown. But doing nothing is not an option.\n\nThe alarming mismatch between the steeply rising need for special education and the budgets allocated to pay for it is one of the biggest challenges facing the government - with at least 18 councils at risk of insolvency. For families caught in the middle, the consequences can be devastating. Children waiting years for autism and other assessments, or for suitable placements, have their lives placed on hold. A system of grants that was meant to support councils to redesign services, and reduce spending, has mostly failed.\n\nThere is no short answer to the question of what went wrong. But reforms brought in under David Cameron are responsible for pitting families against councils in the struggle for additional support - while central government sits on the sidelines. Budgets have consistently risen, so this is not a story of austerity in a simple sense. Between 2015-16 and 2024-25, high‐needs funding in England rose by 59% or £4bn to nearly £11bn. The number of children with education, health and care plans more than doubled, to 576,000.\n\nBut shrinking public spending has intensified pressures on schools - for example, the rising number of children who are not \"school-ready\" when they arrive, and families needing help with food and clothes. Reductions in teaching assistants and support staff have also had an impact. Conservative reforms that downgraded the arts, promoted exams and made academic standards the overwhelming priority, incentivised headteachers to focus on attainment above all else. The fact that summer-born children, particularly boys, are over-represented among the Send cohort , means age and sex differences must also be considered. Is the current curriculum unsuited to some of the youngest children in a year group?\n\nIn some areas, independent special schools costing up to £61,500 a year are responsible for a growing share of council spending. This diversion of public money to private providers is the wrong solution, as in the children's social care sector . But while an expected push for inclusion in mainstream schools should be welcomed, Bridget Phillipson will need to show this is more than a cost-saving exercise. Above all, she must ensure that identifying pupils' needs is not framed as a problem. While the rise in mental health conditions in young people is hugely concerning, improved understanding and awareness of autism and neurodiversity is beneficial.\n\nIf councils were allowed to go bankrupt, a whole range of services would be at risk - along with the vulnerable residents who depend on them. Clearly, this is a scenario that must be avoided. But writing off the existing debt, which is one option open to the government, would not resolve the issue of rising needs in future. Perhaps the real challenge for Labour is to enable an honest debate that recognises the difficulties faced by families, schools and councils. If special needs provision requires reform, so does the wider education system in which so many children do not thrive."

      "text": "What we know so far about Trump's orders on diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nIn his first few days in office, the president reversed four years of work on DEI efforts in the federal government\n\nWithin his first few days in office, Donald Trump reversed four years of work to increase diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the federal government.\n\nSince taking office, he's signed a flurry of executive orders, two of which amount to crackdowns on DEI within the federal government. One overturns Joe Biden's efforts to increase DEI programs in the federal government, while a second bans DEI measures from being taken by the federal government.\n\nThis isn't Trump's first time attacking DEI as president, but advocates are worried about the impact the orders will have not only on the federal government, but the entire American workforce. Here's what we know so far about Trump's orders.\n\nThe first executive order largely scraps the DEI efforts that took place under Joe Biden, who had ordered all federal agencies to come up with equity plans. It terminates all \"mandates, policies, programs, preferences and activities in the federal government\" that the Trump administration considers \"illegal DEI and 'diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility' (DEIA) programs\".\n\nA second executive order broadly ends any DEI activities within the federal government. This order overturns a handful of executive orders from past presidents, including one from Lyndon B Johnson that was signed during the civil rights era and required federal contractors to adopt equal opportunity measures.\n\nBecause the language in the executive orders is so broad, exactly what will happen under them remains unclear. But it generally gives the Trump administration broad power to do away with anything it considers DEI within the federal government.\n\nThe White House made it clear to federal employees just how serious its DEI crackdown will be. Federal employees are now required to report any colleagues they believe are furthering DEI efforts \"in disguise\". Employees received emails warning of \"adverse consequences\" if they fail to report any colleagues who are still carrying out DEI measures.\n\nAs head of the executive branch, Trump has a lot of leeway over the federal government, and he has been exercising that power in the days since he's re-entered the White House. Still, this doesn't mean the DEI executive orders won't be challenged in court.\n\nTrump and his advisers, including the billionaire Elon Musk, have been complaining about what they consider to be \"government waste\". In addition to his attacks on anti-discrimination efforts, Trump declared that federal agencies should order their employees back to the office full time. He is also trying to reclassify some federal employees who are considered career civil servants, and thus are protected from firing when a new presidential administration comes in, as at-will employees whom his administration can then terminate.\n\nThe executive order has already amassed criticism for the adverse, long-term impact it could have on the federal workforce.\n\n\"The federal government hires and promotes exclusively on the basis of merit. The results are clear: a diverse federal workforce that looks like the nation it serves, with the lowest gender and racial pay gaps in the country. We should be proud of that,\" Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), a union representing 800,000 federal employees, said in a statement .\n\n\"Ultimately, these attacks on DEIA are just a smokescreen for firing civil servants, undermining the apolitical civil service and turning the federal government into an army of yes-men loyal only to the president, not the Constitution.\"\n\nDEI has been under attack from conservatives as part of the larger \"culture wars\" that began after 2020 as resistance to the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted after the murder of George Floyd.\n\nConservatives argue that DEI encourages preferences to marginalized groups, which amounts to \"reverse discrimination\" against white Americans, particularly white men.\n\nBut DEI is a broad term that encompasses many policies used within the workplace that were created to prevent discrimination of women, people of color and other historically marginalized groups - policies that ensure people are being considered for jobs and promotions on equal grounds and that create inclusive workplace environments.\n\nAfter the supreme court overturned affirmative action in higher education in 2023, conservatives unleashed a legal crusade against DEI in the workplace. Though the court's affirmative action decision doesn't mention DEI, conservatives have filed dozens of lawsuits over the last few years attacking hiring practices, training and affinity groups, among other practices. America First Legal, the conservative non-profit group of Stephen Miller, a key policy adviser to Trump, has filed multiple lawsuits against companies for their purported DEI efforts.\n\nBoth executive orders frame DEI as a type of \"immoral discrimination\" that amounts to \"an unlawful, corrosive and pernicious identity-based spoils system\".\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nAmalea Smirniotopoulos, senior policy counsel at the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund, said that the orders reframe DEI as \"somehow immoral and in violation of civil rights laws\".\n\n\"It's just not an accurate representation,\" Smirniotopoulos said. \"Fundamentally, DEI programs are about identifying barriers to opportunity that prevent talented and qualified people from contributing to the workforce, to entering higher education institutions and accessing programs. ...\n\n\"The Trump administration is trying to reframe both what these programs are and what our civil rights laws means, to really take away the tools that we need to ensure that everyone in this country can actually achieve the American dream.\"\n\nNo, but Trump asked the US attorney general's office to look into ways that it can get to the private sector.\n\nOne of the executive orders directs the attorney general's office to give the administration \"recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI\".\n\nDavid Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at New York University School of Law, said it wouldn't be surprising if the White House tried to target DEI in the private sector.\n\n\"I don't think the orders released are the full universe of orders that will be issued by this administration,\" Glasgow said. \"There may be more to come\".\n\nAt the end of his first term, Trump tried to ban DEI training within private companies through an executive order. Though the order targeted companies that do contract work for the federal government, a federal judge still temporarily blocked the order on first amendment grounds.\n\nWhile the supreme court's ruling on affirmative action has raised questions about specific DEI measures that give explicit preference to a group of people, like quotas, there are still no laws that make DEI policies in private companies illegal.\n\nStill, Trump's strong anti-DEI stance has led to what advocates consider a \"chilling effect\". Companies have started to pre-emptively drop their DEI policies, including many made in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder, in fear of retaliation.\n\nSince Trump's election, multiple companies, including Walmart, McDonald's and Meta, all said they were ending at least some of their DEI policies. In a statement about the shift, Meta said that the \"legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing\".\n\nBut some companies are doubling down. A conservative shareholder group recently tried to get Costco to re-evaluate its DEI policies, essentially pressuring the company to drop them, but the company pushed back .\n\nIn a statement, Costco's board chair Tony James said: \"We have always been purposefully non-political and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding\"."

      "text": "Pentagon Official: Hegseth's Campaign to Scrub DEI History Is a \"Dumb\" Distraction\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is trying to eliminate all Defense Department DEI efforts. It hasn't been entirely successful.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who heads a military with an enlisted corps that is more racially diverse than the U.S. population, has been one of the most loyal soldiers in the Trump administration's war against diversity, equality, and inclusion, or DEI. He has helped lead President Donald Trump's charge against transgender troops. At an employee town hall at the Pentagon on Friday, the former Fox News television personality laid out his perspective in simple terms: \"The single dumbest phrase in military history is 'our diversity is our strength,'\" Hegseth said. \"It served a purpose of dividing the force.\"\n\nThese efforts are in keeping with the U.S. military's historical embrace of popular bigotry, including more than 150 years of racial segregation, sex and gender discrimination, a longtime ban on openly gay troops, and continuing underrepresentation of women and Black people at the highest levels of the armed forces.\n\nLast month, Hegseth went so far as to launch a new task force to oversee the elimination of all Defense Department DEI offices and eradicate anything that remains of their efforts. But almost a month after Trump launched his war on DEI , the Defense Department's website continues to host information about diversity, equality, and inclusion - including many marquee DEI efforts launched during Trump's first term in office.\n\n\"I doubt anyone cares very much about it, Hegseth aside.\"\n\n\"We are committed to making the DoD a workplace of choice that is characterized by diversity, equality, and inclusion,\" reads a 2020 Department of Defense Board on Diversity and Inclusion report, issued under Trump , which is still available at the Pentagon's defense.gov website. \"We remain steadfast in our commitment to promote an environment free from barriers that may prevent personnel from realizing their potential and rising to the highest levels of responsibility within the Department.\"\n\nAsked if the remaining webpages advocating DEI policies and news releases touting the merits of diversity initiatives were due to Pentagon intransigence or incompetence, one Defense Department official was circumspect. \"More of the latter, probably, to be honest,\" the official told The Intercept on the condition of anonymity due to fears of retaliation. \"But I doubt anyone cares very much about it, Hegseth aside. Even after you write this, they probably will miss some.\"\n\nTrump doubled down on fighting DEI at the Defense Department in a January 27 executive order. DEI served to \"undermine leadership, merit, and unit cohesion, thereby eroding lethality and force readiness,\" the president stated. He said that \"any vestiges of DEI offices\" should be abolished; two days later, Hegseth created his new \"Restoring America's Fighting Force\" Task Force and directed it to do just that.\n\nAlmost two weeks later, the Pentagon's main website, Defense.gov is still filled with pro-DEI documents, news releases, and webpages. Though Trump blamed the Biden administration for forcing DEI programs \"into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government,\" the site still touts many diversity initiatives launched during the first Trump administration.\n\n\"Diversity and inclusion in the Department are moral imperatives - to ensure every member of the Total Force is treated with dignity and respect,\" reads a 2020 memorandum from then-Trump administration Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller. Another memo from that same year , by another Trump secretary of defense, Mark Esper, announced the creation of a \"new, internal Defense Board on Diversity and Inclusion in the Military, which [was to] conduct a 6-month sprint to develop concrete, actionable recommendations to increase racial diversity and ensure equal opportunity across all ranks.\"\n\nOther reminders of pro-DEI efforts under Trump include a 2020 press release touting Defense Department \"Diversity and Inclusion Counseling Resources\" and an Esper memo on \"Immediate Actions to Address Diversity, Inclusion, and Equal Opportunity in the Military Service.\" \"Diversity and inclusivity in the ranks are not merely aspirations,\" he wrote, \"they are fundamental necessities to our readiness and our mission success.\"\n\nThe Pentagon failed to comment on the accomplishments of Hegseth's anti-DEI task force or its success in eradicating reminders of past Pentagon diversity efforts under Trump and others. \"When we have something to provide on the Task Force we will follow-up,\" Pentagon spokesperson Joshua L. Wick told The Intercept. \"We don't have anything to release at this time.\"\n\nEvidence of the Pentagon's more inclusive past also live on in webpages deemed to be \"part of a historical collection\" on Defense.gov. Jim Garamone's 2022 DOD News article, \" Diversity, Equity, Inclusion Are Necessities in U.S. Military ,\" is one of them. \"I want people to see [DEI] as another tool in the toolkit,\" said Bishop Garrison - then the senior adviser to the secretary of defense for human capital and diversity, equity, and inclusion - in the article. \"It's not just something that has to be done because of some type of cultural ideology or culture wars that are going on - that's not the case at all. It is, again, not diversity for diversity's sake.\" Other such articles include: \" Diversity in U.S., Partner Militaries Is a Strategic Strength \" and \"[Defense Secretary Lloyd] Austin Speaks Out on Importance of Diversity in White House Roundtable ,\" both also from 2022.\n\nLast month, the Pentagon managed to pull down diversity.defense.gov. The page now reads: invalid URL . Under the last Trump administration, the website stated that the \"changing face of the Nation demands that we change\" to better reflect the \"demographic make-up of the American population,\" according to an archived webpage .\n\nThe Pentagon official was succinct in describing his own department's efforts to scrub evidence of its past DEI efforts: \"Dumb.\" He went on to say that while the administration has emphasized increasing \"lethality\" and strengthening the military, they appear far more focused on divisive culture war \"hobbyhorses.\" Efforts to purge DEI content aren't limited to the Defense Department. After Trump called DEI efforts \"illegal and immoral discrimination programs\" in an Inauguration Day executive order, documents on diversity, equality, and inclusion were stripped from the websites of the Office of Personnel Management, State Department, and Department of Homeland Security.\n\nWebpages once devoted to diversity and inclusion at the Department of Homeland Security, for example, now mostly lead to error pages featuring a photo of a DHS service beagle that state, \"Page Not Found. It looks like K-9 Scout wasn't able to find the page that you are searching for. The page may have been moved, deleted, or is otherwise unavailable.\" Others offer even less. A page recognizing the winners of a 2019 award for employees who \"excelled in efforts to promote diversity at the Department of Homeland Security,\" for example, now leads to a page which reads \"Access Denied. You are not authorized to access this page.\"\n\nAnti-diversity efforts are in keeping with a long U.S. military tradition, mirroring the broader American culture of bigotry. Racial minorities have volunteered or been drafted into military service since the Revolutionary War, but the armed forces remained segregated until 1948. Since then, the Defense Department has periodically sought to increase its ranks by pursuing women and racial and ethnic minorities, although discrimination has continued to be a hallmark. The Pentagon, for example, barred gay men and women from serving openly until forced by Congress to end the \" Don't Ask, Don't Tell \" policy in 2011.\n\nThe issue of transgender service members has become a culture war flashpoint over the last decade. Trump banned trans personnel from serving in the armed forces during his first administration, and President Joe Biden reversed that decision, only to have Trump recently issue an executive order that is likely to ban trans troops from serving once again.\n\nThe Pentagon also ordered a halt to all medical procedures associated with \"affirming or facilitating a gender transition\" and paused the acceptance of new recruits with a \"history of gender dysphoria,\" according to a memo posted to X on Monday by Hegseth. Less than 400 active-duty military personnel per year, on average, receive gender-affirming surgical and nonsurgical care, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service issued in January.\n\nOriginal reporting.

Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn recent years, the Pentagon has sought to increase the numbers of women and racial minorities in the military's officer corps, which would bring it into line with the demographics of the enlisted ranks.\n\nActive-duty enlisted personnel are more racially diverse than the general population in America. Non-white service members account for 33.4 percent of all active-duty enlisted troops, according to Pentagon statistics .\n\nSome 17.6 percent of the total active-duty force is Black, compared to 13.7 percent of the general population; 19.5 percent are Hispanic or Latino, roughly the same percentage as the general population; and 17.7 percent are women, a number that has grown over several decades as more military specialties have become fully integrated. Hegseth voiced opposition to women serving in combat before his nomination to serve as defense secretary. During his confirmation hearing, he reversed course, stating that he supports women serving in combat roles as long as they meet the same standards as men. This standard has been military policy for nearly a decade.\n\nMinorities have always been underrepresented in the officer corps, especially its upper echelons, and remain so relative to the enlisted ranks and the U.S. population, according to a 2019 report by the Congressional Research Service. Black soldiers, for instance, make up 9 percent of active-duty officers but only 6.5 percent of generals . They are especially underrepresented at the highest levels - three- and four-star generals - which also have the most influence.\n\nWomen have played important roles in the nation's wars since the American Revolution but were exceptionally limited in their ability to serve in the military until the Women's Armed Services Integration Act was passed in 1948. Today, women are still significantly underrepresented at the highest ranks.\n\n\"We don't have anything to offer on this,\" Wick, the Pentagon spokesperson, replied when asked whether Hegseth views his recent pronouncements on DEI and transgender troops as part of a rich, historical continuum of U.S. military discrimination against minorities and women.\n\nIn his military-focused anti-DEI executive order, Trump said diversity efforts \"violate Americans' consciences by engaging in invidious race and sex discrimination.\"\n\nWhite House spokesperson Taylor Rogers did not respond to questions about whether Trump is satisfied by Hegseth's efforts to eradicate DEI so far.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Steve Scalise Knows Exactly What Led to the Bourbon Street Attack: DEI Initiatives\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Louisiana Republican blamed \"wokeness\" in part for police's failure to stop the New Orleans attack that left 15 dead.\n\nBourbon Street hadn't even reopened when House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., was settling on what he saw as one of the main culprits behind the deadly New Year's truck-ramming attack: DEI.\n\nIn a Thursday interview with a talk radio station in New Orleans, Scalise claimed that diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives bore part of the blame for law enforcement's failure to disrupt the attack that left 15 people dead and dozens more injured.\n\nPressed repeatedly for evidence by a conservative radio host, Scalise returned to his DEI talking points. He also claimed that the truck attack was the first instance of terrorism in a decade, glossing over multiple attacks that include a strikingly similar truck rampage by another adherent of the Islamic State in 2017.\n\n\"Some of these agencies have gotten so wrapped up in the DEI movement - call it wokeness, call it whatever you want - where their main focus is on diversity and inclusion as opposed to security,\" Scalise said. \"And they're two very different things. We've got to get back to that core mission.\"\n\nScalise's comments were the latest example of DEI as the ultimate conservative scapegoat for the alleged failings of law enforcement and the military, no matter how tenuous the connection.\n\nIn the wake of the July assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, Republican members of Congress were quick to blame DEI policies for the Secret Service's failures. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., described the head of the Secret Service, a woman, as a \"DEI hire.\"\n\nAppointees in the upcoming administration have also suggested they would install policies that effectively repudiate even long-standing diversity initiatives. Trump's pick to lead the Department of Defense, former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, has said women should be excluded from combat roles, remarking that he would try to fire \"woke\" generals .\n\nIn turning the conversation around the Bourbon Street attack to DEI initiatives, Scalise was offering up a reliable piece of red meat. What he could not offer to WWL radio host Tommy Tucker was any kind of evidence.\n\nTucker asked several times whether there were any signs that law enforcement had missed, or whether Scalise had any evidence to back up his claims.\n\n\"Do you have any proof that diversity, equity, and inclusion contributed to missing this guy that drove his truck down Bourbon Street, or are you just speculating as to this?\" Tucker said at one point.\n\n\"I mean, each agency has a mission, Tommy, and when you move away from your main mission - Homeland Security, I'll start there, their mission is to keep Americans safe in our homeland, and they have started to move away from that,\" Scalise said. \"At some point if you're moving away from that mission, then you're missing out on what you're supposed to be doing. And that's when things get missed.\"\n\nLater on in the interview, Scalise said there had not been a terror attack on U.S. soil in a decade. While the definition of \"terrorism\" is often disputed, federal authorities have deemed several attacks during the past decade as such - including the mass shooting at a congressional baseball game practice in 2017 that left Scalise and others grievously wounded.\n\nAfter the interview was over, Tucker, the conservative radio host, noted that in October 2017 another man claiming fealty to ISIS used a truck in a vehicle-ramming attack on Manhattan's west side that left eight people dead.\n\nOriginal reporting.

      "text": "The Evolution of Union-Busting\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBreaking Unions With the Language of Diversity and Social Justice\n\nJ ohn Merrell, speaking in a southern drawl, apologized for presenting over Zoom in such casual attire. The lack of a jacket and tie, he said, was intentional. He was on-site with a client.\n\n\"I figured this group would appreciate as much as any that you know, when you've got a lawyer in your facility, you usually don't want them to come in looking all lawyered up,\" said Merrell, a management labor attorney at the firm Ogletree Deakins, a South Carolina-based law firm that specializes in closely advising businesses on how to counter union organizing drives. \"I'm trying to be somewhat incognito.\"\n\nThe group had gathered to speak candidly about creative new ways in which employers can subtly counter union organizing. There's a \"huge uptick in activity,\" Merrell began, not just at name brand companies like Starbucks, but union drives \"even in the Carolinas where [I am] based, we're seeing a lot of an uptick of activity in some kind of unexpected places, unexpected industries, not the industries that you typically think of as being your unionized industries.\"\n\nIn the \"heyday\" for union organizing, he continued, \"we just thought of them as seeking better wages and working conditions for their workers.\" Now, workers were agitating for respect and in opposition to \"harassment, bigotry, discrimination and retaliation,\" said Merrell, quoting a mission statement from the Alphabet Workers Union, which secured bargaining rights for a small group of Google Fiber workers in Kansas City, Missouri, in March.\n\nCorporations, advised Merrell, should be ready to pivot and respond quickly to these \"social justice-driven\" campaigns.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAcross the country, particularly in highly educated workplaces, employee activism has centered on demands that go beyond the bread and butter of higher salaries and better retirement benefits. YouTube and Facebook employees have demanded that management take a greater role in censoring content viewed as sexist or racist. Amazon corporate headquarters workers this month staged a protest to demand that the company restrict the sales of books that are perceived by some activist groups as anti-trans. The union that represents workers at NPR has demanded that the media outlet develop demographic tools to track the race and gender of every source that appears in stories.\n\nWorkers now have a \"heightened focus on the optics\" of race, continued Merrell, so management should do more to match the demographics of the workforce. \"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\" initiatives, social consciousness raising, and constant surveys were all on the table as tools to monitor employee sentiment.\n\nMerrell's presentation was just one in a two-day April conference that showcased the changing face of union-busting. Over a dozen other presenters who work in \"union avoidance\" gave talks during the virtual conference, sponsored by a group called CUE, on the latest trends in organizing, strike-breaking, and how to get ahead of changes in the law and political environment that could provide an edge to the labor movement. They included representatives from Kellogg's, John Deere, Five Below, Lowe's, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as a consultant hired by Amazon to oppose the warehouse worker union drives.\n\nIn the new environment, businesses facing worker uprisings are attempting to co-opt the language of social justice movements and embrace trends around self-growth and positive lifestyles to counter demands for unionization - a far cry from the old days of union prevention, a history that featured employers routinely threatening workers with private guards and violent clashes on the picket lines .\n\nLeny Riebli, the vice president of human resources at Ross Stores, noted that given \"what's happening at Amazon and Starbucks,\" her company had retooled its training to remain union-free. \"We really had to redouble our efforts,\" said Riebli. The company, said Riebli, closely monitors employee concerns that might spill over into support for unionization, so managers have been trained not only to spot potential \"card check\" organizing, but also listen for issues around safety, scheduling, and respect in the workplace.\n\n\"This relates to our diversity, equality and inclusion efforts,\" explained Riebli, noting that the company sought managers who can be approachable to an array of worker issues.\n\nVirtually none of the presenters identified explicitly as anti-union agents. Many described themselves or had professional biographies emphasizing their role as DEI experts, developers of \"human capital,\" and champions of workplace \"belonging.\" The industry has undergone somewhat of a rebranding, with many labor relations executives now identifying as \"people experts\" and diversity executives.\n\nEven the host of the conference was camouflaged. The conference was organized by a group called CUE, which bills itself publicly as simply \"a community for positive employee relations.\" But that sunny image belies its true agenda: Founded in 1977 by the National Association of Manufacturers, as part of a sweeping crusade against organized labor, CUE is formally known as the \"Council for a Union-Free Environment.\" The organization provides research and training for the union suppression tactics, an estimated $340-million-per-year cottage industry of lawyers and consultants who specialize in assisting corporations with mitigating the threat of organized labor.\n\nBut there was no doubt that they understood how controversial their work can be. Ken Hurley, the vice president of Kellogg's Co. for human resources and labor relations who presided over the effort last year to replace striking cereal workers, said he did not want participants to share his slide deck, for fear of leaks. And, after The Intercept published his remarks in which he described the union as \" behaving more like terrorists than partners ,\" Hurley left Kellogg's.\n\nUnion workers rally in support of unionizing Alabama Amazon workers in downtown Los Angeles on March 22, 2021.\n\nS o-called union avoidance consultants, also known as persuaders, work in a specialty profession that has been honed in recent decades. They are hired by corporations to train managers to spot union sympathies or to lead \"captive audience\" lectures - where attendance is mandatory - to pressure workers against voting for a union.\n\nThese seminars can involve threats of retaliation, warnings that a union will force the company to close down, and claims that union dues will negate any benefit of a union contract. But the most important aspect of these meetings, experts say, can be collecting information to identify union supporters within a workplace so that they may be sidelined or fired before they gain influence with their co-workers.\n\nThe persuader industry has evolved to match the cultural trends among many workers. Jason Greer, who has led a diversity seminar at CUE in the past, embodies the evolution of the anti-union industry to match cultural trends among workers. Greer, founder of the eponymous business Greer Consulting, is a persuader who helps companies fend off unionization drives, but you wouldn't necessarily know it from talking to him.\n\n\"I do leadership coaching. I do diversity management training,\" said Greer. \"I'm known as the employee whisperer within my industry.\"\n\nMajor corporations are at once under pressure to appear sensitive to employees from marginalized groups and eager to blunt unionization efforts that would hurt their bottom line. Thanks to consultants like Greer and others, these companies can sometimes kill two birds with one stone by wrapping anti-union talking points in a patina of racial sensitivity and commitment to diversity; Greer's company advertises \"labor relations\" alongside \"diversity training.\"\n\nOver the last year, Greer and his team have worked for B&H Photo, Keurig Dr Pepper, Studio in a School, and Blues City Brewery, and are paid as much as $2,000 per day to pressure workers not to join a labor union. B&H, notably, settled a federal racial discrimination lawsuit in 2017, and agreed to paying $3.2 million in back pay to over 1,300 individuals.\n\nEmployees, said Greer, fundamentally want respect and dignity on the job. Listening to worker demands, he explained, can prevent workers from drifting toward a third party, like a labor union. In some cases, that means providing seminars on leadership and understanding, or creating employee resource groups that provide special recognition to marginalized communities.\n\n\"People will work for money, but they will die for respect and die for recognition,\" continued Greer. \"If your employees are talking about wanting diversity and inclusion practices, don't shut your eyes and, you know, shut your ears to that.\"\n\nThe Labor Pros, a Florida-based firm that runs anti-union campaigns across the country, prominently presents a diverse team that conducts diversity training adjacent to interventions to remove the \"union threat.\"\n\nNekeya Nunn, the chief executive officer of the Labor Pros, has adopted terminology from left-wing, activist spaces. \"I'm a proponent of listening, heart-led leaders, people who make decisions on how they would want somebody else to treat them,\" said Nunn, in an interview with The Intercept.\n\nNunn echoed Merrell's argument, that employees care as much about dignity as wages and benefits. \"People unionize against bad managers, not bad companies,\" she said. Programs that help people from different demographics and different nationalities integrate are simply part of a positive workplace culture, she continued. \"People work for companies that make them feel valued and included, so if that's a tactic to not have a union, then so be it.\"\n\nA contract obtained by The Intercept shows that the Labor Pros provided a menu of options to Hilton Hotels last year on options for persuading workers against joining a union. The firm offered up to four consultants to speak to 80 employees for four days at a cost of $43,120, plus per diem.\n\nDanine Clay and Byron Clay of the firm Diverse Workforce Consultants are among the union avoidance professionals who have worked on recent high-profile campaigns to persuade workers against joining a union at Hershey's and at Mission Hospital in North Carolina , according to disclosures. Their firm touts its \"ability to empower management with employee selection, retention, diversity training and skills, and union avoidance tools and strategies are unmatched.\"\n\nDanine Clay was listed on disclosure forms as a consultant for Amazon engaged in persuading warehouse workers not to join a union. Over the phone, she said the disclosure form was incorrect but declined to comment further.\n\n\"There's kind of a jiujitsu, to get employees thinking about racial justice issues, at least superficially, as a way to deflect labor and collective bargaining,\" said Michael C. Duff, a law professor at the University of Wyoming. Duff attended law school after union organizing cost him his job working for an airline. He understands why the diversity, equity, and inclusion field has become an asset for companies hoping to skirt unionization - particularly at a time when employee interest in both is rising rapidly.\n\n\"Labor consultant folks converting into DEI folks,\" added Duff. \"It's really a wonderful kind of psyops, right, because these people are supposed to be close to employees.\"\n\nT he approach is on display in some of the most high-profile union battles going on now. One example is Starbucks, which has faced growing unionization pressure as over 100 stores have voted to join a union. The company, in response, launched an anti-union website earlier this year. Among the reasons not to join a union? The Starbucks website says the firm already provides an \"inclusive\" environment and maintains a strong commitment to diverse hiring practices.\n\nSo far, the approach has mostly backfired for the company. \"Starbucks claims to be a progressive company, and they're using this social justice language, but people see past that,\" said Joseph Thompson, a student barista who organized two Starbucks locations in Santa Cruz, California.\n\nThompson has corresponded with other baristas seeking to form unions around the country as far away as Idaho. Many have voiced frustration at the company's union-busting tactics in contrast to its purported values, he said.\n\nDespite the rosy image of inclusiveness and activism touted in Starbucks press releases, the company has been accused of over 200 violations of federal labor laws, and over 20 baristas say they have been illegally fired in retaliation for attempting to form a union.\n\n\"It's a brutal anti-union campaign, but also one that tries to appeal to the sort of progressive sensibilities of the kinds of people who work at Starbucks,\" said John Logan, professor and director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University.\n\nEffective or not, it's becoming a standard playbook. Princeton University, in a page outlining \"alternatives to unionizing\" for graduate students, notes that the school already welcomes input on all areas of university life, such as professional development and diversity and inclusion. Princeton University has so far prevailed: The graduate student union has not held a unionization vote, there is no recognition to bargain with the graduate students, and they do not have a contract.\n\nWhen workers at vegan food company No Evil Foods, which makes imitation meat products sold at Whole Foods and other upscale groceries, held captive audience anti-union seminars, the company warned workers about the \" old white guys \" in union leadership and compared union dues to taxpayers funding President Donald Trump's golf junkets.\n\nIn other records leaked out of the No Evil Foods seminars, workers were warned that unions were hotbeds of sexism and sexual harassment, and did not share the vegan food manufacturer's progressive values. The union drive at the firm ultimately failed.\n\nCritics say that many corporations merely channel concerns around racial injustice into a reputation-laundering strategy, one that can serve the bottom line of keeping workers in check. \"For lack of a better word, we're in this woke moment,\" said Wes McEnany, a former organizer with CODE-CWA, a project of the Communication Workers of America to unionize the tech industry. \"Corporations are trying to hijack the language of liberation as a way to prevent workers from having a voice at the table and a say in their jobs.\"\n\nMcEnany noted that when he worked on a campaign to organize workers at Mapbox, a technology firm that provides custom online maps, management responded with accusations of bigotry, claiming efforts to prevent the offshoring of jobs reeked of \"xenophobia.\"\n\nMedium, the publishing website launched by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams, countered a union organizing drive with a promise to increase spending on diversity and inclusion efforts, according to McEnany. After the union vote failed by one vote, Medium liquidated its primary editorial division.\n\nSuch left-leaning language and promises were on display in the recent organizing drive at REI, the outdoor clothing and equipment retailer. The company this year posted an internal podcast featuring its chief executive, Eric Artz, and the company's chief diversity and social impact officer, Wilma Wallace, discussing why \"REI doesn't think unionization is the right thing for the co-op or for the employees.\"\n\nMuch of the conversation centered on claims that a union would hamper the company's ability to \"listen and communicate directly with our employees\" and reduce the company's ability to be flexible in resolving workplace concerns. Such arguments are routine in most organizations facing a union vote.\n\nBut what stood out was the language of social justice that filled the discussion. Wallace began the talk by stating her preferred pronouns and a land acknowledgement to honor the \"traditional lands of the Ohlone people.\" Artz, while arguing against unionization, peppered his remarks with comments about how REI intends to maintain its focus on \"inclusion\" and \"racial equity.\"\n\nFinally, Dollar General is perhaps one of the most glaring retailers facing criticism for its labor practices. The company, in its latest annual disclosure, reported that its median annual salary for workers was $17,773. Workers have cited broken air conditioners, mold in the break rooms, and little safety precautions for employees who face constant robberies and violent incidents within stores. The widespread problems have led to a worker revolt, including store clerks posting TikTok videos of unsanitary work environments and grossly understaffed stores, and some moving toward demands for a labor union to negotiate better conditions.\n\nDollar General has responded with an aggressive anti-union effort that is overseen by Kathy Reardon, the company's chief people officer. In public, Reardon is touted for leading the discount retailer's \"ongoing diversity and inclusion journey\" and for creating an \"allyship guide that helps employees play an active role in creating a more inclusive environment.\"\n\nRecords show that Reardon is involved in the hiring of $2,700-per day consultants who have helped the firm defeat a push for a labor union at its Connecticut locations.\n\nO ne of the most insidious tactics have been the use of supposed employee resource groups, also known as affinity groups or ERGs, to undermine labor activism. Many companies offer specific ERGs for Asian, Black, Latino, or LGBTQ+ individuals, among other identity-based suborganizations as part of a larger diversity and inclusion program.\n\nThe management-sanctioned groups are attempts to create safe spaces for historically marginalized identities to voice shared concerns and create a sense of community within the workplace. According to a study published last year by McKinsey & Co. that surveyed 423 organizations employing 12 million people, close to 35 percent of firms have added or expanded ERGs since 2020.\n\nSupporters of these initiatives say these groups provide a useful channel to improve communications and spotlight company practices that might be shaped by racial biases or lack of sensitivity to minority cultures.\n\nThese lofty goals, however, at times run parallel to or even in conjunction with anti-union measures at some firms. IRI Consultants, a union avoidance firm, noted in one publication that unions in some industries, particularly high tech, have drifted toward capitalizing on demands that employers do a better job of hiring diverse talent. One way to \"union-proof your business,\" IRI claims , is to develop \"effective leadership, consistent employee training, and diversity and inclusion (D&I) initiatives that address challenges like unconscious bias in the human resources (HR) process.\"\n\n\"When people feel powerless, resentment festers until someone comes along, like a union representative saying, 'You have a right to be heard. We can help you get a voice in your workplace, and your employer will have to listen,'\" IRI noted in another publication.\n\nIn response, IRI suggests the creation of ERGs within a workplace. \"If you don't give today's employees a voice, the workforce is likely to have a low engagement level, and the union is going to see an opportunity,\" warns IRI.\n\nERGs are becoming more and more common. CUE, along with Littler Mendelson and Jackson Lewis, two of the largest union suppression law firms, have encouraged them.\n\nThat's because ERGs can provide a useful corporate alternative to unions that places management in control. The tech reporting site Protocol noted that when tech firms such as Mapbox faced a union organizing drive, the company kicked off DEI-related efforts, including ERGs, in order to allay worker concerns.\n\n\"ERGs kind of passively work against the idea of a union in that they're a way for you to kind of spend your energy without it turning into anything,\" one tech worker told the media outlet.\n\nWhen Google, notably, hired IRI Consultants to suppress union activism within the tech giant, the decision, recent court documents show , was made by the then-chief diversity officer, Danielle Brown, who previously led the firm's ERG programs.\n\n\"The ERG is essentially the company's union. It's engaged in this way: 'Oh, you're from a marginalized identity group, you have a place to speak,'\" said McEnany, the organizer. \"But if you talk to a lot of workers interested in real change, they see this as a way to throw money for a party. It's more about surveillance, about keeping an eye on workers.\"\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, in the early days of the U.S. labor movement, corporations facing labor activism would often create fake union organizations controlled by management. These so-called company unions would provide a false sense of worker empowerment, with some fringe benefits like a pool hall or recreation center, while keeping wage and benefit decisions controlled by corporate leaders.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act of 1935, also known as the Wagner Act, which enshrined federal labor union rights, expressly outlawed the formation of company unions. Corporations cannot form worker organizations that claim to negotiate on behalf of employees.\n\n\"Company unions were a major concern of Sen. [Robert F.] Wagner because it's very easy for a working person to mistake these groups as third parties,\" said Duff, the University of Wyoming law professor.\n\nThe movement to create ERGs at a time when workers demand better conditions could be a violation of labor law, Duff argued.\n\n\"It's a distraction. The idea is, 'We're going to siphon off energy that might be devoted to creating your own arms-length groups that would be adversarial,'\" he added.\n\nNunn, of the Labor Pros, agreed that operating ERGs in some ways could run in violation of the National Labor Relations Act but questioned the wisdom of such prohibitions. \"So workers get what they want, companies could not have to deal with a union if they didn't want, and employees would still feel they're fairly compensated and they work in a just environment that speaks up on social justice issues. It would make unions obsolete,\" said Nunn.\n\n\"If a company is willing to create those things outside of the union, outside the labor union, what's the problem with that?\" she asked.\n\nT he success or failure of a union election is almost always determined by knowledge of the workforce and an intimate understanding of the values and beliefs of each employee. The union suppression industry has made workforce intelligence gathering a key element of its trade.\n\nIn the '70s and '80s, industrial psychologist Charles Hughes trained over 27,000 managers and supervisors to \"make unions unnecessary.\" One of his methods was to promote the use of surveys to collect information about workers. Employers signed up by the hundreds to attend Hughes's talks, including a seminar titled, \"Attitude Survey Techniques for Measuring Union Sentiments.\" CUE - which hosted the conference - helped streamline the emerging industry of management consultants, industrial psychologists, and law firms that helped turn the tide against the labor movement, which has declined precipitously since the '70s .\n\n\"It's intimate to talk about race and identity,\" said Duff. \"That creates a vulnerability, and to have consultants come in and say, 'Hey, look, I understand the discrimination you've gone through, you can open up to me,' that can get you a lot of valuable intelligence.\"\n\nSuch vulnerabilities can be key insights during an organizing drive. In 2011, Pratt Logistics opened a new plant in Pennsylvania. The company brought in a man who only identified himself as an efficiency expert named \"Jay.\" Jay went around conducting one-on-one interviews with workers, asking them about what problems they faced, their values, and concerns.\n\nLater, when truckers and warehouse workers at Pratt began steps to form a union at the new plant, the company instantly fired union sympathizers. It wasn't until later that they found out Jay's real identity: Jason Greer, the union suppression consultant, who had been hired explicitly to identify potential union supporters.\n\nWhen the Teamsters union later brought the case to court, arguing illegal retaliation and unfair labor practices, labor attorneys noted that Greer on his website explicitly advertised himself as a \"union buster\" who \"wakes up every day with one goal in mind, and that's to keep unions from taking over and ruining businesses that my friends and my clients have worked their entire lives to build.\"\n\nThose words are gone from Greer's website. Now he lists himself as a diversity consultant.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have?

      "text": "How Trump Twisted DEI to Only Benefit White Christians\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTrump's crusade against \"wokeness\" is co-opting the language of the civil rights movement to undo its legacy.\n\nAfter leaving the National Prayer Breakfast at the Capitol earlier this month, President Donald Trump and his entourage slipped into the imposing ballroom at the Washington Hilton, where the real show was about to begin.\n\nAt the \"unofficial\" event on February 6, organized by the powerful and insular evangelical group known as \"the Family,\" Trump took a victory lap before the crowd of largely white evangelicals. These were the voters who had thrust him into power, and they were eager to celebrate the rash of executive orders reversing decades-old civil rights advances.\n\n\"I don't know if you've been watching but we got rid of woke over the last two weeks. Woke is gone-zo,\" Trump said, to applause. \"We're a merit-based society now.\"\n\nWith an assist from Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Trump has made the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion a centerpiece of his new administration.  For all the crowing about his early success - much of it greatly overinflated - Trump has simply flipped the script: Instead of creating a level playing field, he launched DEI for white Christians.\n\nTrump's bid to dismantle the legacy of the civil rights movement while using its own language is part and parcel of the Christian right's playbook, according to Christine Reyna, a psychology professor at DePaul University who studies extremism.\n\n\"They've stumbled on a winning strategy, which is to portray white people as victims and portray their movement as a civil rights movement,\" Reyna said. \"And they've completely co-opted the strategies of the Black civil rights movement.\"\n\nAt the prayer event that morning, Trump announced the latest gift to his right-wing evangelical supporters: a task force on \"anti-Christian bias,\" helmed by his new Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\n\"[T]he task force will work to fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society and to move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide,\" he said.\n\nTrump's war on \"woke\" is a realization of decades of political organizing that has always had civil rights in its crosshairs. Despite rhetoric about religious liberty, backsliding on civil rights and the far-right push to usher in a Christian theocracy are inextricably linked - and they always have been, according to Brad Onishi, a professor of religion at the University of San Francisco.\n\n\"There has been a war on the representation of rights of people they think don't deserve them or at least don't deserve to be at an equal seat of the American roundtable,\" said Onishi, himself a former evangelical Christian. \"It's something that's 60 years in the making.\"\n\nWhile discussions of the Christian right often focus on the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision as its origin story , the issue that truly launched the movement was integration .\n\nIn 1976, the Internal Revenue Service revoked the tax-exempt status of Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist college that banned interracial marriage on \"religious grounds\" and, until 1971, excluded Black applicants entirely.\n\nThe case, which eventually made its way to the Supreme Court along with similar efforts to desegregate religious institutions catalyzed white Christian outrage. Groups like the Moral Majority sprung up in defense of segregation , capitalizing on white evangelicals' feelings of grievance.\n\nAlthough later Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell Sr. would argue that Roe had been his breaking point, scholars have noted that the emergence of these efforts, including Falwell's, began before Roe and only incorporated anti-abortion stances into their platforms in the late 1970s.\n\nLike Trump, these organizations combined a promise of the restoration of Christianity to dominance in American political life with a staunch opposition to integration and other socially liberal trends in American life.\n\n\"The great white Christian flight from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party occurred primarily because the Democratic Party became the party defending the civil rights of Black Americans in this country,\" said Robert  P. Jones, founder of the Public Religion Research Institute and author of \"The Hidden Roots of White Supremacy and the Path to a Shared American Future.\"\n\nNow, said Jones, \"the two political parties have essentially sorted themselves along ethno-religious lines.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

      "text": "Progressive Group Roiled by Accusations Diversity Leader Misrepresented Her Ethnic Background\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe controversy at the American Friends Service Committee puts a spotlight on the \"diversity and equity\" industry's shortcomings.\n\nMembers of the American Friends Service Committee, a prominent Quaker organization known for its progressive values and social justice advocacy in the U.S. and abroad, have raised an alarm about a woman holding a leadership position within the organization who they say has misrepresented her ethnic background for years and who they fear may be working on behalf of groups seeking to undermine their organization.\n\nRaquel Evita Saraswati, a Muslim activist who for years has encouraged people to believe that she is a woman of color , including Latina as well as of South Asian and Arab descent, is the AFSC's chief equity, inclusion, and culture officer , a senior position that gives her access to the files of dozens of the organization's staff and volunteers. But Saraswati, who was born Rachel Elizabeth Seidel, is not a person of color, according to her mother, Carol Perone.\n\n\"I call her Rachel,\" Perone told The Intercept, when reached by telephone. \"I don't know why she's doing what she's doing.\"\n\nSaraswati, her mother added, is of British, German, and Italian descent - not Latina, South Asian, or Arab. \"I'm as white as the driven snow and so is she,\" added Perone, who also shared with The Intercept photos of Saraswati as a child. In the photos, which the mother asked not be published, Saraswati's complexion is significantly lighter than the bronzed look in more recent photographs. Perone also shared with The Intercept her Ancestry.com profile and a photo of Saraswati's biological father, who is deceased. Another relative who asked not to be identified confirmed that Saraswati is white.\n\nPerone noted that her daughter converted to Islam in high school and that at some point she seemed to have felt the need to portray herself as having a different ethnic identity.\n\n\"I'm German and British, and her father was Calabrese Italian,\" her mother added. \"She's chosen to live a lie, and I find that very, very sad.\"\n\nOskar Pierre Castro, a human resources professional who participated in the search committee to fill Saraswati's position, told The Intercept that she had presented herself as a \"queer, Muslim, multiethnic woman.\"\n\n\"It really touched all the points,\" said Castro, who works for Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, a Quaker group that frequently partners with the AFSC, and who was involved in the search along with AFSC staff members. He added that he had been impressed by Saraswati's credentials and charm and that he thought she would be a good fit for the diversity and inclusion role because \"it seemed that there was an element of lived experience and understanding because of the lived experience, not just the academic and extra training that come with being in a position where you are an equity and inclusion practitioner.\"\n\nCastro added, \"In my mind it was, 'Great, a person of color, a queer person of color, who happens to be a Muslim, it's a woman, all these things, and someone who seemed to get it. I definitely feel conned. ... I feel deceived.\"\n\nThe revelation that Saraswati appears to have created a false impression about her ethnic background has roiled the AFSC.\n\nSaraswati did not respond to requests for comment sent to her by email, phone, and on social media. Layne Mullett, a spokesperson for the AFSC, conveyed a statement from the organization's leadership team that said, \"We are in receipt of the documentation alleging that our Chief Equity, Inclusion, and Culture Officer, Raquel Saraswati, has been misrepresenting her identity. AFSC has given Raquel the opportunity to address the allegations against her, and Raquel stands by her identity. Raquel also assures us that she remains loyal to AFSC's mission, which we firmly believe.\" The statement added that \"AFSC does not require any employee to 'prove' their heritage as a condition of their employment, or in order to be valued as a member of our team.\"\n\nOn Thursday, nearly a week before the allegations first surfaced and after The Intercept reached out for comment, the organization sent a similar statement internally.\n\nThere is a history of white people posing as persons of color or claiming ethnic backgrounds they do not have. In 2015, a national controversy erupted following the revelation that Rachel Dolezal, a white woman, had for years posed as Black before becoming president of an NAACP chapter in Spokane, Washington. Others have claimed roots they don't have; more recently, Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., falsely claimed Jewish descent, among a host of other lies.\n\nThe concerns about Saraswati include what some AFSC members and supporters regard as a possible hidden political agenda. In an anonymous letter posted on Medium that The Intercept has confirmed is from AFSC members, they noted that after 9/11 she appeared in conservative and Islamophobic spaces, including right-wing TV shows, where she was presented as a \" moderate \" Muslim critical of Islamic extremism. While a change in political views is not unheard of, Saraswati has not publicly addressed her work from those years, and much of it appears to have been scrubbed from the internet.\n\nIn the Medium letter posted last week, the group of AFSC members and supporters detailed what they allege to be Saraswati's history of misrepresenting her identity as well as some of her connections to conservative groups earlier in her career.\n\n\"We hope that this will catalyze further truth-telling and accountability,\" the group wrote. They called on the AFSC to investigate the matter and whether there are \"external entities with whom Saraswati is collaborating.\" They also called on Saraswati herself to apologize and step down from her role.\n\n\"People are concerned,\" a member of AFSC's leadership told The Intercept, requesting anonymity to avoid retaliation. \"There's a fear that she could be an agent, because she started her career right-wing. She was a token Muslim voice in that milieu. She never publicly apologized.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe AFSC, the organization leader noted, has a history of being infiltrated by the FBI and has frequently been attacked by pro-Israel groups for its work in solidarity with Palestinians. In 2021, another leading civil rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, was hit by scandal when the executive and legal director of its Ohio chapter was revealed to be covertly working with an anti-Muslim group, the Investigative Project on Terrorism, and sharing confidential information with them. Incidents like that, as well as a long history of law enforcement infiltrating racial justice and activist spaces, have left AFSC members shaken.\n\n\"Imagine the trauma of people who confided in her, trusted her, and shared sensitive information about their work and about their lives, thinking that she's a fellow person of color,\" the AFSC leader said, referring to Saraswati. \"And now all of a sudden, it's a white woman with a right-wing history. It's scary.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether the AFSC was aware, when Saraswati was hired, of the concerns about her background and past work. But last week was not the first time that her ethnic background has been publicly questioned. When the Dolezal scandal erupted, some activists and writers noted Saraswati's name change from Seidel and suggested that she was the \" Raquel Dolezal \" of the Muslim community, as Sana Saeed, a media critic at Al Jazeera, wrote on Twitter at the time.\n\nBy that point, Saraswati had built a public profile as a Muslim woman, often wearing a hijab and frequently making media appearances to discuss Islam. In 2007, Saraswati appeared on CNN with conservative commentator Glenn Beck, and also appeared on Fox News and the far-right channel Newsmax. In 2013, she also appeared in a film produced by the Clarion Project, an organization the Southern Poverty Law Center said specialized in \"rabidly anti-Muslim films.\" And she worked with the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, another group that has been accused of promoting Islamophobia .\n\nYet despite her association with right-wing groups raising the suspicions of fellow Muslim writers and activists , Saraswati was later able to cast herself as a progressive activist, launching a career with organizations working on LGBTQ+ rights and more recently working with the Philadelphia mayor's office, where she chaired the commission on LGBT affairs until she joined the AFSC in June 2021.\n\nSaraswati has received a number of awards for her activism in recent years, including a \"liaison for the marginalized\" award, according to her LinkedIn page . She has also worked as a consultant on diversity and inclusion issues, a field that has grown exponentially in recent years in response to the national debate on racial justice issues that followed a number of high-profile police killings of Black people.\n\nMany organizations have responded to the national reckoning on racism and criticism of their lack of representation and equity by hiring consultants and experts to advise them. That rush has helped elevate those claiming expertise even when their credentials - and in Saraswati's case, her very ethnic background - are in question.\n\n\"DEI is becoming a multibillion-dollar industry: corporations, companies, nonprofits,\" the AFSC leader told The Intercept. \"The data shows a tiny percentage of the directors are Black. And now you have white people in brown face getting into DEI positions, with its salary, resources, and power.\"\n\nSaeed told The Intercept in an email that the Saraswati controversy is an indictment of the diversity, equity, and inclusion industry's shortcomings and \"puts a sharp, bright light on ... the DEI industry itself - did AFSC not vet their candidates, like Raquel?\"\n\nShe added, \"There's long been a critique that companies & organizations use DEI as a shield against criticism of structural issues that continue to persist in the workplace; the people often hired in these positions are not qualified and will usually hurt, more than help, in redressing problems around inequities and exclusion. For the AFSC - known for its progressive values and history - to have hired such an individual is also a damning indictment of how superficial and detrimental, to safe and inclusive workplaces, DEI can often be.\"\n\nUpdate: February 27, 2023 A week after this story was published, Raquel Saraswati announced that she would leave the AFSC. In an email to colleagues, she did not directly address the revelations but wrote, \"I want AFSC to move forward in the work in a way that creates the most ease for you. Therefore, I have let my colleagues in leadership know of my intention to separate from the organization.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "When \"Inclusion\" Fails Kids\n\nIllustration by Alicia Tatone; photo courtesy Katherine Osnos Sanford\n\nKatherine Osnos Sanford October 24, 2024\n\nI love looking at pictures from my daughter's first day of preschool. Three years old, wearing a dress with pink apples on it. I had perfected getting her hair into pigtails just a few weeks before. There was something joyous and hopeful about those little hair geysers sprouting straight off her head. In the photos from that day, we look like any other family on the first day of school. My boys, ages 4 and 6, wearing new future-oriented pants that look a little too long, are smiling proudly at the thought of their sister joining them. It was raining and unseasonably cold; our raincoats seemed out of sync with our end-of-summer tans. In one picture, Mae is leaning into my lap, her yellow raincoat and pigtails buried by my scarf as I give her one last kiss.\n\nWe appeared to be a conventional family from afar, but we weren't. Mae wasn't like my other two children. She made repetitive noises and movements, barely slept, never spoke, and seemed plagued by a never-ending carousel of ear infections and rashes. When she started school, she was classified as PDD-NOS, or \"pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified.\" Although she was 3 years old, developmentally, her age was estimated to be between 13 and 17 months. A month after her first day in preschool, she was officially diagnosed with autism. With the right therapies and some good luck, we were told the gap between our daughter and her peers might be narrowed-if not closed. So, for the next decade, we did everything we could to solve the puzzle that was our daughter's brain: hours and hours of therapy, specialists, the occasional snake-oil salesperson, chat rooms, lawyers, and-yes-the public school system.\n\nThat was 14 years ago. Mae has grown into a young woman who loves music, bubble baths, and peanut butter. She can get a map of a place in her head in seconds and can quickly scan a room and identify who would be most likely to bend to her needs. In other ways, though, her developmental age is still under 2 years old. She is still in diapers; she communicates with hand gestures and noises that make perfect sense only to those of us who know her. As her older brothers' academic and social lives have traced the predictable trajectories of adolescence, hers have been characterized far more by what hasn't changed than what has.\n\nThis is where the current model of education for children with disabilities is a mismatch for her: Even though her developmental age is that of a preschooler, well-intentioned policies known under the blanket term of \"inclusion\" put her in a building of high school students with whom she has little in common.\n\nMy daughter's school-based occupational therapist and I have often spoken wistfully of a school site with an OT space where students could learn practical life skills, where my daughter would spend her days learning to make a peanut butter sandwich or brush her teeth or make a bed or comb her hair. Or, most importantly, learn how to take herself to the toilet. The hours and hours she and I spend together in the summer on potty training are paused every time school starts. It is lovely to think that putting her in a small classroom adjacent to neurotypical students would somehow improve her experience. However, if she learned through osmosis or observation, she would be someone else altogether.\n\nStill, I see this issue from two perspectives. I am the parent of a child with complex needs-and for the last eight years a general education middle school teacher. I believe that she has every right to a high-quality education in our public school system. I also believe, however, that what she learns is more important than where she learns it. The gap between my daughter and her neurotypical peers has grown into a galaxy. I am pretty sure she does not look at the long-legged teens twirling car keys at her school and wish she were one of them. (I think one of the gifts of her condition is that envy or insecurity aren't part of her experiences.) But one of the liabilities of including her in classes with her chronological peers is that the important life skills that she lacks are not on the curriculum.\n\nStudents in my classroom also have a range of needs; some are neurodivergent, others aren't, but none of them have demands as complex as Mae's. As a parent and as an educator, I have been increasingly troubled by the gap between good intentions and lived experience in our schools, one that seems especially sharply drawn with children like my daughter. This question of where a child with disabilities learns and with whom is deeply complicated, in part because the term \"disability\" is applied very broadly. It now includes everyone from a child with mild dyslexia or similar processing issues to a child like mine. Is there a unified strategy that can meet these varied needs? Have we progressed from a time when children like my daughter were shut away from society to the present day when we use the myth of inclusion to mask the fact that we are still not truly creating schools to meet the needs of all children effectively?\n\nInspired by the desegregation of schools and the civil rights movement, in the late '60s and early '70s , disability rights advocates started pressuring Congress to address education for children with disabilities. Leading disability rights activist Judy Heumann, who worked with a congressional team to draft legislation, recalled in her book Being Heumann : \"The country was so inaccessible, disabled people had a hard time getting out and doing things-which made us invisible.\"\n\nDisability rights activism changed this. Back then, many children with disabilities never went to school at all. There was no expectation that a local public school could or would meet their needs. In 1975, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act , known as IDEA, passed. The New York Times around that time quoted Dr. Philip R. Jones, president of the Council of Exceptional Children, describing the measure as \"a landmark for education of the handicapped in our country,\" adding, \"It is overcoming 200 years of sin.\" After describing the bill's emphasis on individualized curricula, the Times also reported: \"Another sensitive portion of the legislation deals with what has come to be known in education as the issue of mainstreaming. That is the extent to which the handicapped should be isolated in classes of their own or mixed in the so-called mainstream with the nonhandicapped.\"\n\nToday, nearly 50 years later, across the United States, there are 7.3 million children with disabilities currently receiving services in the public school system, according to the Pew Research Center . They represent about 15 percent of all public school students. IDEA seeks to help them by mandating \"free and appropriate education\" for all children and requiring that students be educated in the \"least restrictive environment,\" or LRE. The law states that \"to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled.\" LRE is descended from another legal standard-the least restrictive means test, which is used any time a law or government may impede on a person's civil liberties. These days, it's often the rationale for placing children with disabilities in schools with their chronological peers-often referred to as \"inclusion or mainstreaming.\"\n\nBroadly speaking, authentic inclusion of disabled children is necessary and important because, just as with any child, these children are as deserving of a high-quality education that meets them where they are. But for my daughter, and for children with similar profiles, the practical effect is that, rather than spend her days on skills she needs-brushing her hair and teeth, going to the bathroom-she spends them in a large public high school, sitting in a classroom located beside a loud, distracting cafeteria, working on some pseudo-academic curriculum that is based on videos of current events. The thought of her sitting and watching videos on the marvels of weather and then being asked to fill out a worksheet on what she just watched is absurd. Her worksheets about tornadoes or growing potatoes appear to have been scribbled on by a toddler.\n\nThe thought of her sitting and watching videos on the marvels of weather and then being asked to fill out a worksheet on what she just watched is absurd. Her worksheets about tornadoes or growing potatoes appear to have been scribbled on by a toddler.\n\nAs we have seen, in practice, the whole concept of LRE is often reduced to the setting where a child learns. But Dr. Mitchell Yell , a professor at the University of South Carolina and an expert on legal issues in special education, explains: \"It is actually much more than that. It's the facilities, personnel, and location. It's a web of services.\" When I asked Yell about how the concept of LRE had come to represent a physical place, he said he wished they had instead called it \"LRAE-least restrictive appropriate environment.\" He added, \"Perhaps then the emphasis would have remained on what is appropriate for that individual child, rather than simply what was available.\"\n\nAs a teacher of social studies, I see 86 middle school students a day; at any given time, I can have as many as 35 in a class. In order to succeed, one of them may need to sit in the front row away from his peers, while another may need to be in the same seat every day flanked by his best friends. One may never remember to bring his backpack, so may need to keep a folder in the room and a steady supply of pencils and other reminders; another may complete every assignment the day that it is given and ask for additional reading. Teachers are like short-order cooks serving up our subjects. At best, we can tailor every lesson, assignment, fact, and expectation to the child in front of us. It is why the job is both so hard and so rewarding. When you crack the code of how a kid learns, you open up some small but important part of the world to them.\n\nAbout two-thirds of children with disabilities are included in the same classrooms as their general education peers. Some, with dyslexia, for instance, or ADHD, have modified assignments, tests without time limits, or support for note taking; others are pulled out for speech or OT services. In some cases, students are accompanied by one-to-one aides. For the most part, these students are able to operate in a general education classroom and still get the support they need.\n\nChildren like my daughter, whose needs are more complex, tend to be in \"special day classes\" (SDCs), usually in the same building as their typically developing peers but in a dedicated classroom. Part of the intention of LRE was to avoid the segregation of people with disabilities, so they could attend their neighborhood schools and build relationships in their community. Plus, these schools already exist, equipped with cafeterias, art rooms, and athletic facilities. It is far less expensive for districts and counties to tuck disabled children on the edges of existing facilities than to really address their needs.\n\nI live in Northern California, and the SDCs are managed by the county, not the local school. In functional terms, the county-run SDC is a guest at the high school, but local school or general education teachers have no authority or responsibility to monitor what is happening in that classroom. I have often worried about Mae's safety in these siloed little classrooms an hour from our home with no daily on-site administration. Her program manager visits her class twice a week, and that is the only oversight or accountability for the teachers and staff who work with her.\n\nMidway through the last school year, we got word that our daughter was struggling in class-huge tantrums every day, screaming, crying, hitting herself. We learned about this because the school nurse reached out to ask whether we were seeing the same behaviors at home (we were not). Only then did I learn that her dedicated one-to-one aide had been away from the school for a month. (My daughter, of course, was not able to tell us.) Then we learned that some complex medical issues would keep the head teacher out of the classroom for the rest of the year. Plus, the program lacked a consistent occupational therapist. The replacement teacher had no teaching credentials at all, let alone experience with children with disabilities. I was told by a county administrator that the replacement teacher's wife had taught disabled children, so I needn't worry. The result was that Mae spent most of the school year in a classroom without a credentialed teacher and with a rotating cast of occupational therapists. Had it not been for the consistency of her one-to-one aide (who returned after the first month of school), my nonspeaking child would have found herself surrounded by under- or unqualified strangers.\n\nWhen parents believe that schools are failing to provide an appropriate education for their child, they can sue for a better placement or services, such as a special school or home-based care or what is classified as \"most restrictive,\" which means a hospital or residential facility. Unsurprisingly, parents with resources tend to be able to hire lawyers and advocates so their children will have access to specialized private schools or obtain additional services and support. In some cases, these parents can get public funds to cover the cost of a private school that best meets the needs of a student, though this puts heavy financial burdens on school districts and creates serious equity issues.\n\nInclusion works well for some children with significant disabilities. Not long ago, I spoke with Janee Adams, whose daughter Ruby has Down syndrome and recently graduated from high school. Ruby went to a large public high school in her district, where her mother said she \"got to be one of one, everyone knew her.\" However, Adams had to fight every step of the way. She hired an advocate and created alliances within the school community so other parents supported Ruby's presence in the classroom. With Adams' daughters so close in age, they often were in the same class-one of the reasons Ruby loved school. Some of the more challenging social elements of inclusion were easier because the girls could have friends sleep over at their house together. Now that Ruby has finished high school, Adams told me that she is in a day program that has helped her find employment and holds her accountable in ways that often didn't happen in school. \"Ruby loves it,\" Adams says. \"She has never been in a place where she completely belonged before, and she is just so happy.\"\n\nOur family also has had experiences when inclusion was truly remarkable. Two years ago, my daughter's teacher collaborated with the theater teacher to create a performance that was written and performed by both general education students and the students in Mae's class. When the play began, Mae was sitting on a couch while Nirvana blasted through the speakers. She loves music and the students working with her had realized that Nirvana was a special favorite. The student actors would weave it into their story when occasionally Mae would jump up off the couch or laugh loudly. It was a wonderful experience to be at my daughter's school for something other than a meeting, where the typical kids described how much they learned from working with their disabled peers. In our home, my sons have gained so much from having a sister with complex needs. Their friends who have grown up with Mae also display a level of understanding and empathy that only comes from authentic relationships.\n\n\"I feel like I'm stuck in a cage with only special needs students that can see me and interact with me. And the mainstream girls think I'm invisible.\"\n\nSome school districts offer a partial inclusion model for students who fall in between inclusion and SDC, where students with disabilities share some low-intensity classes-such as PE or art- with their typically developing peers but are sequestered in other classes for academic programs. I spoke to a neurodivergent student who attends one such program at the large public high school from which my sons graduated. She also holds a job at a local smoothie shop. \"I met these mainstream girls last year in PE who I wanted to be good friends with because we had a good conversation,\" she told me. \"I don't think they knew how to interact with the neurodivergent kids.\" She continued: \"I feel like I'm stuck in a cage with only special needs students that can see me and interact with me. And the mainstream girls think I'm invisible.\"\n\nShe may take PE or electives with her neurotypical peers, but when she wanted to take the genetics section of a science class or manage the swim team, she was told she could not. When her parents pushed back, they were told that the coach of the team did not have the capacity to have her on as a swimmer or manager. They were told that the science class was \"not a good fit\" even though their daughter had independently done hours of research about her own chromosomal deletion. She longs to be included in the daily goings-on at the school, but without the concerted efforts of both students and staff, she and her peers will operate as though they are of a different caste-functional enough to be adjacent to their typically developing peers, but never admitted into what seems to be an exclusive club.\n\nWithout standards to define or measure \"inclusion\" or its benefits, it becomes one of those educational policies that sound good on paper but are rarely as beneficial to the students they are designed to help. When we make inclusion the goal over excellence, we are \"putting the where before the how,\" says Douglas Fuchs , a leading researcher on human development and education for children with disabilities at Vanderbilt University.\n\nFuchs told me his research team created a national database of reading data from 1998 through 2015 for students grades K-12. After analyzing the data using \"multilevel growth models,\" they found \"that mainstreaming, or general classroom placements, did not strengthen the academic achievement of most students with disabilities.\" In 2022, the Campbell Collaboration, an international research organization, published a report saying inclusion did not seem to show any positive academic or social-emotional benefit to students. In fact, students who were taught separately in settings designed for them experienced better outcomes.\n\nThe longitudinal studies are clear about how blanket policies of inclusion can actually inhibit student progress. In summarizing what we know about inclusion, Fuchs says, \"Fifty years of research indicates that placing students with disabilities in general classrooms fails to provide the necessary intensive and expert instruction these children and youth need to succeed in school and in life afterwards.\" This means that for some students, the general classroom is an appropriate placement, but for many, there need to be other school-based options that are better suited to meet their specific needs.\n\n\"Fifty years of research indicates that placing students with disabilities in general classrooms fails to provide the necessary intensive and expert instruction these children and youth need to succeed in school and in life afterwards.\"\n\nIn my classroom, there were students with various diagnoses who spent most of their days in general education and were able to follow much of the curriculum. I have seen moments of enormous grace: when students connect over a beloved video game or when a child with autism will blurt out a question that their peers are too shy to ask. For a moment, they are a hero. I have also cringed as the same child picks their nose, not noticing that their peers are recoiling, or doesn't realize that the clothes they refuse to change may smell. The parent in me dies a little every time I catch the flicker of irritation on a student's face at the thought of having to work with a peer with disabilities. Or when I look out at lunch and see clusters of students all over campus and then one or two lone kids not really excluded, but not fluent in the language of adolescence. I have often wondered whom our well-intentioned efforts benefit. Do the kids really learn to be tolerant of people who are different than they are? Do kids with disabilities learn to live more easily in the world simply because they are surrounded by it?\n\nI know they sometimes feel left out, aware that there are sleepovers they don't attend and jokes they will never get. Are those painful feelings worth the experience of being in their local public school classroom? I've seen how students with complex needs can often confirm the biases of their peers by behaving strangely or having inappropriate outbursts in the classroom. It is one thing to be polite to a kid with disabilities in the context of your eighth-grade classroom; it is another to invite them to your birthday party.\n\nSo what would the best option be? I asked Bill Koski, the founder of Stanford's Youth and Education Law Project , about which country might have the most advanced models for raising children with disabilities. Finland, he said, thrives at addressing the needs of very different learners by focusing more on integration than inclusion. He explains that there is no \"labeling and classification\" of students, but \"three tiers of intervention\" for those who are struggling: general support, intensified support, and specialized support. \"As a result,\" he says, \"a fairly high percentage of Finnish students receive interventions for children with disabilities.\" No matter where or who they teach, good teachers do this instinctively, but what sets Finland apart is that it has normalized the concept that every learner has an individual style and those needs should be met by a highly qualified staff of teachers.\n\nOnly students with the most complex needs aren't in classrooms with their peers. A child like Mae would probably stay with her peers through early childhood and then move to a school or classroom where she could be taught life or vocation skills appropriate to her developmental level. One reason this system works is because it's well funded; the idea that every student needs to learn life skills and independence is seen as fundamental for all students-and a long-term benefit to society at large.\n\nWhen the focus of education is the integration of all learners, the idea that everyone is worthy of an education is reinforced for both students and families. Even without a national initiative, there are models for children like mine that could work in any school district. One of them is a school within a school. The current model in my county puts one teacher for children with disabilities at a school with their own classroom-an island of \"special\" in a world of general. What if there were three or four classrooms for children with disabilities on the site of a general education school? The focus could be on providing authentic inclusive experiences when it was appropriate and on fostering independent living skills. Perhaps the general education students could even work with their disabled peers on building those life skills, like, for instance, figuring out how to manage a small business or practice some simple cooking techniques.\n\nPaul Owens is the principal of Cedar Lane School in Fulton, Maryland. Sharing a campus with a middle school and located down the road from a high school, Cedar Lane offers a kind of school-within-a-school model. Owens described \"buses going back and forth all day\" and said all three school sites share a music and art teacher, allowing for the kind of authentic inclusion that my daughter experienced in last year's theater program. By having a disabilities school within a general education school, districts would be able to provide better oversight, consistency of staffing, sharing of institutional resources and knowledge, and authentic, thoughtful experiences of inclusion as opposed to just proximity.\n\nWhen I asked Owens what he would wish for Cedar Lane School, I expected his answers to be predictable: probably more money and more staff. Instead, he said, \"I wish my staff had more time for connection instead of compliance,\" which is to say spending more time building relationships with students and families and less time on the cumbersome paperwork that defines education for children with disabilities. He added that he wished they could be more effective in helping students transition out of Cedar Lane at the end of high school. For many students with disabilities, graduation from high school is the end of a clear path of state-run services. \"Once students graduate and leave Cedar Lane,\" he said, \"the availability and quality of services is inconsistent and support for students and families is very limited.\"\n\n\"Once students graduate and leave [school], the availability and quality of services is inconsistent and support for students and families is very limited.\"\n\nAs Congress is winding down this session, Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) have sponsored a measure to fully fund IDEA . I asked Huffman what this measure could mean for students with disabilities in this county. For him, the question is personal. He is also a \"special needs parent,\" he said. In the unlikely event that this bill were to pass, the burden on school districts and counties would be eased considerably, with the federal government funding up to 40 percent of the cost of educating students with disabilities, in contrast to the approximately 14.7 percent of costs that are covered today. This means that in the 2022-2023 school year, counties, states, and districts had to make up a $23.92 billion gap between what the federal government funded and what it would be funding if it committed to the originally intended 40 percent.\n\nAs Huffman said: \"Every student deserves a quality educational experience, regardless of their physical or developmental disabilities. What's been missing is the money to make that happen.\" Fully funding IDEA would signal to schools and families that the federal government is invested in students with disabilities. However, without high standards for training teachers, precise definitions of concepts like inclusion, and nationwide standards for services that children with disabilities receive, the system may still perpetuate inequity by offering the minimum to those who need it most.\n\nWhen we insist on the pseudo-inclusion of proximity, my daughter's humanity gets lost. Mae is not her age, nor should she become some symbol of vulnerability used to teach empathy to those fortunate enough to drive cars and spend hours on TikTok. She is a person who deserves an education that meets and acknowledges her specific needs, that focuses on best practices and authentic, inclusive experiences that help her develop the skills she will need to be as independent as possible. When parents fight for full inclusion, what they really are fighting for is the recognition that their child is as valuable as anyone else's. When the focus is compliance over consistency, when chronological age overshadows developmental needs, and when we say we want to foster empathy but instead confirm second-class citizenship on those for whom appropriate is all we are willing to concede, we send a clear message to children and families like mine about their value.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "I Think We're Being Lied to About DEI\n\nJoe Raedle/Getty\n\n\"DEI is dead.\"\n\nAt least that's what the headlines scream.\n\nI spent the last few weeks reading the public statements, leaked internal memos, and listed changes from the organizations that are reportedly rolling back their DEI programs - corporate giants like McDonald's, Meta, and Amazon - and what I found was a mismatch. These corporations aren't actually dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives outright. They're doing something more disingenuous, using, instead, an old-fashioned corporate sleight of hand: rebranding.\n\nA post shared by Mother Jones (@motherjonesmag)\n\nTheir statements indicate that they are, largely, keeping the DEI practices they've come to rely on for business success intact. Initiatives like supplier diversity, recruiting diverse talent into their ranks, and programs aimed at fostering belonging-DEI-will remain, though, perhaps, cloaked with a new name.\n\nOn the surface, this sleigh of hand might seem smart - avoid a Fox News backlash cycle while quietly continuing to do the work.\n\nBut I think the risks of these fake rollbacks may outweigh their potential benefits.\n\nThe issue isn't just that business leaders are carrying out symbolic DEI rollbacks to appease Trump and the MAGA mob. It's that by feigning submission to Trump and his base, these companies may be helping to legitimize Trump's dictatorial inclinations. They are reinforcing the illusion of Trump's power, effectively granting him authority he doesn't actually have. They are doing the work of manufacturing public consent for the executive overreach Trump dreams of getting away with.\n\nIn his book On Tyranny , Timothy Snyder warns against this exact kind of thing, calling it \"anticipatory obedience.\" In authoritarian regimes, Snyder warns, citizens (and more importantly, institutions) begin to conform to an expected order before they're forced to. They restrict themselves, bend their practices, and adjust their language to align with what they assume the authoritarian leader will approve of, often before the authoritarian even demands it.\n\nWhat could be seen as a savvy, strategic, business move by business leaders, may be helping to legitimize Trump's worst inclinations.\n\nSnyder reminder readers that \"[adapting] in this way is teaching power what it can do.\" As such, the solution is simple: stop pretending Trump is more powerful than he actually is. Call his bluff.

      "text": "At the Heritage Foundation, the Anti-DEI Crusade Is Part of a Bigger War\n\nKevin Roberts (right), president of The Heritage Foundation Mother Jones illustration; Drew Angerer/Getty\n\nLast week, I attended an event at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC, focused on \"seizing the moment to defeat DEI.\" I have written before about the right's use of the acronym as a codeword to attack social progress generally and the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 specifically. The panel at Heritage-a think tank that in recent years has taken a turn from Reagnite conservatism to Viktor Orbán-loving , Trumpian populism-was a particular strain of this provocation.\n\nThere is one kind of discussion over Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, with critics across the spectrum debating the efficacy and benefits of such programs. And then there is Heritage's view: that DEI is a hidden agenda pushed by the Black Lives Matter movement-the plan of \"committed Marxists nursed by an international network\" who are \"dedicated to overthrowing America and its entire system.\"\n\nThis ignores that, as Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor has written in the New Yorker , DEI is often a \"popular tool of the upper management of businesses and universities [adopted] after the so-called racial reckoning of the summer of 2020\" to quell frustrations-and \"hardly constitutes a theory, an ideology, or a political movement.\" (Many on the left even say it is, in fact, the corporatization of more radical strains of anti-racism.) But at Heritage and in other conservative circles, a potential compromising of leftist values is being touted as proof that the Reds have won and enshrined their agenda.\n\nSpeakers at the event made the case that DEI and Critical Race Theory (CRT) have metastasized like cancer across every fiber of American society: from high schools, to colleges, to corporations, and even to the military. In their view, left-leaning ideologies that pit oppressors against the oppressed are replacing empathy and patriotism with anger and divisiveness. DEI is a \" Frankenstein monster \" under the bed.\n\nBut it isn't all despair. They also celebrated that, as one of the moderators put it, \"DEI is on the run.\" Even Hollywood is turning against it, Mike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, claimed, saying that American Fiction -an adaptation of Percival Everett's 2001 novel Erasure -was an \"anti-DEI\" movie. \"I find that reading of the film and my novel incorrect and offensive,\" Everett told me in an email. \"The right-wing, in fascist form, will take the slightest critique of a complicated subject and run with it. It takes a lot to misread so badly, but the educated followers of such people will, sadly, buy into it.\" (Gonzalez clarified to me he \"should have said that the movie was anti-woke\" as it \"questioned many of the tired shibboleths of wokeism.\")\n\nThe conservative obsession with DEI should be taken seriously. At the event I attended, there was no direct mention of the Project 2025 playbook for a second Donald Trump term. But the panelists-a mix of Heritage Foundation fellows and conservative activists-revealed their aspirations to dismantle and divest institutions, and eliminate guardrails for social and racial progress.\n\nFor over two hours, they talked about taking the American Bar Association \"out of law schools,\" getting rid of \"agitators\" (aka chief diversity officers), and cutting off DEI programs entirely. If DEI was not ousted, funding should be pulled away from universities and towards, conveniently, organizations like the Heritage Foundation. \"If you hit them with the money they will change,\" Jay P. Greene, a Heritage Foundation senior research fellow, said of universities. \"And if you take some heads-so getting some presidents out-that also will produce change.\"\n\nIn Heritage's 920-page Project 2025 manifesto endorsed by about 100 right-wing organizations and filled with contributions by Trump loyalists, the group suggests the next conservative presidential administration \"must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for culture warriors\" and proposes removing terms such as gender equality, DEI, abortion, and reproductive rights from \"every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.\"\n\nIt also calls for: amending Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to prevent the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from collecting data on race and ethnicity; doing away with disparate impact legal theory; limiting the applications of the Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County that established Title VII protections for employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity; and rescinding regulations that bar discrimination based on \"sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and sex characteristics.\"\n\nChristopher Rufo-who helped launch an overt campaign to rebrand CRT and DEI and publicly pushed for the resignation of Harvard's former President Claudine Gay-didn't attend the event, but he was represented by his right-hand man and chief of staff Armen Tooloee. In true Rufo fashion , Tooloee laid out their \"deliberate strategy\" clearly: To publicize the \"most egregious\" examples of DEI in universities and \"create this illusion that we have eyes and ears everywhere.\" (Toolee said one of his tasks for doing this included doing Google searches on universities' domains for mentions of \"George Floyd.\")\n\n\"The strategy we had behind it was we timed it out to be going on during the legislative session in Florida specifically,\" Tooloee said of their initial focus on Florida and Texas universities, \"because we knew we had buy-in from the state government and from Governor [Ron] DeSantis that this was something they wanted to move on but they needed political cover basically because you know if you start targeting diversity and inclusion you're going to get an enormous backlash in the press.\"\n\nFor all the backlash, this histrionic crusade and \"gotcha\" denunciation of DEI has found powerful adherents. Most notably, billionaires Bill Ackman and Elon Musk. Now, Heritage and its allies are betting on the 2024 elections to take their playbook nationally. \"[We] get a bigger majority in the House, get the Senate, get a President Trump who really loves our country...,\" Rep. Burgess Owens of Utah said at the event. \"20 months and we'll be exposing so much more and turning this whole thing around.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump Shuts Down Diversity Programs Across Government\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds up a signed executive order in the Oval Office. Planet Pix/ZUMA\n\nFederal diversity, equity, and inclusion employees are set to be placed on paid administrative leave by the end this afternoon as part of President Donald Trump's executive order to put a stop to DEI programs in government agencies.\n\nAccording to a Tuesday memorandum from the US Office of Personnel Management, agencies are required to send a plan for \"executing a reduction-in-force action\"-in other words, layoffs -for their DEI employees.\n\nA separate but related executive order -titled \"Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity\"-argues that DEI programs violate civil rights laws by illegally enforcing \"dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences\" that \"deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement.\" The White House also claimed that these policies are discriminatory because they select based on \"how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing.\"\n\nThe Trump administration memo also seeks to coerce federal employees into informing on their agencies and colleagues. It instructs agency heads to tell employees via email: \"We are aware of efforts by some in government to disguise these programs by using coded or imprecise language. If you are aware of a change in any contract description or personnel position description since November 5, 2024 to obscure the connection between the contract and DEIA or similar ideologies, please report all facts and circumstances...within 10 days.\" The email template warns that any \"failure to report this information within 10 days may result in adverse consequences.\"\n\nBut Trump isn't content with just targeting federal employees. In a section of his executive order labeled \"Encouraging the Private Sector to End Illegal DEI Discrimination and Preferences,\" the president calls on the attorney general to submit \"specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles...that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences\" within 120 days.\n\nThis comes as companies like Meta , Walmart , and McDonald's have scaled back DEI initiatives in the wake of Trump's reelection and several conservative-backed lawsuits , which cite the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling curtailing affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nThe right's attacks on DEI programs is nothing new-anti-DEI activists like Christopher Rufo have been pushing against such initiatives since Trump's first term. The backlash has also appeared in places like Project 2025 , which argued that a 60-year-old anti-discrimination executive order should be rescinded because it improperly enables the government to force private employers to comply with \"novel anti-discrimination theories (such as sexual orientation and gender identity theories) that Congress had never imposed by statute.\" Trump revoked that landmark executive order-enacted by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965-on Tuesday.\n\n\"This attack on DEI is part of a larger backlash against racial justice efforts that ignited after the 2020 killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,\" Leah Watson, a senior staff attorney for the ACLU, wrote in February 2024 in response to dozens of bills from the right targeting DEI in higher education. According to Watson, DEI programs are necessary to \"repair decades of discriminatory policies and practices\" harming underrepresented individuals and communities.\n\nTrump is clearly unmoved by such arguments. \"This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life,\" he said in his Monday inauguration address. \"We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based.\" But the important question remains: merit-based for whom?\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "\n\nAs entirely expected by anybody who has spent time with white people, corporate America's post-George Floyd commitment to diversity was as enduring as a Kardashian's love of Pepsi . A new study of over 600 companies from workforce analytics firm Revelio Labs reports that \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\" officers, hired en masse after the protests following Floyd's murder, are now being quietly phased out of their positions. The study found that the attrition for DEI officers was 33 percent at the end of 2022, compared with 21 percent for non-DEI roles. For some corporations these days, \"diversity\" is basically a white lady with dreadlocks wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt and sharing her potato salad recipe with a white CEO ahead of their trip to Davos, which they've rebranded as a cookout in Switzerland. Again, none of this is surprising. Corporate America is never going to be a leader in diversity or inclusion, because most of the white plutocrats running corporations do not want to hear from diverse voices-or hire them. Business leaders can hardly handle being told no by the government of the United States and are willing to spend millions of dollars buying politicians to avoid this fate. People like that don't countenance being told they need to run their companies so as to be more welcoming to nonwhite people, and they certainly don't listen to that kind of advice from a Black person. That's why the entire conceit of a DEI officer is kind of ridiculous. It's not a surprise that these positions are being phased out, because it's a no-win job in the first place. DEI officers are tasked with everything from changing hiring practices at a company to holding racist managers accountable, and yet they have no actual power to do these things. If a CEO doesn't listen to the CFO, the company could wind up with huge fines from financial regulators. If a CEO doesn't listen to the general counsel, the company could wind up getting sued into oblivion. But if a CEO doesn't listen to the DEI officer, there's rarely any legal blowback. Sure, there are some human resource violations that could lead to employee lawsuits, but those are usually one-off instances, and anything truly dangerous to the company will likely get filtered through the legal department anyway. Unless the DEI officer becomes aware of a situation in which a diversity and inclusion issue could trigger litigation-for example, some kind of \"hostile workplace\" claim-their \"advice\" can safely be ignored. And it often is. Current Issue View our current issue Subscribe today and Save up to $129. Subscribe The only thing that can force a company to take diversity seriously is public outcry. Indeed, it was public outcry that led to so many of these DEI people getting hired in the first place. But the public is fickle and easily distracted, and people are often unwilling to put their money where their best intentions lie-myself included. The Revelio study specifically called out Twitter for its \"infamous diversity team layoffs\" after Elon Musk took over the company last fall. I believe the Proud Boys care more about diversity, at least cosmetically , than some of our favorite white South African social media moguls do. And yet I'm still (grudgingly) on that decrepit and increasingly racially hostile platform (for now). The disappearance of DEI staff is all the more notable as it comes amid nearly incessant mewling by corporate America, Republican politicians, and their conservative media sycophants about so-called \"woke\" culture. These days, the richest and most powerful white men in the US regularly cast themselves as victims of alleged \"mobs\" who won't let them do whatever it was they used to do in their \"good old days.\" But the most influential chief diversity officer in the world wouldn't be able to get these people to stop using the N-word at their golf clubs, and would get called \"too woke\" if they asked. The truth about business leaders is that they are followers. They will never lead the way to social change; they will only be dragged there, kicking and screaming, once they fear the rest of society will leave them behind. And society is not nearly ready or willing to lead these people toward more inclusive workplaces. Corporate America's abandonment of whatever promises it made during the George Floyd reckoning merely mirrors that of the government and voters, who stopped pretending to care about reform and social justice the minute the police finished crushing Black Lives Matter protests. Joe Biden ran on the promise to do something about police brutality, and then allowed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to get murdered by the mere possibility of a Senate filibuster. New York City (where a lot of these corporations have outposts) elected a jackboot former cop as mayor. What did you think Amazon was going to do with its diversity initiatives-be the last true keeper of the flame for equality and justice? This is a company that has to be shamed into giving its workers the right to pee. They'd only care about hiring more Black people if we had genetically larger bladders (we don't), and that's not the part of the urinary tract that causes white male fragility anyway. If you want to increase diversity in corporate America-as opposed to burning corporate America down and starting over with something not based on rapacious, smash-and-grab capitalism-you don't need to hire more powerless DEI officers; you need to have a more diverse set of corporate plutocrats. For that, you need to invest in nonwhite business owners, who would hire more diverse workforces if they had the capital to do so. But even that approach keeps white men in the power seat, because they control the flow of most of the capital in this country and thus determine whose business plan gets investments, and whose does not. And so I'm resigned to living in a world where white corporate leaders consider having to interview a Black candidate before hiring their white nephew an impingement on their First Amendment rights. The really nasty ones probably think diversity initiatives infringe on their Second Amendment rights, too. No amount of DEI officers was ever going to stop white business leaders from behaving this way, but phasing them out is an indication that it's no longer politically necessary to feign concern.\n\nFor some corporations these days, \"diversity\" is basically a white lady with dreadlocks wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt and sharing her potato salad recipe with a white CEO ahead of their trip to Davos, which they've rebranded as a cookout in Switzerland.

But even that approach keeps white men in the power seat, because they control the flow of most of the capital in this country and thus determine whose business plan gets investments, and whose does not. And so I'm resigned to living in a world where white corporate leaders consider having to interview a Black candidate before hiring their white nephew an impingement on their First Amendment rights. The really nasty ones probably think diversity initiatives infringe on their Second Amendment rights, too. No amount of DEI officers was ever going to stop white business leaders from behaving this way, but phasing them out is an indication that it's no longer politically necessary to feign concern.\n\nIf you want to increase diversity in corporate America-as opposed to burning corporate America down and starting over with something not based on rapacious, smash-and-grab capitalism-you don't need to hire more powerless DEI officers; you need to have a more diverse set of corporate plutocrats.

But, interestingly, financial documents reviewed by The Nation show that McMahon's foundation has contributed millions of dollars to organizations that espouse views in opposition to the 47th president.\n\nThese donations seem to conflict with her public right-wing stances, even as Trump continues to demand personal and party loyalty among his political appointees. The president has rapidly formed a new coalition-among his cabinet, on Capitol Hill, in the halls of the West Wing, and beyond-centered on hostility toward the Department of Education and DEI programs nationally.\n\nWith a confirmation hearing scheduled for February 13, McMahon submitted financial disclosure documents listing her as the director, secretary, treasurer, and member of the Vince and Linda McMahon Family Foundation. Tax returns for this foundation show a long history of philanthropy by the McMahons, including donations to various education-focused organizations.\n\nSince 2011, the foundation has donated at least $1.97 million to Achievement First, a string of charter schools in New England primarily serving students of color. While Trump has publicly signaled his support for charter schools, he has moved to cut off all federal funding from schools which promote what he calls \"discriminatory equity ideology.\" Achievement First, though, has a multiyear history of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and opposing Trump's actions during his first term, including his threats to immigration protections.\n\nAchievement First has described DEI as \"a philosophy that we live and breathe.\"\n\n\"Diversity, equity, and inclusion aren't just guidelines that sit in some employee handbook,\" their website reads. The network also explicitly says it exists \"to address the legacy of racism in education. We reflect and talk about the role race plays in our work, experiences, and decisions. We strive to be constantly anti-racist in our words and actions.\" In response to the president's latest battle against DEI programs, many education institutions, which receive billions in federal funding from the Department of Education, have scrubbed or altered their public stances on diversity programs. But Achievement First has not, as of this writing.\n\nMcMahon's foundation has contributed more than $800,000 since the organization added a DEI policy to its website in 2019.\n\nWhen Trump attempted to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals during his first term, Achievement First issued a statement condemning the threat, promising to keep the immigration status of its students confidential. The group also sent members of their lobbying team to Capitol Hill to implore members of Congress to oppose Trump's agenda. That year, McMahon donated $250,000 to the organization.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court outlawed race-based affirmative action in college admissions, Achievement First signed on to a 2023 joint statement calling the ruling \"devastating.\" McMahon donated $250,000 that year.\n\nThese ideals stand in opposition to Trump's own platform and the purported values of the America First Policy Institute (AFPI), a right-wing think tank whose board McMahon chairs, which praised the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nMcMahon's foundation has also donated $125,000 to ConnCAN, a Connecticut-based nonprofit advocating for increased public school funding and DEI training in educator hiring. Trump and McMahon's AFPI have refocused their attention away from public school funding to \"school choice,\" which allows parents to use taxpayer funding allocated for public education at private institutions.\n\nTrump himself has also called for schools to embrace \"patriotic values\" and a cut in funding for schools teaching \"inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content.\" It is unclear what topics this would encompass.\n\nThe White House, Department of Education, AFPI, Achievement First, and ConnCAN all did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe office of Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who sits on the committee overseeing McMahon's Thursday hearing, declined to comment on the nominees ahead of any confirmation votes. The committee's chairman, Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEven with donations to these liberal-leaning groups, McMahon has been a power player in Republican circles for years. After two failed campaigns for the US Senate, she assumed a place inside the Beltway as a Republican mega donor, relying on deep pockets lined from her time as president and CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment. After serving as the top-ranking official in the Small Business Administration during Trump's first term, she stepped down to run a pro-Trump super PAC. If confirmed, she has vowed to resign from her foundation.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nIf she secures enough votes to become secretary, one of McMahon's main objectives will be to \"put herself out of a job,\" Trump said last week. Fulfilling a longtime campaign promise, Trump is reportedly taking the first steps toward shutting down the Department of Education.\n\nIn late January, employees at the department were placed on administrative leave in an effort to comply with Trump's executive orders on DEI, according to a letter obtained by The Nation . The union representing the employees has said that approximately 100 of their members have been put on leave. Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, confirmed that they \"are evaluating staffing in line with the commitment to prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in schools and putting student outcomes above special interests.\"\n\nOn Sunday prior to the Super Bowl, Trump warned that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency will target the Department of Education-the latest episode in the billionaire's weeks-long crusade to reshape the federal government. On Monday evening, DOGE announced that it had allegedly cut nearly $1 billion in contracts and grants disbursed by the Department of Education.\n\n\"By selecting Linda McMahon, Donald Trump is showing that he could not care less about our students' futures,\" National Education Association president Becky Pringle said in a statement. \"McMahon's only mission is to eliminate the Department of Education and take away taxpayer dollars from public schools.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Among other provisions, the orders overturn affirmative action regulations and empower the DOJ to identify (and likely investigate) publicly traded corporations and other private industries, including legal and medical associations, that continue \"egregious\" DEI practices.\n\nThis hostility to diversity programs is nothing new; after all, much of the right has been itching to resegregate America ever since Brown v. Board of Education , and policies like affirmative action were already dead or on life support thanks to decades-long efforts from conservative politicians and judges. But Trump's targeting of DEI is a particularly direct attack-one that serves many political purposes.\n\nFor one, the focus on DEI provides an energizing boogeyman for the GOP base, like the attacks on critical race theory and \"wokeness\" in recent years and affirmative action and \"political correctness\" before that. It also gives legal cover to employers and industries that discriminate against Black, Latino, and women job applicants. In addition, by overturning affirmative action regulations, DEI bans limit the real, material progress of non-white men in the workforce and in higher education.\n\nImplicit in the Republican project is that white men have suffered primarily because of an increasingly diverse population and job market, and there's only so much prosperity that can go around. Right-wing attacks are an attempt to keep us (including myself, a Black woman) in our rightful place, rolling back the clock to a Jim Crow era when discrimination was legal in the United States, it was socially acceptable for majority-white spaces to be antagonistic to non-white people, and material progress was limited for people of color. No one with a sense of justice wants that.\n\nYet even as we rightly condemn this patently racist right-wing agenda, that shouldn't prevent us from taking a hard look at what DEI has and has not achieved.\n\nThere's a sound argument that, even with all its limits, having DEI, at least in some sectors, is better than not having it. The lack of diversity in some historically anti-Black professional service industries, like law and medicine, could mean life or death for Black men and women who are unfairly subject to capital punishment and are more likely to die from pregnancy , with racial bias among lawyers, judges, and doctors often a contributing factor.\n\nBut civil rights advocates know that, while DEI, and affirmative action more broadly, is a tool that could give groups who have been subjected to America's racism and sexism a fair shot at being successful (and, in some cases, staying alive), it is not a panacea that should be defended uncritically. We can't avoid the reality of many diversity initiatives, particularly in corporate America: they often allow institutions to performatively support \"equity\" with little substance behind it, advancing a nominal percentage of Black, women, and Latino professionals while working-class peers continue to be left behind by exploitative corporate practices.\n\nDespite the Republican fearmongering around the term, DEI is a relatively modern phrase for long-standing diversity practices in American institutions. There are instances of the term in academia in the 2000s, when predominantly white colleges and universities created offices of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\n\nThese schools weren't catering to unqualified students and professors. They were attempting to address historical practices that frequently excluded qualified Black applicants and other marginalized groups. They offered programs and support for students, staffers, and academics who may have felt adrift in a sea of \"good ol' boy\" social networks, legacy admissions , and underqualified student-athletes that make professional jobs, leadership positions , and higher education at elite schools disproportionately white and male.\n\nThat emphasis on elite spaces meant that, when the Black Lives Matter movement peaked after the murder of George Floyd, corporate America found DEI initiatives to be a handy way to both performatively commit to diversity and help suppress more radical pushes for change.\n\nWhile left activists called for police defunding and carceral abolition, corporate America shifted to DEI , watering down the calls for a fundamental transformation of America's police state to focus on diversifying the C-suite. Racial diversity in corporate boards would not have saved George Floyd, or the millions of Black people who have seen the racial wealth gap widen , income inequality persist , and incarceration rates nearly triple since the civil rights movement.\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nEven assuming that corporations were well-intentioned by scrambling to support diversity in the racial \"reckoning\" that followed 2020's social unrest, DEI has still shown limited utility. Despite Trump's hand-wringing about \"dangerous\" and \"pernicious\" diversity programs dooming the country, Fortune 500 board seats for underrepresented racial and ethnic groups grew by less than 5 percentage points from 2020 to 2022 (17.5 percent to 22.2), even though these groups represented 41 percent of the population. In 2024, only 1.6 percent of Fortune 500 companies had a Black CEO.\n\nThe real bottom line? Diversifying a small segment of the professional managerial class may be good PR, but it can't be confused with one key element of DEI: equity.\n\nRainbow capitalism, something even Richard Nixon supported , is not liberation. Having a Black or Latino business leader oversee a publicly traded company doesn't make it any less exploitative. Having a woman CEO doesn't mean companies will shift from exploitative gig work that fosters poor working conditions and poverty wages for the Black and brown workers overrepresented in the sector. Creating more shelf space for a handful of Black business owners doesn't mean companies will suddenly implement living wages for their disproportionately female and POC retail workers . It is the requirement of corporations to maximize shareholder value, no matter how harmful their practices are to the masses of workers. Diversifying the leaders of those corporations doesn't change that reality.\n\nDonald Trump obviously isn't attacking DEI with these considerations. The president, like many of his Republican colleagues, is evidently more animated by identity-based grievances and focused on exacting revenge on political enemies than doing anything real about the cost of living for the lower-income voters who voted for him.\n\nBut it's not enough simply to hope for a reversal of Trump's executive orders. We have to push for more. While poor and working-class Americans of all races will suffer under this administration, corporate America can't be left off the hook for the harms they've exacted upon workers long before Trump came to power. Any real commitment to diversity promotion will address both the politicians who weaponize DEI to fire off their racist political agenda and private industries that performatively use it to shield themselves from critiques of their widespread, anti-worker business practices.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

      "text": "The War on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nWith Donald Trump's return to the White House, the long-held conservative grudge against affirmative action and programs designed to upend the effects of racial discrimination has transformed into a witch hunt. In the past decade, conservatives have cycled through attacks on wokeness , affirmative action, critical race theory, and the diversity-equity-and-inclusion initiatives known, now pejoratively, as D.E.I. The target has moved, but the message is the same: anti-racism is divisive and discriminatory and should end at all costs.\n\nToday, D.E.I. is in the crosshairs. Its elasticity has made it vulnerable to a wide-ranging blame game. D.E.I. can be many things, from efforts to increase the diversity of a workplace through hiring initiatives to the creation of affinity groups that bring underrepresented workers together. It may also include workplace trainings on topics such as racism, gender discrimination, and sexual harassment. Undoubtedly, there has been ham-fisted D.E.I. programming that is intrusive or even alienating, making workers feel that they are being told what to think or how to feel. But, for the most part, it is a relatively benign practice meant to increase diversity, while also sending a message that workplaces should be fair and open to everyone.\n\nThe Lede Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nAnd yet, in the hands of the right, D.E.I. has been twisted into something nefarious, becoming the discrimination it seeks to weed out. Trump said as much in an interview this past spring: \"I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country. . . . I don't think it would be a very tough thing to address, frankly. But I think the laws are very unfair right now.\" The comment reflected the apparent mood of the fifty-six per cent of Republicans who, in a poll, said they believed that white people are discriminated against on the basis of their skin color. (Numerous studies have shown that most of the benefits of D.E.I. have accrued to white women. A report on board diversity from the consulting firm Deloitte and the Alliance for Board Diversity found that \"white women made the largest percentage increase in board seats gained in both the Fortune 100 and Fortune 500.\" According to recent data by the job-search site Zippia, more than seventy-five per cent of \"chief diversity officers\" are white, and more than half of them are white women.)\n\nWhat critiques of D.E.I. tend to imply, but never quite openly say, is that competent white people are being replaced with incompetent Black people. Just as universities were blamed for displacing qualified and deserving Asian American students with unqualified and undeserving Black students in the lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court's sacking of affirmative action , liberals are now accused of compromising the health and safety of the public to appease the special-interest demographic of incompetent and unqualified Black workers. D.E.I. has been blamed for the collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, the wildfires in Los Angeles, and the midair collision of a helicopter and a plane that killed sixty-seven people in Washington, D.C. Trump is using D.E.I. to scythe through the federal government's disproportionately Black and female workforce and to upend programs that he and his adviser Elon Musk declare to be wasteful and superfluous. Among federal health workers, Black employees have reportedly been the focus of a right-wing \"D.E.I. watch list,\" which published their names and salaries alongside their alleged D.E.I. crimes.\n\nThe veracity of the claims should be considered in light of who is making them. That Trump and Musk are suddenly the voice of anti-discrimination efforts makes a mockery of the idea. Throughout Trump's first Presidency, he made racist and disparaging comments about people of color. He once denounced a Black member of Congress, the late Elijah Cummings, as a \"bully,\" while describing his district in Baltimore as a \"rat and rodent infested mess\" and a \"dangerous and filthy place.\" More recently, Trump appointed Darren Beattie to a State Department position; Beattie was fired from the first Trump Administration, in 2018, for speaking at a conference attended by white supremacists. Two of Musk's government staffers were found to have made openly white-supremacist comments; one resigned and, a day later, Musk said that he intended to rehire him.\n\nMusk's Tesla has faced multiple lawsuits for workplace discrimination during the past decade. In 2024, a California state judge ruled that a class-action lawsuit against the company, involving almost six thousand Black workers, could move forward to determine whether Tesla had a \"pattern or practice of failing to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring\" at its plant in Fremont. In the original case filing, sworn statements from more than two hundred Black former employees and contractors characterized the production floor as a \"hotbed for racism,\" including bigoted graffiti and the use of slurs. This led the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to also sue Tesla, alleging that the company had subjected Black employees at the Fremont plant \"to severe or pervasive racial harassment and has created and maintained a hostile, race-based work environment.\" This past March, a federal judge ruled that the E.E.O.C.'s lawsuit could go forward. (Tesla has denied wrongdoing.)\n\nNearly ten months after the E.E.O.C. lawsuit was filed, the Trump Administration has removed two of the agency's three Democratic commissioners, leaving it without the quorum necessary to function. One of those commissioners was Jocelyn Samuels, who was appointed by Trump in 2020. She has said that she was told she was removed because \"my embrace of radical ideology and my position on D.E.I. and the permissibility of it make me unfit to serve.\"\n\nThe dismantling of the E.E.O.C. appears to be the fulfillment of a grudge. In other ways, these attacks are the crescendo of a long campaign to undermine federal protections against racial discrimination. This is what was significant about Trump's decision to reach back to 1965 to rescind Lyndon Johnson's Executive Order 11246. Issued just weeks after the Voting Rights Act was signed into law, and little more than a year after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the order extended the prohibition against racial discrimination in employment to federal contractors. Unlike D.E.I., which is typically voluntary and aimed at changing company culture or social dynamics, Johnson's order required private contractors doing work on behalf of the federal government to \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\"\n\nMonths before Johnson signed the executive order, he delivered a commencement address at Howard University that underlined the meaning of the civil-rights legislation he was signing into law, and the additional measures his Administration was to undertake. Having been pushed every step of the way by the civil-rights movement and uprisings in Harlem, Philadelphia, Rochester, and beyond, Johnson connected the Voting Rights Act to his efforts to pursue legislation that would foster economic opportunity for Black people. He described freedom as \"the right to share, share fully and equally, in American society-to vote, to hold a job, to enter a public place, to go to school.\" But, he continued, famously, \"Freedom is not enough. You do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying: Now you are free to go where you want, and do as you desire, and choose the leaders you please.\" In what he considered to be \"the next and the more profound stage of the battle for civil rights,\" Johnson went on, \"We seek not just freedom but opportunity. We seek not just legal equity but human ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a fact and equality as a result.\"\n\nThe denial of racism as a real and existing social phenomenon isn't for its own sake, but to justify the end of anti-poverty programs that have disproportionately served the Black poor and working class. Two decades after Johnson declared that freedom was not enough, in part to inspire support for his War on Poverty, Ronald Reagan decried those efforts, dismissing the entirety of the Great Society and the Johnson welfare state. In a 1987 briefing on his Administration's latest welfare-reform proposal, Reagan said, \"The Federal Government does not know how to get people off of welfare and into productive lives. We had a war on poverty-poverty won. . . . So, we don't plan to serve up another program from Washington.\"\n\nThe end of affirmative action, in 2023, has helped pave the way for this latest effort to claim that racism doesn't exist in any systematic way and to strip away institutions' ability to challenge it. Indeed, the Court's decision gets at the heart of whether race and racism deserve any particular consideration in addressing inequality and disadvantage. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, equated reparative measures that take race into account with the racial discrimination that gave rise to them, delivering the suffocating statement, \"Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling contributes to an atmosphere where racism continues to lose its force to make sense of the persistence of racial inequality and disadvantage. Justice Clarence Thomas, in a concurring opinion, seemed to relish attacking the dissent of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, all but denying that racism is a significant factor in the particular hardships that surround Black life. Jackson, the first Black woman and only the third Black person ever confirmed to the Court, described \"gulf-sized race-based gaps\" between Black and white people in the United States. Thomas described Jackson as \"irrational,\" dismissing the possibility of any \"causal link\" between racial discrimination and an endless list of disparities separating Black people and their white peers, in health, wealth, and well-being. Thomas claimed that disparities don't \"prove anything.\" Instead, he celebrated the \"great accomplishments of black Americans, including those who succeeded despite long odds,\" adding the homily: \"What matters is not the barriers they face, but how they choose to confront them.\"\n\nFor all of Thomas's smugness, it also cut to a certain truth about the U.S. today. The spectacular visibility of a Black political class, a Black élite, and the Black celebrities who power American culture has created powerful examples of that unique social mobility in the United States which has historically anchored the American dream. Thomas did not need to lecture Brown on the power of overcoming barriers, as she made clear during a ceremony celebrating her confirmation. \"It has taken two hundred and thirty-two years and a hundred and fifteen prior appointments for a Black woman to be selected to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. But we've made it. All of us,\" she said. \"Our children are telling me that they see now more than ever that here in America anything is possible.\"\n\nBut it is also true that the existence of these highly successful Black people has obscured the harsh fact that tens of millions of ordinary Black people suffer from high rates of poverty, homelessness, hunger, and other measures of deprivation. For example, though the U.S. is currently experiencing historic lows of unemployment, Black workers still face nearly twice the rate of unemployment of white workers. A 2021 study based on an experiment that sent out eighty-three thousand fictitious job applications with random characteristics to the hundred and eight largest employers in the United States found that \"distinctively black names\" reduced the \"probability of employer contact.\" According to the study, twenty-three of the employers were \"found to discriminate against Black applicants.\" In 2022, Wells Fargo was forced to pay eight million dollars to more than thirty thousand Black job applicants to settle a claim based on a Department of Labor lawsuit, which alleged that the bank interviewed Black applicants for jobs that had already been filled in order to fulfill diversity requirements. The United States is awash in racism even as some Black people have risen to the highest ranks within our country-including the Presidency.\n\nWhat gets lost amid complaints from both the left and the right about D.E.I. is that the proliferation of these programs was in response to a real problem. So, too, was affirmative action, though it was also denounced as wrongheaded and ineffectual. The D.E.I. efforts loudly trumpeted by corporate America were largely intended to shield those organizations from criticism at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement. But the broader public discussions of race and equity at that moment brought to the surface ongoing inequities in the housing market and in public-health practices. They renewed conversations about why Black people were disproportionately exposed to the coronavirus as \"essential workers,\" even as their lives were treated with little regard. They raised awareness about Black women's vulnerability to eviction and revealed that the vast majority of Black and brown students attend schools that are in drastic need of repair. There were discussions about the racial wealth gap and how it came to be, along with widely publicized policy proposals about how to address it. There were front-page stories about how racism in home appraisals had cost Black families, collectively, billions of dollars.\n\nIt is easy to dismiss D.E.I. programs as ineffectual, because in many ways they have been. But that raises the question of why the right is so determined to undermine and dismiss them. It is because these widely varied efforts represent a commitment to integration, to opposing bigotry and racism, to offering an invitation to belong. Maybe that seems corny in our deeply cynical and dour society, but given the pervasiveness of loneliness and depression, we should look at improving these efforts, not subverting them.

      "text": "An Award Show for Inclusion\n\nTwo nights after the Emmy Awards, Keli Lee, the managing director of international content and talent at ABC Studios International, faced a dilemma. She had to choose between accepting an award in Hollywood for helping to cast people of color in major television roles-Sofia Vergara in \"Modern Family,\" Kerry Washington in \"Scandal,\" Viola Davis in \"How to Get Away with Murder\"-and flying to London to make a presentation to executives of the Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC.\n\nStanding outside the beige ballroom of the Loews Hollywood Hotel, an hour before the Adcolor Awards ceremony, Lee smoothed her hair and said, \"The hurricane cancelled the flight I was supposed to take tomorrow morning, so I'm flying out tonight.\" She would have to head to LAX just as the ceremony was beginning.\n\n\"Oh, shit, which hurricane? Maria or Jose?\" a man wearing a bow tie encrusted with tiny mirrors asked. He was Bing Chen, a former YouTube executive.\n\n\"Whatever one,\" Lee said.\n\n\"There are so many now,\" Chen said. He held up an iPhone to film her making an acceptance speech, to be played on a monitor while she was on her way to the airport. The Adcolor Awards commend diversity in media and advertising and give trophies to people more accustomed to conference rooms than to red carpets. In her remarks, Lee, who is forty-six, recalled emigrating from South Korea, assimilating with help from \" Charlie's Angels \" and \"The Love Boat,\" and wondering why TV stars were mostly white when the people around her were not. When she finished recording, she was joined by Anjula Acharia, a talent manager and venture capitalist, who complimented her pink gown, which fastened at one shoulder with a bow of Oldenburgian proportions. \"I'm going to change in the car,\" Lee said. \"I've done that a few times. I scare the drivers.\"\n\nAcharia and Lee walked a short red carpet. Nadja Bellan-White, an Ogilvy & Mather executive vice-president based in London, grabbed Lee's elbow. \"I hear you have to leave,\" Bellan-White said. Like Lee, she was receiving a Legend Award that evening. (Earlier this year, as part of a conservation ad campaign, Bellan-White created a Tinder profile for the world's only remaining male northern white rhinoceros, who has a low sperm count; more than two million people swiped right on him, raising a hundred thousand dollars for researching alternative reproduction methods.)\n\nGrabbing a pot sticker from a passing tray, Lee told Bellan-White about her presentation the next morning. \"And you don't get to where we are without that shit,\" Bellan-White said. \"You gotta go. The higher up you are, the worse it is. People are gunning for you. I was on conference calls last night at 3 A . M ., 4 A . M ., 5 A . M ., because even though you're here , they've gotta know that this ,\" she gestured around at the crowd, \"means nothing.\"\n\n\"I'm up for the challenge,\" Lee said. \"Though I'm a little sleepy.\"\n\n\"I was sick yesterday,\" Bellan-White said. \"Because, after the long-ass flight to get here, I was done.\"\n\nPrior to plotting the international expansion of ABC Studios-Lee oversees shows in the U.K., Australia, China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy-in 2001, she conceived of ABC's diversity showcase, an incubator for minority talent. \"I was in a position to think about what's on television, who's on television, why aren't we seeing people who look like us?\" Lee said. \"If this is a talent-pipeline issue, how do we fix that? Let's go audition seven hundred people in New York and L.A. and try to find the best fourteen to twenty to nurture, develop, and create opportunities for them.\" The showcase gave Lupita Nyong'o, Gina Rodriguez, and Chadwick Boseman their starts.\n\n\"She created my son!\" a man in burgundy velvet shouted. He was Jeff Yang, and his thirteen-year-old son, Hudson, stars in the sitcom \"Fresh Off the Boat.\"\n\n\"She created everybody,\" Acharia said. Her client Priyanka Chopra stars in \"Quantico.\"\n\n\"Hey, we're going to take a quick picture with all the Asians,\" Yang said, pulling at Lee.\n\n\"Are South Asians included?\" Acharia asked.\n\nA bell dinged, beckoning guests to their seats. As Lee prepared to leave, Chen said that he'd miss her at the after-party. Lee and Acharia spent the end of August club-hopping through Ibiza together. Chen said, \"When I met Keli, I was, like, 'This girl knows how to party, and she's legit.' She can get shit-faced right now, but she'll be up and running tomorrow, you'd better believe that!\"\n\nLee shot him a look. \"I never get shit-faced,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm waiting for you to be Iger,\" Chen said. Robert Iger, the Disney C.E.O. to whom Lee reports, is stepping down in 2019. \"That's not why I talk to you, by the way. I'm homies with you because I like you.\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "What's the Point of Trump's War on D.E.I.?\n\nIf Donald Trump's first days in the White House, in 2017, were about shock and awe-his haunting \"American carnage\" speech, the Muslim ban-the 2025 version, at least initially, felt more dutiful, a bit weirder, but ultimately not quite as scary. Trump 45 talked about a \"new vision\" to \"govern our land\" and promised his voters \"you will never be ignored again.\" Trump 47 seemed bored for the first half of his inaugural speech, then rambled on about Panama, Mars, and \"the electric-vehicle mandate.\" The flurry of executive orders that followed might have made for good headlines because they touched on culture-war topics such as trans rights and D.E.I., but outside of a few notable exceptions- withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and curbing renewable-energy programs-Trump's first round of legislation mostly seemed like repurposed archival footage from his campaign, chopped up and stretched out into a new, thin form. The Gulf of Mexico is now the Gulf of America. Denali is once again Mount McKinley, because we're not cancelling dead white men anymore, especially not for some tribe . D.E.I. is over at federal agencies and in the military. Now please go fight among yourselves about all this culture-war stuff while we deregulate everything.\n\nThis period of unhinged, but perhaps not so consequential, Trump theatre lasted until Monday, when his Office of Management and Budget released a memo freezing all federal spending \"that may be implicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.\" We still don't know the extent of the order, its legality, or who, exactly, it will affect, but the brazenness of the move suggests that Trump intends to run the country as a petty despot who values fealty to him over allegiance to the country. (The White House later rescinded the order, while also saying that the spending review remains in \"full force and effect.\" A judge has paused its implementation until February 3rd.)\n\nGiven the potential seriousness of Trump's freeze, I think it's good practice, especially after the recurring freakouts between 2016 and 2020, to point out when Trump mostly seems to be doing something for purely symbolic reasons and when he's actually trying to get something done. The first Trump Administration and the constant stream of stories that ended in Russiagate ultimately desensitized much of the public to the actual bad things he was doing, disoriented the audience's priorities, and might have even led to a quiet backlash or at least a sense of disbelief that Trump could actually be that bad. The renaming of bodies of water and mountains, for example, is easy enough to cast aside as Trumpian bluster, but what about the handful of executive orders Trump signed regarding D.E.I. which included the end of all such programs in the military and the federal government as well as the repeal of a 1965 executive order that prohibited federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of race, gender, and national origin? It's still unclear how many employees will lose their jobs-the executive order calls for a list of everyone who might work in some D.E.I.-related endeavor and a review, which could either mean that everyone who has said a word about racial or gender equality or diversity will be out of work, or it could just mean that after a few high-profile firings of D.E.I. officers this list never really gets made, the review never happens, and everyone moves on to the next dimension of the culture war.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions two years ago, the outrage from liberals and Democratic elected officials was relatively muted. There are many possible explanations for this, most notably that perhaps the people who were the maddest about the decision didn't have the same platforms as the people who either shrugged or cheered it on. But over all it seemed like much of the public agreed with Sandra Day O'Connor who, in an earlier ruling on affirmative action in 2003, famously said that affirmative action should not really be necessary in twenty-five years. The clock, it seemed, had run out. Similarly, I suspect most Americans won't miss D.E.I., which has become another digital training you have to finish before you get your first paycheck and a way for management to control what their workers say. (I doubt they'll cheer on its end, either, largely because I don't think most Americans really care one way or another. A recent poll by YouGov, in fact, found around half of Americans had a somewhat or very favorable opinion of D.E.I. programs, and less than thirty per cent said that they had a very unfavorable opinion.) This isn't really the fault of the employees who work in these programs. I'm sure most of them envisioned something a bit more radical or at least useful when they signed up, but, if you're a college graduate with a humanities degree and want to make a salary while still vaguely doing something that deals with reducing racism in America, D.E.I. is one of the few possible career paths. The problem, at a grand scale, is that D.E.I.'s malleability and its ability to survive in pretty much every setting, whether it's a nearby public school or the C.I.A., means that it has to be generic and ultimately inoffensive, which means that, in the end, D.E.I. didn't really satisfy anyone.\n\nWhat it did was provide a safety valve (I am speaking about D.E.I. in the past tense because I do think it will quickly be expunged from the private sector as well) for institutions that were dealing with racial and social-justice problems. If you had a protest on campus over any issue having to do with \"diverse students\" who wanted \"equity,\" that now became the provenance of D.E.I. officers who, if they were doing their job correctly, would defuse the situation and find some solution-oftentimes involving a task force-that made the picket line go away. A couple years ago, a D.E.I. officer at Stanford Law School went viral after she supported students who were shutting down a conservative guest speaker. I recall watching the video and feeling both a bit annoyed at yet another instance of pointless and ultimately counterproductive \"resistance\" and also a bit sad because it was clear that the officer didn't understand the point of her job. She wasn't hired to actually join the protest against the conservative speaker. Her job was to intervene, give the students a \"space\" to vent, and, ultimately, find a solution that didn't end with Stanford Law going viral for an instance of campus cancel culture.\n\nThere's also the argument that the growth of D.E.I. offices, especially after the George Floyd protests, led to an aggressive and potentially illegal push to hire racial minorities throughout corporate America and academia, which, in turn, led to an overextension and corruption of the original goal of enforcing fair hiring practices to insure that people of all kinds would not be discriminated against. But this narrative also fundamentally misunderstands the purpose of D.E.I. within large institutions. What happened in many workplaces across the country after 2020 was that the people in charge were either genuinely moved by the Floyd protests or they were scared. Both the inspired and the terrified built out a D.E.I. infrastructure in their workplaces. These new employees would be given titles like chief diversity officer or C.D.O., which made it seem like it was part of the C-suite, and would be given a spot at every table, but much like at Stanford Law, their job was simply to absorb and handle any race stuff that happened. D.E.I. didn't hire itself at Meta. It was embraced by the company's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who gleefully ended his company's program earlier this month, signalling to the White House and investors that the days of wokeness at Meta were over. This was the final purpose of D.E.I. programs in corporate America-when the political winds changed this past November, D.E.I. became the convenient fall guy; the best way to signal that you never wanted to do all that woke stuff in the first place was to fire your D.E.I. staff and blame them for forcing you down the wrong path.\n\nTrump, I believe, is doing something similar at a grand scale. He is taking a relatively powerless program, vilifying it, and using its dissolution as proof that he has single-handedly ended the woke era. The clearest example came on Thursday when he outrageously blamed \"diversity\" for the tragic airline crash in Washington. When his O.M.B. gambit turned into a legal and political disaster this past week, Trump's Administration retreated to a familiar, safe space. The funding freeze, they said, was only for the parts of the federal government directly affected by Trump's earlier executive orders, the most prominent being D.E.I. He and his Administration are wielding the word \"diversity\" both as a slur and an excuse for everything that goes wrong in this country.\n\nI suppose it's possible that the elimination of D.E.I. might take away what was a dead-end solution and recommit people to more fruitful forms of protest and dissent, but politics rarely follows such a linear and satisfying script. I also do not think the end of D.E.I. will derail the desires of employers and their workers to have diverse workforces, nor do I think Trump will pay much attention to any of this down the line. On Wednesday, Tom Malinowski , a former congressman and diplomat, pointed out that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency had just bragged about ending \"DEI scholarships for Burma.\" The scholarships in question are through U.S.A.I.D. and granted to young people who are fighting against the dictatorship in Burma, which, as Malinowski noted, has long been a priority in Washington for Democrats and Republicans, including the new Secretary of State, Marco Rubio. \"It looks like these geniuses are just going through grant awards and killing anything that uses words like 'diversity' and 'inclusion,' even though in countries where ethnic and religious minorities are murdered and persecuted, these have long been American goals,\" Malinowski speculated.\n\nOne can imagine Musk and his staff hitting Control+F on a database of grants for the word \"equity,\" cancelling any search returns without reading what they're actually for, and then screenshotting the paperwork to post on Twitter. But this snickering for clout doesn't mean there shouldn't be a great deal of alarm. These first two weeks of Trump's Presidency have made it clear that his main priority, at least for now, is controlling federal funding and using it to enrich his allies and to harm his political enemies. In California, he told Gavin Newsom that he would make aid for cleaning up the devastating fires in Los Angeles conditional, in part, on the development of a voter-I.D. program. This past Friday, seventeen inspectors general were fired, which effectively removed independent oversight at a multitude of federal agencies. On Monday, the Department of Justice fired around a dozen employees who had worked with Jack Smith, the special counsel assigned to prosecute Trump, saying that they could no longer be trusted. Trump's endgame has started to reveal itself and it will not be coming through the tired culture war we have all been fighting for the past decade but rather through the bureaucracy. Whatever rises to enforce or resist it will not sit nicely in a corporate or academic office, nor will it be neatly summarized through words like \"woke\" or \"anti-woke,\" or the endless campus wars. The next four years, instead, will be filled with true extremism on both the left and the right that will make supposedly out-of-control D.E.I. feel like a quaint company retreat in comparison.\n\nSo, yes, the war on D.E.I. is almost certainly a catchall scapegoat meant to distract from Trump's larger plans to gut the federal government, but I also can't imagine it will hold the public's attention, just as a similar focus on racial politics in academia and élite corporations did not work for Ron DeSantis during his failed run for President. The American public elected Donald Trump, but between social-justice warriors, \"woke,\" and D.E.I., the right has now been fighting the same tired culture war for more than a decade, and it has largely lost the capacity to outrage anyone outside of a small set of terminally online, mostly conservative activists. Trump is going to need a better distraction, but one thing we know about him is that he stubbornly sticks to a theme. He might not be able to credibly blame diversity for everything from plane crashes to children's reading scores, but I imagine he will try. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Campaign Against D.E.I.\n\nFor critics of the former Harvard president Claudine Gay, a larger goal was always in sight.\n\nCritical race theory was yesterday's scandal. Today, diversity-equity-and-inclusion initiatives are in the crosshairs of critics across the political spectrum who seek to dismantle any notion that racism is systemic and thus deserving of systemic remedies. Though the crisis at Harvard University began with questions concerning the prevalence of antisemitism and ended with charges of plagiarism against its president, Claudine Gay-who then resigned-for many of Gay's opponents, D.E.I. initiatives appear to have been the main target. When the conservative activist Chris Rufo wrote in the Wall Street Journal about the role of conservatives, including himself, in ending Gay's presidency, antisemitism and plagiarism received no meaningful mention. Instead, Rufo focussed on conservatives' efforts to end D.E.I. in higher education. In his own long statement, Gay's chief critic, the billionaire hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman, said that D.E.I. was the \"root cause\" of antisemitism on Harvard's campus.\n\nAntisemitism has been on the rise for some time, as was most dramatically demonstrated by the murders of eleven worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, in 2018.  But the argument that D.E.I. programs, which were designed to address issues of discrimination, are themselves a source of bigotry is undermined by the reality that the people making it have suspect records on the subject. In 2021, during Kyle Rittenhouse's homicide trial, Ackman lauded Rittenhouse-who shot three Black Lives Matter protesters in 2020-as a \"civic-minded patriot.\" More recently, when Elon Musk responded to a post on X that gestured toward the theory that Jews were responsible for flooding countries in the West with \"hordes of minorities,\" commenting that it was the \" actual truth ,\" Ackman rushed to Musk's defense, saying, \"Elon Musk is not an antisemite.\" He added that the \"world is a vastly better place because of him.\"\n\nBeyond Ackman, the Republican Party's newfound role of fighting antisemitism is most curious. In a poll taken in 2020, more than two-thirds of American Jews and more than half of U.S. adults said they believed that the G.O.P. holds at least some antisemitic views. Forty-nine per cent of American Jews believed that the \"extreme political right\" poses a \"very serious threat.\" These fears are founded: members of the Republican Party have trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories about Jews dominating various areas of finance, manipulating the media, and pulling the strings of the American left. In 2017, Trump notoriously referred to white supremacists who marched through the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting, \"Jews will not replace us,\" as \"very fine people,\" before he was compelled to decry white supremacy.\n\nThe Republican Party has become the main vector for the deeply antisemitic \"replacement theory\" that Jews are involved in a plot to inundate the U.S. with undocumented immigrants who will \"replace\" the waning white majority and keep the G.O.P. out of power. The Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who challenged university presidents at the hearing on antisemitism on college campuses and gloated about her role in toppling Gay, went on to denounce the \" institutional rot of antisemitism in Harvard .\" But before she was known for her role in the hearing, Stefanik was thrust into the national spotlight after a white supremacist massacred ten African Americans at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York. In a rambling political manifesto, the shooter invoked  \"replacement theory\" as a possible motivation for his rampage. Stefanik, a representative for upstate New York, who has described herself as an \"ultra MAGA\" warrior, had expressed the same idea in social-media ads claiming that Democrats were planning a \" permanent election insurrection \" to \"overthrow our current electorate and create a permanent liberal majority in Washington.\"\n\nEven now, as the Republican Party claims to be committed to eradicating antisemitism on college campuses, its members have continued to invoke the name of the Holocaust survivor and Hungarian-born billionaire and philanthropist George Soros as the mastermind of mischief in American politics. Trump has branded the prosecutor Alvin Bragg, who is bringing criminal indictments against him in New York, as  \"Soros-backed.\". Republicans blamed the short-lived post-lockdown crime wave on Soros because his foundation had financed the campaigns of liberal prosecutors who have criticized racism in the criminal-justice system. Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis , described the \"Soros-backed prosecutors\" as a \" menace to society .\"\n\nIn general, it is simply unbelievable that a political party in thrall to Trump is the leading light opposing antisemitism. What seems more likely is that the onset of another war in the Middle East created a political crisis, exemplified by support for Palestinian rights and criticism of Israel across college campuses. This crisis overlapped with existing concerns on the right about the political indoctrination of college students and the waning influence of the right among young people.\n\nIndeed, when Republicans suffered unexpected losses in the 2022 midterm elections, the former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker complained on Twitter, \"Younger voters are the issue. It comes from years of radical indoctrination - on campus, in school, with social media, & throughout culture. We have to counter it or conservatives will never win battleground states again.\" To some, the outbreak of protests expressing hostility toward the state of Israel, even in the immediate wake of Hamas's surprise attack on October 7th, offered more proof of this liberal indoctrination. As Rufo explained, \"Following the outpouring of sympathy on elite campuses for Hamas's war of 'decolonization' against Israel, many Americans-including center-left liberals-became aware of the ideological rot within academic institutions.\" Even a moderate Democrat like Chuck Schumer has acted with alarm at the lack of support for Israel among young people since the Hamas attacks and since Israel's bombing of Gaza. The war in the Middle East became an opportunity for opponents of D.E.I. and affirmative action to make common cause with political moderates and others who may not like Trump or even the modern G.O.P. After all, Ackman is no shill for the Republican Party. He is known to have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Barack Obama, Al Gore, and Pete Buttigieg.\n\nThis decline in support for Israel, along with rising support for Palestinian rights, has been recast by the right as antisemitism-which, in turn, has tapped into the old political debate over whether criticism of Israel is the same as irrational and racist attacks on Jews. A recent study conducted by the Anti-Defamation League, Hillel International, and College Pulse to \"better understand the current state of the campus climate for Jewish students\" found that seventy-three per cent of Jewish students have \"experienced or witnessed some form of antisemitism\" on campus. But their metrics for determining the climate on campus also included anti-Israel statements. Seventeen per cent of those surveyed said they had seen a \"problematic post about Israel\" by someone associated with their university. Nearly a third said that they had heard \"problematic comments\" about Israel, which the surveyors described as witnessing an antisemitic incident. When the A.D.L. released a new report tracking antisemitism, in January, it counted anti-Zionist demonstrations and protests as prima facie antisemitic. Of course, none of this means that antisemitism never animates critiques of Israel, but neither can it be assumed that any critique of Israel is motivated by antisemitism.\n\nThe criticism that university presidents allowed antisemitism to bloom across their campuses was, in large part, because they allowed antiwar protests that included searing criticisms of the state of Israel. Gay's answers in the congressional hearing were lawyerly and cognizant that her Republican questioner was trying to lay a trap, but the charges of antisemitism were specious and unfounded. If anything, Gay, along with the two other university presidents who appeared in the hearing-Liz Magill, then the leader of the University of Pennsylvania, and Sally Kornbluth, of M.I.T.-had campaigned against antisemitism even when it spilled over into undermining the speech of pro-Palestinian activists and other critics of Israel's siege of Gaza. The schools are establishing task forces and implementing other initiatives with the specific charge of rooting out antisemitism. They publicly criticized the phrase \"from the river to the sea,\" dismissing the idea that it is a legitimate part of the political debate about the future of Israelis and Palestinians, in one or two states.\n\nStill, their performances at the hearing became the staging ground for blaming D.E.I. for the crises on campuses-as well as evidence that Gay, in particular, the first Black president of Harvard, lacked the qualifications to be in the job. Ackman was a leading voice in making this connection: he claimed, after the hearing, that Gay never would have been named president if not \" for a fat finger on the scale .\" And for many on the right, the charges of plagiarism were hard evidence that Gay was an unqualified beneficiary of D.E.I., pushed to the highest levels of the Harvard bureaucracy because of its lurch to the left. After Gay resigned, Ackman wrote a detailed critique of D.E.I., describing it as a \"political advocacy movement on behalf of certain groups that are deemed oppressed under DEI's own methodology.\" He went on to write, \"DEI is racist because reverse racism is racism, even if it is against white people.\" He described antisemitism as \"the canary in the coal mine.\" Elon Musk chimed in , saying that \"D.E.I. is just another word for racism.\"\n\nConservatives, along with those galled by the virulence of opposition to Israel's war in Gaza, began to link antisemitism to the anti-racist frameworks prevalent on campuses. Ben Sasse, a former Republican senator who is now president of the University of Florida, wrote a lengthy article for The Atlantic that barely mentioned antisemitism but argued that the \"moral confusion on too many campuses after the October 7 massacre of 1,200 Israelis fits a familiar pattern. The acceptability of the speech depends on the speaker. Individuals from oppressed groups are given leeway to target oppressor groups through disruptions and threats. This victimology allows Palestinians and their supporters (the oppressed) to target, intimidate, and harass Jews (the oppressors).\" Sasse did not blame D.E.I. specifically; instead he aimed his fire at the \"religious cult\" of intersectionality.\n\nDespite the claims that D.E.I. is a left-wing social movement, Mark Cuban, the billionaire investor and former majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, responded to Musk's tweet against D.E.I. by saying, \"Having a workforce that is diverse and representative of your stakeholders is good for business.\" Indeed, D.E.I. is hardly the progressive crusade it has been made out to be by its critics. An immensely popular tool of the upper management of businesses and universities after the so-called racial reckoning of the summer of 2020, D.E.I. programming includes webinars, sensitivity trainings, reading groups, and speaker series, which are meant to address everything from workplace racism to legacies of industry inequality to the wide disparities between Black and white people in America. The popularity of D.E.I. dovetailed with the entry of \"systemic racism\" into mainstream discourse as an explanation for the prevalence of racism in U.S. society. But it hardly constitutes a theory, an ideology, or a political movement. Claudine Gay is no radical, which is how she rose to the Harvard presidency in the first place. But her presence was radical-as a Black woman leading one of the most powerful institutions in the world. It is the same reason that Kamala Harris has been mocked as unqualified in her role as Vice-President.\n\nBy whipping up outrage that the Black woman appointed as president of Harvard was not only an antisemite but also immensely unqualified, as evidenced by the charges of plagiarism, the right, led by Chris Rufo, got to demonstrate in real time what they believe to be the fallacy and double standard of progressive programs such as affirmative action and D.E.I. The latest campaign against anti-racist programs is intended to cast aspersions, or, at the very least, doubt, upon the presence of any Black person in a position or place they are deemed not to belong. Opponents of D.E.I. are now also challenging its use in business as well, suing companies that have created fellowships and investments for members of marginalized or historically discriminated-against minority groups. Whether in business or at universities, D.E.I.'s opponents have portrayed such programs as unfair, divisive, anti-white, and now antisemitic.  (The irony here is that, according to the A.D.L. and Hillel poll, Jewish and non-Jewish students overwhelmingly back expanding D.E.I. programming to address rising antisemitism.)\n\nTo this end, D.E.I. has proved much more useful than critical race theory as a target. Explaining C.R.T. inevitably led to abstraction, and, beyond the realm of education, it was difficult to rally conservatives around the topic. With D.E.I., right-wing activists hope to build a broader coalition by tapping into a common-sense perception of its inherent unfairness. Moreover, by casting antisemitism as adjacent to the alleged anti-white racism of D.E.I., this effort has the potential to draw Jews and others concerned about antisemitism into the right's campaign of grievance politics. In one sense, the furious backlash against the anti-racist outpouring of 2020 and the decade-old Black Lives Matter movement can be interpreted as evidence of the success of those endeavors. But the fall of Claudine Gay is another example of the rapid retreat from D.E.I. and the reckoning on American racism that ushered it in, posing new challenges to those movements. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

Here's how to fix them.\n\nby Abdallah Fayyad\n\nIn recent months, the attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion policies have been unrelenting. Since Donald Trump's win in November, several major companies - including McDonald's, Target, Amazon, and Meta - have announced that they're either scaling back or outright ending their DEI programs. And since Trump returned to the White House, his administration has been dismantling all DEI programs across the federal government.\n\nThe assault has been so aggressive that at one point the Trump administration seemed to just be scrapping all references to the words \"diversity,\" \"equity,\" and \"inclusion\" on government websites and handbooks, even in cases where they don't actually refer to DEI programming. According to the Wall Street Journal , that included deleting references like the \"inclusion\" of identification numbers on tax forms.\n\nBut despite the efforts of Republicans to turn DEI into a battlefront for the culture wars, DEI practices are nothing new. In fact, they trace their roots to the civil rights movement and have long been a part of corporate America, let alone organizations in the public sector. Their goal is to build fairer workplaces by focusing on things like diversity in hiring or reducing discrimination - creating opportunities that otherwise might not exist for qualified people from marginalized backgrounds.\n\nThe backlash against DEI has had measurable consequences. In 2023, for example, the Supreme Court ended affirmative action, and since then, enrollment of Black and Latino students at universities has declined . Republicans have also started using the phrase \"DEI\" as a slur.\n\nUnderstanding the history of DEI - how it came to be, as well as its strengths and weaknesses - can help us figure out how we got to this point, and, for organizations that are actually still interested in promoting diversity and fairness in the workplace, where we can go from here.\n\nWhile diversity programs have faced some push and pull, until recently, they were largely cemented as a mostly uncontroversial feature of the American workplace.\n\nBefore they were known as DEI, these programs started as a civil rights era push toward integration. In the 1960s, President John F. Kennedy signed an executive order that required federal contractors to take active steps to ensure that they don't discriminate against applicants or employees based on race, creed, color, or national origin.\n\nThis was followed by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 - signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson - which banned all companies with more than 15 employees from engaging in discrimination when it came to practices like job training, hiring, compensation, promotion, and termination. Back then, diversity programs - which were called \"equal employment opportunity programs\" before the terminology evolved to \"diversity programs\" and, eventually, \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" - were mostly designed to ensure that companies complied with the law, and consisted of measures like anti-discrimination training that explained to employees what the new laws required and basic company standards.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, some businesses started to go to greater lengths to avoid discrimination suits or bad press. Major companies like IBM and the Xerox Corporation adopted the stance that promoting integration and preventing discrimination was not just a matter of complying with the law but a matter of social responsibility. IBM, for example, started conducting pay equity analyses - an effort to ensure that employees with similar responsibilities are paid at comparable rates in order to combat pay discrimination on the basis of race and gender - in the 1970s, a practice it continues today.\n\nWhen President Ronald Reagan came into office, he pushed for cutting a lot of red tape. That included threatening to roll back affirmative action laws and advocating that discrimination within companies should be dealt with internally instead of being litigated in the courts. But companies and their employees had already started believing in their diversity programs, and Reagan received pushback from Democrats and Republicans, businesses and civil rights activists alike. In fact, most major companies said that they would keep their diversity programs regardless of whether they were required to.\n\nAround the same time, corporate America started settling on a new case for improving diversity in the workplace: It wasn't just the morally right thing to do, it was also good for business. The demographics of the labor force were quickly changing , and so companies developed a renewed interest in promoting diversity and inclusion in order to maintain a competitive advantage.\n\nAll of this laid the foundation for the DEI programs that are being attacked today. \"We kind of came to this idea that diversity is going to happen, and as a result, we need to be able to manage it correctly,\" said Lily Zheng, a diversity and inclusion strategist and consultant. \"So this spawned a whole bunch of diversity training, racial sensitivity training, gender inclusion training to prepare the modern workforce for what was meant to be this huge influx of diversity.\"\n\nIn the 2010s, the rise of social movements like Black Lives Matter and Me Too led to a boom in hiring diversity czars and consultants, and many organizations, from fashion brands to academic institutions, pushed PR campaigns that included diversity pledges. In 2020, after the murder of George Floyd, organizations showed a renewed interest in promoting diversity because of the public pressure to do the right thing.\n\nBut even before the swift retreat from DEI after Trump's election win, it seemed like the so-called racial reckoning many employers promised never really materialized - and now companies are trying to pretend their commitments to diversity never really happened.\n\nWhile there isn't comprehensive data across the labor force to evaluate the impact of DEI programs broadly, studies that focus on different components of diversity programs have shown mixed results.\n\n\"If we look at the big picture, what kinds of things have been effective at actually helping firms to hire and retain a more diverse workforce, they're not the things that are designed to target individual bias at companies,\" said Frank Dobbin, a social science professor at Harvard University who has studied corporate diversity programs.\n\nThose kinds of initiatives include things like implicit bias training, which seeks to help people become aware of their own biases and figure out how to limit their negative impact, or grievance procedures, where employees can file complaints against their managers or other people in their organizations for discrimination or harassment.\n\nThese programs have been very popular among companies, in part because they're a low lift and relatively low cost. The problem is that they aren't all that effective and, in some cases, might have unintended consequences. Implicit bias training, for example, tends to make participants defensive rather than open to change. Even when people want to do better, few people think that they actively make racist decisions, and so they don't necessarily think the training applies to them.\n\n\"These trainings and grievance procedures, they're really designed to show people that they're biased and change their ways either through education in the case of training or punishment in the case of grievance procedures,\" Dobbin said. But in practice, those processes, Dobbin says, tend to antagonize people in management , especially white men.\n\n\"In their typical forum, they tend to have adverse effects that are leading to decreases in the ability of firms to hire, retain, and promote Black workers, Hispanic workers, and Asian American workers,\" he added.\n\nThis approach of seeing the problem as individual behaviors and beliefs as opposed to the structure and processes of an organization has been one of the critical failures of DEI. That's created what some have called the \" DEI-industrial complex .\" In fact, DEI training has swelled into an $8 billion industry, allowing employers to pat themselves on the back for spending time and money on surface-level diversity programming like hiring consultants or public speakers for their employees, while not investing in an actual long-term strategy that would tangibly improve working conditions and address systemic barriers to entry that women and people of color face.\n\n\"Companies always want to pay for their flashy speakers, for their award ceremonies, for their external-facing communications or heritage month activities and very little is actually spent on doing things like addressing discrimination, ensuring fair pay, or creating healthy workplace processes,\" Zheng said. \"And that's a problem because these sorts of deeper investments are what's actually needed if we want to create workplaces that are more fair, that are more equitable, that are better for everyone.\"\n\nWhen people think of DEI, they often think about diversity training or job titles like chief diversity officer. But sometimes, the best diversity and inclusion initiatives are much less flashy.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, a blockbuster study showed that employers are much less likely to give applicants with Black-sounding names a callback than applicants with white-sounding names. Twenty years later, researchers at the University of California Berkeley and the University of Chicago did a similar study, and while the results showed that companies had improved, applicants with Black-sounding names are still less likely to get an interview .\n\nThe researchers found that the companies that were less likely to discriminate had something surprisingly simple in common: centralized processes and standards. Correlation, of course, is not causation, but that pattern shouldn't be dismissed.\n\n\"When hiring processes are not standardized, when there's no scoring rubric, when hiring managers aren't trained to give consistent results and actually evaluate based on merit, you see people's individual biases really impact the demographics of who ends up ultimately hired,\" Zheng said. \"And so the takeaway is, if you want to fight this bias, one of the simplest things you can do is very mundane: Standardize your hiring process.\"\n\nCompanies can be so focused on diversity in recruiting that they avoid making changes that would help retain employees or draw people to want to work there in the first place. Acknowledging this is part of what changed many companies' approach from just thinking about diversity in hiring to making the workplace more inclusive so that people can advance their careers once their foot is in the door.\n\nHaving more objective and standardized processes can reduce the risk of unfair or discriminatory compensation, disciplinary action, or termination. The persistence of pay gaps between men and women or Black and white people, for example, inherently creates a less inclusive workplace and a lasting impression on employees that they aren't treated equally.\n\nThat's why long-term commitments like pay-gap reviews and corrections - or accountability mechanisms like publicly releasing diversity data that would encourage workers to demand more of their employers - can go a long way in promoting diversity in the workplace.\n\nDEI programs have also been criticized for not paying close enough attention to classism. In practice, DEI programs are often the corporate-friendly approach to desegregation, where the C-suites co-opt the language of social justice while doing little, if anything, to meaningfully improve the workplace for everybody. These kinds of programs are often designed to cater to a certain type of background, like college-educated workers, while ignoring class divides that continue to segregate the labor force.\n\nOne DEI program that helps address this issue is changing recruiting practices, especially in companies that value graduates of elite colleges, which tend to have mostly upper-middle-class students. By expanding recruitment to all types of schools, including HBCUs, state schools, and two-year colleges, companies are likely to see more racial and class diversity in their applicant pools.\n\nWith the aggressive attacks on DEI coming from the Trump administration and the kind of kowtowing we've seen from big corporations, it's clear that the DEI backlash isn't going away anytime soon. Workers looking to create more inclusive workplaces will have a harder time getting their employers to adopt or expand DEI programs.\n\nThat's why companies that are actually interested in advancing equality should hone in on what really works - things like standardized hiring processes, pay equity commitments, recruiting from schools outside of Ivy Leagues and the like - and leave the ineffective aspects of DEI behind, including one-off trainings, speaking engagements, and half-hearted heritage month celebrations.\n\n\"These off-the-shelf, one-shot, feel-good, check-the-box kinds of initiatives are not going to be sufficient to produce any change in outcomes like giving people equal opportunity to develop, to be promoted,\" said Robin Ely, a business administration professor at the Harvard Business School who has studied diversity programs.\n\nCompanies should be data and outcome-oriented - that is, they should figure out what it is, exactly, that needs to be addressed and tailor a solution to address it.\n\nZheng also says that companies have to think about how to get buy-in from everybody. That kind of coalition building, they said, is crucial to DEI's future success. Oftentimes, the way people talk about DEI makes it sound like one racial group will get preferential treatment - giving ammo to the charge Republicans often levy that companies are simply lowering standards to increase diversity, even when they're not. It's often seen, in other words, as a zero-sum game.\n\nBut Zheng suggests that the most successful DEI programs are win-wins, creating better outcomes for everybody, and advocates should focus on that communal aspect to build stronger coalitions. So before throwing out DEI initiatives altogether, companies and organizations that are actually interested in the ideals of diversity and inclusion should consider a more coalitional approach.\n\n\"Let's look at parental leave: Parental leave policies in the US are abysmal, they're atrocious, and when advocates try to make them better, they often say things like, 'Women stand to benefit a lot from these policies,'\" Zheng told me, adding that some advocates might argue that the patriarchy, or simply men, are the problem. \"Yet we lose the fact when we argue like this that men benefit enormously from parental leave as well.\"\n\nIn the long run, this approach could indeed prove popular. The majority of Americans still think DEI programs are a good thing , though that number has been shrinking, and only a fifth of Americans think that DEI is plain bad. By designing these programs to benefit everyone, and by communicating that to workers across the board, DEI practitioners might garner more support. At the end of the day, Zheng says, \"we just need to design systems that are fair.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Now the question is whether the Supreme Court's ban on race-conscious admissions will lead them to further rein in these programs to avoid potential legal challenges.\n\nOne thing is clear: The laws surrounding affirmative action in employment haven't changed.\n\nFederal contractors have been required to take affirmative action, steps to ensure applicants are treated fairly, since 1965 when President Lyndon Johnson signed Executive Order 11246 . Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.\n\nUnder the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's guidelines on voluntary affirmative action , employers are encouraged to take voluntary steps to \"correct the effects of past discrimination and to prevent present and future discrimination\" such as expanding their applicant pools to ensure a diverse body of applicants for any given position.\n\nAs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission noted in a statement after the decision, the cases do not \"address employer efforts to foster diverse and inclusive workforces or to engage the talents of all qualified workers, regardless of their background,\" clarifying that it is still legal for \"employers to implement diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility programs that seek to ensure workers of all backgrounds are afforded equal opportunity in the workplace.\"\n\nStill, legal threats from right-wing organizations that have already spent years trying to get organizations, including Starbucks and McDonald's, to end their DEI programs could increase.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to ban race-conscious measures in college admissions is likely to encourage more lawsuits against race-conscious policies in employment, said Pauline Kim, an employment law expert at the Washington University in St. Louis School of Law.\n\nI talked to Kim about the future of diversity in the workforce and workplace and why affirmative action in college admissions and workplace hiring aren't completely unrelated. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat are the implications of the higher education affirmative action decision on employment?\n\nThe legal answer is nothing. The Harvard and UNC cases were decided under the equal protection clause of the Constitution, which does not apply to private employers. When it comes to affirmative action or discrimination in the workplace, private employers are covered by Title VII. It's a different source of law. It's not just a technical matter of being a different source of law, but there are actually differences in what Title VII holds compared to the equal protection clause precedents of the court. So on the purely legal technical level, there's no direct implication.\n\nOn the other hand, the Court in the higher ed affirmative action cases has expressed hostility to race-conscious efforts to improve racial equity. At that broad level, it may make employers worried about their own DEI programs. And that may encourage people who are ideologically inclined to challenge any kind of race-conscious or race-remedial efforts to try to bring lawsuits to challenge what employers are doing.\n\nThere's also a practical connection for employers, and I think it's why so many of them weighed in on the university admissions case in favor of affirmative action. They are interested in hiring diverse workforces to meet the demands of their business in a global economy. They are worried about the pipeline of diverse candidates that are going to be available to them for hiring. Since affirmative action in higher ed is something that primarily affects the most elite schools, it could mean that employers may need to move beyond looking at the status of a college or university that somebody attended. They'll need to look more broadly at students coming from varied educational backgrounds who may have the skills and ability to do the work.\n\nWhat's the history behind Title VII?\n\nTitle VII is part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was the groundbreaking legislation that Congress passed in the wake of the civil rights protests of the '50s and early '60s. Under Title VII, it's unlawful for an employer to take an adverse action against an employee or an applicant because of their sex, national origin, religion, or color. Title VII was intended to protect Black workers as well as women and other ethnic minorities. Prior to 1964, employers were free to make employment decisions on any of those bases if they wanted to.\n\nAfter Title VII was passed, in addition to prohibiting intentional discrimination, the Court also made clear that if an employer has a practice that has a disparate impact on disadvantaged groups, then that's a form of discrimination as well, unless the employer can justify it for business reasons. So a lot of employers realized they had a problem.\n\nSome employers were sued, and they entered into either consent judgments or there were court judgments entered, and then there were permanent affirmative action plans put into place. Other employers realized they needed to voluntarily adopt traditional kinds of affirmative action plans.\n\nOver time, as discrimination became latent, employers moved away from affirmative action plans that involved any kinds of racial quotas. They have really shifted their focus to examining their policies and moving towards what's now called DEI initiatives.\n\nCan we take a step back to first even define affirmative action in the workplace context? Does affirmative action in workplace hiring look the same as affirmative action in higher education admissions?\n\nPart of the problem is affirmative action, both within the employment space but also more generally, means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. So there's often confusion about what exactly it entails.\n\nIn some of the older cases, affirmative action literally meant that a spot might be reserved, for example, for somebody from a racial minority group. That practice has long since been abandoned by universities and employers. Affirmative action also could refer to a program or policy, where the effort is to diversify either the university class or the workforce, where race or sex is taken into account as a positive.\n\nSometimes people also use the term affirmative action to mean taking any kind of step that will help to improve racial equity or to improve the diversity of a pool. A lot of firms now refer to that as DEI initiatives rather than affirmative action. So part of the confusion that comes in is that people think that they're the same thing. There are people on the right who attack DEI programs, equating them with something like a racial quota, when they are completely different. They don't involve the use of race in individual decisions at all.\n\nWhat are some concrete examples of DEI initiatives that you don't consider to be affirmative action?\n\nA really easy example is a law firm that has always been recruiting at the local state flagship university and decides to start recruiting at HBCUs, realizing that by only going to one or two traditional universities to recruit they're narrowing their pool.\n\nAnother example is how some employers in the past wouldn't formally post jobs. They would rely on word of mouth. That tends to reproduce the existing workforce. If you have a racially homogenous workforce, it's going to reproduce that. An employer might instead realize that that's the effect of this practice and choose to formally post their positions and criteria in advance. Instead of just hiring an employee's cousin, they choose to use rubrics to judge candidates.\n\nWhat is legal and what is illegal when it comes to diversity practices or affirmative action in the employment context? Where does the law draw the line on what is allowed in hiring?\n\nOne of the original Supreme Court cases that dealt with affirmative action in employment was United Steel Workers v. Weber in 1979. That involved a steel plant that had never hired Black workers in the skilled craft positions. They required skilled craft workers to already be trained. Training was done through the unions, and the unions did not admit Black workers at that time. So they recognized after Title VII was passed that they had a problem. They entered into a voluntary agreement with the union that they would create a training program that they would admit trainees on a 50 percent Black to white ratio. In other words, if they had 10 openings, five of them went to Black employees and five went to white employees.\n\nThat was a rigid racial quota, but the Supreme Court actually approved that, as it was done in the context of a history of racial segregation where there was a complete absence of Black workers in that job category. And at the same time, the particular program didn't completely block white workers from moving forward.\n\nThe ratio was challenged by a white worker who didn't get into the program the first year. The Supreme Court upheld it, because it was intended to address this manifest imbalance due to former racial segregation. That kind of a program would be very difficult to justify today, in part because that sort of enforced racial segregation is much harder to prove now. But on the other hand, no employers are doing anything like that today, either.\n\nIf an employer had a program that said, \"We plan to hire 25 percent workers of color out of all of our hires for the next year,\" that's a racial quota. That's not something that would be permissible.\n\nIf an employer says they value diversity and that they're going to be looking for diverse candidates and examining their practices to make sure they promote equity and inclusion, and are fair to everybody, that is not a basis for anybody who doesn't get hired to say, \"Oh, I wasn't hired because of my race.\" That's because there's no evidence that that individual person was disadvantaged because of their race. The employer is just making a broad aspirational statement in terms of overall goals in their hiring processes.\n\nAnd when such challenges do get filed, what do they tend to look like? For example, I'm thinking of Stephen Miller's organization that's trying to stop \"woke organizations\" from engaging in DEI.\n\nWhen somebody challenges an \"affirmative action program\" what they are alleging is that the employer has discriminated against them based on their race.\n\nThere have been a handful of cases in the lower courts. They didn't get a lot of attention because they weren't big blockbuster cases. They have involved white candidates or male candidates who have sued and said, \"I wasn't hired\" or \"I wasn't promoted\" and \"The person you hired was a woman or a person of color, or a woman of color. And I think I was discriminated against.\"\n\nIn trying to prove discrimination, they would point to the fact that the employer maybe had a diversity statement, or maybe the employer did something like announce that they were going to expand to a nationwide search instead of just a local search to ensure a diverse group of candidates. The courts have pretty much thrown those out because those plaintiffs were not able to show that the reason they were not hired was because of their race, or because of their sex, as opposed to because the employer changed their practices and found a more qualified candidate.\n\nSo what would a lawsuit look like? Well, under Title VII, it should be an individual who can show that they suffered an adverse action, that they weren't hired or promoted because of their race or sex. They would have to show that the fact that the employer had a DEI policy meant that in their individual case, that their race was the reason they didn't get the job.\n\nCan you say more about hyper-compliance? Is it true that employers, out of fear, will take it upon themselves to rein in their DEI practices?\n\nI think that it's a concern because already there have been advocacy groups on the right who have announced they plan to sue employers and try to challenge their DEI programs. For the reasons I said earlier, I think, overwhelmingly, as far as what I'm aware of, most employers are doing things that are perfectly legal under established law. But sometimes, just the fear of a suit can inhibit them from pursuing these types of policies. That would be unfortunate because it's really the threat or the fear of being sued, rather than compliance with the law that would be driving it.\n\nUltimately, what responsibility do employers have right now?\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission put out a statement saying nothing's changed in the law, that employers should continue to exhibit their policies and make sure that they are not inadvertently racially exclusionary. Employers do have a responsibility to make sure that they are not using arbitrary practices that disadvantage racial minority groups or other previously disadvantaged groups. It's not like they can just run away from this completely.\n\nThey have a duty under the law to eradicate practices that may not be intentionally discriminatory, but have the effect of harming groups that have been excluded in the past. So, to that extent, I think the EEOC's statement is right, that employers should continue to develop a very diverse and inclusive workforce.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

See our ethics statement.\n\nby Nadra Nittle\n\nIf you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\n\nA generation ago, many brands promoted products by cultivating an image of privilege. Ads oozed wealth, glamour, and a very defined concept of beauty. The bulk of them centered on people who were thin, white, cisgender, and non-disabled.\n\nWhile ads based on exclusion haven't vanished, today, inclusion sells . It's hard to argue that a business can be truly innovative if it's leaving out large swaths of the marketplace; a fashion brand can hardly call itself mainstream and superior if its size range is too small for the average shopper to wear. In this way, inclusivity has become its own metric for being best in class, and millennials are responding with their dollars. Research shows that the generation, projected to outnumber baby boomers in 2030, respond to marketing that's relevant and authentic, and reflects the diversity they see in their communities. Because it pays for companies to be inclusive, some brands are making inclusion the entire focus of their product lines.\n\nClothing brands such as Universal Standard have built their identity on the fact that they offer sizes for women with a wide range of body types . In spring, the lingerie company ThirdLove declared (wrongly) in a press release that it offered more bra sizes than any other brand, and Rihanna's Fenty Beauty won widespread praise, including being named one of Time magazine's best 2017 inventions , for its 40-shade foundation range. In May, when Rihanna's lingerie brand Savage x Fenty dropped , featuring an array of shades and sizes, it too received applause for being inclusive . Yet some customers didn't think Savage was quite inclusive enough .\n\nDuring a time when inclusion has become both a selling point and an expectation, companies will continue to face backlash for falling short when it comes to inclusion or for framing themselves as pioneers at it when they're not. The reality, of course, is that no brand can be all things to all people, but it's in the best interest of socially conscious shoppers to distinguish the companies genuinely invested in inclusion from the ones that view it as a means to financial gain.\n\nFor years, Victoria's Secret has been a brand based on exclusivity , but in an age when inclusion is widely championed, the lingerie maker has seen its sales slump. The retailer's mounting irrelevance came to a head when its chief marketing officer, Ed Razek, told Vogue last month that he didn't think the annual fashion show should include \"transsexuals\" because the show \"is a fantasy.\" He also said that no one had any interest in seeing a Victoria's Secret show for plus sizes and seemingly made a jab at ThirdLove when he quipped, \"We're nobody's third love. We're their first love.\"\n\nThe outcry about Razek's comments grew so loud that the executive attempted to clarify them later, but the damage, it seemed, had been done. ThirdLove, which has billed itself as being inclusive, took out a full-page ad in the New York Times taking Victoria's Secret to task.\n\n\"It's time to stop telling women what makes them sexy - let us decide,\" ThirdLove's CEO Heidi Zak said in the ad. \"We're done with pretending certain sizes don't exist or aren't important enough to serve. And please stop insisting that inclusivity is a trend.\"\n\nBut if inclusion isn't a trend, it's certainly marketable now in a way that it traditionally hasn't been. Cora Harrington , author of In Intimate Detail: How to Choose, Wear, and Love Lingerie and founder of the Lingerie Addict blog, said that because consumers tend to be uneducated about lingerie generally, their perceptions about how inclusive a particular brand or product is may be skewed. A company may market itself as inclusive when it's simply practicing industry standards.\n\nEarlier this year, when ThirdLove introduced what it characterized as the most inclusive size range of bras on the market, Harrington said the claim was easily disprovable. Brands like Triumph , Wacoal , Lane Bryant , Playful Promises , Panache , and more offered equally large or even bigger size ranges. So why didn't they sound the horn about it?\n\n\"I don't know if it has occurred to other brands to center their marketing on [size inclusion],\" Harrington said. \"It was the first time I personally heard of a [lingerie] marketing campaign where that was the focus. I don't think it would have dawned on these other brands to do that. Part of that is in our current time, there is a sense that a size range is never big enough, so some brands [feel] guarded discussing size range.\"\n\nThere may be fear, she said, that customers will call them out for not making certain sizes, so companies \"see that conversation around size as more of a minefield than an asset.\"\n\nMoreover, some customers may take issue when they get the impression that companies have wrongfully portrayed themselves as trailblazers of inclusion. In 2016, for example, Naja Lingerie , of which actress Gina Rodriguez is a co-partner, launched its #NudeForAll line featuring undergarments in seven skin tones. The marketing campaign led to glowing headlines such as \" Gina Rodriguez's Naja Lingerie Is Redefining the Term Nude\" and \" Naja Lingerie Is Making 'Nude For All' Underwear a Reality.\" Those unfamiliar with the market may have assumed that Naja was a pioneer of the trend, when brands such as Nubian Skin had already put in the groundwork to expand the lingerie world's definition of nude.\n\nHarrington warns consumers to be cautious of lingerie brands that claim to be trailblazers. Don't take a brand's word for it if it claims to make be more inclusive than the competition or to make every bra size, she said.\n\n\"If it's a lingerie brand and they say they're the first to do something or they're doing it more than anyone else is, immediately be skeptical,\" she said. \"The likelihood of anyone being the first ever to do something in lingerie is very, very slim, especially if they're a new or smaller brand.\"\n\nWhen Fenty Beauty debuted in fall 2017, the praise was overwhelming, but some fans pointed out that no trans women were used in its campaign . In response to that oversight, Rihanna said that she would not use trans women as a gimmick.\n\n\"I don't think it's fair that a trans woman, or man, be used as a convenient marketing tool!\" she said on Instagram. \"Too often do I see companies doing this to trans and black women alike! There's always just that one spot in the campaign for the token 'we look mad diverse' girl/guy! It's sad!\"\n\nLikely because Fenty Beauty made a point to serve women traditionally underserved by the cosmetics industry - women with dark skin - the lack of trans women in its ad campaign never ballooned into a huge controversy. But as Fenty was lauded in the press for being radically inclusive, brands that had been serving women of color for years, such as Iman Cosmetics and Fashion Fair , were overlooked. Fenty was widely portrayed as a makeup industry disruptor, although other cosmetics brands, including MAC , Bobbi Brown , Makeup Forever , Nars , and Lancôme , had already offered inclusive foundation ranges.\n\nMakeup artist Zarielle Washington says that consumers with dark skin, especially globally, need more cosmetics options. But she says she hopes inclusion isn't just a lucrative marketing trend. Still, she's noticed that when one company markets itself as inclusive, others follow suit. Kylie Cosmetics, for instance, released a 30-shade foundation range after Fenty's debut. On the other hand, when brands fail to be inclusive, they get called out for it, such as when Tarte released a range of makeup in January that appeared to cater almost exclusively to people with pale skin.\n\n\"We have millennials and a society that's more interested in putting their money into brands that resonate with them personally,\" Washington said. \"It's not just about the product; it's all about people and their personal choices and their lifestyles. I do feel like the industry is being more receptive to inclusion, and that's also translating into dollars.\"\n\nWashington pointed out that CoverGirl featured model Winnie Harlow, who has vitiligo , in its ads. (Victoria's Secret also included her in its 2018 fashion show.) Fenty Beauty included shades so light that people with albinism could wear the foundation, and globally, cosmetics brands have started to cater to men who wear makeup . These may all be efforts by companies to get across the idea that they're better at inclusion than the competition. Washington, however, mostly welcomes the trend.\n\n\"I think people who before felt ostracized are now being made to feel comfortable,\" she said. \"Actually, I love that. It helps people see things from a different perspective.\"\n\nBut how can customers tell if a company really is better at inclusion than others or is using the trend toward inclusion to win cool points and, inevitably, dollars? Washington advises consumers to keep an eye on a company's social media to see the issues it highlights, and if inclusion doesn't seem to be part of it, she pointed out that it's never been easier for a customer to give feedback to a company on a public forum like Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook.\n\n\"Every time you make a purchase, you're casting a vote; you're voicing how strongly you feel about the company or their ethics and what they stand behind,\" she said.\n\nWhile concern grows that companies are embracing inclusion for profit, Barbara Kahn , a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School , said that advances in manufacturing and technology have allowed businesses to make products with a wider range of customers in mind.\n\n\"Online marketing allows for more 'long tail' service - i.e., people who do not represent a significant proportion of the overall population and have special requirements, because the inventory can be kept in central warehouses and shipped out as needed,\" Kahn explained.\n\nPrior to the digital age, companies had to rely on the products they could fit on a counter or on the sales floor. That meant they limited how much makeup they displayed or the range of sizes on clothing racks.\n\n\"Keeping every size in stock was infeasible,\" Kahn said. \"It's part of the reason Bonobos started as a showroom or guideshop with subsequent purchasing or ordering online. That way, they could keep a large selection of sizes in the physical showroom but not have to keep all of them in stock in the store, which would be a logistical nightmare.\"\n\nBut she does acknowledge that some brands simply thought it best for their image to have \"their clothing to only be worn by certain-size people.\" This is called \"brand positioning.\" As millennials are poised to become the group with the most spending power, however, brand positioning is shifting from the fantasy espoused by companies like Victoria's Secret to products made for \"real people.\" Authenticity, and thus inclusion, is now perceived to be the most marketable.\n\n\"Advertising used to be more 'aspirational,' and people looked to brands to show what people hoped they could be,\" Kahn said. \"But the younger generation is much more accepting of all kinds of diversity - and that brands are embracing all of these different ideas and allowing people to accept who they are is definitely a selling point.\"\n\nWant more stories from The Goods by Vox?

      "text": "Trump's sweeping new order tries to dismantle DEI in government - and the private sector\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe order shows that the \"anti-wokeness\" crusaders now have immense power.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nNew executive actions from the Trump administration on Tuesday make clear that not only is President Donald Trump using his power to purge the practice of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) from the federal government - he's acting to try and purge it from American culture as a whole.\n\nIn an executive order Tuesday night, Trump dismantled the decades-old requirements that federal contractors practice affirmative action by trying to employ more women and people of color. Trump's acting chief of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - the office that oversees the federal civil service - also ordered that all employees of DEIA (diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility) offices at federal agencies be placed on paid administrative leave by the end of the day Wednesday.\n\nBut Trump went further, also taking aim at DEI in the private and nonprofit sectors. His executive order instructed the Justice Department and other agencies to identify \"the most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners\" in their jurisdiction.\n\nEvery federal agency, the order went on, must send a recommendation to the attorney general of up to nine potential investigations of corporations, large nonprofits, foundations with assets of $500 million or more, higher education institutions with endowments of $1 billion or more, or bar and medical associations. All this, the order said, was meant to \"encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"\n\nDEI is, broadly, efforts at companies, universities, and other institutions to manage their internal cultures on identity-related matters, from hiring to workplace policies. Its supporters say DEI is necessary to combat bias and ensure employees of underrepresented backgrounds feel comfortable and supported. Its critics argue say it often crosses the line into speech policing and advances a progressive political agenda that conservatives don't share.\n\nTrump's legal justification for all this is his claim that DEI programs or race- and sex-based preferences can violate civil rights laws - he claims that they often amount to illegal discrimination (the implication being: discrimination against whites, Asian Americans, and men when they do not receive such preferences). The order argues that \"individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination\" - not race or sex - should matter. (What exactly crosses the line to make a DEI program \"illegal\" is left extremely vague in the order.)\n\nAll this marks a seismic cultural and legal shift away from the 2010s and the racial reckoning of 2020, when these programs became widespread across the US. A few years ago, they seemed to many to be a commonsense response to enduring structural discrimination - now, they might get you investigated.\n\nBut the rollback goes even further than that. Trump revoked a 1965 order by President Lyndon B. Johnson calling for affirmative action in federal contracting, which has become a pillar of the civil rights canon in the decades since.\n\nThe order also underscores the ascendance to power of the \"anti-wokeness\" crusaders who, irate at what they viewed as increasing progressive dominance in American culture, came up with a detailed plan for using federal power to combat it. They are now seeing that plan put into action by the president of the United States.\n\nIn a certain sense, this latest move is nothing surprising, given that conservatives have long criticized affirmative action practices that were adopted after the civil rights era.\n\nSupporters of affirmative action argued that such programs were necessary to help broaden access to institutions dominated by white men due to longstanding societal discrimination.\n\nThe right has long had a two-part critique: First, that these programs deprioritize qualifications and \"merit\"; and second, that programs to benefit minorities or women amounted to \"reverse discrimination\" against whites and men (and, in recent years, Asian Americans). That is, that, far from being compliant with civil rights law, affirmative action actually violates the principle of race neutrality by doing its own kind of discrimination.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, conservative activists won victories in certain states that approved bans of affirmative action, but they kept coming up short at the Supreme Court and the status quo prevailed in federal policy.\n\nThen, in the 2010s, the practice evolved into a newfound trend toward DEI programs, which focused not just on affirmative action in hiring but on more broadly managing institutions' internal culture on identity-related matters, culminating in an intense focus on such topics during the racial reckoning of 2020.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, he and his appointees did not make challenging affirmative action or DEI a top priority. But in 2020 and the years after Trump's defeat, activists on the right increasingly focused on pushing back against \"wokeness.\" Their number included Trump's policy expert Stephen Miller, who was mainly preoccupied with immigration during Trump's first term, but branched out to focus on challenging DEI as well during the Biden years, when he founded a legal nonprofit to challenge Biden's policies. And in 2023, the Supreme Court finally delivered the anti-affirmative action ruling long sought by the right, severely curtailing the use of affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nBut the right didn't want to stop there. Advocates and commentators like Chris Rufo and Richard Hanania had gained prominence on the right by coming up with theories of why wokeness was so widespread - and how it could be combated. Rufo's big idea was that the left controlled major institutions in American life, and that the right must take over such institutions and use power to purge left-wing ideas and practices from them.\n\nAs for Hanania - who wrote various extremely racist things for white supremacist sites in the early 2010s under a pseudonym, but has since claimed he now finds his old beliefs \"repulsive\" - he argued the roots of wokeness were in federal civil rights law. He singled out LBJ's 1965 executive order on affirmative action for government contractors as starting the trend, arguing that GOP presidents (including Trump) had inexplicably failed to roll it back . He also argued for going further, and issuing a new executive order stating that \"you can't have an affirmative action program.\"\n\nThis is in essence what Trump did. Trump is acting far more aggressively on this topic than he did in his first term, apparently spurred on by some combination of the new focus from conservative activists, interest from Miller, his deputy chief of staff, and cover from the Supreme Court decision. Another potential contributor is a sense that many in the public have soured on wokeness - and that public backlash will be muted.\n\nHis new executive order reflects the Rufo-Hanania agenda, rolling back the LBJ order specifically to dismantle affirmative action in federal contracting, while putting private sector and nonprofit institutions on notice that DEI initiatives they deem \"discriminatory\" could land them in legal hot water.\n\nWith his OPM order , Trump's team is also outright purging DEI supporters from the federal government. And they're also warning federal employees against fighting back. The OPM announcement stressed that higher-ups are \"aware of efforts by some in government to disguise these programs by using coded or imprecise language,\" and instructed employees to report any changes made since the election to \"obscure\" connections with DEI. \"Failure to report this information within 10 days may result in adverse consequences,\" the announcement adds.\n\nThe question now is how American institutions will respond. Enthusiasm for DEI has already cooled in recent years, as several major corporations have rolled back their efforts; more companies could follow their lead, using these legal threats as justification. More progressive-leaning colleges and nonprofits may be more inclined to fight back - but they, too, face the threat of investigations (Trump's order calls out major universities, nonprofits, and foundations as potential \"egregious\" offenders).\n\nLegal challenges against Trump's order will clearly be coming. Progressives could argue that the order goes too far and threatens constitutional rights of speech or association. But whether the Supreme Court will sympathize with progressives is questionable, given that its six conservatives share the view that affirmative action amounts to discrimination. (\"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\" Chief Justice John Roberts famously wrote in 2007.)\n\nFor now, what is clear is that Trump's team is making an all-out effort to dismantle both the legal framework and the larger culture that have underpinned affirmative action and DEI in recent years.\n\nIt is unclear what pushback they will receive - and, if none materializes, the ultimate legacy of the racial reckoning could well be a backlash that ends up rolling back decades of progressive policy.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWhy the pendulum swung on DEI - and how that could be a good thing.\n\nby Jonquilyn Hill\n\nThe buzzwords \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" are everywhere right now, but you can't be blamed if you don't quite have a handle on what they mean.\n\nThe origins of DEI date back to the civil rights era - but recently \"DEI\" has been thrown around with regard to everything from plane crashes to Super Bowl halftime performances . These business practices are under renewed scrutiny now, thanks to conservative activists and President Donald Trump's newly enacted policies . That's something Eric M. Ellis spends a lot of time thinking about.\n\nEllis is the president and CEO of Integrity Development, a consulting firm that helps businesses with DEI programs. \"I think that everybody is looking for a sense of belonging,\" he says.\n\nOver the past 30 years, his outlook on implementing DEI in the workplace has changed. \"When I started doing this work in the '90s,\" he says, \"I thought my job was to be a diversity ghostbuster. I had a formula.\" Now he does things differently. \"I changed my style from one of blaming and shaming to one of becoming more transparent around my own biases, because I believe that bias is a human condition,\" Ellis said.\n\nSo how do companies address that bias now? And what does DEI's future hold? We explore that on this week's episode of Explain It to Me . You can listen to Explain It to Me on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , or wherever you get podcasts . If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.\n\nWhat's your school of thought when it comes to DEI in the workplace?\n\nI ask people: What's the No. 1 diversity issue in the workplace? And they'll start brainstorming: \"It's classism or it's sexism or racism.\" And I'll say, \"No. The No. 1 diversity issue in the workplace is the one that affects you.\" At the end of the day, I think that everybody is looking for a sense of belonging.\n\nIt's interesting listening to your definition of DEI. It's very different from what we're talking about in the news right now. Does DEI getting a bad rap surprise you at all?\n\nNo. One of the best ways to get attention is by negativity and sensationalism. So DEI being misrepresented, demonized, or defined in convenient ways doesn't surprise me. Does that mean that I don't recognize that there are some opportunities within the space of DEI? I absolutely recognize that, but I don't think that the people that are going after it the hardest are interested in that. It's stereotyping the entire industry.\n\nYou actually have to evaluate each and every effort to determine if it's something that's adding to the business' bottom line and making it more effective for everybody or if it's something that's out of line and needs to be changed or eliminated.\n\nHow have you seen DEI efforts evolve over time?\n\nIt started off as civil rights training, then affirmative action training, then sensitivity training. Then it was racial sensitivity; race and gender sensitivity; diversity; diversity and inclusion; diversity, equity, and inclusion. So we've got alphabet soup going on.\n\nFor the most part, when we started, diversity efforts were put in place to ensure meritocracy. Today, people act as though DEI is synonymous with lowering standards. But then we'll see those same people bringing on people that are completely unqualified to do their job, and blame DEI as something that is bringing down standards and [leading to] hiring unqualified people, which is absolutely not the case.\n\nHave you seen a major change in how for-profit companies are responding to this in the wake of President Donald Trump's second term?\n\nThere are three categories of responses from the organizations that I've worked with. There are some that are closing up the tent. There are some that are pausing or pivoting. And then there's some that are staying the course and doubling down.\n\nOrganizations have to do what they believe is in their best interest. One of the things that I don't think that we should do is force organizations to do DEI when it's against their own values. In other words, organizations ought to stand where their values are. If they don't believe in this, then they ought to walk away. They probably should have never started it.\n\nFor organizations that are just afraid and concerned and don't want to get run over, I understand people pivoting, and I don't have a problem with that. And then some people have the strength, the size, the power, the conviction that they are staying the course. And that's admirable.\n\nIs this just going to kind of be a rebrand? Will there just be different words to use for these programs?\n\nI'm not sure, but I know that the government has said that they are going to be keeping a keen eye out for that. What I see companies doing most is maintaining their messages internally and changing what they do externally.\n\nHow effective are these policies in the first place?\n\nUltimately, you have to engage in structural change. I think one of the things that the Supreme Court's decision around affirmative action brought to the surface was that oftentimes organizations are trying to have their cake and eat it, too. They don't want to admit to structural inequities, but they then want to implement DEI initiatives. I don't think you can have it both ways.\n\nYou actually are going to have to identify where we are structurally and systemically falling short around being fair and equitable to all people as a justification for engaging in DEI initiatives. And then when you do that, it should be based upon our work, fairness, equity around the work, not simply identity politics. And I think too often we start conflating equality and fairness and justice with identity and preference.\n\nI hear what you're saying about systemic change. And I feel like for a lot of companies DEI looks like greens in the cafeteria during Black History Month. And that's cool and all, but how do you enact actual systemic change?\n\nActivities and events don't change the culture. You have to study yourself - not just do an inclusion survey - but look at all systems and processes: pay equity, the performance management systems, performance evaluation. If an organization is looking at its whole structure and improves that, then the business will be more successful as well. It will be more diverse, but it will also be more successful.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nTrump wants to reverse years of climate progress.

In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThis push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 order , issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as \"illegal and immoral,\" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave .\n\nDEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation.\n\nMany critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism.\n\nBut DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees.\n\n\"DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'\" David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool.\"\n\nIn defining DEI, Glasgow described \"diversity\" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. \"It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status.\n\n\"These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,\" she explained.\n\nThe equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work.\n\n\"It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,\" Fulton said. \"It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive.\"\n\nCorporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton.\n\n\"It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,\" Fulton said.\n\nGiven the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford, Harley Davidson , McDonald's, Meta and more.\n\nMany corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues.\n\nGlasgow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. \"It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,\" he said. \"It also depends on what you are trying to achieve.\"\n\nOne tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired - patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness.\n\nBy contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool.\n\nCorporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line.\n\n\"The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,\" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry.\"\n\nIn one noted study , McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research , the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management - women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015.\n\n\"[A] lot of the language and framing right now of DEI as illegal and discriminatory obscures who it's really for, which is all of us, and to the benefit of companies,\" Fulton told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nCait  Bladt contributed to this report.\n\nMegan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics.

In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThis push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 order , issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as \"illegal and immoral,\" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave .\n\nDEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation.\n\nMany critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism.\n\nBut DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees.\n\n\"DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'\" David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool.\"\n\nIn defining DEI, Glasgow described \"diversity\" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. \"It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status.\n\n\"These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,\" she explained.\n\nThe equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work.\n\n\"It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,\" Fulton said. \"It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive.\"\n\nCorporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton.\n\n\"It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,\" Fulton said.\n\nGiven the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford, Harley Davidson , McDonald's, Meta and more.\n\nMany corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues.\n\nGlasgow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. \"It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,\" he said. \"It also depends on what you are trying to achieve.\"\n\nOne tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired - patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness.\n\nBy contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool.\n\nCorporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line.\n\n\"The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,\" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry.\"\n\nIn one noted study , McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research , the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management - women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015.\n\n\"[A] lot of the language and framing right now of DEI as illegal and discriminatory obscures who it's really for, which is all of us, and to the benefit of companies,\" Fulton told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nCait  Bladt contributed to this report.\n\nMegan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics.

      "text": "Trump signs orders ending diversity programs;  federal DEI staffers being placed on leave\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  January 22, 2025 / 8:08 PM EST / CBS News\n\nPresident Trump signed executive orders Monday and Tuesday that aim to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. \"We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based,\" Mr. Trump said in his inauguration speech on Monday.\n\nA memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management   Tuesday evening called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave by Wednesday evening. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the move in a post on X , citing CBS News reporting.\n\nThe orders cut funding for so-called DEI initiatives across all agencies in order to \"end DEI inside the federal government,\" according to Trump administration officials. They also rescind numerous previous executive orders and actions from past administrations that aimed to promote diversity throughout the federal government.\n\nMr. Trump said he will direct the Office of Management and Budget to end all related mandates, policies and programs across agencies, including all initiatives that aim to promote diversity, equity and inclusion within departments. His aim is to restore what the administration considers to be a merit-based hiring system, according to officials and the text of the order.\n\nMr. Trump's effort to eradicate all traces of DEI within the government will be an ongoing effort.\n\nThe memo from OPM sent Tuesday directs the heads of all U.S. agencies to place all federal employees in diversity, equity and inclusion roles on leave by 5 p.m. Eastern Time Wednesday. Agencies must also \"take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) of DEIA offices,\" cancel upcoming DEI trainings and terminate contracts with DEI-related contractors by the same time Wednesday.\n\nThe agencies must also submit \"a written plan for executing a reduction-in-force action regarding the employees who work in a DEIA office,\" by 5 p.m. ET on Friday, Jan. 31, the memo stated.\n\nTrump officials and members of the Department of Justice will meet with different agencies monthly to evaluate how ongoing DEI programs are allegedly discriminating against Americans. The groups will \"figure out ways to end those,\" Trump officials said.\n\nLawyers at various agencies are wondering whether the directive applies to employees who work on DEI matters, but have a much broader work portfolio.\n\nTuesday's order also goes beyond just federal agencies, and directs the attorney general within 120 days to submit \"recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"\n\nMr. Trump is also directing the attorney general to create a plan to deter the private sector from adopting or continuing DEI programs.\n\n\"As a part of this plan, each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars,\" Tuesday's order read.\n\nThe orders also includes a review of spaces that have been renamed under DEI initiatives. It's unclear how they will affect the private sector. A Trump administration official Monday advised businesses to \"wait and see\" how further guidance will pertain to them.\n\nIncoming White House officials doubled down on Mr. Trump's distaste for inclusion efforts by proclaiming that there are only two sexes that the federal government will recognize: male and female. Mr. Trump signed an executive order Tuesday stating that it's policy of the federal government to only recognize \"two sexes, male and female,\" reversing the ability of Americans to mark \"other\" or \"X\" on federal forms.\n\n\"As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female,\" Mr. Trump said at his inauguration.\n\n\"So what we're doing today is defining that it is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These are sexes that are not changeable, and they are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,\" an incoming Trump official said Monday regarding the executive order. \"You are no longer going to have robust and long drop-down menus when asking about sex.\"\n\nAmong other things, the order will ensure that federal funds will not be used to promote gender inclusivity.\n\nA number of major U.S. employers including Meta, McDonald's and Walmart have wound down their diversity programs following a 2023 Supreme Court decision banning affirmative action in college admissions, and under pressure from conservative political activists.\n\nKristin  Brown contributed to this report.\n\nMegan Cerullo is a New York-based reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering small business, workplace, health care, consumer spending and personal finance topics.

      "text": "DOGE's anti-DEI drive flagged these programs. Only they weren't DEI.\n\nBusiness Insider has found examples of government programs that contained keywords like \"equity\" - but that weren't actually related to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives - that have been indefinitely paused after being flagged for review or, in some cases, cut entirely.\n\nThis comes in the weeks following President Donald Trump's executive order ending DEI initiatives.\n\nOne USAID employee told BI their program on helping people in sub-Saharan Africa \"grow equity through savings accounts\" was flagged to be reviewed by the DOGE office shortly after it began targeting DEI-related initiatives. The request for review happened prior to the widespread USAID cuts.\n\nThe USAID employee, now on administrative leave, said they believe the review was triggered because the program's name contained the word \"equity,\" even though it was geared toward financial equity rather than anything DEI-related. Business Insider has verified the employee's identity and others who spoke to us on the condition of anonymity.\n\nIt felt like \"they just used Control+F , or some AI did exactly that,\" they said. \"My impression was it was them just being ham-fisted.\"\n\nAnother federal employee, whose primary job function is managing relations with private equity-held businesses, was placed on administrative leave \"pursuant to the President's executive order on DEIA,\" per a dismissal memo reviewed by BI.\n\n\"My job has nothing to do with DEIA at all,\" the federal employee said, adding that they had attended DEI-related training, but such work was not part of their job description. BI reviewed a copy of the employee's job description and verified it did not contain any work tasks or priorities related to diversity, equity, or inclusion initiatives.\n\nIt remains unclear exactly why these two jobs were flagged to be cut.\n\nRepresentatives for the White House and the DOGE office did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nWhile it remains unclear exactly how the employees and programs were targeted for removal, Business Insider's reporting expands a growing list of cuts initiated by the DOGE office that appear to target terms like \"equity\" and \"gender\" even when used in contexts unrelated to their meanings in DEI frameworks. The USAID employee compared the nature of the cuts to a keyboard shortcut - find and replace - to target DEI-related language.\n\nThe Washington Post reported the DOGE office has fed sensitive data into AI software to identify programs to cut.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that references to the Enola Gay, the name of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, were among tens of thousands of photos and online posts marked for deletion as the Defense Department works to purge DEI-related content. The AP reported that it appeared the photos were flagged because of the word \"gay\"; the Enola Gay was named after a colonel's mother.\n\nPer Bloomberg , a DOGE office review led to millions of dollars in canceled affordable housing contracts after their websites and social media posts were combed for terms linked to equity and diversity. It remains unclear what ultimately caused each of the contracts - which addressed homelessness, disaster recovery, and other housing issues - to be flagged.\n\nBusiness Insider identified over a dozen removed pages of the Internal Revenue Manuals, the official staff instructions for members of the Internal Revenue Service. The pages previously contained notes indicating that their last update - made in response to a Biden-era executive order promoting equity - removed \"unnecessary gendered language,\" such as changing the phrase \"he or she\" to the gender-neutral pronoun \"they.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's review of the manual found that the pages were removed after the Trump executive order went into effect. The update note contained the word \"gender.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the IRS also removed pages from the manual about the \"inequity\" of holding on to taxpayer money longer than necessary and the \"inclusion\" of a taxpayer identification number on a form.\n\n\"I feel like this must be reactionary panic at the agencies,\" one tax attorney told BI about the pages removed from the IRS manuals. \"This doesn't seem possible or legal in some cases.\"\n\nTrump said during his address to Congress last week that the DOGE office is being \"headed by\" White House senior advisor and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. (The White House has said that Amy Gleason is the acting administrator.) The office has been tasked with rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government. But though the office has publicly celebrated its wins, it has quietly reversed some of its efforts and hedged its claims of cost savings .\n\nAlthough not every cut has been permanent, Trump has cheered Musk on, saying he hopes the billionaire businessman gets \" more aggressive \" in his effort to slash federal spending.\n\nCritics have lambasted the DOGE office and Musk for employing Silicon Valley's \" move fast and break things \" maxim rather than a slower, more targeted strategy.\n\nThe USAID employee whose equity program was flagged for review said they believed the program was likely permanently cut, along with the vast majority of USAID contracts cut through DOGE office efforts.\n\n\"The program was about increasing the impact-per-dollar in these developmental impact programs,\" the employee said, adding that they were making things efficient \"in a measured impactful way.\"\n\nHave a tip?

      "text": "Adobe's HR chief tells staff: We're done with DEI hiring goals\n\nAnother tech giant - Adobe - is scaling back its diversity hiring goals.\n\nAt an internal all-hands meeting on Monday, Adobe's chief people officer, Gloria Chen , said Adobe would no longer have diversity, equity, and inclusion hiring targets, internally dubbed \"Aspirational Goals,\" according to a recording of the meeting obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThese goals were set in 2020 to \"increase global diversity and inclusion\" at leadership levels, Adobe's company blog said. The goals included increasing female leadership representation to 30% globally, doubling underrepresented minorities in leadership roles, and doubling Black representation as a percentage of US employees by 2025.\n\n\"We will discontinue the practice of setting aspirational representation goals while continuing our focus on fair and consistent hiring practices,\" Chen said, adding Adobe had never actually hired based on such quotas.\n\nAdobe is the latest in a long list of companies , including Google , Meta , McDonald's, and Deloitte, to reduce its DEI initiatives. The change follows executive orders issued by President Donald Trump in January aimed at ending DEI programs within the federal government and its contractors.\n\nIn an email to BI, Adobe's spokesperson said, \"We've always believed in and remain committed to Adobe for All, which is our belief in creating a company culture where all employees are empowered to make an impact. While some programs and policies are changing, our values are not.\"\n\nDuring Monday's meeting, Chen said executive orders could be \"complex\" to interpret and Adobe was \"evaluating\" many internal programs, activities, and practices to ensure the company complied with them.\n\nChen added that Adobe didn't believe the DEI pullback applied to countries outside the US for now. As of November, Adobe had a little over 30,000 employees worldwide, 50% of which were in the US, according to a company filing.\n\nAdobe also removed all diversity mentions in its latest proxy statement, a change first spotted by Michelle Leder, the founder of Footnoted, a site that analyzes Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Adobe mentioned diversity 22 times in the previous year's proxy. This year's proxy also deleted a chart on director diversity.\n\nSome Adobe employees shared their frustration in an internal Slack channel, according to screenshots seen by BI. One employee said Adobe's unique culture of embracing different perspectives, called Adobe for All, now seems \"lost.\" Another said it was \"heartbreaking\" and asked for additional guidance from the leadership team.\n\n\"I think we all need more transparency around this issue,\" one of the people said.\n\nHave a tip?

Business Insider was unable to independently verify it.\n\nIn a statement sent to BI, a NASA spokesperson said: \"Our agency has complied with the requirements of the executive order and guidance from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management memorandum issued Jan. 21.\"\n\nThey added that the agency sent a message to its workforce ahead of the deadline.\n\nAccording to the BBC , versions of the email were also sent to employees at agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Treasury Department.\n\nThe Treasury's version, seen by the BBC, omitted the warning about \"adverse consequences,\" the outlet reported.\n\nTrump's executive order overturned efforts by the Biden administration aimed at advancing equity in the federal workforce.\n\nWhile in office, President Joe Biden required all federal agencies to submit equity action plans.\n\nAs of Friday, pages on some federal agency websites detailing DEI initiatives or profiling former chief diversity officers had been taken down.\n\nIn other cases, it appears that roles have been reduced to exclude DEI activities.\n\nOne example: An archived version of the about page of Elizabeth P. Martin, deputy inspector general at the US Postal Service Office of Inspector General, lists her as the agency's chief diversity officer. That title is now missing from her current page.\n\nJump to"

Inclusion means embracing ideas that run counter to or outside of long-held notions and narratives created without the benefit of the diversity of people and perspectives we now seek.\n\nIn our content, diversity means including people in their difference and in their ordinariness, mitigating the biases and prejudices that can warp coverage and distort truth. In hiring, we are striving to create a workforce that, at every level, looks more like America, even as we work to overcome a legacy of exclusion.\n\nDiversity means that we are doing the hard work of rooting out bigotry and bias in structures, systems and processes and replacing them with equity, empowerment, and fairness. It means that everyone is learning and growing, expanding their understanding of themselves and others and shedding the flawed and consequential views and practices that have made so much of this work necessary.\n\nAt NPR, diversity is not a program or initiative.

They include ending virtually all such programs in the federal government, calling them \"illegal,\" and \"Ending racial indoctrination in K through 12 schooling.\" According to the Trump administration, that includes teaching \"gender ideology and critical race theory\" in the classroom.\n\nA number of private companies and institutions are following suit.

      "text": "Here's what can be gained when students with disabilities are included in classrooms\n\nJonaki Mehta\n\nStudents with certain disabilities are often excluded from general education classrooms. Two children with Down syndrome show what can be gained from more inclusion.\n\nJUANA SUMMERS, HOST: More and more students with disabilities are learning alongside their non-disabled peers in school, but that depends on the disability. Federal data shows students with certain severe disabilities are still largely being educated separately. That's a problem because for decades, research has shown that including all students in the same classroom benefits all students. NPR's Jonaki Mehta spent time with two elementary schoolers who show what can be gained from inclusion in the classroom. JONAKI MEHTA, BYLINE: Adaline Whitmer and Kellen Hedler both attend public schools in Oklahoma. Kellen just turned 11. He wears red-rimmed glasses, is pretty outgoing, and he plays all kinds of sports. KELLEN HEDLER: Basketball and soccer, baseball and bowling. MEHTA: Bowling? KELLEN: Yeah. MEHTA: Adaline is 7 years old with long blonde hair. She's observant and kind of shy, and she loves cheerleading. ADALINE WHITMER: Again. MEHTA: Again. Adaline mostly communicates using sign language, but she's starting to talk. She and Kellen both have Down syndrome, a genetic condition that comes with a range of physical and developmental challenges. They both go to public school less than two hours away from each other. But their experience in the classroom - it's a world apart. I'm going to start with Adaline's story and the very first time her mom, Kristen Whitmer, picked Adaline up from kindergarten a couple years ago. She lined up with all the other parents at the front of the building. KRISTEN WHITMER: And I get a phone call, and they're, like, where are you? I was, like, well, I'm in the car line. I'll be there in a minute, you know? And they're like, oh, no, no, no, y'all go to the back of the building. MEHTA: Kristen was shocked that the default was to separate Adaline. Earlier this year, the school finally said Kristen could choose to pick up Adaline with the other students. It's a choice Adaline's school district, Bixby Public Schools, told NPR parents have always had. But Kristen says it's one of the many ways Adaline has been segregated at school. WHITMER: I say segregated because it is segregated from the typically developing population. And, yes, she's in general education only 47.18% of her day. MEHTA: Adaline spends most of her day in a separate room with other students with disabilities instead of with her first-grade peers. It's driven Kristen to find places outside of school where her daughter can feel included. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Four, five, six, seven, eight, jump. MEHTA: This past summer, Adaline began cheering at a local gym near her suburb just outside of Tulsa. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yeah. MEHTA: With help from a peer buddy, she's learning to do somersaults and dance moves and how to be part of a team. WHITMER: Getting to watch her kind of come out of that shell has been amazing. MEHTA: Kristen says Adaline has never experienced that kind of inclusion at school. She thinks that's a big reason Adaline isn't progressing as much as she could, both academically and socially. WHITMER: We want them to look at our children as general education students first. Let's start there, and then let's figure out how we can support them there. MEHTA: In fact, that's what federal law recommends. It says students with disabilities should be learning with their typically developing peers as much as possible. At least 80% of the day is a goal driven by federal policy. And remember; Adaline is only included in the general ed setting for less than half her day. JENNIFER KURTH: People have been studying this question of inclusion for 50 years now. MEHTA: That's Jennifer Kurth, a professor of special education at the University of Kansas. KURTH: Study after study is showing that there's no harm to being included, but there's great risks of harm to being segregated. Kids who were included develop better academic skills, better communication skills, better social skills - just kind of everything we try to measure. MEHTA: Kurth says that's especially true for students with disabilities like Down syndrome. And for kids in inclusive classrooms who don't have disabilities... KURTH: Those students have almost no differences in terms of their academic skills or sometimes slightly improved academic or social outcomes. MEHTA: But according to public data, Adaline's school district is falling short of federally driven goals for inclusion of special education students. WHITMER: We used to say based on race, people couldn't learn stuff or they had to be segregated. We know it's not true. So why is it OK that we're still treating an individual differently based upon having an extra chromosome or having a different way that they need to learn? MEHTA: Bixby Public Schools tells NPR they, quote, \"disagree with the characterization that any child is being segregated based on their individual educational placement\" and that they offer a range of specialized services based on student needs and abilities, sometimes in special settings. ADAM FREDERICK: Come on, in, please. MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline. FREDERICK: Good morning, Kellen. KELLEN: Good morning. MEHTA: Kellen goes to Frontier Elementary just outside Oklahoma City. He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher? KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'll be there in a minute, you know? And they're like, oh, no, no, no, y'all go to the back of the building. MEHTA: Kristen was shocked that the default was to separate Adaline. Earlier this year, the school finally said Kristen could choose to pick up Adaline with the other students. It's a choice Adaline's school district, Bixby Public Schools, told NPR parents have always had. But Kristen says it's one of the many ways Adaline has been segregated at school. WHITMER: I say segregated because it is segregated from the typically developing population. And, yes, she's in general education only 47.18% of her day. MEHTA: Adaline spends most of her day in a separate room with other students with disabilities instead of with her first-grade peers. It's driven Kristen to find places outside of school where her daughter can feel included. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Four, five, six, seven, eight, jump. MEHTA: This past summer, Adaline began cheering at a local gym near her suburb just outside of Tulsa. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yeah. MEHTA: With help from a peer buddy, she's learning to do somersaults and dance moves and how to be part of a team. WHITMER: Getting to watch her kind of come out of that shell has been amazing. MEHTA: Kristen says Adaline has never experienced that kind of inclusion at school. She thinks that's a big reason Adaline isn't progressing as much as she could, both academically and socially. WHITMER: We want them to look at our children as general education students first. Let's start there, and then let's figure out how we can support them there. MEHTA: In fact, that's what federal law recommends. It says students with disabilities should be learning with their typically developing peers as much as possible. At least 80% of the day is a goal driven by federal policy. And remember; Adaline is only included in the general ed setting for less than half her day. JENNIFER KURTH: People have been studying this question of inclusion for 50 years now. MEHTA: That's Jennifer Kurth, a professor of special education at the University of Kansas. KURTH: Study after study is showing that there's no harm to being included, but there's great risks of harm to being segregated. Kids who were included develop better academic skills, better communication skills, better social skills - just kind of everything we try to measure. MEHTA: Kurth says that's especially true for students with disabilities like Down syndrome. And for kids in inclusive classrooms who don't have disabilities... KURTH: Those students have almost no differences in terms of their academic skills or sometimes slightly improved academic or social outcomes. MEHTA: But according to public data, Adaline's school district is falling short of federally driven goals for inclusion of special education students. WHITMER: We used to say based on race, people couldn't learn stuff or they had to be segregated. We know it's not true. So why is it OK that we're still treating an individual differently based upon having an extra chromosome or having a different way that they need to learn? MEHTA: Bixby Public Schools tells NPR they, quote, \"disagree with the characterization that any child is being segregated based on their individual educational placement\" and that they offer a range of specialized services based on student needs and abilities, sometimes in special settings. ADAM FREDERICK: Come on, in, please. MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline. FREDERICK: Good morning, Kellen. KELLEN: Good morning. MEHTA: Kellen goes to Frontier Elementary just outside Oklahoma City. He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher? KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Federal data shows students with certain severe disabilities are still largely being educated separately. That's a problem because for decades, research has shown that including all students in the same classroom benefits all students. NPR's Jonaki Mehta spent time with two elementary schoolers who show what can be gained from inclusion in the classroom. JONAKI MEHTA, BYLINE: Adaline Whitmer and Kellen Hedler both attend public schools in Oklahoma. Kellen just turned 11. He wears red-rimmed glasses, is pretty outgoing, and he plays all kinds of sports. KELLEN HEDLER: Basketball and soccer, baseball and bowling. MEHTA: Bowling? KELLEN: Yeah. MEHTA: Adaline is 7 years old with long blonde hair. She's observant and kind of shy, and she loves cheerleading. ADALINE WHITMER: Again. MEHTA: Again. Adaline mostly communicates using sign language, but she's starting to talk. She and Kellen both have Down syndrome, a genetic condition that comes with a range of physical and developmental challenges. They both go to public school less than two hours away from each other. But their experience in the classroom - it's a world apart. I'm going to start with Adaline's story and the very first time her mom, Kristen Whitmer, picked Adaline up from kindergarten a couple years ago.

But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

MEHTA: Adaline is 7 years old with long blonde hair. She's observant and kind of shy, and she loves cheerleading. ADALINE WHITMER: Again. MEHTA: Again. Adaline mostly communicates using sign language, but she's starting to talk. She and Kellen both have Down syndrome, a genetic condition that comes with a range of physical and developmental challenges. They both go to public school less than two hours away from each other. But their experience in the classroom - it's a world apart. I'm going to start with Adaline's story and the very first time her mom, Kristen Whitmer, picked Adaline up from kindergarten a couple years ago. She lined up with all the other parents at the front of the building. KRISTEN WHITMER: And I get a phone call, and they're, like, where are you? I was, like, well, I'm in the car line. I'll be there in a minute, you know? And they're like, oh, no, no, no, y'all go to the back of the building. MEHTA: Kristen was shocked that the default was to separate Adaline. Earlier this year, the school finally said Kristen could choose to pick up Adaline with the other students. It's a choice Adaline's school district, Bixby Public Schools, told NPR parents have always had. But Kristen says it's one of the many ways Adaline has been segregated at school. WHITMER: I say segregated because it is segregated from the typically developing population. And, yes, she's in general education only 47.18% of her day. MEHTA: Adaline spends most of her day in a separate room with other students with disabilities instead of with her first-grade peers. It's driven Kristen to find places outside of school where her daughter can feel included. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Four, five, six, seven, eight, jump. MEHTA: This past summer, Adaline began cheering at a local gym near her suburb just outside of Tulsa. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yeah. MEHTA: With help from a peer buddy, she's learning to do somersaults and dance moves and how to be part of a team. WHITMER: Getting to watch her kind of come out of that shell has been amazing. MEHTA: Kristen says Adaline has never experienced that kind of inclusion at school. She thinks that's a big reason Adaline isn't progressing as much as she could, both academically and socially. WHITMER: We want them to look at our children as general education students first. Let's start there, and then let's figure out how we can support them there. MEHTA: In fact, that's what federal law recommends. It says students with disabilities should be learning with their typically developing peers as much as possible. At least 80% of the day is a goal driven by federal policy. And remember; Adaline is only included in the general ed setting for less than half her day. JENNIFER KURTH: People have been studying this question of inclusion for 50 years now. MEHTA: That's Jennifer Kurth, a professor of special education at the University of Kansas. KURTH: Study after study is showing that there's no harm to being included, but there's great risks of harm to being segregated. Kids who were included develop better academic skills, better communication skills, better social skills - just kind of everything we try to measure. MEHTA: Kurth says that's especially true for students with disabilities like Down syndrome. And for kids in inclusive classrooms who don't have disabilities... KURTH: Those students have almost no differences in terms of their academic skills or sometimes slightly improved academic or social outcomes. MEHTA: But according to public data, Adaline's school district is falling short of federally driven goals for inclusion of special education students. WHITMER: We used to say based on race, people couldn't learn stuff or they had to be segregated. We know it's not true. So why is it OK that we're still treating an individual differently based upon having an extra chromosome or having a different way that they need to learn? MEHTA: Bixby Public Schools tells NPR they, quote, \"disagree with the characterization that any child is being segregated based on their individual educational placement\" and that they offer a range of specialized services based on student needs and abilities, sometimes in special settings. ADAM FREDERICK: Come on, in, please. MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline. FREDERICK: Good morning, Kellen. KELLEN: Good morning. MEHTA: Kellen goes to Frontier Elementary just outside Oklahoma City. He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher? KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

ADALINE WHITMER: Again. MEHTA: Again. Adaline mostly communicates using sign language, but she's starting to talk. She and Kellen both have Down syndrome, a genetic condition that comes with a range of physical and developmental challenges. They both go to public school less than two hours away from each other. But their experience in the classroom - it's a world apart. I'm going to start with Adaline's story and the very first time her mom, Kristen Whitmer, picked Adaline up from kindergarten a couple years ago. She lined up with all the other parents at the front of the building. KRISTEN WHITMER: And I get a phone call, and they're, like, where are you? I was, like, well, I'm in the car line. I'll be there in a minute, you know? And they're like, oh, no, no, no, y'all go to the back of the building. MEHTA: Kristen was shocked that the default was to separate Adaline. Earlier this year, the school finally said Kristen could choose to pick up Adaline with the other students. It's a choice Adaline's school district, Bixby Public Schools, told NPR parents have always had. But Kristen says it's one of the many ways Adaline has been segregated at school. WHITMER: I say segregated because it is segregated from the typically developing population. And, yes, she's in general education only 47.18% of her day. MEHTA: Adaline spends most of her day in a separate room with other students with disabilities instead of with her first-grade peers. It's driven Kristen to find places outside of school where her daughter can feel included. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Four, five, six, seven, eight, jump. MEHTA: This past summer, Adaline began cheering at a local gym near her suburb just outside of Tulsa. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yeah. MEHTA: With help from a peer buddy, she's learning to do somersaults and dance moves and how to be part of a team. WHITMER: Getting to watch her kind of come out of that shell has been amazing. MEHTA: Kristen says Adaline has never experienced that kind of inclusion at school. She thinks that's a big reason Adaline isn't progressing as much as she could, both academically and socially. WHITMER: We want them to look at our children as general education students first. Let's start there, and then let's figure out how we can support them there. MEHTA: In fact, that's what federal law recommends. It says students with disabilities should be learning with their typically developing peers as much as possible. At least 80% of the day is a goal driven by federal policy. And remember; Adaline is only included in the general ed setting for less than half her day. JENNIFER KURTH: People have been studying this question of inclusion for 50 years now. MEHTA: That's Jennifer Kurth, a professor of special education at the University of Kansas. KURTH: Study after study is showing that there's no harm to being included, but there's great risks of harm to being segregated. Kids who were included develop better academic skills, better communication skills, better social skills - just kind of everything we try to measure. MEHTA: Kurth says that's especially true for students with disabilities like Down syndrome. And for kids in inclusive classrooms who don't have disabilities... KURTH: Those students have almost no differences in terms of their academic skills or sometimes slightly improved academic or social outcomes. MEHTA: But according to public data, Adaline's school district is falling short of federally driven goals for inclusion of special education students. WHITMER: We used to say based on race, people couldn't learn stuff or they had to be segregated. We know it's not true. So why is it OK that we're still treating an individual differently based upon having an extra chromosome or having a different way that they need to learn? MEHTA: Bixby Public Schools tells NPR they, quote, \"disagree with the characterization that any child is being segregated based on their individual educational placement\" and that they offer a range of specialized services based on student needs and abilities, sometimes in special settings. ADAM FREDERICK: Come on, in, please. MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline. FREDERICK: Good morning, Kellen. KELLEN: Good morning. MEHTA: Kellen goes to Frontier Elementary just outside Oklahoma City. He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher? KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently.

KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

She and Kellen both have Down syndrome, a genetic condition that comes with a range of physical and developmental challenges. They both go to public school less than two hours away from each other. But their experience in the classroom - it's a world apart. I'm going to start with Adaline's story and the very first time her mom, Kristen Whitmer, picked Adaline up from kindergarten a couple years ago. She lined up with all the other parents at the front of the building. KRISTEN WHITMER: And I get a phone call, and they're, like, where are you? I was, like, well, I'm in the car line. I'll be there in a minute, you know? And they're like, oh, no, no, no, y'all go to the back of the building. MEHTA: Kristen was shocked that the default was to separate Adaline. Earlier this year, the school finally said Kristen could choose to pick up Adaline with the other students. It's a choice Adaline's school district, Bixby Public Schools, told NPR parents have always had. But Kristen says it's one of the many ways Adaline has been segregated at school. WHITMER: I say segregated because it is segregated from the typically developing population. And, yes, she's in general education only 47.18% of her day. MEHTA: Adaline spends most of her day in a separate room with other students with disabilities instead of with her first-grade peers. It's driven Kristen to find places outside of school where her daughter can feel included. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Four, five, six, seven, eight, jump. MEHTA: This past summer, Adaline began cheering at a local gym near her suburb just outside of Tulsa. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yeah. MEHTA: With help from a peer buddy, she's learning to do somersaults and dance moves and how to be part of a team. WHITMER: Getting to watch her kind of come out of that shell has been amazing. MEHTA: Kristen says Adaline has never experienced that kind of inclusion at school. She thinks that's a big reason Adaline isn't progressing as much as she could, both academically and socially. WHITMER: We want them to look at our children as general education students first. Let's start there, and then let's figure out how we can support them there. MEHTA: In fact, that's what federal law recommends. It says students with disabilities should be learning with their typically developing peers as much as possible. At least 80% of the day is a goal driven by federal policy. And remember; Adaline is only included in the general ed setting for less than half her day. JENNIFER KURTH: People have been studying this question of inclusion for 50 years now. MEHTA: That's Jennifer Kurth, a professor of special education at the University of Kansas. KURTH: Study after study is showing that there's no harm to being included, but there's great risks of harm to being segregated. Kids who were included develop better academic skills, better communication skills, better social skills - just kind of everything we try to measure. MEHTA: Kurth says that's especially true for students with disabilities like Down syndrome. And for kids in inclusive classrooms who don't have disabilities... KURTH: Those students have almost no differences in terms of their academic skills or sometimes slightly improved academic or social outcomes. MEHTA: But according to public data, Adaline's school district is falling short of federally driven goals for inclusion of special education students. WHITMER: We used to say based on race, people couldn't learn stuff or they had to be segregated. We know it's not true. So why is it OK that we're still treating an individual differently based upon having an extra chromosome or having a different way that they need to learn? MEHTA: Bixby Public Schools tells NPR they, quote, \"disagree with the characterization that any child is being segregated based on their individual educational placement\" and that they offer a range of specialized services based on student needs and abilities, sometimes in special settings. ADAM FREDERICK: Come on, in, please. MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline. FREDERICK: Good morning, Kellen. KELLEN: Good morning. MEHTA: Kellen goes to Frontier Elementary just outside Oklahoma City. He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible.

KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nAdaline mostly communicates using sign language, but she's starting to talk. She and Kellen both have Down syndrome, a genetic condition that comes with a range of physical and developmental challenges. They both go to public school less than two hours away from each other. But their experience in the classroom - it's a world apart. I'm going to start with Adaline's story and the very first time her mom, Kristen Whitmer, picked Adaline up from kindergarten a couple years ago. She lined up with all the other parents at the front of the building. KRISTEN WHITMER: And I get a phone call, and they're, like, where are you? I was, like, well, I'm in the car line. I'll be there in a minute, you know? And they're like, oh, no, no, no, y'all go to the back of the building. MEHTA: Kristen was shocked that the default was to separate Adaline. Earlier this year, the school finally said Kristen could choose to pick up Adaline with the other students. It's a choice Adaline's school district, Bixby Public Schools, told NPR parents have always had. But Kristen says it's one of the many ways Adaline has been segregated at school. WHITMER: I say segregated because it is segregated from the typically developing population. And, yes, she's in general education only 47.18% of her day. MEHTA: Adaline spends most of her day in a separate room with other students with disabilities instead of with her first-grade peers. It's driven Kristen to find places outside of school where her daughter can feel included. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Four, five, six, seven, eight, jump. MEHTA: This past summer, Adaline began cheering at a local gym near her suburb just outside of Tulsa. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yeah. MEHTA: With help from a peer buddy, she's learning to do somersaults and dance moves and how to be part of a team. WHITMER: Getting to watch her kind of come out of that shell has been amazing. MEHTA: Kristen says Adaline has never experienced that kind of inclusion at school. She thinks that's a big reason Adaline isn't progressing as much as she could, both academically and socially. WHITMER: We want them to look at our children as general education students first. Let's start there, and then let's figure out how we can support them there. MEHTA: In fact, that's what federal law recommends. It says students with disabilities should be learning with their typically developing peers as much as possible. At least 80% of the day is a goal driven by federal policy. And remember; Adaline is only included in the general ed setting for less than half her day. JENNIFER KURTH: People have been studying this question of inclusion for 50 years now. MEHTA: That's Jennifer Kurth, a professor of special education at the University of Kansas. KURTH: Study after study is showing that there's no harm to being included, but there's great risks of harm to being segregated. Kids who were included develop better academic skills, better communication skills, better social skills - just kind of everything we try to measure. MEHTA: Kurth says that's especially true for students with disabilities like Down syndrome. And for kids in inclusive classrooms who don't have disabilities... KURTH: Those students have almost no differences in terms of their academic skills or sometimes slightly improved academic or social outcomes. MEHTA: But according to public data, Adaline's school district is falling short of federally driven goals for inclusion of special education students. WHITMER: We used to say based on race, people couldn't learn stuff or they had to be segregated. We know it's not true. So why is it OK that we're still treating an individual differently based upon having an extra chromosome or having a different way that they need to learn? MEHTA: Bixby Public Schools tells NPR they, quote, \"disagree with the characterization that any child is being segregated based on their individual educational placement\" and that they offer a range of specialized services based on student needs and abilities, sometimes in special settings. ADAM FREDERICK: Come on, in, please. MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline. FREDERICK: Good morning, Kellen. KELLEN: Good morning. MEHTA: Kellen goes to Frontier Elementary just outside Oklahoma City. He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher?

Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Earlier this year, the school finally said Kristen could choose to pick up Adaline with the other students. It's a choice Adaline's school district, Bixby Public Schools, told NPR parents have always had. But Kristen says it's one of the many ways Adaline has been segregated at school. WHITMER: I say segregated because it is segregated from the typically developing population. And, yes, she's in general education only 47.18% of her day. MEHTA: Adaline spends most of her day in a separate room with other students with disabilities instead of with her first-grade peers. It's driven Kristen to find places outside of school where her daughter can feel included. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Four, five, six, seven, eight, jump. MEHTA: This past summer, Adaline began cheering at a local gym near her suburb just outside of Tulsa. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yeah. MEHTA: With help from a peer buddy, she's learning to do somersaults and dance moves and how to be part of a team. WHITMER: Getting to watch her kind of come out of that shell has been amazing. MEHTA: Kristen says Adaline has never experienced that kind of inclusion at school. She thinks that's a big reason Adaline isn't progressing as much as she could, both academically and socially. WHITMER: We want them to look at our children as general education students first. Let's start there, and then let's figure out how we can support them there. MEHTA: In fact, that's what federal law recommends. It says students with disabilities should be learning with their typically developing peers as much as possible. At least 80% of the day is a goal driven by federal policy. And remember; Adaline is only included in the general ed setting for less than half her day. JENNIFER KURTH: People have been studying this question of inclusion for 50 years now. MEHTA: That's Jennifer Kurth, a professor of special education at the University of Kansas. KURTH: Study after study is showing that there's no harm to being included, but there's great risks of harm to being segregated. Kids who were included develop better academic skills, better communication skills, better social skills - just kind of everything we try to measure. MEHTA: Kurth says that's especially true for students with disabilities like Down syndrome. And for kids in inclusive classrooms who don't have disabilities... KURTH: Those students have almost no differences in terms of their academic skills or sometimes slightly improved academic or social outcomes. MEHTA: But according to public data, Adaline's school district is falling short of federally driven goals for inclusion of special education students. WHITMER: We used to say based on race, people couldn't learn stuff or they had to be segregated. We know it's not true. So why is it OK that we're still treating an individual differently based upon having an extra chromosome or having a different way that they need to learn? MEHTA: Bixby Public Schools tells NPR they, quote, \"disagree with the characterization that any child is being segregated based on their individual educational placement\" and that they offer a range of specialized services based on student needs and abilities, sometimes in special settings. ADAM FREDERICK: Come on, in, please. MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline. FREDERICK: Good morning, Kellen. KELLEN: Good morning. MEHTA: Kellen goes to Frontier Elementary just outside Oklahoma City. He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher? KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean?

ADAM FREDERICK: Come on, in, please. MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline. FREDERICK: Good morning, Kellen. KELLEN: Good morning. MEHTA: Kellen goes to Frontier Elementary just outside Oklahoma City. He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher? KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It's driven Kristen to find places outside of school where her daughter can feel included. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Four, five, six, seven, eight, jump. MEHTA: This past summer, Adaline began cheering at a local gym near her suburb just outside of Tulsa. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yeah. MEHTA: With help from a peer buddy, she's learning to do somersaults and dance moves and how to be part of a team. WHITMER: Getting to watch her kind of come out of that shell has been amazing. MEHTA: Kristen says Adaline has never experienced that kind of inclusion at school. She thinks that's a big reason Adaline isn't progressing as much as she could, both academically and socially. WHITMER: We want them to look at our children as general education students first. Let's start there, and then let's figure out how we can support them there. MEHTA: In fact, that's what federal law recommends. It says students with disabilities should be learning with their typically developing peers as much as possible. At least 80% of the day is a goal driven by federal policy. And remember; Adaline is only included in the general ed setting for less than half her day. JENNIFER KURTH: People have been studying this question of inclusion for 50 years now. MEHTA: That's Jennifer Kurth, a professor of special education at the University of Kansas. KURTH: Study after study is showing that there's no harm to being included, but there's great risks of harm to being segregated. Kids who were included develop better academic skills, better communication skills, better social skills - just kind of everything we try to measure. MEHTA: Kurth says that's especially true for students with disabilities like Down syndrome. And for kids in inclusive classrooms who don't have disabilities... KURTH: Those students have almost no differences in terms of their academic skills or sometimes slightly improved academic or social outcomes. MEHTA: But according to public data, Adaline's school district is falling short of federally driven goals for inclusion of special education students. WHITMER: We used to say based on race, people couldn't learn stuff or they had to be segregated. We know it's not true.

So why is it OK that we're still treating an individual differently based upon having an extra chromosome or having a different way that they need to learn? MEHTA: Bixby Public Schools tells NPR they, quote, \"disagree with the characterization that any child is being segregated based on their individual educational placement\" and that they offer a range of specialized services based on student needs and abilities, sometimes in special settings. ADAM FREDERICK: Come on, in, please. MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline. FREDERICK: Good morning, Kellen. KELLEN: Good morning. MEHTA: Kellen goes to Frontier Elementary just outside Oklahoma City. He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher? KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

MEHTA: Kristen says Adaline has never experienced that kind of inclusion at school. She thinks that's a big reason Adaline isn't progressing as much as she could, both academically and socially. WHITMER: We want them to look at our children as general education students first. Let's start there, and then let's figure out how we can support them there. MEHTA: In fact, that's what federal law recommends. It says students with disabilities should be learning with their typically developing peers as much as possible. At least 80% of the day is a goal driven by federal policy. And remember; Adaline is only included in the general ed setting for less than half her day. JENNIFER KURTH: People have been studying this question of inclusion for 50 years now. MEHTA: That's Jennifer Kurth, a professor of special education at the University of Kansas. KURTH: Study after study is showing that there's no harm to being included, but there's great risks of harm to being segregated. Kids who were included develop better academic skills, better communication skills, better social skills - just kind of everything we try to measure. MEHTA: Kurth says that's especially true for students with disabilities like Down syndrome. And for kids in inclusive classrooms who don't have disabilities... KURTH: Those students have almost no differences in terms of their academic skills or sometimes slightly improved academic or social outcomes.

KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher? KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

MEHTA: Kristen says Adaline has never experienced that kind of inclusion at school. She thinks that's a big reason Adaline isn't progressing as much as she could, both academically and socially. WHITMER: We want them to look at our children as general education students first. Let's start there, and then let's figure out how we can support them there. MEHTA: In fact, that's what federal law recommends. It says students with disabilities should be learning with their typically developing peers as much as possible. At least 80% of the day is a goal driven by federal policy. And remember; Adaline is only included in the general ed setting for less than half her day. JENNIFER KURTH: People have been studying this question of inclusion for 50 years now. MEHTA: That's Jennifer Kurth, a professor of special education at the University of Kansas. KURTH: Study after study is showing that there's no harm to being included, but there's great risks of harm to being segregated. Kids who were included develop better academic skills, better communication skills, better social skills - just kind of everything we try to measure. MEHTA: Kurth says that's especially true for students with disabilities like Down syndrome. And for kids in inclusive classrooms who don't have disabilities... KURTH: Those students have almost no differences in terms of their academic skills or sometimes slightly improved academic or social outcomes. MEHTA: But according to public data, Adaline's school district is falling short of federally driven goals for inclusion of special education students. WHITMER: We used to say based on race, people couldn't learn stuff or they had to be segregated. We know it's not true. So why is it OK that we're still treating an individual differently based upon having an extra chromosome or having a different way that they need to learn? MEHTA: Bixby Public Schools tells NPR they, quote, \"disagree with the characterization that any child is being segregated based on their individual educational placement\" and that they offer a range of specialized services based on student needs and abilities, sometimes in special settings. ADAM FREDERICK: Come on, in, please. MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline.

MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nMEHTA: In fact, that's what federal law recommends. It says students with disabilities should be learning with their typically developing peers as much as possible. At least 80% of the day is a goal driven by federal policy. And remember; Adaline is only included in the general ed setting for less than half her day. JENNIFER KURTH: People have been studying this question of inclusion for 50 years now. MEHTA: That's Jennifer Kurth, a professor of special education at the University of Kansas. KURTH: Study after study is showing that there's no harm to being included, but there's great risks of harm to being segregated. Kids who were included develop better academic skills, better communication skills, better social skills - just kind of everything we try to measure. MEHTA: Kurth says that's especially true for students with disabilities like Down syndrome. And for kids in inclusive classrooms who don't have disabilities... KURTH: Those students have almost no differences in terms of their academic skills or sometimes slightly improved academic or social outcomes. MEHTA: But according to public data, Adaline's school district is falling short of federally driven goals for inclusion of special education students. WHITMER: We used to say based on race, people couldn't learn stuff or they had to be segregated. We know it's not true. So why is it OK that we're still treating an individual differently based upon having an extra chromosome or having a different way that they need to learn? MEHTA: Bixby Public Schools tells NPR they, quote, \"disagree with the characterization that any child is being segregated based on their individual educational placement\" and that they offer a range of specialized services based on student needs and abilities, sometimes in special settings. ADAM FREDERICK: Come on, in, please. MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline. FREDERICK: Good morning, Kellen. KELLEN: Good morning. MEHTA: Kellen goes to Frontier Elementary just outside Oklahoma City. He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher? KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently.

Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher? KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nKURTH: Study after study is showing that there's no harm to being included, but there's great risks of harm to being segregated. Kids who were included develop better academic skills, better communication skills, better social skills - just kind of everything we try to measure. MEHTA: Kurth says that's especially true for students with disabilities like Down syndrome. And for kids in inclusive classrooms who don't have disabilities... KURTH: Those students have almost no differences in terms of their academic skills or sometimes slightly improved academic or social outcomes. MEHTA: But according to public data, Adaline's school district is falling short of federally driven goals for inclusion of special education students. WHITMER: We used to say based on race, people couldn't learn stuff or they had to be segregated. We know it's not true. So why is it OK that we're still treating an individual differently based upon having an extra chromosome or having a different way that they need to learn? MEHTA: Bixby Public Schools tells NPR they, quote, \"disagree with the characterization that any child is being segregated based on their individual educational placement\" and that they offer a range of specialized services based on student needs and abilities, sometimes in special settings. ADAM FREDERICK: Come on, in, please. MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline. FREDERICK: Good morning, Kellen. KELLEN: Good morning. MEHTA: Kellen goes to Frontier Elementary just outside Oklahoma City. He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough.

MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

WHITMER: We used to say based on race, people couldn't learn stuff or they had to be segregated. We know it's not true. So why is it OK that we're still treating an individual differently based upon having an extra chromosome or having a different way that they need to learn? MEHTA: Bixby Public Schools tells NPR they, quote, \"disagree with the characterization that any child is being segregated based on their individual educational placement\" and that they offer a range of specialized services based on student needs and abilities, sometimes in special settings. ADAM FREDERICK: Come on, in, please. MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline. FREDERICK: Good morning, Kellen. KELLEN: Good morning. MEHTA: Kellen goes to Frontier Elementary just outside Oklahoma City. He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher? KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities.

But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

MEHTA: Just a couple hours southwest of Tulsa, Kellen Hedler, the 11-year-old we met earlier, is having a very different school experience from Adaline. FREDERICK: Good morning, Kellen. KELLEN: Good morning. MEHTA: Kellen goes to Frontier Elementary just outside Oklahoma City. He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher? KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently.

But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He spends most of his day in the classroom alongside his fourth-grade peers. FREDERICK: Three plus three plus three. What is our total? KELLEN: I know. FREDERICK: Kellen, what's our total? KELLEN: Nine. FREDERICK: Nine. You got it. MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher? KELLEN: Yes. We're reading. MEHTA: You're reading. You like - I've heard you're... This year one of Kellen's goals is to make transitions like these between classes without an adult. His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently.

He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

MEHTA: There's a classroom assistant who's around for when Kellen needs support, but he's largely independent. His two classroom teachers, Adam Frederick and Robyn Fox, both work together and with one of Kellen's special ed teachers to make sure their lessons are meeting Kellen where he's at. Like, there was recently a test where students had to label continents on a map, something Mrs. Fox says Kellen wasn't yet ready to do. ROBYN FOX: For Kellen, even with the word bank, it's still just not quite accommodated enough. So we just gave him a world map that had all the continents at the bottom, and it said, color Africa yellow. Color Asia orange. MEHTA: That is a point of an accommodation - holding students with disabilities to the same benchmarks as their peers while making learning more accessible. Now, sometimes Kellen does need specialized instruction outside of his regular classrooms. Where are you walking right now? KELLEN: Mrs. Lobaugh. MEHTA: Mrs. Lobaugh. That's your speech teacher?

His mom, Kristy Hedler, says it's one of the many goals he's already meeting. KRISTY HEDLER: Kellen's academic growth has been amazing. He's made progress across all areas. He's made very, very good friends. MEHTA: When Kellen first transferred to this inclusive school, his reading skills were somewhat stagnant, and he was having a hard time recognizing common words. And now... HEDLER: The reading has just exploded. Like, at home, he goes and he gets a book, and he's reading for enjoyment now. MEHTA: Kristy pulls up a video of Kellen reading to her recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KELLEN: (Reading) Oh, no, says the art teacher. HEDLER: He's not just reading words. He's participating in a story. You know what I mean? MEHTA: Kristy chalks up that progress to a lot of hard work on Kellen's part and an inclusive environment that enables him to learn. Kellen's spending over 80% of his day in the general ed classroom, a target many schools struggle with. Now, inclusive classrooms are becoming more common in America's public schools. That's according to federal data. But inclusion has remained low for some students, including those with intellectual disabilities. For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference. MEHTA: A difference they hope Adaline and other students like her will see one day soon. Jonaki Mehta, NPR News, Oklahoma. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

For Kristy, inclusion at school is an essential way for Kellen to learn how to navigate the world. HEDLER: At some point, the schooling stops. But we want them to have the opportunity to be productive members of their community, to have friendships, to live independently. MEHTA: Kristy and Adaline's mom, Kristen, are both part of a group for parents of kids with disabilities. That's how they met, and they talk often. And recently, Kristen got the chance to meet Kellen. WHITMER: And he's doing amazing. Like, that gives us hope because they have not always had an inclusive placement. But just with the right adults at the school, with the let's-try-this mentality, it's made a world of difference.

      "text": "Schools, colleges have 2 weeks to ban DEI. An education expert warns it won't be easy\n\nBy\n\nOlivia Hampton\n\n,\n\nObed Manuel\n\n,\n\nLeila Fadel\n\nAn empty elementary school classroom is seen on Tuesday, Aug. 17, 2021 in the Bronx borough of New York. Brittainy Newman/AP hide caption\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education has given schools and universities that receive federal funding an ultimatum: eliminate diversity initiatives or risk losing federal funding.\n\nThe Education Department has directed institutions, from preschools to colleges, to stop using \"racial preferences\" in admissions, financial aid, hiring and other areas in a letter sent last week . The directive extends President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs as part of his fight against \"wokeness.\"\n\nCraig Trainor, the department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, wrote in the letter to school and college administrators that treating students differently based on race violates the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling on affirmative action and \"breaks the law.\"\n\nThe funding at risk includes Title IV, student loans, state funding for curriculum development, free or reduced lunch programs, and support for students with special needs, among others.\n\nPresident Trump's executive actions aimed at eliminating DEI efforts across various institutions has drawn strong criticism and legal challenges. The American Association of University Professors, the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, and other groups argue in a lawsuit filed this month that Trump's orders exceed executive authority, violate the First and Fifth Amendments, and threaten academic freedom and access to higher education.\n\nCynthia Jackson-Hammond, president of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, told Morning Edition 's Leila Fadel that meeting the two-week deadline will be a challenge for school administrators because it requires them to change their core value systems.\n\n\"There's a fine line between removing programs that are considered to be discriminatory by race and removing programs that speak to a cultural or ethnicity support for students,\" Jackson-Hammond said. \"So this is not going to be a quick and easy kind of examination.\"\n\nShe added that the education department's letter is vague and doesn't exactly lay out what is meant by DEI or what eliminating it entails.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLeila Fadel: When you read this letter from the Department of Education, what was your initial reaction?\n\nCynthia Jackson-Hammond: I thought the letter was very overreaching. I thought it was threatening. And it certainly does demean the principles of institutional autonomy in higher education. It is very vague, and we must remember that it is guidance and not the law.\n\nFadel: Well, what are you hearing from college administrations about what they're going to do?\n\nJackson-Hammond : Well, the first thing to set is a two-week span that they have to do a real assessment as to whether or not any of their programs fit the vagueness of this letter. I think that some will seek legal recourse, as some will begin to do a deep dive to examine if any of their programs are violating the law. And that is a process that would take more than two weeks. But I'm sure that they will do that level of investigation.\n\nFadel: But do they know how to comply? You mentioned the vagueness. Will this impact what school libraries can carry? Will it change what schools can teach? Do administrators have an understanding of how to comply?\n\nJackson-Hammond: I don't think that they have a full understanding. And that is the problem with this \"dear colleague\" letter, which is far from being collegial. They will have opportunities to look - first at their programs - and then do a deep dive with other, less obvious examples of programming that they may not have even thought about as being discriminatory to any group. Institutions are there to support their students regardless of their race, culture or ethnicity. There's a fine line between removing programs that are considered to be discriminatory by by race and removing programs that speak to a cultural or ethnicity support for students.\n\nFadel: The letter from the DOE says that right now schools and colleges are treating students differently on the basis of race. And it claims that race-based programs have hurt white and Asian students in particular. Is this an accurate description of what diversity, equity and inclusion programs do at schools and colleges?\n\nJackson-Hammond: No, it's not. These are subjective inaccuracies that's presented in this letter in an effort to be inclusive and to provide value to the educational process for all students. There's nothing in the guidelines of institutions that said that only these students or only one particular group of students would benefit from this form of program. So that kind of language is not there.\n\nFadel: Is structural and systemic racism that minority communities face in the United States, particularly Black Americans, a false premise as this letter states?\n\nJackson-Hammond: If the premises were false, then there would be no need to have these kinds of support systems for all students. We have to go back and look historically at what America has done to alienate or to keep students of certain race or certain culture from the educational experience. If it were never identified as such, then the need for diversity, equity and inclusion would not have been needed.\n\nFadel: Describe to me some of the diversity, equity and inclusion programs, what they do and what their goal is. If they're not around, what happens?\n\nJackson-Hammond: Too often we focus just on diversity. And the second part of diversity, equity and inclusion is equity, which means fairness. How do you present policies, practices and procedures that are fair to everyone, including faculty, staff and students? Being able to have programs that support women in leadership or women just in the work environment - that's fairness. Prior to the constructs of DEI, there was very little alternatives or options for women to have a fair and equal chance to succeed in the communities or in higher education in general.\n\nFadel: And if colleges and schools lose this funding, what happens?.\n\nJackson-Hammond: If they lose their funding, I hope that colleges and institutions do not lose their integrity, their principles and their values just to appease funding. I think that there would be community support to allow them to do the programs that represent the values of that institution.\n\nOlivia Hampton edited the radio version of this story.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

But is it effective?\n\n\"Many antiracist frameworks approach the work of anti-racism from the top down,\" Chloé Valdary says. \"And their workshops will perpetuate the notion that people based upon skin color should be put into boxes.\"\n\nDEI training is now a $3.4 billion industry. But what's all that money actually buying?\n\n\"A lot of companies will ask, you know, 'Who else have you worked with or what did you do with so-and-so?' And that to me, signals that it's not intrinsic, that it's kind of like this exercise in conformity,\" diversity consultant Robert Livingston says.\n\nSo, what kind of DEI training actually works - and how do we know that?\n\nToday, On Point : Rethinking diversity, equity and inclusion training.\n\nFrank Dobbin , chair of the department of sociology at Harvard University. Co-author of the book \" Getting to Diversity: What Works and What Doesn't .\" ( @DobbinFrank )\n\nRobert Livingston , diversity consultant to scores of Fortune 500 companies and other organizations. Lecturer in public policy, Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nChloé Valdary , CEO, Theory of Enchantment, an organization that offers anti-racism training. ( @cvaldary )\n\nANTHONY BROOKS: Let me introduce another voice into this conversation. Chloé Valdary. She's the CEO of The Theory of Enchantment, a diversity and inclusion program that focuses its training on love, among other things. And Chloé, welcome to On Point. It's great to have you.\n\nCHLOÉ VALDARY: Thank you so much. Glad to be here.\n\nBROOKS: Yeah, it's really good to have you. So your website lists clients. They include TikTok. WeWork. The Federal Aviation Administration, and Greenwich High School. And I was reading a really interesting article about your program, and it points out that your website asks potential customers a loaded question, looking for an anti-racism program that actually fights bigotry instead of spreading it.\n\nBROOKS: So let's start there. I'd love to you to just sort of explain that provocative statement there.\n\nVALDARY: Yeah, I think that a lot of our partners were feeling very much under attack by bringing in or when bringing in programs that perhaps centered, for example, a Robin DiAngelo style approach to DEI. An approach that where the facilitator would tell folks, depending upon their background, depending upon their skin color, things like, you are privileged. Or things like, you are underprivileged. Either explicitly or implicitly. And oftentimes in facilitation, that would actually result in a sense of fracturing between groups of different ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it would also result in, instead of this coming together of people from different backgrounds, which I totally agree with, it would result in a kind of self-segregation. People would feel like they couldn't empathize with other people, and they would also assume different things about the lived experiences of others. And so many of our partners and clients were coming to us feeling like these are the only types of DEI programs that are in the market today. We are looking for something else, something as an alternative.\n\nAnd at that point, I had already developed a curriculum that taught and focused on what Dr. King called the beloved community, which really centers agape love, unconditional love, which Dr. King said was the aim of the civil rights movement. Which center that as the sort of organizing principle around which to fight for equity, equality.\n\nBROOKS: We actually have tape from Dr. King talking about this idea of agape. So let's listen. This is Dr. King's Love Your Enemy sermon from 1957 in Montgomery, Alabama, where he talked about the idea.\n\nMARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. [Tape]: It is a love that takes nothing in return. It is an overflowing love. It's what theologians would call the love of God working in the lives of men. And when you rise to love on this level, you begin to love men not because they are likable, but because God loves them.\n\nBROOKS: I'm reading about the principles that guide your course work. One, treat people like human beings, not political abstractions. Criticize to uplift and empower, never to tear down, never to destroy. And three, root everything you do in love and compassion. So what does that end up looking like as a DEI training program?\n\nVALDARY: So it looks like really trying to give organizations an ecology of practices. We you know, I heard you guys talking about training earlier and how training is often, you know, a 15-minute sort of implicit bias test. But Theory of Enchantment is actually about giving folks long term practices, that they can then use those practices to build their systems within their company around.\n\nAnd with this, we're actually talking about multi-year partnerships. This kind of way of being that centered around agape love does not happen overnight. And it can't happen overnight because, you know, we are all susceptible to bias. We are all susceptible to self-deception. And the only way we can actually help to counter that or even strive to counter that is by practicing. And so I'll give you an example.\n\nTreat people like human beings, not political abstractions. Well, we ask the question, what does it mean to be a human being? One of the practices that we give people is called the Who am I? practice where they actually ask themselves, Who am I? And for everything that comes to them, whether positive or negative, they are asked to say thank you. They're asked to express gratitude for the complexity of their being. Why is that important? Because when we stereotype others, we are simultaneously stereotyping ourselves.\n\nSo if I am walking around thinking that a group of people are, for example, lazy, right? I stereotype another ethnic group as lazy, I am denying the fact that in certain contexts I am lazy and if I don't make peace or come to come into right relationship with that aspect of my identity, if I am suppressing that or ashamed of that, I am far more likely to unconsciously project it onto other people who do not look like me.\n\nSo we give people that Who am I? practice. We introduce people to the Who am I? practice and we also encourage them to practice it on a regular basis. So once a week, for example, this is just one example of many practices that we give, especially in our in our online curriculum. That again, is all about this awareness that we are all susceptible to bias, we are all prone to self-deception. And the only way to sort of work through that and it is a lifetime practice. The only way to work through that is not by, you know, memorizing a set of propositions, but by actually committing to a discipline.\n\nBROOKS: One of the pop culture references that you use in your Theory of Enchantment training is from an interview the rapper Jay-Z did with The New York Times in 2017, where he talked about his experience going to therapy. So I want to play a clip from that.\n\nJAY-Z [Tape]: Every emotion is connected, and it comes from somewhere. You know, you realize that, you know, someone's racist toward you, not even about you. It ain't about you. It's about their upbringing and what happened to them and how that led them to this point.\n\nThere was a lot of fights in our neighborhood that started with, Who are you looking at? Are you looking at me? You look at me and then you realize, Oh, you think I see you? You're in a space where you're hurting, and you think I see you. So you don't want me to look at you. Knowing that and understanding that changes life completely.\n\nBROOKS: So sort of expand on that a little bit about the profundity of what Jay-Z is talking about there.\n\nVALDARY: So, I mean, this goes to something that we try to teach people about supremacy. People think that supremacy is this kind of mysterious thing whereby a person really actually thinks that they're better than another human being. But if you were to look into the psychology of supremacy and supremacist tendencies, someone acting out of a supremacist tendency, nine times out of ten actually feels an incredible, incredibly strong inferiority complex, and which is to say, a deep sense of a lack of self-worth and is overcompensating by projecting this kind of, I'm better than you, I'm bigger than you, I'm holier than you, etc.\n\nThis is what's known, I think in psychology, as splitting. And splitting is this mechanism by which we as human beings will see the world in black and white. Figuratively and literally speaking, we will say, Oh, all those people, you know, if we were experiencing scarcity, let's say some sort of material scarcity and or psychological scarcity and we don't have the tools to deal with that, we will drop into splitting and we will say all the people over there who look like me are good, and all the people over here who don't look like me are bad.\n\nIt's ... a defensive mechanism used to bring about security into one's space. And that's basically what Jay-Z is getting at in explaining that. And so if you can first of all, become aware of that, become aware of the fact of how you function as a human being, be aware of how the human condition is playing itself out in all aspects of your life, including the workplace. And if you can practice seeing through different lenses, then you can actually regulate that, calibrate collaborative tendency.\n\nAnd we all have the tendency. Every one of us has the tendency because that's part of what it means to be human. But if we can become aware of that and practice different techniques to come out of that lens, we will be better off in the long run.\n\nBROOKS: I want to get Robert Livingston back in this conversation. Robert. If you could sort of respond to what you're hearing.\n\nROBERT LIVINGSTON: So I like the idea and it's not an entirely new idea. I mean, as she mentioned, you know, with Dr. King, there's a lot of research on humanism. Carl Rogers, in psychology, there's a long tradition of that from the 1950s. But in my work and in my book, I talk about how a lot of what we see and a lot of the roots of, you know, aggression is insecurity. And that if you affirm people, that they actually become less prejudiced. And there's a lot of research on this. So if you make people feel better about themselves, they're less prejudiced. If you tell someone they failed a test, they become more racially prejudiced.\n\nSo there's a long history of sort of research on this. But I think I want to respond in two ways. One is I think this word love or even agape gets tossed around. And there's a wonderful book by bell hooks called All About Love. And in the whole book, she spends, you know, 150 pages explaining what love is. And, you know, the central thesis is that most people don't really understand what love is even in their own lives. And one of the critical components to love is respect. And I think that's where a lot of this approach falls short for me, because we're not just talking about recognizing our common humanity and loving one another.\n\nI think there is a critical element of respect here that is necessary. And I think even Dr. King said, you know, love without respect or love without power is anemic. So you don't want to turn yourself into a doormat in the service of love. And I think a lot of people interpret love as meaning that I'm going to love you regardless of what you do.\n\nAnd it's kind of this unconditional acceptance of behavior, some of which may even be unacceptable behaviors. But I think my other issue is ... in my 25 years of experience in doing this, I have a hard time understanding how this can actually move the needle in organizations. Because as I mentioned before, there are three types of people, dolphins, ostriches and sharks. And I can see this bill being wonderful for dolphins and not so for the ostriches.\n\nBROOKS: The question I would add, and this comes from what Robert was talking about earlier. You know, we've got to deal with hard truths. And sometimes dealing with hard truths is going to make people uncomfortable. Is there a place for hard truths that might make people uncomfortable and be necessary to move the needle here?\n\nVALDARY: Yes, I think it is a kind of common theme to assume that love means not being honest with people or not being truthful or direct with people when they mess up. But the second principle to the Theory of Enchantment is criticize to uplift and empower, never to tear down or destroy. So that act of being critical when criticism is required is actually built into the framework. But there's also this piece about respect that I agree with. But I think what they're ... trying to get to the heart of is that often people are not respectful of others, in part because they lack their own sense of self-respect.\n\nAlso, the Theory of Enchantment is obviously a much more, you know, bottom-up approach. And I do think that in order to accomplish some of the things that were talked about earlier, you need both a top down and a bottom-up approach. So, you know, I'm a huge fan of ideas like mentorship programs. I mean, in many ways my career is the product of mentorship programs.\n\nSo I do believe that structurally things should take on that shape and form. But I want to bring up a critique that Derrick Bell, the father of Critical race theory, actually brought up. When it comes to top-down approaches that actually, because the ecosystem is not fervent, won't actually work. Derek Bell actually critiqued that in his book Silent Covenant, and that's worth thinking about.\n\nThis program aired on January 25, 2023.\n\nAnthony Brooks is WBUR's senior political reporter.\n\nClaire Donnelly is a producer at On Point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "What ProPublica Is Doing About Diversity in 2024\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nProPublica is committed to increasing the diversity of our workplace as well as the journalism community more broadly, and each year we publish a report on those efforts. This is the report for 2024; here are all our past reports .\n\nWe believe that it is imperative to staff our newsroom and business operations with people from a broad range of backgrounds, ages and perspectives. We are committed to recruiting and retaining people from communities that have long been underrepresented, in journalism broadly and in investigative journalism especially. That includes African Americans, Latinos, other people of color, women, LGBTQ people and people with disabilities.\n\nProPublica has continued to expand, growing from 172 full-time employees at the start of 2023 to 186 in 2024, due in part to the creation of our Northwest team and additions to our development, audience and visual teams.\n\nOur diversity efforts last year were wide-ranging, with the launch of an investigative editor training program that is open to journalists across the U.S., a large presence at journalism affinity conferences and a webinar for former conference stipend recipients and other early career journalists who have participated in previous ProPublica programs.\n\nWe also continued to formalize some of our formerly staff-run, volunteer diversity efforts, built partnerships with outside journalism organizations and looked for ways to improve the internal culture and processes for all ProPublicans.\n\nOur Diversity Committee comprises more than 50 ProPublicans who volunteer their time to work on initiatives that are pitched and run by the staff. The current co-chairs are Vianna Davila, Melissa Sanchez and Liz Sharp.\n\nAs with last year, we tracked candidates through the application and interview process. Out of 21 positions filled in 2023, 50% of the candidates we interviewed identified as women and 36% identified as being part of a racial/ethnic group other than solely non-Hispanic white. About 67% of the people we hired identified as women.\n\nHowever, 29% of those people we hired in 2023 identified as being part of a racial/ethnic group other than solely non-Hispanic white - a lower percentage than ProPublica had hired in previous years.\n\n\"Recruiting and retaining a diverse staff is one of ProPublica's core principles,\" said ProPublica editor-in-chief Stephen Engelberg, responding to the hiring numbers. \"We are proud of the progress we've made, but we agree that there's more to be done.\"\n\nThis year, Engelberg said, ProPublica added a full-time talent acquisition manager \"to make sure our job searches reach the broadest possible group of applicants.\"\n\nAt the start of 2024, the percentage of all ProPublica staff members who identified as solely non-Hispanic white was 62% - slightly higher than in previous years. This percentage was the same for editorial positions.\n\nFor the sixth year in a row, more women than men work at ProPublica. About 2% of our staff identify as nonbinary or transgender. In editorial positions, women represented 51% of the staff.\n\nSince 2022, we have collected demographic information about our board of directors. Half of the 14 people on the board identified as women, the same as last year. About 64% of the directors identified as non-Hispanic white, compared to 71% last year.\n\nAs we've said since 2015, part of our commitment to diversity means being transparent about our own numbers. Here's how our staff breaks down.\n\n(Please note that the data is based on employees' self-reported information. Recognizing that some people may identify as more than one race but not identify as a person of color, in 2022 we began stating numbers in terms of people who \"solely identify as non-Hispanic white.\" We hope this will provide more specificity and accuracy. The employee information is as of Jan. 1 of each year. Managers are defined as staff members who supervise other people, and that group does not include all editors. Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding. Fellows, time-limited employees and part-time employees are not included in this analysis.)\n\nRace and Ethnicity: All of ProPublica\n\nRace and Ethnicity: Editorial\n\nRace and Ethnicity: Managers\n\nGender: All of ProPublica\n\nGender: Editorial\n\nGender: Managers\n\nInvestigative editor training: ProPublica started an Investigative Editor Training Program in 2023 for journalists who want to learn how to manage, edit and elevate investigative projects that expose harm and create impact. The curriculum for the yearlong program was designed by ProPublica chief of correspondents Ginger Thompson and deputy managing editor Alexandra Zayas to increase diversity in the next generation of investigative editors. We did a test-run for the program for nine ProPublica staffers. Then we refined the training and invited journalists from other organizations to apply. More than 150 reporters and editors from news organizations across the country applied. We selected 11 people to attend a weeklong training at our New York office, where they heard from ProPublica editors on different aspects of the craft, from story selection and memos to managing the reporting and digging into the first draft. After that, participants were paired with ProPublica senior staff as mentors and received additional virtual training for the remainder of the year. We are offering this training again this year for external participants.\n\nAlumni virtual meetup: After a hiatus in 2022, ProPublica staff hosted a career-building webinar for \"alumni\" of our various external programs, including Emerging Reporters, the Data Institute and our conference stipends. Irena Hwang, Maya Miller and Ellis Simani volunteered their time to organize this event and surveyed alumni about what kinds of skills they wanted to build. The virtual event, held in September, included a panel on \"building your investigative career\" featuring Ginger Thompson, Zahira Torres, Lulu Ramadan and Kavitha Surana . That was followed by breakout rooms on workshopping a pitch, managing up, specialty reporting and becoming an editor. More than 50 early-to-mid-career journalists attended the event, and more than a half-dozen ProPublicans lent their expertise as breakout-room moderators. Our goal is to continue to build on the success of this program in 2024 and provide another opportunity for community members to come together.\n\nProPublica thinks about its efforts in the following ways: building the pipeline (for us and for all of investigative journalism); recruiting talent and improving our hiring process; and inclusion and retention.\n\nConference stipends: ProPublica previously offered stipends to help student journalists attend conferences. Last year we changed this program to instead partner with Investigative Reporters & Editors (IRE) and sponsor five journalists to attend the annual IRE convention. IRE's diversity scholarship supports journalists, students and educators from diverse backgrounds, including people of color, those who identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community and/or people with disabilities. We also sponsored a Journalists of Color mixer at the conference, which was attended by more than 50 people.\n\nEmerging Reporters Program: The program provides financial assistance and mentorship to five students for whom investigative journalism might otherwise be inaccessible so they can pursue early career opportunities in the field. The program includes a $9,000 stipend, virtual programming and an all-expenses paid trip to an IRE conference on computer assisted reporting. This is the program's ninth year, and it is coordinated by Talia Buford. Check out our most recent class and find out more about the program.\n\nData Institute: In 2016, ProPublica journalists founded The Data Institute, a workshop for journalists on how to use data, design and code . ProPublica eventually started working with Open News, which coordinates student and instructor participation and provides support for project management and event planning. The Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting and the Center for Journalism & Democracy now organize this in-person event. Last year a half-dozen current and former ProPublicans served as trainers at the institute, which is focused on empowering  people with data skills they can bring back to their own newsrooms. ProPublica staffers will continue to serve as trainers at the institute this year.\n\nAffinity conferences: Last summer, ProPublica newsroom staff and senior leadership partnered with The Marshall Project and The Trace at the country's three largest affinity journalism conferences. At the Asian American Journalists Association conference, the three organizations hosted a panel about paths into nonprofit news that also included participation from a staffer at the Center for Public Integrity. The panel was followed by a beverage lounge, where anyone could drop by for refreshments. The organizations hosted a reception at the National Association of Black Journalists conference, put on through the convention's Investigative Task Force, that included journalists from The Texas Tribune and The Intercept. ProPublica staff also participated in three conference sessions focused on investigative reporting. At the National Association of Hispanic Journalists conference, the three journalism organizations hosted a booth along with The Texas Tribune, The Intercept and CPI.  This work was led by ProPublica staffers Maya Miller, Irena Hwang and Ellis Simani. Going forward, ProPublica's talent department will assume responsibility for this work.\n\nSalary equity and transparency: ProPublica management regularly analyzes salaries in job categories where there are at least four employees and, when necessary, adjusts those salaries to ensure equity by race and gender in each job and location group, while taking into account years of experience. This analysis started in 2021. We do this because we want to try to eliminate the effects of any unconscious bias in setting salaries. In addition, since the fall of 2022, ProPublica has published salary ranges for all posted job openings, regardless of geography.\n\nRooney Rule: We require that hiring managers interview at least one person who does not self-identify as solely non-Hispanic white. In addition, every application must be read by at least two people.\n\nFreelancer guide: In 2022, ProPublica published a guide for freelancers interested in pitching an investigation to ProPublica . We designed the guide to formalize the pitch process and level the playing field for how freelance projects are presented and considered. Submissions will be reviewed by editors on a rotating basis. ProPublica will respond to anyone who completes the form, even if their proposal is not accepted.\n\nLRN candidate outreach: Editors with ProPublica's Local Reporting Network continued to do personalized recruiting and offered office hours so local journalists could discuss their accountability work with a member of the team. LRN editors were also present at affinity journalism conferences, where they met with interested applicants in an effort to help them with the project-development and application process.\n\nWelcoming new hires and focusing on internal culture: Our inclusion subcommittee includes about 30 ProPublicans who meet monthly to consider ways to make the newsroom more inclusive and equitable. Duaa Eldeib chairs this subcommittee. Some of the issues the group has been tackling include ways to improve ProPublica's fact-checking process and build community, particularly for employees who work remotely. The subcommittee launched an internal story club that meets regularly to discuss particularly enjoyable stories, podcasts or books.\n\nSensitivity subcommittee: Led by Colleen Barry and Andrea Wise, this group serves as a resource for editors and reporters to tap the collective brain trust of our newsroom when working on particularly sensitive stories about suicide, sexual abuse, child abuse, racial trauma and more. The committee maintains a Slack channel where anyone can share resources and where editors and reporters can solicit feedback on drafts or ask questions on how best to report on sensitive subjects. When a \"sensitivity read\" or the discussions during the editing and production of a story are particularly instructive, the subcommittee has shared those experiences at diversity committee meetings so any lessons can be more broadly applied.\n\nProPublica Peer Partnership Program: This is an internal program organized by Jodi Cohen and Lisa Song that matches ProPublicans with a mentor or peer partner to meet each other, develop new skills and have someone to turn to for help navigating workplace or career questions. Last year more than 50 ProPublicans participated in this program, which was started in 2018.\n\nRead More\n\nUnconscious bias training: Since 2021, ProPublica has contracted with Paradigm Reach to provide ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion training for staff. The training is required of all new managers.\n\nDiversity Committee office hours: We have continued to offer a casual virtual hangout twice a month where ProPublicans can chat with the Diversity Committee co-chairs to brainstorm about diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, ask questions about ProPublica's ongoing DEI programs or chat about diversity-related concerns in a more intimate setting outside of the monthly committee meetings.\n\nHere is our jobs page , where we post new positions, including fellowships, full-time and temporary roles.\n\nI'm deputy editor of the ProPublica-Texas Tribune investigative unit.\n\nI report on immigration and labor, and I am based in Chicago.\n\nLiz Sharp is ProPublica's human resources director.\n\nMyron Avant is the human resources associate at ProPublica.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "School Board Candidates Who Criticized the Hiring of a Black DEI Educator Lose Their Elections\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nTwo Georgia school board candidates who criticized the hiring of a Black educator focused on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives lost their runoff elections this week. Meanwhile, a person who helped organize the effort to push educator Cecelia Lewis out of her job is narrowly losing her bid for a seat in the state House of Representatives.\n\nThe three were described in a ProPublica story last week that detailed how Lewis was attacked in both Cherokee County and neighboring Cobb County by white parents making baseless claims that she was bringing critical race theory to both school districts. (CRT maintains that racial bias is embedded in America's laws and institutions and has caused disproportionate harm to people of color; it's rarely if ever taught in K-12 public school systems.)\n\nState House candidate Noelle Kahaian, a paralegal and conservative nonprofit leader, is trailing her opponent by 23 votes. The state has until July 1 to certify results, and candidates who come within half a percentage point of their opponent can request a recount.\n\nThe two Cherokee County school board candidates, Sean Kaufman and Ray Lynch, were defeated by wide margins on Tuesday . They were part of a four-candidate slate attempting to gain a majority for a more conservative school board. That collective effort, dubbed 4CanDoMore, was endorsed by the 1776 Project PAC, a new super PAC that touted victories of far-right school board candidates it had backed in multiple states. The two other 4CanDoMore candidates, Michael \"Cam\" Waters and Chris Gregory, had lost to incumbents in the May 24 primary.\n\nIn a statement to ProPublica, Cherokee County School District Chief Communications Officer Barbara Jacoby said that the group of people who targeted Lewis \"do not speak for our community, as was illustrated when their candidates failed in their recent attempt to win a majority on the School Board. We do not support hate, and we are deeply sorry for how Ms. Lewis and her family were treated by these members of our community.\"\n\nKaufman, Lynch and Kahaian did not respond to requests for comments. In a public statement to his Facebook page, Kaufman congratulated his opponent, Erin Ragsdale. \"I truly believe that Cherokee County had some incredible candidates - and we really could not lose,\" he wrote . \"I wish her the very best and give her my full support in the November election.\"\n\nLewis, an accomplished middle school principal from Maryland, was hired in the spring of 2021 as the Cherokee County School District's first-ever administrator devoted to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Community members targeted Lewis soon after her hire was announced. Kahaian, the state House candidate, was a presenter in a meeting during which plans to push Lewis out of her job were hatched. Parents went on to attack Lewis' credentials and wrongfully accuse her of promoting critical race theory.\n\nLewis quit the job before she even started, following a chaotic school board meeting during which board members and students were evacuated and escorted to safety amid threatening outbursts from attendees.\n\nRead More\n\nMonths later, parents using a private Facebook group began complaining that Lewis had a new job in neighboring Cobb County. (People with access to the group shared screenshots of posts with ProPublica.) She'd been hired as that district's social studies supervisor. She lasted just two months there, resigning from the position after the district received an onslaught of erroneous complaints about her supposed intentions to indoctrinate children through CRT.\n\nAfter ProPublica published its story about the community's campaign against Lewis, one woman wrote in the parents' private Facebook group: \"Looks like we should prepare for antifa here in Cherokee County. I'm genuinely concerned for those names listed in that piece.\"\n\nCommunity members who disagree with those who targeted Lewis have been hesitant to speak up, according to Mandy Marger, a mother of two whose family moved to Cherokee County a decade ago.\n\nMarger said she was encouraged by the outcome of the runoffs.\n\n\"The idea that groups who had such extreme views thought that they could grab a hold of our community was frightening,\" Marger said. \"They made it very clear that those of us who did not align with them were going to have to stand up, and I'm really, really proud of our community - especially today - that we did.\"\n\nJacoby said in her statement that Lewis' departure was the district's loss.\n\n\"No one wants their community to be the place where a story like this unfolds, but it is important for us all to understand what happened and reflect on what we can do to ensure it doesn't happen again,\" Jacoby said. \"It's a cautionary tale about the dangers of misinformation and what can happen when you judge others based on falsehoods spread on social media or by people with political agendas.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nNicole Carr was a reporter focusing on criminal justice and racial inequity for ProPublica's South unit.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "White Parents Rallied to Chase a Black Educator Out of Town. Then, They Followed Her to the Next One.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nThis story and accompanying videos were co-published by ProPublica and FRONTLINE as part of an ongoing collaboration.\n\nIn April of 2021, Cecelia Lewis had just returned to Maryland from a house-hunting trip in Georgia when she received the first red flag about her new job.\n\nThe trip itself had gone well. Lewis and her husband had settled on a rental home in Woodstock, a small city with a charming downtown and a regular presence on best places to live lists. It was a short drive to her soon-to-be office at the Cherokee County School District and less than a half hour to her husband's new corporate assignment. While the north Georgia county was new to the couple, the Atlanta area was not. They'd visited several times in recent years to see their son, who attended Georgia Tech.\n\nThis story is part of an ongoing collaboration between ProPublica and FRONTLINE that includes an upcoming documentary.\n\nLewis, a middle school principal, initially applied for a position that would bring her closer to the classroom as a coach for teachers. But district leaders were so impressed by her interview that they encouraged her to apply instead for a new opening they'd created: their first administrator focused on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nDEI-focused positions were becoming more common in districts across the country, following the 2020 protests over the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. The purpose of such jobs typically is to provide a more direct path for addressing disparities stemming from race, economics, disabilities and other factors.\n\nAt first, the scope of the role gave Lewis pause. In her current district, these responsibilities were split among several people, and she'd never held a position dedicated to anything as specific as that before. But she had served on the District Equity Leadership Team in her Maryland county and felt prepared for this new challenge. She believed the job would allow her, as she put it, to analyze the district's \"systemic and instructional practices\" in order to better support \"the whole child.\"\n\n\"We're so excited to add Cecelia to the CCSD family,\" Superintendent Brian Hightower said in the district's March 2021 announcement about all of its new hires. (The announcement noted that the creation of the DEI administrator role \"stems from input from parents, employees and students of color who are serving on Dr. Hightower's ad hoc committees formed this school year to focus on the topic.\") Hightower acknowledged \"both her impressive credentials and enthusiasm for the role\" and pointed out that, \"In four days, she had a DEI action plan for us.\"\n\nCecelia Lewis: \"The District Identified This as a Need\"\n\nDuring her early visits, Lewis found Cherokee County to be a welcoming place. It reminded her of her community in southern Maryland, where everyone knew one another. But leaving the place where she'd been raised - and where, aside from her undergrad years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she'd spent most of her adult life - wasn't going to be easy. Before her last day as principal of her middle school, her staff created a legacy wall in her honor, plastering a phrase above student lockers that Lewis would say to end the morning messages each day: \"If no one's told you they care about you today, know that I do ... and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it!\"\n\nCecelia Lewis initially was reluctant to talk about her experience in Georgia. For several months, she did not respond to requests for an interview. Lewis then declined to comment in March, citing safety and privacy concerns. After multiple additional requests, Lewis agreed to an interview, her first regarding what happened to her in Georgia, seeing it as a way for her experience to help people understand what educators are facing in these times. Read more about reporter Nicole Carr's pursuit of the story.\n\nLewis was beginning to prepare for her move South, spending as much time with friends and family as possible, when she got a strange call from an official in her new school district. The person on the line - Lewis won't say who - asked if she had ever heard of CRT.\n\nLewis responded, \"Yes - culturally responsive teaching.\" She was thinking of the philosophy that connects a child's cultural background to what they learn in school. For Lewis, who'd studied Japanese and Russian in college and more recently traveled to Ghana with the Fulbright-Hays Seminars Abroad program for teachers, language and culture were essential to understanding anyone's experience.\n\nAt that point, she wasn't even familiar with the other CRT, critical race theory, which maintains that racial bias is embedded in America's laws and institutions and has caused disproportionate harm to people of color. In a speech the previous fall , then-President Donald Trump condemned CRT as \"toxic propaganda\" and \"ideological poison.\"\n\nThe caller then told Lewis that a group of people in a wealthy neighborhood in the northern part of the county were upset about what they believed were her intentions to bring CRT to Cherokee County. But don't worry, the district official said; we just want to keep you updated.\n\nThe following month, inside a gabled white clubhouse overlooking the hills of a Cherokee County golf course, dozens of parents from across the county had assembled on a Sunday afternoon for a lesson in an emerging form of warfare. School board meetings would be their battlefield. Their enemy was CRT.\n\nOne of several presenters at the meeting was Rhonda Thomas, a frequent guest on conservative podcasts and the founder of the Atlanta-based Truth in Education, a national nonprofit that aims to educate parents and teachers about \"radical ideologies being taught in schools.\" \"So what is critical race theory?\" Thomas asked the crowd. \"It teaches kids that whites are inherently racist and oppressive, perhaps unconsciously,\" and that \"all whites are responsible for all historical actions\" and \"should feel guilty.\"\n\nShe added: \"I cannot be asked for repentance for something my grandparents did or my ancestors did, right?\"\n\nThomas stressed that parents should form their own nonprofit groups and cut ties with their schools' Parent Teacher Associations. \"The PTA supports everything we're against,\" she told them.\n\nAnother presenter, a local paralegal named Noelle Kahaian, leads the nonprofit Protect Student Health Georgia, which aims to \" educate on harmful indoctrination \" including \"comprehensive sexuality education\" and \"gender ideology.\"\n\nKahaian emphasized how to grab attention during upcoming school board meetings. Identify the best speakers in the group, she told them, adding: \"It's OK to be emotional.\" Be sure to capture video of them addressing the board - or even consider hiring a professional videographer.\n\n\"It's good in case Tucker Carlson wants to put you on air,\" Kahaian said. \"It really helps.\"\n\nInside the Clubhouse\n\nPresenter Noelle Kahaian talks to the crowd about the \"tsunami strategy.\"\n\nShe then briefed them on how to file grievances about school board members' teaching licenses and on their right to request school board members' cellphone records.\n\nAnd she advised them on the benefit of collaborating with \"outside forces\" to file open records requests to school systems for employee emails and curriculum plans that could provide evidence of inappropriate material being taught in classrooms. Doing so would allow those outsiders to \"take some of the heat.\"\n\nBut there was one agenda item that would inspire the crowd to take more urgent action than any other: They had to figure out what to do about the Cherokee County School District's decision to hire a woman named Cecelia Lewis.\n\n\"And when I got a text message from somebody saying that this person was hired, I immediately was like, 'Oh, my goodness, where are my people?'\" said another speaker, Mandy Heda, a Cherokee County GOP precinct chair who introduced herself as a parent of four students in the district.\n\nThomas, Kahaian and Heda did not respond to multiple requests for comment or to a list of questions detailing the points they raised at the clubhouse meeting and elsewhere.\n\nAfter asking the crowd to look at the Maryland district where Lewis was coming from, Heda wondered how Lewis could \"leave that at the border\" (she didn't elaborate on what \"that\" was) and how the longtime educator could come \"to Cherokee County and not want to change us.\" (Like Cherokee, the district where Lewis was a principal serves a majority-white county that voted for Trump in 2020 - though Heda and others in the clubhouse seemed unaware of this.)\n\nA man interjected, saying he'd contacted the Cherokee County School District to find out \"how they arrived at the choice to hire\" Lewis. Hadn't there been any local candidates, he asked.\n\nTargeting Lewis\n\nPresenter Mandy Heda criticizes the district's decision to hire Cecelia Lewis.\n\n\"You cannot tell me, you know, that you can't find somebody else qualified,\" Heda responded. \"And if you're looking for her to be Black, that's fine. But that's not what this is about. This is not about the color of her skin. It's what she's going to bring into our district and what she's going to teach our children.\"\n\nAnother person in the crowd later asked if the arrival of Lewis was a done deal. Several confirmed that it was.\n\n\"We don't have to accept it, right?\" another man asked, the crowd's energy rising in response with a collective yes. \"We can change that, right?\"\n\n\"In some way, shape or form,\" another woman vowed.\n\nThe May 2021 clubhouse meeting, a recording of which was provided to ProPublica by a parent who attended, provides a window into the ways in which conservative groups quickly and efficiently train communities to take on school districts in the name of concepts that aren't even being taught in classrooms.\n\nNational groups, often through their local chapters , have provided video lessons and toolkits to parents across the country on how to effectively spread their messaging about so-called school indoctrination. Parents Defending Education has created \" indoctrination maps \" tracking everything from a district celebrating \"Black Lives Matter week\" to one that allows students to watch CNN Student News, while the Atlanta-based Education Veritas and Kahaian's Protect Student Health Georgia provide portals for anonymously reporting educators supposedly sympathetic to CRT, DEI and other so-called controversial learning concepts.\n\nIn the wake of 2020's summer of racial reckoning, as the work of anti-racist authors shot to the top of bestseller lists and corporations expressed renewed commitments to diversity initiatives, conservatives mounted a counteroffensive against what they viewed as an anti-white, anti-American, \"woke\" liberal agenda. And with that effort came a renewed vilification of CRT, a four-decade-old theory that, contrary to its opponents' accusations, is rarely if ever taught in K-12 public school systems (it typically is taught in graduate-level college and law school courses). That effort quickly snowballed into complaints about what used to be basic history lessons involving race and slavery, which organized groups began conflating with CRT and campaigning for their removal from curriculums.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThanks for signing up.

Support independent journalism by donating to ProPublica.\n\nNearly 900 school districts across the country have been targeted by anti-CRT efforts from September 2020 to August 2021, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, San Diego, found . Teachers and district equity officers surveyed and interviewed for the report \"often described feeling attacked and at risk for discussing issues of race or racism at all, or promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion in any way. Equity officers told us that at times they feared for their personal safety.\"\n\nThe report also stated: \"Only one equity officer described a year free of anti 'CRT' conflict.\"\n\n\"It makes me very sad for my colleagues,\" said Cicely Bingener, one of the UCLA researchers and a longtime elementary school educator.\n\nUsing local media coverage and lawsuits, ProPublica has identified at least 14 public school employees across the country, six of them Black, who were chased out in part by anti-CRT efforts in 2021. Some of the educators resigned or did not have their contracts renewed, while others were fired by school boards where elections had ushered in more politically extreme members.\n\nSince January 2021 , legislatures in more than 40 states have proposed or passed bills and resolutions that would restrict teaching CRT or would limit how teachers can discuss racism and sexism. Four days after the meeting in the golf course clubhouse, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp released a statement solidifying his stance against CRT and asking the state Board of Education to do the same. \"I urge you to take immediate steps to ensure that Critical Race Theory and its dangerous ideology do not take root in our state standards or curriculum,\" it read.\n\nOn June 3, 2021, the Board of Education did just that, joining Utah's as the first such groups to pass resolutions of that kind. Georgia's declared that \"the United States of America is not a racist country, and that the state of Georgia is not a racist state.\"\n\nIn predominantly white Cherokee County, 40 miles north of downtown Atlanta, the fight over CRT has led some residents to question whether they still recognize the community they thought they knew.\n\n\"These are our neighbors,\" said Leanne Etienne, a Black mother of two Cherokee County students, one of whom served on the superintendent's ad hoc committee that led to the creation of the DEI position. \"These are people who are the parents of the children my kids go to school with. It's a very uncomfortable feeling. You don't know who to trust. You don't feel safe.\"\n\nAfter that April call from the school district official, Lewis was confused but remained optimistic. She read up on CRT and determined it had nothing to do with her role. Then came more calls.\n\nIn one, a district official asked Lewis if she has social media accounts. \"Only a LinkedIn,\" she replied. (Lewis barely has a digital footprint. She has never posted anything on social media nor made any professional statements in regard to CRT or any other controversial topic.) The official explained that some of the people upset about her hiring were complaining that a Twitter user with her name was posting Marxist ideology.\n\nAround that same time, according to Lewis, several emails and handwritten letters were showing up at her school in Maryland, calling her a Black Yankee and saying her liberal thinking is unwanted. She saved only one, with typewriting on the envelope. The return address was just \"A Cherokee County Citizen.\"\n\n\"They ultimately just said, you know, 'We don't want you here, and we don't want you to push us to find out what will happen if you come here,'\" Lewis said.\n\nOn May 18, 2021, two days after the meeting at the clubhouse, Cherokee County's schools communications chief and its school board members received the first of approximately 100 form letters that would flood their inboxes over a 48-hour period, demanding that Lewis be fired.\n\nAnother parent wrote to a school board member , citing Cherokee County's recent census statistics: \"Did you know that 77.8% of the population is considered 'whtie [sic] alone' 7.7% are black and 11.1% hispanic? Are we now in a county that is going to cater to a handful of people?\"\n\nLewis said she was willing and eager, once she arrived in Georgia, to speak to concerned parents. \"I just felt as if there was a misunderstanding,\" she said, \"and as soon as I [would] have an opportunity to get there and really speak on my own behalf, then it was going to be OK.\"\n\nShe also felt comforted by the fact that school district officials were regularly checking in with her, offering reassurances that they were monitoring the situation and that everything would be OK \"once they get to know you.\"\n\nLewis tends not to talk about racism in terms of her professional life. She said that, until she got the Black Yankee email, she had not experienced racial prejudice and was accustomed to learning and working in majority-white spaces. She also recalled being surprised when someone from the district pointed out that a hiring like hers was rare, in that there were not many minority leaders working in the district.\n\n\"I did not think that in 2021 that that was really a thing,\" Lewis said, noting the district's proximity to Atlanta, with its high concentration of Black leadership and affluence. \"And that was probably just ignorance on my end. And I mean that in the purest form of ignorance, of just not knowing. I didn't know.\"\n\nOn May 20, 2021, one of Lewis' soon-to-be colleagues called to say that the people upset about her hiring were claiming to have spotted her around Cherokee County and were sharing with one another her supposed locations. Lewis, however, was still in Maryland.\n\nThat same day - following an increase in social media posts, emails and phone calls complaining about Lewis and CRT - the district installed metal detectors and assigned extra security at the county building where school board meetings are held.\n\nLewis soon received yet another call. Someone from district leadership asked if she was planning to watch the board meeting that night. She replied that it hadn't been on her radar.\n\n\"You should watch it,\" they said.\n\nWell before the Cherokee County School Board meeting's 7 p.m. start time, people hoping to get inside were being turned away. The room and the overspill viewing area in the lobby were at capacity. Those who were denied entry gathered outside near the parking lot, where they could peek through windows and glimpse the large screens mounted in the boardroom. Others hung around outside, planning to watch the livestream of the meeting on their phones.\n\nAt home in Maryland, Lewis and her husband sat in their bedroom, the laptop propped up between them.\n\nInside, just before the meeting started, mothers in black T-shirts printed with the words \"I don't co-parent with the government\" smiled and posed for pictures. A husky man with a deep voice formed the beginning of the large prayer circle that inched toward the dais where district officials, student delegates and Cherokee County's seven school board members were seated.\n\nThe first order of business was introduced by Mike Chapman, a Republican board member who'd held his seat for more than two decades: a resolution against teaching CRT and the 1619 Project , a Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times series that \"aims to reframe the country's history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of our national narrative.\" (Conservatives have railed against it as racially divisive and have often lumped it together with CRT in an attempt to ban both from schools across the country.)\n\nWhat came next caught Lewis off guard.\n\nHightower, the superintendent, read from a statement: \"While I had initially entertained and publicly spoken to the development of a diversity, equity and inclusivity, DEI plan, I recognize that our intentions have become widely misunderstood in the community and it created division.\n\n\"To that end, I have concluded that there will be no separate DEI plan.\"\n\nTo Lewis, it was as if the \"foundations of everything that I was asked to do have just shifted, and I was not a part of the conversation.\"\n\nState Rep. Brad Thomas, a Republican, spoke next. He assured the board that, as the father of a Cherokee County student, he'd done his research after fielding complaints about Lewis' hiring.\n\nHe said he now had a plan of his own in the works: He would be drafting legislation to ensure that teaching CRT and the 1619 Project would be illegal statewide. \"We've pulled language from Tennessee's bill. We've pulled language from Texas' bill. We've pulled language from Oklahoma's bill. We've pulled language from Idaho's bill,\" he said. \"And I've put some of my own language in there.\"\n\nHeda, the Cherokee County GOP precinct officer who'd spoken at the clubhouse meeting four days earlier, also addressed the board. She claimed that the definition of DEI had changed over time and now represents the views held by people with \"the same woke political understanding of power dynamics and social positions.\"\n\n\"We cannot fix racism with institutionalized racism,\" she said.\n\nA neighbor of Heda's approached the lectern next. The woman, who is Black, spoke in favor of the decision to hire Lewis. It was the first time she was mentioned by name.\n\nAccording to one observer, that's when the crowd gathered outside began beating against the building's windows.\n\n\"No, no, no!\" they screamed in unison, the sound reverberating through the lobby as their fists pounded the glass.\n\nA subsequent speaker, a parent named Lori Raney, was rewarded with applause when she asked the board, \"My question to you is, if you vote to do away with the DEI program, does that mean the new DEI officer has her offer rescinded? Because why do we need to pay $115,000 for somebody who doesn't have a job to do anymore?\"\n\nAt that moment, Lewis recalled, her husband said: \"That's it. We're not doing this. You are not going there.\" He left the bedroom in disgust.\n\nNot long after, a volunteer from the campaign of Vernon Jones, a Black Republican who at the time was running for governor (Jones later switched to a run for Congress), read a statement to the school board from the candidate. \"Embracing the teaching of critical race theory is a slap in the face of Dr. King's teachings,\" said the volunteer, Stan Fitzgerald. \"Taxpayer-funded anti-white racism is still exactly that - racism.\"\n\nUpon hearing that, Lewis thought about how Martin Luther King Jr. promoted humanity and love, and she was devastated to hear his words used by strangers to attack her. Everything she had just witnessed felt contrary to his ideals.\n\nBreaking down in tears, Lewis closed her laptop. She could no longer watch.\n\n\"That cut me so deeply,\" she said. \"It hit the core of who I am as a being.\"\n\nLewis missed the part when Miranda Wicker, another parent and member of the county's Democratic Party, addressed the board. \"Those who want this ban are spouting talking points fed to them by an outside special interest group with a deeply political agenda to keep people riled up against an invisible other,\" said Wicker, who was interrupted by loud shouts.\n\n\"Stop the disrespect!\" school board Chair Kyla Cromer yelled at the crowd after banging her gavel. \"Stop! Stop!\"\n\nCromer threatened to adjourn the meeting early but ultimately allowed it to continue.\n\nThe board voted 4-1 with two abstentions to pass the anti-CRT and anti-1619 Project resolution. But the crowd was still worked up. Cromer moved to take a break. The livestream of the meeting was paused. But the yelling continued. And things spiraled out of control, to the point that Cromer abruptly adjourned the meeting.\n\nOne man in the crowd screamed: \"I'm furious!\"\n\nAnother declared: \"We're going to hunt you down!\"\n\nThe school district's chief communications officer, Barbara Jacoby, would later say that's when the students attending the meeting started crying.\n\n\"They had to be rushed out of the room,\" Jacoby recalled. She went with them and the school board members as security guards ushered the group to a conference room behind the dais. \"And then we had to be walked to our cars,\" she said. \"We had to be followed out of the parking lot onto the highway by police officers.\"\n\nIn response to questions from ProPublica, the school board provided a statement describing how some members requested school police escorts to their homes, where city and county agencies conducted extra patrols. In response to the other questions, including ones about anti-CRT letters the board received, Jacoby responded on its behalf, stating \"the information you note below is correct.\" Cromer and Hightower declined to comment.\n\nJacoby said the scene felt unreal. \"It's certainly not anything anyone who comes to work for a school district expects would ever be part of their job.\"\n\nCecelia Lewis: \"I Don't Even Know Why We Continue to Give Life to It\"\n\nLewis' phone kept ringing that night. People from the district were telling her that this is not who they are, that they're embarrassed by the actions of their neighbors and church members, that they're sorry she had to witness this.\n\nIn a phone call the next morning, Hightower apologized to Lewis. He said he still wanted her to come to Cherokee. Another administrator asked if she would consider a different position.\n\nBut by then she'd made up her mind. She told Hightower: It's just not going to work.\n\n\"I can't say I blame her,\" Cherokee County School District chief of staff Mike McGowan said in an interview with ProPublica. \"There was so much misinformation about who she was, what she stood for and what was going on politically.\"\n\nIn response to a detailed list of questions to the district covering all aspects of Lewis' experience in Cherokee County, Jacoby responded that \"we have no further comments to add.\"\n\nThe following morning, before it was publicly known that Lewis had quit the job she'd never started, a former Cherokee County student who'd attended the school board meeting appeared on \"Fox & Friends \" and warned that the board was still pursuing CRT under the guise of other concepts. \"I think that they're relying on wordplay to try to confuse Cherokee County representatives or constituents that aren't necessarily completely involved because they're busy with their day-to-day life,\" the guest, Bailey Katzenstein, said. She claimed that CRT initiatives would be carried out by \"someone from Maryland\" in the form of programs \"synonymous\" with CRT: DEI and SEL (or social emotional learning). SEL is a decades-old child development concept that emphasizes building self-awareness, teaching kids how to better communicate, fostering relationships and making responsible decisions, according to scholars and researchers.\n\n\"I don't think it's acceptable,\" Katzenstein said of the school board not banning DEI and SEL along with CRT. \"They're hiding behind closed doors, and I think it's completely full of cowardice.\"\n\nThe Fox host, ending the segment, said: \"If you thought this was an elite, New York City school problem, Bailey Katzenstein just told you the exact opposite. This is spreading. It's going all over the country, and it's having real impacts.\"\n\nThe next day, Cherokee County parents used their private Facebook group to continue to report Lewis \"sightings.\" (People with access to the group shared screenshots of posts with ProPublica.)\n\n\"My husband swears he saw Ms. Lewis at Ace yesterday afternoon!\" one woman wrote, adding, \"He saw the Maryland plates and the driver looked just like her.\"\n\nBut Lewis was still in Maryland. She hadn't returned to Georgia since the house-hunting trip.\n\nIn a statement quoted in the Cherokee Tribune & Ledger-News a week and a half later, Lewis wrote: \"I wholeheartedly fell in love with Cherokee County when I came to visit and accepted the position, but somehow, I got caught in the crossfire of lies, misinformation, and accusations which have zero basis.\"\n\nWhen Lewis and her husband actually relocated to Georgia later that summer, the Cherokee parents' private Facebook group lit up.\n\n\"Guess where Cecelia Lewis is possibly landing now?\" another woman wrote .\n\nThey'd figured out her next move.\n\nFive days after Lewis quit her would-be job in Cherokee County, the district's human resources director forwarded a copy of her resume to the chief academic officer at his former school district, one county over. \"Great catching Up!\" he wrote. \"Talk soon.\"\n\nOfficials in the Cobb County School District, the second-largest in the state, called Lewis soon after. They wanted to talk to her about an opening they had for a supervisor of social studies, a job title she'd held in another school district earlier in her career.\n\nLewis did not know it, but the position already had been subjected to scrutiny.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, in wake of Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police, the Cobb County School District began to more tightly manage the way racial issues are handled in social studies teacher training and more closely vet the materials trainers and educators could use.\n\nAccording to records obtained by ProPublica, the previous, longtime social studies supervisor had been reprimanded for hosting a district-approved speaker from the state Department of Education. A teacher had complained about the speaker's presentation, titled \"All are Welcome.\"\n\nThe social studies supervisor's boss wrote in the letter that most of the presentation was appropriate. There were just a few issues.\n\nThe boss wasn't happy with the \"sensitive content and images\" and \"probing questions\" in the presentation. One slide included a photo of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin atop Floyd, his knee pinned to Floyd's neck, along with two questions that challenged educators in how they approach lessons about such controversies: \"What can we share with our black students to help them cope with the bottom?\" \"What did the man on top miss out on learning that could have made him a better person?\"\n\nAdditionally, the director's letter reminded the social studies supervisor that there already had been discussions about references to the 1619 Project, about vetting all presentations, about monitoring social media posts for the \"message they send to the greater Cobb County community\" and about ensuring that outside organizations the social studies supervisor might partner with would present controversial issues in a manner acceptable to the school district.\n\nIn 2021, the social studies supervisor retired. Lewis - who holds a master's degree in teaching the subject - applied to replace her.\n\nIn June, at around the same time that Lewis got the call from Cobb County to come in for an interview, Cobb's seven-member school board passed its own anti-CRT and anti-1619 Project resolution. Three members - all of them Black Democrats - abstained, noting this was not the first time they were blindsided by the addition of a problematic, last-minute agenda item.\n\nOnce a Republican stronghold represented by Newt Gingrich in Congress, Cobb County flipped to blue in 2018 and has remained that way since. By 2020 the county elected its first Black sheriff and county commission chair . Though the school district's population is 30% Black and 24% Hispanic , the school board majority remains white and conservative.\n\nBy mid-July, another metropolitan Atlanta school district was courting Lewis. But by then she was living in Cobb County and decided to follow-up with the district there. It had been weeks since she'd gone through multiple rounds of rigorous interviews, during which Cobb officials complimented her on her credentials, saying she'd be an asset in multiple leadership roles, according to Lewis.\n\nLewis recalled that a district official finally called her back toward the end of July to apologize for the delayed response and explained that the superintendent had been involved in vetting her hiring, something that typically doesn't happen for a person who applies for a supervisor role.\n\nThe district offered Lewis the job on that call, and she accepted. She was asked to report to work the next day, July 20.\n\nBy the end of the week - right around the time when the Cherokee County parent circulated the tip in the private Facebook group that Lewis might now be heading to Cobb - Lewis got a call from a school district leader. It was someone above her boss, Lewis said. According to Lewis, the person requested an immediate, off-site meeting.\n\nIt was already after 6 p.m. Lewis had just settled in for a manicure and pedicure. She left her appointment and headed to a nearby Panera Bread, where she and the district official took a seat near the back of the restaurant.\n\nThe person explained that complaints about her were \"percolating\" out of Cherokee into Cobb, according to Lewis, who also remembered the person telling her to be careful; she's an at-will employee (meaning she can be fired at any time for any reason without notice) and the person might not be able to help her. Lewis also recalled the person telling her that she shouldn't have to endure in Cobb what she went through in Cherokee.\n\nLewis was stunned. \"I did nothing but showed up to work, signed a contract, agreed to do what I was asked to do in the job description,\" she told ProPublica. \"And yet again, I'm getting attacked.\"\n\nAround the same time, Cobb's four Republican school board members, its superintendent and another district official, John Floresta, were fielding complaints about the decision to hire Lewis.\n\n\"I am appalled that anyone would advocate for the racist, sexist, and Marxist ideology that is Critical Race Theory,\" one woman wrote to the group in an email, which ProPublica obtained through an open records request. Her name was redacted. She went on to say, among other things: \"I insist that you pass real policy reforms that forbid indoctrinating children with CRT in classrooms,\" \"Anyone found pushing CRT on CCSD time should be immediately terminated,\" and \"Make no mistake: press releases and toothless resolutions just won't cut it.\"\n\n\"I agree with you 100%,\" Cobb County school board member Randy Scamihorn responded. \"Thankfully, the majority of the Board did vote on June 10th to ban CRT and 1619 Project from our schools in Cobb County. We then directed Superintendent Ragsdale to implement the enforcement of this decision, which he readily agreed to do.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear you feel that way, but it certainly seems we need to remain vigilant,\" the woman replied . \"Why has Cecelia Lewis been hired by Cobb? She was hired by Cherokee schools for CRT and was run off because the parents put up such a fight. Now Cobb has quietly hired her. This isn't a good move for the optics that Cobb has supposedly banned CRT.\"\n\nThere is no record of an email reply from Scamihorn.\n\nIn response to ProPublica's request for comment on the email exchange, a spokesperson for the district responded on behalf of Scamihorn: \"Your assertion that Mr. Scamihorn 'agreed 100%' that 'anyone pushing CRT on CCSD time should be immediately terminated' is grossly inaccurate and not consistent with the email you are referencing. The Cobb Board did pass a resolution which directs the District to focus on keeping schools, schools, not on political distractions.\" When asked to elaborate on what was inaccurate or inconsistent, the spokesperson did not respond.\n\nFloresta responded to a different email complaining about CRT, assuring the sender that it was not allowed to be taught per district policy. The sender then pointed to the hiring in Cobb of \"Cecelia Lewis, a well known advocate for CRT and DEI agents who actually resigned from Cherokee County recently because of the push back from the parents.\"\n\n\"How in the heck did Dr. Cecelia Lewis get hired on?\" the email continued. \"It is ASTOUNDING to think that anyone would think this was a good idea. We need answers on this, immediately, and an explanation of her role within the County. To list her under Social Studies does not fool any of us.\"\n\nOn Lewis' fourth day on the job, she got a message from one of the district secretaries.\n\n\"I received a call from a parent wanting to know if you were the same person hired in Cherokee County. I just told her that someone would give her a call back to address her questions.\"\n\nLewis' boss soon told her to direct all such messages to her office. She also told Lewis to hold off on responding to any emails regarding her hiring, after Lewis replied to a positive note that came in from a supportive parent.\n\nThe following week, Lewis was supposed to introduce herself to all the social studies teachers at a districtwide training meeting. She said she'd been asked, before the Panera meeting, to prepare a presentation and share the social studies program vision.\n\nShe said she was then asked to shorten the presentation to a simple series of slides. Then, to one slide.\n\nFinally, she learned she wouldn't even be acknowledged at the meeting as the new supervisor of social studies.\n\n\"When the day came, I was told that I had to sit in the back and flip the slides for the presenter,\" Lewis recalled. \"I was not introduced at all.\"\n\nLewis said she did receive warm welcomes when she individually introduced herself to teachers, some of whom said they'd heard she'd arrived and wondered when they'd meet her.\n\nNot long after the meeting, she recalled, other aspects of her job began to change. Her emails to social studies teachers would need to be vetted before she could hit send (not a single one was approved). And she'd now be on a special project, reviewing thousands of resources that had already been approved and adopted by the district.\n\n\"It was pretty much them tucking me away,\" Lewis said. \"Every meeting was canceled. Every professional learning opportunity that I was supposed to lead with my team, I couldn't do. Every department meeting with different schools, I was told I can't go.\"\n\nAccording to Lewis, the only direct communication she was allowed to have without vetting was with other supervisors.\n\n\"They were wasting their money,\" she said. \"I'm just sitting here in this room every day, looking through resources that have already been approved, which makes no sense, and not given much direction as to what I'm looking for - just making sure they're aligned to standards, which obviously they were.\"\n\nAt the end of August, Lewis requested a meeting with her supervisor and the district's chief academic officer. She told them that she would be submitting her two-week notice.\n\nThe next day, she got one last email from district leadership.\n\n\"As we discussed, it is never our intention, as an organization, for an employee to feel anything other [than] the support and collegiality associated with a positive and professional work environment,\" the email said. \"Please know your concerns and feedback, as an individual and employee, were heard and valued.\"\n\nProPublica submitted to the Cobb County School District and its school board a list of detailed questions about the hiring of Lewis, the community blowback and the changes to her job. A school district spokesperson responded: \"Cecelia Lewis was employed by the Cobb County School District during the summer of 2021, voluntarily submitted her letter of resignation in early fall of 2021, and like every Team member, her contributions and work for students was greatly appreciated.\"\n\nLewis' departure from not one but two school districts didn't put an end to the efforts of anti-CRT groups. In fact, the groups used Lewis' retreat as a rallying call.\n\nIn August 2021, Educate Cherokee - a group with a now-defunct website that identifies itself on Facebook as a local chapter of the national conservative nonprofit No Left Turn in Education - announced that it would be holding an event. According to an online notice about the event, it would be led by Heda, who had spoken at the clubhouse and the school board meetings, and Raney, who at the school board meeting had called out Lewis' salary. In the notice, the group claimed the elimination of \"a new DEI administrative position\" as one of its accomplishments . \"Bring your ideas, energy, and enthusiasm,\" the meeting notice said. \"We need to convert all of it into an effective election effort to eliminate CRT by replacing all of the current school board members up for re-election with new conservatives committed to our cause.\"\n\nIn the months to come, four school board candidates - Michael \"Cam\" Waters, Ray Lynch, Sean Kaufman and Chris Gregory - established themselves as part of a collective effort to gain a majority on the board, in part by ousting board members who'd come under attack following Lewis' hiring.\n\nThe candidates dubbed themselves 4CanDoMore and launched a website, the top of which states: \"In May of 2021, Cherokee County was taken by surprise when it was announced that our 'conservative' board voted to bring in Cecelia Lewis, as Administrator on Special Assignment, Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI). However, her history was riddled with Critical Race Theory (CRT) ideologies in her previous school district. Why would the current board vote 7-0 to bring in someone to implement programs not in alignment with the family values of our community?\"\n\nIn March of 2022, the 4CanDoMore candidates got a boost. The 1776 Project PAC, founded last year by author and OANN political correspondent Ryan Girdusky, had been singling out open school board seats across the country and supporting candidates who ran on platforms to ban CRT and the 1619 Project. (The super PAC's name is a nod to an advisory committee launched in 2020 by Trump partly in response to the 1619 Project. Trump's 1776 Commission sought to support a \"patriotic education\" in schools and oppose lessons that teach students to \"hate their own country.\")\n\nIn 2021, the 1776 Project PAC backed 69 school board candidates in eight states. Fifty-five won their seats, its website claims, including all 15 candidates the PAC endorsed in Texas .\n\nThe 4CanDoMore candidates were the 1776 Project PAC's first endorsements of 2022.\n\nGirdusky did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding the decision to zero in on Cherokee County candidates.\n\nIn May, two of the 4CanDoMore candidates lost their primary bids to incumbents. The other two, Kaufman and Lynch, advanced to a June runoff. Another familiar face in the anti-Lewis effort also made it to the runoff: Kahaian, the paralegal who'd told parents in the clubhouse how to prepare for an appearance on Tucker Carlson's show. She's running for a seat in Georgia's House of Representatives.\n\nEven before any potential shake-up on the school board, some changes have already arrived in the Cherokee County School District. Among them is a ban on the word \"equity\" from any district initiative.\n\n\"We had to stop using the word because the word was redefined by people,\" said Jacoby, the Cherokee County Schools communications director. \"And so we had to take the word out of the equation, and say, OK, fine, 'access.' There's no way around that access is important.\"\n\nAfter moving back home to Maryland, Lewis continues to work in education, although her role doesn't primarily focus on DEI. \"I may not have the specific acronym tied to my official title, but I am committed to celebrating diversity and promoting equity and inclusion,\" Lewis said.\n\nShe also noted that, even in the face of increasing attacks, educators should not lose sight of their value and the difference they can make in children's lives. \"No one can take that away from us.\"\n\nCecelia Lewis: \"The Work Still Needs to Be Done\"\n\nToday, the metal detectors remain installed at the entrance to the building where Cherokee County School Board meetings are held. A staff member is permanently assigned the task of evacuating students in attendance, should the need ever arise. And an increased number of security officers are strategically placed throughout the meeting room and beyond.\n\nRead More\n\nStanding in line outside the building before a recent school board meeting, mothers identified themselves to each other as \"a Marjorie\" - meaning a proponent of the speaking style of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, known for her provocative and unfiltered claims.\n\nA little while later, once the meeting was underway, a man who described himself as a school bus driver and a grandfather stepped to the microphone during the public comment period.\n\n\"This is not California or New York. This is Cherokee County, Georgia. We can choose what and how our students learn on a local level,\" said the man.\n\n\"I was raised in a different era, in the '50s and '60s, where we were equipped to survive and succeed.\"\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?

      "text": "What ProPublica Is Doing About Diversity in 2023\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nProPublica is committed to increasing the diversity of our workplace as well as the journalism community more broadly, and each year we publish a report on those efforts. This is the report for 2023; here are all our past reports .\n\nWe believe that it is imperative to staff our newsroom and business operations with people from a broad range of backgrounds, ages and perspectives. We are committed to recruiting and retaining people from communities that have long been underrepresented, in journalism broadly and in investigative journalism especially. That includes African Americans, Latinos, other people of color, women, LGBTQ people and people with disabilities.\n\nProPublica has continued to expand, growing from 160 full-time employees at the start of 2022 to 172 in 2023, due in part to the launch of our global public health team and additions to our visuals, audience, development, finance and talent teams. In addition to recruiting talent and awarding financial stipends for students to attend journalism conferences, ProPublica's diversity efforts last year included our largest presence yet at journalism affinity conferences and the development of an investigative editor training program.\n\nWe also worked to formalize some of our previously volunteer-run diversity efforts and have included some of our broader diversity goals in ProPublica's first strategic plan.\n\nThe Diversity Committee comprises more than 50 ProPublicans who volunteer their time to work on initiatives that are pitched and run by the staff. The current co-chairs are Vianna Davila, Melissa Sanchez and Liz Sharp.\n\nAs with last year, we tracked candidates through the application and interview process. Out of 30 positions filled in 2022, 55% of the candidates we interviewed identified as women and 42% identified as being part of a racial/ethnic group other than solely non-Hispanic white. Of those we hired, 40% identified as women and 47% as being part of a racial/ethnic group other than solely non-Hispanic white.\n\nThe percentage of all ProPublica staff members who identified as solely non-Hispanic white was 59%, the same as last year. In editorial positions, the percentage of staff members who identified as solely non-Hispanic white was 59%, the same as in the two prior years.\n\nFor the fifth year in a row, more women than men work at ProPublica. In editorial positions, women represented 49% of the staff.\n\nLast year we began collecting demographic information about our board of directors. Half of the 14 people on the board identified as women, and 71% of the directors identified as non-Hispanic white.\n\nAs we've said since 2015, part of our commitment to diversity means being transparent about our own numbers. Here's how our staff breaks down:\n\nRace and Ethnicity: All of ProPublica\n\nRace and Ethnicity: Editorial\n\nRace and Ethnicity: Managers\n\nGender: All of ProPublica\n\nGender: Editorial\n\nGender: Managers\n\nNote : The data is based on employees' self-reported information. Recognizing that some people may identify as more than one race but not identify as a person of color, last year we began stating numbers in terms of people who \"solely identify as non-Hispanic white.\" We hope this will provide more specificity and accuracy. The employee information is as of Jan. 1 of each year. Managers are defined as staff members who supervise other people and that group does not include all editors. Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding. Fellows, time-limited employees and part-time employees are not included in this analysis.\n\nInvestigative editor training: ProPublica in December announced its new Investigative Editor Training Program for applicants who want to learn how to manage, edit and elevate investigative projects that expose harm and create impact. This initiative, led by Talia Buford and Ginger Thompson, was designed to increase diversity in the next generation of investigative editors. The program will launch this spring with an internal training for ProPublica staffers interested in becoming editors. In June 2023, we will welcome the first external cohort of the yearlong program with an in-person editor training in New York. After that, participants will be paired with ProPublica senior staff as mentors and receive additional virtual training for the rest of the year. ( Apply here .)\n\nSensitivity subcommittee: Led by Andrea Wise, Colleen Barry and Maya Eliahou, this group formed in 2022 after numerous internal conversations about concerns that regularly surfaced when reporters were working on stories touching on sensitive topics, particularly suicide and sexual assault. Volunteers created a standing Slack channel to create a space for the staff to leverage and share its collective knowledge and experience on these and other topics that require a careful and thoughtful approach.\n\nStrategic plan: Leading the journalism industry on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts is one of the priorities ProPublica staffers and leaders are including in our five-year (2023-2027) strategic plan. The plan outlines the organization's progress and initiatives over the past 15 years while acknowledging that there is more work to do. We plan to dedicate more resources to making investigative journalism careers accessible and sustainable for journalists from underrepresented backgrounds.\n\nWe think about our efforts in the following ways: building the pipeline (for us and for all of investigative journalism); recruiting talent and improving our hiring process; and inclusion and retention. Last year, as travel and in-person diversity initiatives became more feasible after the initial years of the coronavirus pandemic, ProPublica increased its presence at conferences and continued to offer virtual training and development opportunities.\n\nConference stipends: ProPublica offers funding to help student journalists attend conferences. This effort is coordinated by Mollie Simon, Ash Ngu and Adriana Gallardo. In the seventh year of the program, we teamed up with The Pudding to award 25 stipends of $750 each. Because of the pandemic, we gave students the option to use the money for either journalism-related expenses or conference expenses. This year, following feedback from our 2022 stipend cohort, we are working to focus this initiative on supporting journalists from diverse backgrounds who have a distinct desire to pursue investigative journalism.\n\nEmerging Reporters Program: The program provides financial assistance and mentorship to eight students for whom investigative journalism might otherwise be inaccessible so they can pursue early career opportunities in the field. The program includes a $9,000 stipend, virtual programming and admission to a journalism conference. This is the program's eighth year, and it is coordinated by Talia Buford. Check out our most recent class and find out more about the program.\n\nONA (Online News Association) Diversity Breakfast: A breakfast at the ONA conference, facilitated by Ruth Baron and Steve Myers, paired managing editors, executive editors and other leading professionals in the industry with journalists from historically underrepresented communities. Nearly 40 journalists participated in the event. We have hosted both virtual and in-person breakfasts at the conference since 2015. In 2023, we will be shifting our efforts to other investigative mentorship opportunities.\n\nChicago external mentorships: Mentorship sessions with Free Spirit Media , which provides teens and young adults in communities of color on Chicago's West and South sides with media literacy and media production opportunities. Led by Duaa Eldeib, workshops include sessions on the art of pitching stories and conceptualizing data.\n\nData Institute: ProPublica, in partnership with The Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting and OpenNews, held a workshop for journalists on how to use data, design and code . Twelve journalism students, professors and working journalists participated in the weeklong online training last summer. The Data Institute started in 2016, founded by ProPublica journalists to make high-quality technical training accessible to more journalists.\n\nMentorship: Working with the Journalism Mentors program, a group of ProPublica journalists had one-on-one mentoring sessions with 17 people last year. This mentorship opportunity, which can include general advice or portfolio reviews, can be arranged as an in-person session during affinity conferences. The sessions can also be arranged outside of the traditional conference season. Melissa Sanchez, Rui Kaneya and Max Blau coordinated these efforts last year. (Interested? Sign up for a session .)\n\nAffinity conferences: Newsroom staff and masthead members from ProPublica and three other nonprofit newsrooms (The Marshall Project, The Texas Tribune and The Trace) came together at the Asian American Journalists Association and the joint National Association of Black Journalists/National Association of Hispanic Journalists conference to host mixers and other professional development opportunities. ProPublica staff also attended the Native American Journalists Association conference and conducted resume reviews. This work was led by Maya Miller and Irena Hwang.\n\nSalary transparency: Starting last fall, in advance of a new law that affects postings for jobs based in New York City, ProPublica began publishing salary ranges for all posted job openings, regardless of geography. Management also shared salary ranges internally for positions in which four or more people hold that job. This was done to ensure transparency about pay among staff and potential applicants in an effort to achieve equity in the newsroom.\n\nSalary equity: ProPublica management annually analyzes salaries in job categories where there are at least four employees and, when necessary, adjusts those salaries to ensure equity by race and gender in each job and location group, while taking into account years of experience. This analysis started in 2021. We do this because we want to try to eliminate the effects of any unconscious bias in setting salaries.\n\nRooney Rule: We require that hiring managers interview at least one person who does not self-identify as solely non-Hispanic white. In addition, every application must be read by at least two people.\n\nFreelancer guide: Last fall, ProPublica published a guide for freelancers interested in pitching an investigation to ProPublica . We designed the guide to formalize the pitch process and level the playing field for how freelance projects are presented and considered. Submissions will be reviewed by editors on a rotating basis. ProPublica will respond to anyone who completes the form, even if their proposal is not accepted.\n\nLRN candidate outreach: Editors with ProPublica's Local Reporting Network started offering office hours to potential applicants. They also offered more intensive mentoring to a select number of applicants who weren't accepted in order to develop promising proposals over time. Finally, LRN editors were present at affinity journalism conferences, where they met with interested applicants in an effort to help them with the project-development and application process.\n\nUnconscious bias training: In 2021, ProPublica hired Paradigm Reach to conduct ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion training with staff. The training is required of all new managers.\n\nRead More\n\nProPublica Peer Partnership Program: This is an internal program organized by Jodi Cohen and Lisa Song that matches ProPublicans with a mentor or peer partner to meet each other, develop new skills and have someone to turn to for help navigating workplace or career questions.\n\nWelcoming new hires and focusing on internal culture: A subcommittee led by Michael Grabell and Ariana Tobin continued to meet last year to consider ways to make the newsroom more inclusive and equitable, including how to prevent burnout, how to build community while working remotely and ways to make the organization's expense policy welcoming to people who come from different socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nDiversity Committee office hours: We have continued to offer a casual hangout on Zoom twice a month where ProPublicans can chat with the Diversity Committee co-chairs to brainstorm about diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, ask questions about ProPublica's ongoing DEI programs or chat about diversity-related concerns in a more intimate setting outside of the monthly committee meetings.\n\nHere is our jobs page , where we post new full-time positions, and here's our fellowships page .

      "text": "What ProPublica Is Doing About Diversity in 2022\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nProPublica is committed to increasing the diversity of our workplace as well as of the journalism community more broadly, and each year we publish a report of what we're doing about it. This is the report for 2022; here are all our past reports .\n\nWe believe that it is crucial to fill our newsroom with people from a broad range of backgrounds, ages and perspectives. We are committed to recruiting and retaining people from communities that have long been underrepresented, not only in journalism but particularly in investigative journalism. That includes African Americans, Latinos, other people of color, women, LGBTQ people and people with disabilities.\n\nProPublica has continued to expand, growing from 137 full-time employees at the start of 2021 to 160 in 2022, largely due to the launch of regional units in the South and Southwest and the expansion of our Midwest office. In addition to our talent recruitment efforts, mentorship opportunities and financial stipends, many of ProPublica's diversity efforts this year continued to be internal, focused on onboarding and staff development.\n\nThe Diversity Committee comprises more than 50 ProPublicans who volunteer their time to work on initiatives that are pitched and run by the staff. The current co-chairs are Caroline Chen, Vianna Davila, Melissa Sanchez and Liz Sharp.\n\nAs with last year, we tracked candidates through the application and interview process. Out of 50 positions filled in 2021, 55% of the candidates we interviewed identified as women, and 47% identified as being part of a racial/ethnic group other than solely non-Hispanic white. Of those we hired, 45% identified as women and 44% as being part of a racial/ethnic group other than solely non-Hispanic white.\n\nThe percentage of all ProPublica staff members who identified as solely non-Hispanic white was 59%, the same as last year. In editorial positions, staff members who identified as solely non-Hispanic white also stayed the same as last year, at 58%.\n\nFor the fourth year in a row, more women than men work at ProPublica. In editorial positions, women represented 51% of the staff.\n\nAs we've said since 2015, part of our commitment to diversity means being transparent about our own numbers. Here are the breakdowns:\n\nRace and Ethnicity: All of ProPublica\n\nRace and Ethnicity: Editorial\n\nRace and Ethnicity: Managers\n\nGender: All of ProPublica\n\nGender: Editorial\n\nGender: Managers\n\nNote: The data is based on employees' self-reported information. Recognizing that some people may identify as more than one race but not identify as a person of color, from this year onward we are stating these numbers in terms of people who \"solely identify as non-Hispanic white.\" We hope this will provide more specificity and accuracy. In previous years, we have sometimes given statistics with the term \"people of color.\" To better compare current data to previous years, ProPublica used employee information as of Jan. 1, which was not the date used in the 2021 annual report; as a result, figures for 2021 differ from what was previously reported. Managers are defined as staff members who supervise other people and do not include all editors. Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding.\n\nWe think about our efforts in the following ways: building the pipeline (for us and for all of investigative journalism), recruiting talent and improving our hiring process, and inclusion and retention.

      "text": "The Harsh Truth About Disability Inclusion\n\nM y biggest fear is that I will never see true disability inclusion in my lifetime. Dare I say it-my biggest fear is that none of us will.\n\nFor years, disability advocates have fought to break down barriers, to be seen, valued, and included-not as a charity case, not as a box to be ticked, but as equal contributors to society. Yet, despite progress, recent global shifts in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies are undoing critical steps forward. In some cases, these policies have been misunderstood, misapplied, and now, weaponized against us.\n\nRecent statements and policy changes in the United States are fueling a dangerous and discriminatory narrative-one that threatens to erase decades of progress for disabled individuals. If major economies like America's begin to roll back DEI commitments, the impact will be felt globally.\n\nAs a Paralympian, disability advocate, and consultant, I, like so many others, am exhausted from fighting the same battles over and over again. We shouldn't have to constantly prove our worth. The numbers already speak for themselves: There are 8 billion people on this planet. More than 1.3 billion of them are disabled.\n\nWe are not a minority.\n\nWhen DEI policies were first introduced, they were meant to level the playing field-to recognize marginalized communities and create opportunities that had long been denied. But somewhere along the way, the process became diluted. Instead of meaningful, long-term change, many organizations chose a checklist approach: hire a disabled employee, showcase their story in marketing campaigns, enter an industry award, and call it progress.\n\nI know this all too well-because I have been that photo opportunity.\n\nI have been invited to events, featured in marketing materials, and asked to speak on panels-only to realize that no real systemic change was happening behind the scenes. My presence was being used to signal progress when, in reality, the same barriers remained for disabled employees, customers, and communities. It's a deeply frustrating and disheartening experience.\n\nBut not all organizations get it wrong. There are companies, institutions, and leaders who are doing the work-who have committed to making accessibility an ingrained part of their policies and culture. These are the organizations we should be championing-their methods, their stories, and their successes. They prove that true inclusion is possible, but only when it is done right.\n\nDisability remains shrouded in stigma. The perception that disabled people are \"less capable\" or that accessibility is a burden rather than a right is still deeply ingrained in many aspects of society. And the worst part? It's incredibly hurtful.\n\nWhen I walk into a room, I know that some people will see my disability first. They will make assumptions about what I can and can't do before I even open my mouth. This isn't just an inconvenience-it's exhausting. People with disabilities shouldn't have to prove their worth over and over again.\n\nA society that only values people based on their ability to conform is a society that fails us all. When we devalue people with disabilities, we are setting a dangerous precedent-one that says some lives are worth more than others.\n\nPeople with disabilities have always added value to workplaces, communities, and industries.\n\nWe are problem-solvers, innovators, and leaders-because we've had to be. We navigate inaccessible systems daily, adapting in ways that others never have to think about.  According to a 2018 Accenture study , companies that excel in disability inclusion see 28% higher revenue, 30% higher profit margins, and two times the net income compared to peers. A 2020 study from the U.S. Department of Labor also noted that employees with disabilities tend to have higher retention rates, reducing costly turnover and improving workplace stability. The business case for disability inclusion couldn't be clearer.\n\nWe don't need special treatment. We just want equal access to the same world-one that initially wasn't designed with us in mind, but one that can be redesigned for all.\n\nI hope that's not too much to ask.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "These U.S. Companies Are Not Ditching DEI Amid Trump's Crackdown\n\nA s the Trump Administration sets out to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs across the federal government and private sector, a number of major companies have joined in the effort . Some others, however, have decidedly not.\n\nWhile companies like Google, Amazon, Meta, and some Wall Street banks have reversed course on DEI-related policies and pledges-many of which were made in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter Movement in 2020-others, like Pinterest , have expressed caution over how the Trump-led backlash against DEI could impact their business.\n\nStill, others see an abrupt shift away from DEI to be short-sighted.\n\nOn Tuesday, Apple shareholders rejected a proposal to abolish its DEI initiatives, after the company's board of directors made the case that ditching its DEI programs would \"restrict Apple's ability to manage its own ordinary business operations, people and teams, and business strategies.\" And earlier Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi told the Financial Times , \"We think that building an employment group that is diverse, that is global, that thinks about all aspects of the business, that's positive-that's just good business,\" although the company is adjusting its DEI-based executive pay incentives .\n\nHere are some of the major companies that are resisting attacks on their DEI initiatives:\n\nApple became the latest major company to reject a shareholder proposal asking the company to abolish its diversity and inclusion programs, policies, departments, and goals. The bid was drafted by conservative think-tank National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), which has submitted a number of DEI-related proposals to companies even before President Donald Trump's second term began.\n\nThe proposal argued that corporate DEI programs expose the company to potential litigation, citing a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that reversed affirmative action in college admissions. But investors at Apple's annual shareholder meeting on Feb. 25 rejected the measure, with 97% of votes cast against it .\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who met with Trump last week, said at the meeting that Apple has never had quotas or targets. However, he added that the company may have to make adjustments \"as the legal landscape around these issues evolves,\" according to Bloomberg News .\n\nBen & Jerry's has never shied away from social activism-with campaigns around marijuana legalization, racial justice, and LGBTQ+ pride. Unsurprisingly, when it comes to DEI, the ice cream company told CNBC that it has no plans to roll back or slash its efforts.\n\n\"We believe that companies that timidly bow to the current political climate by attempting to turn back the clock will become increasingly uncompetitive in the marketplace and will ultimately be judged as having been on the wrong side of history,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nBen & Jerry's recently accused its parent company Unilever of trying to mandate its silence on Trump. The company is suing Unilever for allegedly threatening to \"dismantle\" Ben & Jerry's independent board and stifling its social activism .\n\nLast month, the board of directors for Costco Wholesale unanimously opposed a proposal filed by NCPPR, which asked the wholesaler to report the risks of maintaining its DEI policies.\n\n\"Our Board has considered this proposal and believes that our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary,\" Costco's board wrote in its recommendation to shareholders, who would vote on the proposal. \"Our efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion remind and reinforce with everyone at our Company the importance of creating opportunities for all. We believe that these efforts enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed.\" The board added that its DEI policies are legally appropriate.\n\nShareholders voted against the proposal at Costco's annual shareholder meeting on Jan. 23, with 98% votes cast against it.\n\nDelta Air Lines maintained its line on DEI efforts last month. \"DEI is about talent, and that's been our focus,\" Delta chief external affairs officer Peter Carter reportedly said on an earnings call in January. \"We are steadfast in our commitment because we think they are actually critical to our business.\"\n\nClothing retailer Francesca's affirmed its commitment to DEI in a LinkedIn post earlier this month. \"DEI is not an abbreviation-it's a Human Strategy, and respect and inclusion are good for business,\" the post said. \"At Francesca's, we've built a culture where employees feel free to be you in all senses,\" CEO Andrew Clarke said in an accompanying video. He added that as an openly gay CEO, he has faced prejudice, discrimination, and \"even lost a job\" over his identity. DEI is \"not just part of the strategy,\" Clarke said in the video. \"It's the human strategy.\"\n\nClarke told CNBC that DEI was critical to the company's rebound after filing for bankruptcy in 2020.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon reaffirmed the bank's support of DEI in a Feb. 24 interview with CNBC . The bank-the largest in the U.S.-will continue its outreach to Black, Hispanic, LGBTQ+, veteran, and disabled communities, Dimon said.\n\nDimon's comments came after the bank's latest annual filing earlier this month noted that it \"has been and expects that it will continue to be criticized by activists, politicians and other members of the public concerning business practices or positions taken by JPMorgan Chase with respect to matters of public policy (such as diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives).\"\n\nCosmetics company Lush wanted its message on DEI to be heard-and smelled-putting out three new bath bombs named Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Hilary Jones, global ethics director at Lush, told ADWEEK that the company is \"not going to roll back on anything, and we wanted to make sure that we were visible in not rolling back.\"\n\nThe company, known for its colorful soaps with quirky names, has long been vocal about social issues: it launched a soap in the early 2000s called \"Gay is Okay\" and in 2014 supported its employees who staged a protest over police brutality at the Mall of America. After a complaint about the protest was posted on the company's corporate page, Lush responded : \"We are a campaigning company, and we support the right to free speech and peaceful protest. Standing in solidarity of fairness, justice and equality for all, regardless of gender, race, age, sexuality, and religion-this is something that as a business we do wholeheartedly believe in.\"\n\nMicrosoft has not made any moves to repeal its DEI policies, according to Bloomberg Law . The company's chief diversity officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre put forward the business case for supporting diversity and inclusion practices in a Dec. 20 LinkedIn post .\n\n\"I'm thinking about the importance of continuing our diversity and inclusion work, expanding empathy, and anticipating the needs of all our stakeholders, both within Microsoft and beyond,\" she wrote. \"A workforce strengthened by many perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds is critical to our innovation.\"\n\nPatagonia told CNBC that it will not scale back its DEI policies. \"We stand firm in support of our justice, equity and antiracism policies and practices,\" the outdoor apparel company said in a statement.\n\nThe company has been well known for its activism around climate issues. \"We know that when we come together and push back, we can win,\" Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert recently wrote in TIME , arguing against the Trump Administration leasing or selling 640 million acres of public lands. \"As we have for decades before,\" Gellert wrote, \"Patagonia will mobilize our community and use our position as a business and supporter of grassroots conservation groups to protect public land and water regardless of who is in the White House.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "How to Thread 'a Pretty Difficult Needle' With Inclusion\n\nE ven as CEOs and politicians have denounced diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, data show that many of these policies remain important for employees, creating a tricky situation for companies.\n\nEmployers \"are threading a pretty difficult needle,\" says Joelle Emerson , CEO and co-founder of Paradigm, a firm that provides services related to culture and inclusion. \"You simultaneously want to reassure your employees, 'We care about you. Our values have not changed,' and you want to reduce risk, which may mean evolving some of your programs or how you talk about this stuff externally.\"\n\nWe spoke with Emerson about how leaders can reassure employees and build buy-in for inclusion as \"basic business hygiene\" and how to interpret the barrage of headlines about DEI rollbacks. Here are excerpts of our conversation, edited for length and clarity:\n\nHow are you making the case for the continued importance of inclusion even as it seems like many corporate leaders are de-emphasizing the importance of culture and human-centric policies?\n\nWe're in a different moment where companies' priorities may be shifting more broadly around how important culture is. It's a confusing moment, but what isn't confusing is that companies need to have the basic business hygiene in place that's capable of positioning them for the future.\n\nThe workforce globally is becoming more diverse across a range of dimensions. You don't have to think culture is your number one priority to care about whether you're going to be able to hire enough people given the diversifying workforce. Our data at Paradigm Research from thousands of companies show that there are pretty critical gaps in how companies are designing hiring, culture, and experience strategies for underrepresented groups. If that continues, companies are simply not going to be able to attract and retain top talent.\n\nSo in the conversations I'm having with executive and leadership teams, we're talking about how you build a future-ready workplace. How do you build a company that is going to be a place people want to work over the next decade? When people who are different from each other are brought together-which will happen more and more-how do you make sure those people can collaborate, they can communicate, and they can get their work done really well?\n\nHow do you make sense of all of the headlines about DEI rollbacks?\n\nWe're trying to understand what is actually changing on the ground through an anonymous survey that asks about how specific initiatives, programs, and budgets are changing. Our hypothesis is that it might look different in reality than it does from the headlines.\n\nThe headlines make everything seem really binary: Apple and Costco are doubling down and Walmart and Meta are giving up on DEI. Even from the announcements themselves, I don't interpret that to be what's actually happening. What does it actually mean when a company like Walmart says, 'We're not doing DEI. We're focused on creating a culture of belonging going forward,' and the headline says, 'Walmart quits DEI.' That's actually not what I think that means.\n\nSo we want to know, when you say you're no longer doing DEI, what does that actually mean? Have you just changed the language? Are there external partnerships you're no longer participating in? Are you actually changing your hiring practices? Are you changing your training programs? Our hypothesis is that fewer things are changing than we might be led to believe, and that companies are probably all evolving a similar set of things-which probably makes sense from a legal and regulatory standpoint-and are mostly likely not evolving away from some of the core practices that we think are most important.\n\nWhat are those core practices that make up 'good business hygiene?'\n\nOrganizations should double down on making sure the work they're doing is in service of fairness, of consistency, of experience, of inclusion for everyone. That means looking at all the different things you're doing and asking, 'Is this helping us build a culture for everyone?' To be clear, a culture for everyone isn't like an identity-agnostic culture. It's a culture that recognizes that if we want to create a great place for everyone to work, we need to ask ourselves, 'For whom are we not doing that today?' And then we need to solve and address the gaps we uncover.\n\nIt also means moving away from more siloed practices to embedded practices. When I saw companies in 2021 launch diversity hiring strategies, my question was, 'Why do you need that separate hiring strategy? Why is your core hiring strategy not about casting a wide net for talent and applying consistent standards so the best person gets hired?' Make your entire hiring strategy about that and that's going to be more impactful, more sustainable, and, in our experience, more resilient to moments like this.\n\nOne last trend is a change in how companies are talking about the work they're doing. I'm sure you're seeing a lot of companies moving away from the acronym DEI. I don't see that as a bad thing or a compromise on values. Companies have relied on that umbrella term to categorize hundreds of different types of initiatives, so people are talking past each other. When you say, 'We do DEI hiring,\" I have no idea what that means. Instead, talk about how you go to a wider set of universities than you used to or you train hiring managers to ask consistent questions of all candidates.\n\nLanguage is evolving to become more precise and more clear. That will help communicate to the large majority of Americans who believe in this stuff that these are not controversial practices. These are things that actually most of us across the political spectrum agree on. Oftentimes, the broader political landscape can make it seem like there's a lot of division within companies on whether building representative teams, fair practices, and inclusive cultures are controversial. In reality, these values are often pretty widely held.\n\nThe handbook for the future of work, delivered to your inbox."

      "text": "A New Framework for DEI\n\nW ith escalating attacks on corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts, many private-sector organizations are searching for an approach that preserves effective, popular initiatives while insulating them from external attacks.\n\nFor strategist Lily Zheng, the solution is not wholesale retreat, but holding DEI programs to the highest standard of effectiveness using a framework they call FAIR: fairness, access, inclusion, and representation. \"FAIR is built on four principles that make DEI work effective, namely being outcome centered, being focused on systems, being driven by coalitions, being communicated in win-wins,\" they explain.\n\nThey contend that many programs currently being rolled back-such as participation in external surveys and public statements on a company's website-fall short of this standard. We spoke to Zheng to learn more about how these kinds of programs have failed in the past and their recommendations for designing DEI strategy that will stick going forward. Here are excerpts from our conversation, edited for length and clarity:\n\nYou have argued that much of mainstream DEI was falling short, even before this current wave of attacks. Why is that?\n\nThere was a study that came out showing that between 1990 and 2015, which is 25 years, the rates of anti-Black hiring discrimination did not change by a single percentage point. There's lots of similar stats on the glass ceiling for women on promotion rates being low, the bamboo ceiling for Asian people, disability-related discrimination rates. By all of these measures, we've seen that workplaces haven't necessarily been making good progress.\n\nAll these problems still existed, but companies tried to solve them in ways that were just ineffective. You don't solve racism by having a book club. You solve racism by fixing your hiring process, by training your managers, by ensuring that there are consequences for harmful behavior, and by building respectful norms in your workplace. This is what the work looks like and companies were not investing in it. Unfortunately, even in 2025, this continues to be the case in the vast majority of workplaces. This is the big challenge that DEI practitioners have had for decades at this point, even if backlash had not become a challenge. Now not only are we navigating backlash, we are navigating this legacy of ineffective responses to solving these deeply rooted problems.\n\nAre there ways to make DEI work more impactful while shielding it against this new wave of attacks?\n\nI mentioned that study done on anti-Black hiring discrimination. The same study found that the companies that had the least hiring discrimination all had one mundane thing in common: a centralized, standardized hiring process that used scoring rubrics and hiring panels. That made it so there was some rigor and a standardized process so that a single hiring manager could not hire someone willy-nilly because they liked the way they look.\n\nSo if you ask me how to mitigate hiring discrimination, I'm not going to recommend you sit everyone down for three hours to train them on every single racial bias that exists. I'll just say standardize your hiring process. People of color or women or LGBTQ+ folks, these are not the only people that are impacted by bias. Basically, standardizing your process is going to help pretty much everyone. It ensures that we don't act on these biases that we might hold about who a smart person is or a skilled person is.\n\nThere are lots of other common-sense interventions like this across the workplace that we don't even need to call DEI work. This is just how to run an effective, responsible, healthy workplace that people trust and that people feel respected in.\n\nYou focus on measuring outcomes and building accountability in your work. How do you recommend organizations set these systems up, and what should they be measuring?\n\nOne of the things that I have helped companies do for the last eight years is assess their workforce sentiment on their policies and processes. We do audits and culture surveys to assess people's access to decision making, their access to opportunity, their perceptions of psychological safety or physical safety. We analyze all these data by demographics and organizational factors like level, tenure, and department.\n\nData allow us to see which problems are real, which problems do not exist, which things don't need solving, and allow us to allocate our resources to actually fix the things that need fixing and ensure everyone has good outcomes. I've worked with organizations where women have better outcomes than men. In that situation, how can we make this organization work better for people of all genders? I've worked in organizations where Ivy League grads ran a top clique-how can we make sure that talent, regardless of where you went to school, can shine?\n\nAlso, data are the first step to accountability. If a leader says, 'I want to end discrimination,' then of course you need to measure discrimination. You need the leader to do something about it, and then you need to measure discrimination again to see if it went down. This is the building block of any kind of effective change-management organizational-intervention approach. You measure, you do your experiment, you measure again. The more data we collect, and the more effectively we collect it and use it, the better we can not only make change, but also visualize that change and hold ourselves accountable.\n\nWhat has been the impact of the recent rollbacks? It seems like there has been a mix of programs affected, from the window dressing of lunch-and-learns and heritage month messages to more concrete actions like supplier diversity pledges and diverse hiring slate policies...\n\nI really appreciate you pointing out that not all rollbacks are created equal. There are some which are clearly performative-just as performative as the performative DEI efforts were. For example, you can get a perfect score on the Human Rghts Campaign survey and still be a terrible workplace for LGBTQ+ people. It's just a signaling effort. In the same way, companies saying they're not doing the survey anymore doesn't tell me anything, but some folks on the right will see this as a political win.\n\nBut there are other things that are going to have real impacts. For example, the companies that are rolling back on their commitments to ensure broad representation within candidate pools before they hire. These efforts meaningfully increase the diversity of workplaces in perfectly legal ways because they're just trying to extend the talent pool rather than setting quotas. These things are legal, they're effective, they're very well appreciated. I can't see any possible benefit except to signal to certain groups that you're willing to inflict harm upon marginalized communities. Or let's say you're funding a nonprofit or an institution dedicated to racial justice. It does send signals, but it also has real tangible impacts on everyone who works there.\n\nThen, importantly, that's going to really, really hurt morale for everyone within their workplace. If these things go away, there's a very good chance that workers in those companies will feel a lower sense of belonging, lower wellbeing, and lower productivity. They're likely to see these workers leave because there are lots of workplaces that treat workers of all races and all genders well, so we're going to see a brain drain away from these workplaces that have signaled that they would much rather pander to authoritarians than build workplaces for everyone.\n\nRead Zheng's recent article about the FAIR framework in Harvard Business Review.\n\nCharter Pro members can read a full transcript of our conversation on our website.\n\nThe handbook for the future of work, delivered to your inbox."

      "text": "Meta and Amazon scale back diversity initiatives\n\nMeta and Amazon are scaling back their diversity programmes, joining firms across corporate America that are retreating from hiring and training initiatives criticised by conservatives, citing legal and political risks.\n\nThe moves come shortly after Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans.\n\nIn a memo to staff, Meta said it was also scrapping its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts due to a \"shifting legal and policy landscape\".\n\nWalmart and McDonalds are among the other firms to have made similar decisions regarding diversity efforts since Trump won re-election.\n\nIn its memo, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by the BBC, Meta cited a Supreme Court ruling concerning race in college admissions, while also noting that the term \"DEI\" (diversity, equity and inclusion) had become \"charged\".\n\nThe tech giant said it would continue to look for diverse staff, but stop using its current procedure, which seeks to make selections from a pool of diverse candidates.\n\nAmazon said in its internal announcement that it remained \"dedicated to delivering inclusive experiences\" but was altering its approach to focus on programmes with \"proven outcomes\".\n\n\"As part of this evolution, we've been winding down outdated programs and materials, and we're aiming to complete that by the end of 2024,\" Candi Castleberry, Amazon's VP of inclusive experiences and technology, wrote in the December note to staff, which was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nThe changes include unifying \"employee groups\" under one umbrella, she said.\n\nFinancial firms JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, also pulled out of groups focused on risks from climate change this week.\n\nThe moves are a sign of the acceleration of a retreat that started two years ago, as Republicans ramped up attacks on firms such as BlackRock and Disney , accusing them of \"woke\" progressive activism and threatening political punishment.\n\nBig brands such as Bud Light and Target also faced backlash and boycotts related to their efforts to appeal to LGBTQ customers.\n\nMany of the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives were put in place after the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in 2020 following George Floyd's murder at the hands of police.\n\nRecent court decisions have bolstered critics of the programmes, who said that they were discriminatory.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2023 struck down the right for private universities to consider race in admissions decisions.\n\nAnother court of appeals ruling invalidated a Nasdaq policy that would have required companies listed on that stock exchange to have at least one woman, racial minority or LGBTQ person on their board or explain why not.\n\nMeta said it was also ending its efforts to work with suppliers who are \"diverse\" but will instead focus on small and medium-sized companies.\n\nIt also plans to stop offering \"equity and inclusion\" training and instead offer programmes that \"mitigate bias for all, no matter your background\".\n\nMeta declined to comment on the memo, news of which was immediately met with both criticism and celebration.\n\n\"I'm sitting back and enjoying every second of this,\" said conservative activist Robby Starbuck, who has taken credit for successfully campaigning against the policies at companies such as Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson.\n\nLGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign said workplace inclusion policies help to attract and retain top staff and had been \"directly tied to long-term business growth\".\n\n\"Those who abandon these commitments are shirking their responsibility to their employees, consumers, and shareholders\" RaShawn \"Shawnie\" Hawkins, the senior director of the HRC Foundation's Workplace Equality Program said.\n\nMeta's move comes just days after the tech giant said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by Trump and Republicans and elevated conservatives to key leadership positions.\n\nIn a nearly three-hour interview with podcaster Joe Rogan Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said he had always been concerned about being the arbiter of \"truth\" and was \"ill-prepared\" when the issue first heated up after the 2016 election.\n\nHe said the demands to take down information became unreasonable under the Biden administration. For example, he said the company faced pressure during the pandemic to remove content like statements about vaccine side effects.\n\nThat helped to generate a wider political backlash, he said, including his own.\n\n\"I feel like I have much greater command now of what I think the policies should be,\" he said, adding that he felt the US government \"should be defending its companies ... not be the tip of the spear attacking\".\n\n\"When the US does that to its tech industry, it's basically just open season around the rest of the world,\" he added.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nBBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts.\n\nSantos' downfall included him being the first member of Congress to be expelled in more than 20 years.\n\nThe former US senator offers some typically frank advice as he urges his old party to work with the president.\n\nBoeing's boss says it's looking to sell 50 more planes China has on order to other countries.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Google joins firms dropping diversity recruitment goals\n\nGoogle has become the latest big US firm to scrap its goals to recruit more workers from underrepresented groups, BBC News understands.\n\nThe decision to abandon the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) recruitment targets comes after the company carried out an annual review of its corporate policies.\n\nThe technology giant is also reviewing some of its other DEI programmes.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and his allies have regularly attacked DEI policies. Since his return to the White House just over two weeks ago, Trump has ordered government agencies to eliminate such initiatives.\n\n\"We're committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities,\" a Google spokesperson said.\n\n\"We've updated our [annual investor report] language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.\"\n\nThe story was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2024, Google's investor reports stated its commitment to make \"diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do\". That line is not in its latest report, which was published on Wednesday.\n\nIn recent years, Google had been an outspoken supporter of DEI targets, particularly after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the protests that followed his death.\n\nAt the time, Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, set a five-year goal to increase the number of its leaders who came from underrepresented groups by 30%.\n\nAccording to the company, the proportion of black people among its leadership almost doubled between 2020 and last year. It also said representation of women and Latino people had increased in those roles.\n\nGoogle is the latest major company to make a U-turn on its diversity policies.\n\nMeta, Amazon, Pepsi, McDonald's, Walmart and others have rolled back their DEI programmes .\n\nApple has stood out by pushing back against this trend. Last month, the tech giant's board asked investors to vote against a proposal to end its diversity policies.\n\nThe proposal by conservative group, the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), called on the iPhone maker to abolish its DEI policies, saying they expose firms to \"litigation, reputational and financial risks\".\n\nLast week, the retail chain Target was sued by a group of shareholders, led by the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund in Florida, who said the firm had defrauded them by allegedly concealing the risks associated with its DEI policies.\n\nThe lawsuit referred to a 2023 backlash over LGBTQ+ merchandise at its stores, which caused both its sales and its stock price to drop.\n\nTarget has also recently announced that it was ending its DEI targets.\n\nIn the latest example of the Trump administration's disapproval of such policies, the US President last week speculated , without giving evidence, that DEI had led to an air crash in Washington DC.\n\nThe remarks, which came less than 24 hours after the crash, were in line with the White House's efforts to undo such programmes.\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world.\n\nOutside the UK?

      "text": "In the US, DEI is under attack. But under a different name, it might live on\n\nIn Union County, South Carolina, the sprawling cotton mills that once put bread on the table for many are long gone. Union is also what is termed a \"food desert\", where many residents live far from the nearest supermarket. So in 2016, local non-profit director Elise Ashby began working with farmers to deliver discounted boxes of farm-fresh produce across the county, where 30% of the population is black and roughly 25% live in poverty.\n\nTo fund this, Ms Ashby first relied on her own savings and then some small-scale grants. But in 2023, the Walmart Foundation - the philanthropic arm of one of America's largest corporations - awarded her over $100,000 (£80,000), as part of a $1.5m programme to fund \"community-based non-profits led by people of colour\".\n\n\"I cried a little bit,\" she says. \"It was just one of those times where, like, somebody actually sees what you're doing.\"\n\nTwo years ago, this was the kind of programme that attracted sponsorship from major companies across America, as the country grappled with racism past and present following the murder of George Floyd, a black man suffocated under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer during an arrest in 2020.\n\nBut now, those same companies are pulling back. Walmart announced in November that it was ending some of its diversity initiatives, including plans to close its Center for Racial Equity, which supported Ms Ashby's grant.\n\nCorporations from Meta and Google to Goldman Sachs and McDonald's have all announced similar changes as part of a larger retreat from diversity, equity and inclusion programmes (DEI) across the corporate landscape.\n\nThe moment represents a stark cultural shift, fuelled in part by fears of lawsuits, investigations, and social media backlash, as well as relentless pressure from the new president of the United States.\n\nSince assuming office in January, Donald Trump has aggressively sought to \"terminate DEI\" and \"restore merit-based opportunity\" in the US. He has directed the federal government to end its DEI programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".\n\nIn the early days of his second term, the Veterans Affairs department has closed its DEI offices, the Environmental Protection Agency has placed nearly 200 employees who worked in its civil rights office on paid leave and Trump has fired the top military general, a black man whom his defence secretary had previously said should be fired because of his involvement in \"woke\" DEI.\n\nAt first sight, it may appear that the US's experiment with policies designed to improve outcomes for specific racial and identity-based groups is finished. But some experts suggest there's another possibility, that some such efforts will continue - but in a different guise, one more suited to the political mood of a country that has just elected a president who has pledged a war on \"woke\".\n\nProgrammes resembling DEI first emerged in earnest in the US in the 1960s, in the wake of the civil rights movement that fought to protect and expand the rights of black Americans.\n\nUnder names like \"affirmative action\" and \"equal opportunity\", initially their aim was to reverse the damaging effects of centuries of enslavement of African Americans and decades of discrimination under \"Jim Crow\" laws that enforced racial segregation.\n\nAs the movement evolved, promoting the rights of women, the LGBT community, and other racial and ethnic groups, use of the terms \"diversity\", \"equity\" and \"inclusion\" became more widespread.\n\nDEI programmes in the corporate world and government agencies have often focused on hiring practices and policies emphasising diversity as a commercial benefit. Their supporters say they aim to address disparities affecting people from a range of backgrounds, though a significant emphasis tends to be on race.\n\nThe programmes saw a huge upswing in 2020 during the social unrest of the Black Lives Matter movement. For example, Walmart committed $100m over five years to its racial equity centre. Wells Fargo appointed its first chief diversity officer; Google and Nike already had theirs in place. After adjusting their hiring practices, companies listed on the S&P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs - 94% of which went to people of colour, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBut almost as quickly as the pendulum swung left, a conservative backlash began. For Stefan Padfield, executive director of conservative think-tank the National Center for Public Policy Research, DEI programmes are based on a premise that \"divides people on the basis of race and sex\".\n\nMore recently, these arguments that programmes intended to combat discrimination were themselves discriminatory, particularly against white Americans, have been made with increasing force. Training sessions emphasising concepts like \"white privilege\" and racial bias have drawn particular scrutiny.\n\nThe roots of this opposition took hold in conservative opposition to critical race theory (CRT), an academic concept which argues racism is endemic to American society. Over time, the campaign to remove books from classrooms that allegedly indoctrinated students into CRT thinking evolved into one focused on \"punishing woke corporations\".\n\nSocial media accounts like End Wokeness and conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck seized the moment to target companies accused of being \"woke\". Mr Starbuck has taken credit for changes in policy at the likes of Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson after he publicised details of their DEI initiatives to his social media followers.\n\nOne of the clearest signs of this movement's strength came in spring 2023, after a Bud Light partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked right-wing outrage and calls for a boycott of the beer and its parent company Anheuser-Busch. In the aftermath of the campaign, Bud Light sales were 28% lower than usual, a Harvard Business Review analysis found.\n\nAnother major victory for conservatives arrived in June 2023, when the Supreme Court ruled that race could no longer be considered as a factor in university admissions, reversing decades of affirmative action-based policy.\n\nThe ruling also cast the legal standing of corporate DEI policies into uncertainty. When Meta made the internal announcement it was cancelling DEI programmes, the company told staff \"the legal and policy landscape\" surrounding DEI had changed.\n\nThe speed at which some large corporations have shed their DEI policies raises the question of how genuine their commitment to diversifying their workforces was in the first place.\n\nMartin Whittaker, chief executive at JUST Capital, a non-profit that surveys Americans on workplace issues, says much of the backtracking comes from companies who were \"rushing to kind of look good\" at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nBut not all are yielding to political and legal pressure. Conservative think-tank the Heritage Foundation noted in a November report that although DEI programmes appear to be trending downwards, \"nearly all\" Fortune 500 companies still list DEI commitments somewhere on their websites. Apple shareholders recently voted to continue diversity programmes at the company.\n\nSurveys that measure Americans' support for DEI offer mixed results. JUST Capital's survey suggests support for DEI has declined, but support for issues closely linked to it - such as fair pay - have not. A 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center suggested most employed adults (56%) believed \"focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing\".\n\nMuch rests on the question of whether DEI is actually effective in the first place.\n\nSome research has suggested that DEI programmes like diversity training can in fact be harmful. According to one study by researchers from Harvard University and the University of Tel Aviv, trainers commonly report hostility and resistance from employees who feel forced to do the training and threatened by what they see as reverse discrimination; it also says the programmes can often leave trainees feeling more hostility towards other groups.\n\nThis research has been seized on by DEI's opponents as part of the evidence that \"the best way to improve the lives of all our citizens, and all our neighbours, is to allow the free market to lift all the boats\", as Mr Padfield puts it.\n\nThe problem with this kind of thinking, according to Siri Chilazi, a researcher focused on gender equity at Harvard University, is that there is no historical precedent to suggest that racial and gender imbalances will correct themselves. Mrs Chilazi says racial and gender barriers still exist and believes DEI solutions focused on \"levelling the playing field for all\" are needed.\n\nShe cites multiple experiments that show white men disproportionately receive more responses after applying for jobs than women or people of colour. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research sent identical CVs to roughly 100 of the largest US companies and found that applicants presumed to be white were contacted by employers 9.5% more often than applicants presumed to be black - with one company contacting presumed white applicants 43% more often.\n\nBut Mrs Chilazi also says there are genuine issues with many DEI programmes, adding that the most common programmes - including diversity and unconscious bias training and employee resource or affinity groups - are often the least effective. A recent study highlighting the ineffectiveness of some DEI practices said a common issue was treating them as an end goal in themselves, without measurable outcomes.\n\nAnd when it comes to large corporations donating money towards DEI initiatives - like Walmart's equity centre - Mrs Chilazi says the problem is that there is not much data to show how effective this is. \"This is an area where we actually don't have good research,\" she says.\n\nWhere studies have shown DEI to be effective is when it comes to making \"small systemic changes\", she says. There is evidence to suggest replacing open-ended questions in performance evaluations with more specific ones, such as \"what's the one biggest accomplishment of this person last year?\", has shown significant reductions in gender and racial evaluation gaps that can affect pay, according to Mrs Chilazi.\n\nSupporters of DEI say the real-world impact of the shift from it can be seen at Harvard University, which was targeted in the landmark Supreme Court case.\n\nLast autumn, Harvard Law School reported having only 19 first-year black students among more than 500 students that enrolled, according to the American Bar Association. That was less than half the number from the previous year - 43 - and the lowest since the 1960s. The law school also saw a significant decline in Hispanic student enrolment, which dropped from 63 to 39 between 2023 and 2024.\n\nColleges and schools have already begun making adjustments in response to the new climate. At one university, a lunar new year celebration was cancelled; another ended a decades-long forum on race. Elsewhere, social clubs for black and Asian students have been disbanded.\n\nBut the ruling's impact does not appear straightforward. Enrolment numbers for black and Hispanic students at some other top US colleges have actually increased since the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nFor the freshman class that arrived in the autumn, Northwestern University saw an 11% rise in enrolment for black students and a 13% increase for Hispanic students.\n\nBecause of results like these, some DEI opponents have accused universities of flouting the court's ruling.\n\nBut another explanation offered for the increase in diversity at some universities is a shift towards \"socio-economic inclusion\" instead of race and ethnicity - which nonetheless appears to have achieved the same objective.\n\nDartmouth University's Hispanic student enrolment jumped from 9.7% to 12.7% last year, after adjusting to make the school \"more accessible for low- and middle-income families\", it said in a press release.\n\nIt's clear that the anti-DEI campaigns are having a significant real-world impact. \"I think we are in the midst of a big shift,\" says Mrs Chilazi.\n\nMichelle Jolivet, author of Is DEI Dead?: The Rebranding of Inclusive Organizations, says she is worried that the anti-DEI movement will lead to progress stalling for historically disadvantaged groups.\n\n\"Things that matter are measured, and when you stop measuring them, they stop happening,\" she says. \"Then you do stop making progress.\"\n\nBut as to the question at the centre of her book - is DEI dead? - Jolivet says the answer is no.\n\nThe companies that appear to have cancelled their DEI programmes are not really eliminating them, she says. Instead, they are just rebranding and reorganising to escape potential lawsuits.\n\nShe gave the example of Walmart renaming its chief diversity officer to chief belonging officer. Similarly, McDonald's gave one of its programmes a facelift, changing the name of its Global DEI Center of Excellence to the Global Inclusion Team.\n\n\"DEI has become more of a controversial word,\" she says. \"If I just take that word out, I can still do the same thing.\"\n\nBut not everyone is reassured.\n\nBack in the fields of Union County, Elise Ashby looks towards the future with uncertainty. The grant from Walmart gave her access to capital that she argues black-owned businesses often struggle to obtain.\n\nShe fears a return to when she \"stayed up nights\" wondering where the next cheque would come from and facing the kind of obstacles \"white men don't have\".\n\nShe says: \"Am I concerned about the future? Absolutely.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Natalie Sherman\n\nTop image credit: Getty Images\n\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

      "text": "As diversity, equity and inclusion comes under legal attack, companies quietly alter their programs\n\nSophia Danner-Okotie's has ambitious plans for her Nigerian-inspired clothing line but a sense of dread has punctured her optimism as she watches a legal battle being waged against a small venture capital firm that has provided funding instrumental to her boutique brand's growth.\n\nThe case against the Fearless Fund alleges that one of its grant programs discriminates against non-Black women and asks the courts to imagine a similar program designed only for white applicants. It is among a growing list of lawsuits against corporate diversity and inclusion programs that are making their way through the courts this year.\n\nMost have been filed by conservative activists encouraged by the Supreme Court's June ruling ending affirmative action in college admissions and are now seeking to set a similar precedent in the working world.\n\nThe battle has been a roller coaster of setbacks and victories for both sides, but some companies are already retooling their diversity programs in the face of legal challenges, and the growing expectation that the conservative-dominated Supreme Court will eventually take up the issue.\n\nOne conservative activist, Christopher Rufo, claimed another victory this month with the resignation of Harvard's first Black woman president, Claudine Gay, after allegations of plagiarism and a furor over her congressional testimony about antisemitism.\n\nRufo, who has cast Gay's appointment to the job as the culmination of diversity and inclusion efforts that have sidelined conservative voices in higher education, vowed on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, not to \"stop until we have abolished DEI ideology from every institution in America.\"\n\nDozens of prominent companies have already been targeted, as well as a wide array of diversity initiatives, including fellowships, hiring goals, anti-bias training and contract programs for minority or women-owned businesses.\n\nSome challenges have focused on policies adopted after the 2020 protests over George Floyd's killing by police as companies pledged more efforts to redress racial inequalities in the workplace. But others have targeted decades-old diversity programs that anti-affirmative action advocates have long tried to dismantle.\n\nDiversity and inclusion experts say the legal backlash is already having a chilling effect over corporate efforts to address workplace inequality at a time when investment and interest in such initiatives have slowed following the post-Floyd surge.\n\nJob openings for diversity officers and similar positions have declined in recent months. The combined share of venture capital funding for businesses owned by Black and Latina women has dipped back to less than 1% after briefly surpassing that threshold - at 1.05% - in 2021 following a jump in 2020, according to the nonprofit advocacy group digitalundivided.\n\nThe case against the Fearless Fund, which provides early-stage funding to businesses led by women of color, exemplifies the unpredictable legal landscape.\n\nIn late September, a federal judge in Atlanta refused to block a Fearless Fund grant contest for Black women business owners, saying they are donations protected by the First Amendment and the lawsuit was likely to fail. But days later, a three-judge federal appeals panel suspended the contest, calling it \"racially exclusionary\" and saying the suit was likely to succeed.\n\n\"Am I going to be able to apply to grants like these? Are they even going to exist?\" said Danner-Okotie, who received $10,000 from a separate Fearless Fund grant. \"With this last ruling, it seems like no.\"\n\nDanner-Okotie first saw the potential for scaling her clothing brand when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the boutiques and fairs that carried her designs. Searching for ways to increase her online sales, she landed a contract with subscriber-based retailer Stitch Fix and used a government pandemic relief loan to fulfill the order. But when she tried to build on that success, she ran into roadblocks as banks declined her loan applications, deeming her business model risky since her clothes are handmade by Nigerian tailors.\n\nThe Fearless Fund, Danner-Okotie said, grasped her mission of designing clothes for American women looking to celebrate their African heritage. The grant was a game changer, allowing her to contract a factory in India to make uniquely designed fabrics for her team of tailors in Nigeria.\n\nBut now, future funding from the program is in jeopardy. The lawsuit against the Fearless Fund is being brought by the American Alliance for Equal Rights, a nonprofit founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, the man behind the college admissions cases the Supreme Court ruled on in June. The outcome of the case could be a bellwether for similar diversity programs.\n\nOral arguments in the case are scheduled for Jan. 31.\n\nFaced with a messy legal landscape, companies are being cautious. Most major companies have stuck by diversity initiatives that many ramped up in the face of pressure from some shareholders, employees and customers. Starbucks and Disney are among companies that have so far prevailed in court against challenges to their inclusion policies.\n\nBut some have made changes to diversity programs to try to protect them from legal scrutiny.\n\nAmong those are two prominent law firms that had faced lawsuits by Blum's group. The firms, Morrison Foerster and Perkins Coie, opened their diversity fellowship programs to all applicants of all races in October, changes the companies said were in the works before Blum's lawsuits, which he subsequently dropped.\n\nIn February, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer dropped race-based eligibility requirements for a fellowship program designed for college students of Black, Latino and Native American descent, even though a judge had dismissed a lawsuit against the program two months earlier. Despite the change, the conservative nonprofit suing Pfizer, Do No Harm, is appealing the lawsuit's dismissal, arguing the fellowship's goals remain the same.\n\nIn May, Comcast said business owners of all backgrounds would be eligible to apply for a grant program originally intended for women and people of color when it launched in 2020. The telecommunications giant settled a lawsuit last year over the program brought by the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty on behalf of the white owner of a commercial cleaning business.\n\nThe Wisconsin Institute filed another lawsuit in October, this one on behalf of two construction firms. The lawsuit seeks to dismantle the U.S. Department of Transportation's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, which dates back to the Reagan administration and requires that 10% of funds authorized for highway and transit federal assistance programs be expended with small businesses owned by women, minorities or other socially and economically disadvantaged people.\n\nDan Lennington, an attorney with the Wisconsin Institute, said he considers Comcast's changes \"progress,\" but the anti-affirmative action movement is looking for a broader victory that could change case law on workplace diversity programs, and the lawsuit against the DOT has that potential.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action \"opened up a whole new world,\" Lennington said. \"This decision just really injected new life into the whole debate.\"\n\nMany of the lawsuits challenging diversity programs, including the cases against Pfizer and the Fearless Fund, are relying on a section of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which prohibits racial discrimination in contract agreements. The law was originally intended to protect formerly enslaved people, but conservative activists are citing it to challenge programs designed to benefit racial minorities.\n\nTheir lawsuits generally target programs that have clear race-based eligibility components. A more difficult challenge is proving that companies are making hiring decisions based on race, said David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging at New York University's School of Law.\n\nTaking race into account for hiring or promotions is illegal under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. A debate has emerged about whether companies are crossing the line by announcing goals for increasing Black and other minority representation. Companies say such efforts are not quotas but aspirational goals they will try to achieve through policies like widening candidate pools and rooting out bias in hiring processes.\n\nGlasgow called it a \"gray area\" that could depend on a court's interpretation of corporate policies. He said it could be hard to prove discrimination just because a company \"announced in a really broad way that it would be nice to have more people of color in management\" but plaintiffs could try to argue that Diversity Equity and Inclusion policies are pressuring hiring managers to make race-based decisions.\n\nConservative activists are trying to make just that case, seizing on corporate documents that share data on efforts to increase the ranks of Black, Hispanic and other underrepresented groups in their workforce, however modest that progress might be.\n\nAmerica First Legal, a group run by former President Donald Trump adviser Stephen Miller, sent a letter in November to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission seeking an investigation into Macy's efforts to strengthen its DEI policies, arguing they amount to discriminatory hiring practices.\n\nIn 2019, Macy's announced a goal of 30% ethnic diversity among its leadership at the director level and above by 2025, in part to better serve its customer base, which is about 50% non-white. The retailer launched a leadership training program for selected managers of color, and last year required that candidates for director roles include ethnically diverse applicants. It also has incorporated its DEI goals into annual performance reviews for directors and company-wide incentive calculation.\n\nAmerica First Legal cited those initiatives to argue that Macy's \"has set explicit racial and other quotas for hiring.\" The group has sent dozens of similar letters to the EEOC targeting companies from IBM to American Airlines .\n\nMacy's declined to comment on the letter. But in a previous interview with The Associated Press, outgoing Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette said the company is sticking with its DEI policies while closely watching legal developments.\n\n\"Our enthusiasm and our commitment to all the prongs that we had with DEI, and our strategy, remains. We might express it differently based on court rulings and in the future,\" Gennette said, without providing details.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: Perfectly Synchronized With 'Steal, Kill, and Destroy' (Sound Familiar?)\n\nThe global surge of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), now a social component woven into the fabric of ESG (environmental, social, and governance) standards, marks a potent force on the global stage. Yet we still struggle to learn whether it is a force for good or a potentially diabolical one.\n\nCrucial to understand is how the terms \"diversity,\" \"equity,\" and \"inclusion\" have radically veered over time into very different meanings. Originally, \"diversity\" conveyed the idea of providing individuals from diverse backgrounds with equal access to affiliate within a given group or association. \"Equity,\" in its inception, revolved around the idea of upholding consistent standards for all individuals and groups; everyone has a \"stake\" and is a stakeholder. \"Inclusion,\" in its primary sense, signified inviting people of varied backgrounds and identities to fully partake in a group or association, to become like \"members of the family.\"\n\nNegative treatment toward whites within workforces (including forced Marxist-tinged DEI training/\"struggle sessions\") and race-based firing/layoffs that subvert federal and state labor laws by undermining existing Equal Employment Opportunity laws and policies, make clear to an objective observer: DEI's track record reflects disruption and disunity-not unity!\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, stealing means \"to take another person's property without permission or legal right and without intending to return it.\" Therefore, DEI steals!\n\nDEI also inflicts a form of killing. Individuals' merit and core competencies often take a backseat to skin color, impacting personal dignity and ambition, as DEI initiatives, particularly those focused on \"equity,\" undermine the very qualities that inspire excellent work. Excellence and work ethic are the very attributes that provide drive and ambition toward high performance and quality work.\n\nThe culmination of DEI initiatives, especially those fixated on \"equity,\" lead to destruction and humiliation. They amount to retributive acts toward whites solely based on skin color. DEI policies, targeted to disadvantage and humiliate certain people, lead to the dismantling of workgroups, eroding business excellence and efficiencies, ultimately culminating in the collapse of entities that would otherwise create prosperity.\n\nA commitment to diversity in and of itself can be a smart business move as the United States becomes more diverse and continues to expand and flourish with diverse people groups. The simple commitment to diversity doesn't steal, kill, and destroy.\n\nLikewise, a commitment to inclusion doesn't steal, kill, and destroy. Inclusion simply provides workplaces and communities that are more open and accepting. An inclusive environment resembles a nuanced extended family scenario. Inclusions are designed to help reduce the stress of dealing with hierarchical stereotypes of \"closed management rungs\" while helping people foster kinship with corporate missions and goals.\n\nIt is only \"equity\" that eschews meritocracy and demands equal outcomes. Its underlying Marxist principles drive actions that steal, kill, and destroy. Equity lives as the mindset of those who adhere to the notorious anti-God, anti-business, pro-state-run Marxist philosophies.\n\nMarx's singular goal was to inculcate ideas and policies that would bring about a communist utopia that rejects personal attributes of excellence and competence. His utopian schemes aimed to flatten and replace corporate hierarchies with government/state-run entities. Having mooched off his parents and never holding a real job, Marx declared that people who were educated, competent, and deserving of merit and advancement were unworthy of esteem. Instead, Marx demanded that all people should share the same income and advancement levels. He ignored market-based incentives toward excellence. He highlighted people's malaise, not excellence.\n\nThe DEI concept should ideally be altruistic, focusing on diversity and inclusion, which foster sincere diversity initiatives. Objectively viewed, DEI's current \"fruit\" reveals DEI as a selfish, communistic force infused with nefarious intentions. Far from fostering unity and flourishing for all, DEI reflects the destructive ideologies of Karl Marx.\n\nIntrinsic to his worldview, Marx was grotesquely vitriolic and hateful toward any notion of God. He emphatically declared his war against God. It's therefore unsurprising that his theories and schemes are all designed to steal, kill, and destroy. These are the hallmarks of what the thief Satan comes to do (John 10:10).\n\nAttempts to revise Karl Marx and his diabolical acts and schemes fail because socialism and his ultimate utopia, communism, are specifically designed to carry out principles that steal, kill, and destroy.\n\nTrue diversity efforts should be altruistic, moral, and ethical. A focus on diversity and inclusion, while wholly rejecting the demands of \"equity,\" can allow sincere diversity initiatives to once again flourish. Judging DEI on its current \"fruit\" means acknowledging it is selfish, communistic, and infused with evil schemes and intentions that reflect the avowedly demoniac Karl Marx.\n\nRegrettably, DEI does not reflect unity and cannot support the flourishing of all humankind."

      "text": "One of the things The Free Press has been doing since its inception is documenting and exposing how many of our most important institutions- medicine , the media , the law -are increasingly being captured by an ideology that is hollowing out their core functions.\n\nToday, John Sailer , a fellow at the National Association of Scholars, tells the story of how that's happening at American universities across the country .\n\nYou don't have to have ever stepped foot on a college campus to care about the revelations in today's piece. Because as we've seen again and again, what happens on campus doesn't stay there. It's just a preview of what's coming for the rest of us. -BW\n\nIn June 2020, Gordon Klein, a longtime accounting lecturer at UCLA, made the news after a student emailed him asking him to grade black students more leniently in the wake of the \"unjust murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.\"\n\nKlein's response was blunt. It stated in part:\n\nThanks for your suggestion in your email below that I give black students special treatment, given the tragedy in Minnesota. Do you know the names of the classmates that are black? How can I identify them since we've been having online classes only? Are there any students that may be of mixed parentage, such as half black-half Asian? What do you suggest I do with respect to them? A full concession or just half?\n\nHe went on:\n\nRemember that MLK famously said that people should not be evaluated based on the \"color of their skin.\" Do you think that your request would run afoul of MLK's admonition?\n\nThanks, G. Klein\n\nKlein's response enraged students. They organized a petition to remove him that quickly gained nearly 20,000 signatures, resulting in the professor being placed on leave and banned from campus. But the story got national attention, and a counter-petition signed by more than 76,000 people demanded his reinstatement. In less than three weeks, Klein was allowed to return to the classroom.\n\nYet his encounters with what UCLA calls Equity, Diversity and Inclusion were far from over.\n\nJust under a year later, Klein, the author of a textbook on ethics in accounting, was up for a merit raise. For the first time in his 40 years at UCLA, Klein told me he had to submit a statement on equity, diversity, and inclusion. UCLA had adopted this as a promotion requirement in 2019, and now demands that all faculty members express how they will advance these principles in their work, and how their mentoring and advising helps those \"from underrepresented and underserved populations.\"\n\nKlein inquired of the EDI office just what groups of students they meant. When they failed to reply, he wrote a dissent he made available to me, which reads in part:\n\n\"I find it abhorrent for the University to encourage faculty members to classify and prioritize students based on their group identities. I intend to continue helping all students equally, regardless of their backgrounds.\"\n\nAlthough his previous teaching evaluations were sterling, and he had received prior merit raises, this one was declined. Klein has brought suit against UCLA.\n\nThe struggle between Klein and UCLA represents a major shift in the mission of higher education in America.\n\nThe principles commonly known as \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI) are meant to sound like a promise to provide welcome and opportunity to all on campus. And to the ordinary American, those values sound virtuous and unobjectionable.\n\nBut many working in academia increasingly understand that they instead imply a set of controversial political and social views. And that in order to advance in their careers, they must demonstrate fealty to vague and ever-expanding DEI demands and to the people who enforce them. Failing to comply, or expressing doubt or concern, means risking career ruin.\n\nIn a short time, DEI imperatives have spawned a growing bureaucracy that holds enormous power within universities. The ranks of DEI vice presidents, deans, and officers are ever-growing-Princeton has more than 70 administrators devoted to DEI; Ohio State has 132. They now take part in dictating things like hiring, promotion, tenure, and research funding.\n\nMore significantly, the concepts of DEI have become guiding principles in higher education, valued as equal to or even more important than the basic function of the university: the rigorous pursuit of truth. Summarizing its hiring practices, for example, UC Berkeley's College of Engineering declared that \"excellence in advancing equity and inclusion must be considered on par with excellence in research and teaching.\" Likewise, in an article describing their \"cultural change initiative,\" several deans at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine declared : \"There is no priority in medical education that is more important than addressing and eliminating racism and bias.\"\n\nDEI has also become a priority for many of the organizations that accredit universities. Last year, the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, along with several other university accrediting bodies, adopted its own DEI statement, proclaiming that \"the rich values of diversity, equity and inclusion are inextricably linked to quality assurance in higher education.\" These accreditors, in turn, pressure universities and schools into adopting DEI measures.\n\nMuch of this happened by fiat, with little discussion. While interviewing more than two dozen professors for this article, I was told repeatedly that few within academia dare express their skepticism about DEI. Many professors who are privately critical of DEI declined to speak even anonymously for fear of professional consequences.\n\nThe Invention of DEI\n\nHow has this fundamental shift taken place? Gradually, then all at once.\n\nFor decades, university administrators have emphasized their commitment to racial diversity. In 1978, Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell delivered the court's opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , taking up the question of racial preferences in higher education. Powell argued that racial preferences in admissions-in other words, affirmative action-could be justified on the basis of diversity, broadly defined. Colleges and universities were happy to adopt his reasoning, and by the 1980s, diversity was a popular rallying cry among university administrators.\n\nBy the 2010s, as the number of college administrators ballooned, this commitment to diversity was often backed by bureaucracies that bore such titles as \"Inclusive Excellence\" or \"Diversity and Belonging.\" Around 2013, the University of California system-which governs six of the nation's top 50 ranked universities-began to experiment with mandatory diversity statements in hiring. Diversity statements became a standard requirement in the system by the end of the decade. The University of Texas at Austin in 2018 published a University Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan , which began to embed diversity committees throughout the university.\n\nThen came the Black Lives Matter demonstrations of 2020. The response on campus was a virtual Cambrian explosion of DEI policies. Any institution that hadn't previously been on board was pressured to make large-scale commitments to DEI. Those already committed redoubled their efforts. UT Austin created a Strategic Plan for Faculty Diversity, Equity, and Inclusivity , calling for consideration of faculty members' contributions to DEI when considering merit raises and promotion.\n\nWhite Coats For Black Lives, a medical student organization that calls for the dismantling of prisons, police, capitalism, and patent law, successfully petitioned medical schools around the country to adopt similar plans, including at UNC-Chapel Hill, Oregon Health & Science University, and Columbia University. In some cases, administrators even asked White Coats For Black Lives members to help craft the new plans.\n\nAll at once, policies that previously seemed extreme-like DEI requirements for tenure and mandatory education in Critical Race Theory -became widespread.\n\nSaturate the Campus\n\nThe upshot is that the entire experience of higher education-from earning a college degree to seeking a career in academia-now requires saturation in the principles of DEI.\n\nMany American college students are now required to take DEI, anti-racism, or social justice courses. At Georgetown, all undergraduates must take two Engaging Diversity courses. At Davidson College, the requirement goes under the title of Justice, Equality, and Community , which students can fulfill by taking courses like Racial Capitalism & Reproduction and Queer(ing) Performance. Northern Arizona University recently updated its general education curriculum to require nine credit hours of \"diversity perspectives\" courses, including a unit on \"intersectional identities.\"\n\nDEI is also becoming a de facto academic discipline. In 2021, Bentley University in Massachusetts created a DEI major . Last year, the Wharton School announced its introduction of a DEI concentration for undergraduates and a DEI major for MBA students.\n\nMeantime, the open faculty position listings at universities across the country illustrate how a focus on race, gender, social justice, and critical theory can be crucial to landing a job. Last year, the University of Houston-Downtown sought an instructor in Early Modern British Literature, including Shakespeare, with a preferred specialization in \"critical race studies.\" At Wake Forest University, an applicant for assistant professor of Spanish should be someone \"whose critical perspectives are linked to the experiences of groups historically underrepresented in higher education in ways that inform and influence their pedagogical approach.\" Williams College recently sought an assistant professor of German who works \"in the areas of migration, race and anti-racism, post- and decolonial approaches, disability, and/or memory studies.\"\n\nThese imperatives often come from the top. In May, the Board of Governors for California Community Colleges (CCC), the largest system of higher education in the country, decreed that every employee-faculty, staff, and administrators-must be evaluated for their \"diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\" competencies. Each district in the system ultimately decides how to enforce the new rule, but the Chancellor's Office released a list of recommended competencies. It suggested faculty create a curriculum that \"promotes a race-conscious and intersectional lens\" and advocate for \"anti-racist goals and initiatives.\"\n\nRay Sanchez, faculty coordinator of the academic success centers at Madera Community College, sent me a document published by the system that describes how to incorporate DEI into curricula. \"Take care,\" the document declares, \"not to 'weaponize' academic freedom and academic integrity as tools to impede equity in an academic discipline or inflict curricular trauma on our students, especially historically marginalized students.\"\n\nIt is telling that the CCC system warns against taking academic freedom too far-especially for the sake of avoiding \"curricular trauma.\" After all, a successful liberal education inevitably involves challenging students' unquestioned assumptions, an experience that is unsettling by design. Applying the language of trauma to this enterprise pathologizes learning itself.\n\nIn higher education, academic freedom is sacrosanct, a vital tool for facilitating the pursuit of truth. But now the CCC treats academic freedom with suspicion. \"If we need to be culturally responsive in the classroom, well, what does that look like? We have it right here,\" Matthew Garrett, professor of history and ethnic studies at the CCC's Bakersfield College, and a rare public critic of the system's new policy, told me about the document. He added, \"You can't weaponize academic freedom.\"\n\nIf you appreciate our reporting, become a subscriber today:\n\nA Radically New Definition of Racism\n\nSome DEI initiatives seem almost designed to create distrust, especially between faculty and students. In an article last year for City Journal , I wrote about the \"cultural change initiative\" taking place at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine. When describing their work, the program's creators asserted that it's important to accept that \"if we are White, we are a big part of the problem. We are part of the reason that structural racism imprisons and oppresses people of color every day, everywhere they go, and no matter what they do.\"\n\nThe program's creators also emphasized that when anyone on campus reports a concern about racism and bias, \"We unconditionally accept that what they are describing really happened and needs to be explored, addressed, and resolved.\" They acknowledge there can be multiple versions of a story, but assert that \"someone's lived experience of racism and bias is all we need to know about its impact on them, whether intended or not.\" They followed up this initiative with the Anti-Racist Transformation in Medical Education training program to help other medical schools emulate Mount Sinai. The first adopters included top schools such as Duke and Columbia.\n\nThe Mount Sinai program underscores a point that came up repeatedly when I spoke with faculty members for this article: Some claims, especially about race and racism, are treated as unassailable.\n\nJonathan Haidt, the coauthor of The Coddling of the American Mind and a professor of ethical leadership at New York University's Stern School of Business, has warned about this redefinition of racism-and about the rise of ideological groupthink in academia and in his field of social psychology in particular. Twelve years ago Haidt gave a keynote address at the annual convention of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology (SPSP), pointing out the trend toward groupthink and arguing it was bad for science.\n\nFast-forward to September 2022, the month Haidt announced his departure from SPSP, citing the organization's new diversity statement policy. For scholars to present their work at SPSP's annual convention, they now must submit a statement explaining how their talk advances the \"equity, inclusion, and anti-racism goals\" of the society.\n\n\"When SPSP specifically used the word 'anti-racism,' that's when I had to act. Because I read Ibram Kendi's work,\" said Haidt, referring to the author of 2019's How to Be an Antiracist . Kendi's work is the basis of much employment training both in academia and business. It popularized the notion that \"anti-racism\" requires embracing race-conscious policies and asserts that all racial disparities are, by definition, racist. \"Kendi demands a totalizing approach that means everything must be actively anti-racist, and if you're not actively anti-racist, you're racist,\" Haidt told me.\n\nIn other words, SPSP-one of the organizations where Haidt first expressed his concerns about ideological conformity-now mandates ideological conformity.\n\n'Fake Research and Fake Standards'\n\nIt's easy to imagine that DEI would find its natural home in the humanities. But disciplines such as engineering, medicine, and physics quickly are becoming bastions of DEI as well. Leaders from the Association of American Medical Colleges recently proclaimed that DEI \"deserves just as much attention from learners and educators at every stage of their careers as the latest scientific breakthroughs.\"\n\nThe federal government also is doing its part to infuse DEI into the sciences. The Department of Energy's Office of Science is the nation's largest sponsor of the physical sciences. It recently announced that all new research proposals must include its Promoting Inclusive and Equitable Research (PIER) Plan. To get a grant, scientists must describe how equity and inclusion are \"an intrinsic element to advancing scientific excellence in the research project.\"\n\nOne medical researcher at an elite institution who requested anonymity told me that grants for medical research increasingly use veiled ideological language that focuses on issues such as health equity and racial disparities. \"The answer is preordained: The cause of disparities is racism,\" he told me. \"If you find some other explanation, even if it's technically correct, that's problematic.\"\n\nThis fixation can have a stultifying effect on medical research, and eventually medical care, the researcher told me. \"We're abdicating our responsibility. We're creating fake research and fake standards, aligning ideology with medicine, and undermining our basic ability to engage in meaningful sensemaking.\"\n\nAnother physician-scientist at a top medical school also pointed out that an all-out focus on research that documents racial disparities crowds out other, more consequential areas of scientific research. \"In general, science is a zero-sum game with a relatively limited pot of resources,\" he told me. \"And therefore, it means that biological discovery, mechanisms of basic science, new insights, new molecules, don't get discovered because you have this other type of research going on.\"\n\nThe physician-scientist was concerned that an obsession with equity has shifted attention away from pursuing groundbreaking scientific breakthroughs that will benefit everyone. \"We are distributing more equitably therapies that largely don't work. We're still rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,\" he said. \"It's a very foolish tactic when the death rate from cancer is still as high as it is.\"\n\n'Morally Wrong and Incompatible with Scientific Inquiry'\n\nA growing number of universities, such as UCLA, where Gordon Klein ran into trouble, now consider their faculty members' contributions to DEI as a criterion for hiring, promotion, and tenure. UC Berkeley's rubric for evaluating DEI contributions, which is used by universities around the country, dictates a low score for a candidate who professes a desire to \"treat everyone the same.\"\n\nDiversity statements-short essays on job candidates' past efforts and future plans to advance DEI-have long been in vogue for hiring. And according to the American Association of University Professors' 2022 survey of tenure practices , 45.6 percent of large institutions surveyed had DEI criteria for tenure, and 35.5 percent were considering adding them. Only 18 percent didn't have and weren't considering them.\n\nTo boost faculty diversity (explicit racial preferences in hiring are illegal), many universities are resorting to a practice known as \"cluster hiring\"-that is, hiring multiple professors at once, across multiple departments. To increase the likelihood of hiring minority faculty members, cluster hiring initiatives often assess candidates' contributions to DEI as the first criterion.\n\nIn 2018, UC Berkeley launched a cluster hire across several life sciences departments. Of 893 qualified applicants, the hiring committee narrowed the pool to 214 based solely on the candidates' diversity statements. Finalists then were asked to describe their DEI efforts during their interviews. The initiative yielded eyebrow-raising results: The initial applicant pool was 53.7 percent white and 13.2 percent Hispanic. The shortlist was 13.6 white and 59.1 percent Hispanic.\n\nIn 2020, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began a $241 million cluster hiring grant program -specifying that the faculty hired must have \"a demonstrated commitment to promoting diversity and inclusive excellence.\" So far, it has awarded grants for hires at twelve institutions, including the University of South Carolina, Cornell University, and Florida State University.\n\nOne humanities professor told me that after his department creates a final group of candidates, \"a lawyer in the DEI office will make a determination as to whether this slate of candidates is diverse enough. If it's not diverse enough in their estimation, they can kick the slate back to the search committee.\" Professors across multiple disciplines told me this is standard practice. One said DEI officers have the power to simply cancel searches.\n\n\"If we've got this gaming of the hiring process across the board, so that the new generation of professors are that much more ideologically pure, these are the people who believe that dissident research shouldn't be given a voice at all,\" Adam Ellwanger, a professor of rhetoric at the University of Houston-Downtown, told me. He pointed out that these professors go on to conduct peer review and decide what scholarship gets published.\n\nLittle is being done to halt the intrusion of DEI into higher education. Academic jobs are perilously scarce for many disciplines, which encourages graduate students and young scholars to avoid rocking the boat at all costs. \"There's just a general fear that, if you push back, you'll be marked for being on the wrong side,\" one professor told me. \"There's no way to guard against how your colleagues will evaluate you for tenure in the future.\"\n\nAnd as allegiance to DEI has become a formal job requirement, even many senior faculty members remain silent out of a sense of self-preservation. As former dean of Harvard Medical School Jeffrey Flier told me, \"It is considered politically and socially tenuous to bring up the subject.\"\n\nStill, some are pushing back. In August, the Academic Freedom Alliance released a statement, coauthored by Flier, calling for an end to the practice of mandatory DEI statements.\n\n\"It is one thing for schools to take action against wrongful discriminatory conduct; institutions are under a legal as well as moral and pedagogical obligation to do that,\" the statement read. \"A very different and disturbing thing is monitoring beliefs by demanding pledges of allegiance to an array of policies that are often vague, frequently ambiguous, and invariably controversial.\"\n\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) has also issued numerous statements opposing DEI requirements that violate the First Amendment. The organization I work for, the National Association of Scholars , frequently publishes reports on DEI, serving as a watchdog on the issue.\n\nNYU's Jonathan Haidt hopes his resignation from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology will be a wake-up call for his fellow academics, but his outlook is pessimistic.\n\n\"It is morally wrong, but it's also incompatible with scientific inquiry, which requires total fidelity to the truth,\" Haidt told me of the DEI requirement that prompted his decision to leave.\n\n\"The way that institutions collapse is that they become structurally stupid. That means people can no longer object, they have to go along with the orthodoxy.\" Haidt said this isn't an issue just in his field of psychology. \"It's about the biggest problem facing our country-the collapse of our institutions.\"\n\nWhy only higher education? It is rampant in public schools, up and down the grade levels.\n\nThis DEI is simply what Marxism-Leninism was in the Soviet Bloc. Students all had to take courses in it, admission to universities was on an affirmative action  points system based on ancestry/origins, and of course one had to lie. Dissidents were dismissed, imprisoned, their children barred from higher education. Party faithful could get degrees for mediocre work, and there were many useless people supposedly working as professors, though also many very good people. The party mediocrities quickly departed the scene after Soviet Communism fell, the Marxist-Leninist institutes closed up shop. The dissidents took over, while generously allowing those ex-Communists not too tainted by the past to still take part in democratic politics (at least in Poland).\n\nXi Jinping Thought is now taught in China, together with all that I mentioned above.\n\nSome of he most influential critics of Soviet-style Communism were actually idealistic Communists who from within saw the hypocrisy and inhumanity of the system and rebelled, becoming dissidents. By analogy, I see black, female or gay dissidents as being those most likely to effectively expose the betrayal of civil rights ideals by the DEI Critical/Queer Theory complex in the Anglosphere. They are doing a great job already, but the simultaneous insanity on the Right in the US means that getting over the hump will take a longer time than it should. In normal times, these extreme and irrational movements should have no chance of wide acceptance.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "This article is taken from The Free Press ' s daily newsletter. To get the best of the news delivered to your inbox every morning, sign up here:\n\nReaders may remember John Sailer's recent Free Press story \" The DEI Rollback ,\" where he detailed how the tide is turning against the diversity, equity, and inclusion bureaucracy, especially in higher education. But that's not true for one major state school where DEI dogma is alive and well, John reports for us today:\n\nThe University of Nebraska-Lincoln's College of Engineering might sound like one of the last places in higher education where you'd expect to find evidence of DEI orthodoxy influencing big decisions. Nebraska is a red state and UNL is a public school. Plus, you'd expect hiring at an engineering school to be based on, well, scientific criteria.\n\nBut through a public records request, I reviewed every diversity recruitment report created by the school over the last four years. And I've discovered that even here, DEI has been central to hiring decisions.\n\nFor example, in 2020, when the school set out to hire a professor of National Defense/Computer Network Security, the search committee made its priority clear: each candidate's \"diversity\" score-assessing how well applicants understand things like \"many intersectional aspects of diversity\"-was given equal weight to factors like research and teaching experience.\n\nAnother search in 2021, for a professor of Big Data/Cybersecurity, stated: \"the weight of the 'diversity' scores were equal to the other scored areas that contributed to the candidate's overall score.\"\n\nAnd applicants have been ruled out for failing to clear DEI hurdles. According to one report, from 2021, \"a small number of candidates\" in a search for a professor of thermal sciences \"were eliminated based on absence or weak diversity statement.\" In another case that year, three applicants for a role in environmental engineering \"did not include diversity statements and were disqualified from the search.\"\n\nPer the college's diversity and inclusion plan , which is still in place, the reports carry high stakes: a search that fails to show \"a serious consideration\" of DEI-related issues risks being canceled, resulting in no hire at all.\n\nDiversity statement evaluations have long been criticized for their potential to enforce an orthodoxy on issues of race and gender, weeding out faculty with heterodox views. They raise serious questions of academic freedom-as well as First Amendment compliance .\n\nThe college's DEI statement evaluation rubric -also acquired through a records request-confirms these fears. The rubric dictates a high score for engineers who identify and discuss \"intersectional aspects of diversity\"-while punishing those who fail to \"distinguish inclusion from diversity.\"\n\nIn other words, even in Nebraska, chemical engineers and materials scientists must be fluent in the idiom of race consciousness.\n\nThe absurdity is transparent, which is why state university systems from North Carolina to Missouri to Wisconsin have abolished diversity statements. Even faculty at progressive universities have begun to push back . In Nebraska, the policy is alive and well-but that's something the state's lawmakers could easily fix.\n\nJohn Sailer is a senior fellow at the National Association of Scholars.

      "text": "Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS)-the largest school within the university, comprising half of all Harvard students-will no longer require \"diversity, inclusion, and belonging\" statements for faculty hiring. The news, first reported by The Boston Globe , is the latest indicator that elite universities are moving away from the ideological litmus tests that have come to dominate campus.\n\nThis follows the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's decision to end the controversial policy entirely, which I first reported on last month. It also comes after Harvard reinstated standardized testing in admissions in April.\n\n\"In external searches for faculty appointments, we have changed our process to request a broad statement of service instead of requiring a Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DIB) statement,\" Nina Zipser, FAS Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning, said in an email to faculty on Monday seen by The Free Press .\n\nThese revisions mark an incremental but real move away from a policy that represents the worst excesses of the DEI bureaucracy. In a statement, a Harvard spokesperson told me that the update means that the school will request \"broader and more robust service statements as part of the hiring process.\" These statements can include, but are not limited to, \"efforts to increase diversity, inclusion, and belonging.\"\n\nAt the time of MIT's decision, several prominent Harvard faculty members praised the move. Harvard's former president Larry Summers described diversity statements as \"morally bankrupt\" and \"an affront to almost every academic freedom value,\" and called on the college to follow MIT's lead.\n\nNow, prominent faculty members are calling on the entire university to follow FAS's lead. \"It's a cause for celebration that FAS has replaced the requirement for DEI statements with a requirement for 'service statements,' i.e., how candidates will contribute to their department, their university, and their professional community,\" Jeffrey Flier , the former dean of Harvard Medical School, told me in an email. \"The next step should be for this to be extended across all schools of the university.\"\n\nMembers of the Council on Academic Freedom at Harvard -led in part by Flier, and Steven Pinker-have now proposed a resolution urging the university as a whole to stop using diversity statements. These overdue changes have arrived because professors simply do not like the idea of being tested for their commitment to a cause unrelated to their academic work. The FAS's decision gives them all the more permission to say that out loud. Expect others to follow Harvard's lead.\n\nJohn Sailer is a senior fellow at the National Association of Scholars.

      "text": "\"Equity\" and mendacity could go hand in hand when there are political points to be scored.\n\nIn the last month, a Japanese airplane burst into flames on the tarmac after colliding with an American aircraft, a panel blew out of the side of an Alaska Airlines plane mid-air, and a cargo plane made an emergency landing in Miami after an engine malfunction caused it to spew flames in flight. Many worry that the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency that declares , \"Our continuing mission is to provide the safest, most efficient aerospace system in the world,\" has shifted its focus instead to Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI).\n\nFrom the beginning of his service as secretary of transportation, Pete Buttigieg made DEI a top priority . He's even created an Advisory Committee on Transportation Equity. And recent headlines claim the FAA is expanding a push to hire people with disabilities. Indeed, the list of disabilities they are considering includes those with hearing or vision loss, missing extremities, complete or partial paralysis, and, what may be most alarming to air travelers, \"severe intellectual disabilities\" and \"psychiatric disabilities.\"\n\nAs it turns out, the FAA's diversity initiatives included persons with disabilities as early as 2013. Recent incidents, however, conjured visions of confused and colliding planes misguided to their destinations by individuals too cognitively or psychiatrically impaired to assume the task of securing planes for flight, much less seeing them safely into the air and back to the ground.\n\nIf you go to the FAA's website to see what jobs they are trying to fill, you'll see this list . It's hard to imagine someone with a cognitive impairment able to manage any of them, but easy to see how someone would be alarmed by the prospect.\n\nThe FAA consoles us that extensive testing is done to verify qualifications , and that there is no reason for concern. But does that implicate the FAA in a bait and switch with people with disabilities?\n\nAny parent who has a child with a disability will tell you that rejection is too large a part of their life. Many grow up hearing that they don't qualify for this or that service, or for this or that program. It's very common, and sometimes even required, to be rejected by one program so you can be considered for another.\n\nPerhaps the FAA is trying to be sincerely generous to persons with disabilities. There is no reason to assume the worst. Yet it would be a grim thing if people with disabilities were being used by a federal agency to make a political point.\n\nOf course, the whole DEI movement is about gathering political power and then using it to divide people into assigned categories of oppressor and oppressed. Corporate DEI departments who promote incidental genetic traits over qualifications contribute to the discrimination they proclaim they want to defeat.\n\nWhen people hear the word \"disability,\" they likely see in their mind's eye an identity group symbolized by those signs for special parking places. That's the kind of broad-brush grouping that may be necessary for parking places but becomes dehumanizing when that impression is carried over into disregard for the individual needs and abilities of those who are living with physical, mental, or cognitive impairments.\n\nThe truth of disability is that the population is incredibly diverse in their unique gifts and talents. Not everyone can do everything, nor should everyone be expected to do everything-or given the hope or opportunity of doing everything. To attempt to create a world based on a utopian idea of equity is likely to give those with disabilities false hope-and ultimately another opportunity for rejection and humiliation.\n\nMark Bradford is the Fellow for Persons with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities at the Word on Fire Institute.\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

The Dean of Student Affairs at Bowdoin College just sent out this stupid crap:\n\nDear students,\n\nMany offices on campus have been working together since 2014 to launch the Lived Name Initiative, which lets students, faculty, and staff specify a name they go by that may differ from their legal name. Allowing people in our community to be known by the name they go by is an important part of creating an inclusive community.\n\nThis welcome change benefits people who may prefer to use a middle name, who have changed their marital status, who go by a name that aligns with their gender identity, or who use a different name in English than their native language or country of origin name.\n\nBeginning in January, your updated lived name will be shown as the default in Polaris, Blackboard, Workday, eBear, the online campus directory, in your Bowdoin email display name, and if you'd like, on your OneCard. That's a lot of system integration!\n\nAs students, you will have the opportunity to update your lived name on the Enrollment Form at the start of the spring semester. After that, you may update your lived name at any time in the Student Biographical Change Form available through the registrar's office.\n\nBowdoin will continue to store your legal name because it is required in a few areas of the College. For more information about where lived and legal names for students are used on campus and externally, as well as additional details, please visit the registrar office's Name Changes webpage.\n\nThis initiative is sponsored by the Office of the Dean for Academic Affairs, the Office of Inclusion and Diversity, Information Technology, and the Division of Student Affairs. On behalf of the sponsors, we see this as an important step in affirming an inclusive community.\n\nFor more information, please contact Peter Wiley or Kate Stern.\n\nBest regards,\n\nTim Foster\n\nDean of Student Affairs\n\nAffirming an inclusive community.

      "text": "Conservatives should not allow the concept of equity to be undermined by ideologues.\n\nOver the past decade or so, so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has become one of the most hotly debated topics in American political and social life. We have heard it used with increasing regularity in contexts ranging from human resources to highways .  It is ubiquitous on college campuses with their expansive-and growing-bureaucracies dedicated to it.\n\nWhile the first and last of these are fairly self-explanatory, the recent insertion of \"equity\" into the older and more familiar \"diversity and inclusion\" has caused both confusion and consternation.  Simplistic attempts to illustrate equity have met with challenges from both the right and left .\n\nBut what is equity?\n\nAs it is now commonly used, the term \"equity\" serves as something like a cross between an ideological buzzword and a political cudgel. Though often left undefined, equity has come to be associated with any number of progressive pieties on issues ranging from race to reproduction and beyond .\n\nThe response on the American right has tended to be a total rejection of the concept of equity, under the assumption that it is some kind of recent interpolation intended to overturn our constitutional heritage. To be sure, as it is commonly used, it does pose a serious threat to the rule of law and our Constitution. But rejecting the concept entirely is a mistake.\n\nEquity, rightly understood, is a concept with deep roots in the Western philosophical, political, and jurisprudential tradition.  More importantly, it is a concept that is essential to a just and prudent political order. Far from being an alien concept in Western philosophy, equity has been considered an integral aspect of justice by virtually every political and legal theorist.\n\nThere is an ancient Roman maxim that declares summum jus, summa injuria -plausibly rendered \"the extremity of the law is extreme injury.\" This maxim summarizes the legal concept that underlies equity, rightly understood.\n\nGreek and Roman legal theory distinguished between jus (law) and aequitas (equity). The distinction is rooted in the recognition that, at times, the law as written is ill-suited to render justice in a concrete circumstance, due to the peculiarities of the case. It recognizes that the letter of the law sometimes needs to be supplemented or corrected by common sense or natural law, thereby avoiding the \"extreme injury\" that can be caused by an overly zealous application of the written law.\n\nTo see why, it is helpful to return to Aristotle's account of equity ( epieikeia ) in his Nicomachean Ethics- perhaps the first philosophic articulation of the concept.\n\nIn the chapter examining the virtue of justice, Aristotle raises the question equity.  The equitable, he explains , presents a difficulty because though it is itself just, it \"is not legal justice, but a rectification of legal justice.\"\n\nHow so?\n\nBy their very nature , laws \"speak in general terms\" because lawmakers have to look to what ordinarily happens.  But generalities cannot be directly applied to the concrete circumstances of human conduct, because it is \"essentially irregular\". Even the best law construed by the wisest lawgiver would fail to render perfect justice, because the abstract and general nature of written law necessarily misses the concrete irregularities of human action.\n\nEquity strives to \"rectify the defect\" where the lawgiver's absolute pronouncement is insufficient to the task of rendering justice in a particular case.  Equity does not violate the principle of the law but tries to apply the law in the way that the lawmaker would find consistent with his intent.\n\nIn other words, for Aristotle, equity strives to uphold the spirit of the law, allowing the abstraction of the law to come into contact with the messiness of reality.  True equity does not overturn legal justice, but supplements it. Equity works to achieve the deepest aim of the law-rendering justice and upholding the common good-within the framework of the law. Rooted in this basic theoretical articulation, numerous other thinkers-including Cicero, St. Thomas Aquinas , Thomas More , and William Blackstone, among many others-took up the concept and further refined it.\n\nEquity is particularly associated with the English common law system, given the theoretical and practical advancements made by More and Blackstone.\n\nIn fact, for several hundred years, the English legal system had institutions specifically tasked with applying principles of equity to legal cases.  Consistent with the Aristotelian concept, these courts of equity were authorized to hear special appeals and apply remedies that were outside the scope of ordinary law, rooted in moral and common-sensical-rather than strictly legal-reasoning. This English system of law is the same system that ultimately gave rise to American constitutionalism , and, as such, our own Constitutional system is deeply rooted in it. (While most court systems have unified the law and equity functions , several states- including my own native Delaware -retain the separate court systems handed down from the English common law.)\n\nThere are three primary takeaways for conservatives from this account of equity.\n\nFirst: In practice, equity recognizes the inherent messiness of history and the contingency of human affairs, as well as the central role that the moral imagination and prudence serve in the achievement of justice. It recognizes that reality cannot be fitted to any pre-existing ideological scheme, because the abstract and universal will always fail to account for aspects of the concrete and particular. In this sense, equity stands in stark contrast to utopian theories of justice rooted in abstract ideologies determined to force reality-including the stubborn realities of human nature and society-into preconceived, rigid, and abstract patterns. Equity, in fact, is radically anti-utopian in its recognition that reality is far too complex to be forced into any narrow ideological straitjacket.  In the real world, any semblance of justice that might be attained requires a humble and prudent approach to human affairs.\n\nSecond: Because equity appeals to the moral imagination and common sense to rectify defects in the written law, it presents an inherent challenge to legal positivism and to progressive politics rooted in postmodern social theories of power. By recognizing that laws may need to be supplemented or corrected by reason and common sense, equity recognizes a standard against which those enactments can be judged. This, in turn, implies that justice is rooted in a kind of natural law.  In recognizing that there is a rational and intelligible natural law against which laws may be judged, the \" who-whom \" account of politics loses potency in favor of a politics rooted in a genuinely common good.\n\nFinally: When it is rightly understood, the concept of equity is not an illegitimate interpolation in our constitutional heritage or our received idea of justice. Equity as an aspect of justice possesses deep roots in our heritage-roots that cannot be cut without serious loss. Conservatives should no longer allow equity to be undermined by ideologues who would subvert it even as they claim it for their own. Instead, equity should be reclaimed as a fundamentally and essentially conservative principle.\n\nShaun Rieley is a Visiting Fellow at Hillsdale College's Van Andel Graduate School of Government in Washington, D.C., where he teaches courses on political philosophy and government.

      "text": "The \"Diversity and Inclusion\" industry rakes in billions of dollars every year.\n\nThe market for Diversity and Inclusion was estimated to be $7.5 billion in 2020, according to a report from GlobeNewswire earlier this year , and was projected to reach $15.4 billion by 2026. D&I \"puts companies in the position to hire the best employees from a diverse and often untapped candidate pool,\" declared Forbes earlier this year . \"Diverse companies make 19 percent more revenue than companies that don't value diversity,\" MSNBC reported in 2019 .\n\nAnd so, if you haven't experienced it already, get ready for the stultifying, inconsistent world of D&I (or DEI if you add \"equity\" to the mix) corporate training. And if you feel particularly fresh, consider raising some of the below objections to your local DEI consultant or trainer and study the response.\n\nOne popular video in DEI courses is a Danish TV2 video entitled \" All That We Share .\" In the video, groups from disparate walks of life-professional and working class, ethnic Danes and immigrants, rural and urbanite-stand in designated boxes. A moderator asks members of each group to come forward based on various questions: if they were a class clown, if they are a step-parent, if they like to dance. The goal, purportedly, is to demonstrate that everyone, despite their differences, share things in common that can break down barriers.\n\nAt the end of the video, the moderator asks if anyone is bi-sexual. A lone, long-haired blonde youth awkwardly steps forward, extending a tentative smile. After a brief pause, he is greeted with applause. A voiceover declares, \"and we, who acknowledge the courage of others.\"\n\nI wonder, though, is announcing who you would prefer to copulate with really that \"courageous\" in tolerant 2022, when people regularly suffer professional or personal consequences for protesting contemporary sexual mores? And if, on religious, philosophical, or scientific principles, a lonely soul refuses to applaud, how should we describe that person? Is going against the grain in that situation also courageous, or is it bigoted, since, well, they tell us so ?\n\nAnother popular video in DEI programs was produced by Heinekin, whose advertising arm has cleverly capitalized on finding that special commercial sweet spot: how to both sell their product and carry water for wokedom. In \" Worlds Apart: An Experiment ,\" three pairs of complete strangers are placed in a warehouse to cooperate on building a bar together. Each pair represents opposite ends of the political spectrum on one of three controversial issues: gender, sexuality, or climate change. Little surprise, those representing the conservative side of these issues are presented as intolerant and bigoted, the man acting as the archetypal patriarchal male declaring \"women need to remember that we need you to have our children.\"\n\nOnce each bar is complete-the pairs becoming friends in the process-each group watches videos of themselves describing their opinions on their designated hot-button issue. Don't worry, there is a \"happy\" ending: The man who had asserted there are only two genders admits the errors of his ways to the trans \"woman\"; the \"misogynist\" male clinks beers with the black female feminist and declares \"down with the patriarchy!\" The climate skeptic...well, Heinekin doesn't spend much time on him, perhaps because he didn't actually change his mind.\n\nAgain, the lesson is clear: DEI doesn't actually mean promoting a public square where different opinions, even if unpopular, are permitted. It means that those with the wrong opinions are given their opportunity to admit their error, repent, and join the revolution.\n\nCan you even imagine the Heinekin commercial ending with the straight male, perhaps an evangelical, saying to the trans person: \"You were created in the image of God, and your decisions are an offense against nature and harmful to yourself. But God loves you and is calling you to repent of your sins\"?\n\nSpeaking of nature, DEI programs explain that biases are natural, a result of evolution . Our prehistoric ancestors needed bias, we're told, in order to accurately identify friend from foe. How we learned this truth from prehistory is not explained, given our inability to conduct controlled experiments on people who died more than 7,000 years ago, or that psychological analysis on prehistoric humans is a bit harder than understanding, say, their burial practices or use of primitive tools. Anyway, the point is that biases were needed for man's survival.\n\nNevertheless, DEI instructors tell us, we must learn to transcend these biases. We tend to make judgments about people based on their physical features, sex, attire, or behavior. But, we are told, such judgments are bigoted, misogynist, and cisnormative.\n\nYet if those judgments are based on some evolutionary process that enabled man's survival , why, exactly, would we want to dispense with them? Isn't survival good? Isn't evolution supposed to be good?\n\nDiversity specialist Joe Gerstandt , frequently cited in DEI courses, notes : \"Diversity is not an agenda. Diversity is a natural byproduct of human beings interacting with each other. Any time you have two or people together, you have diversity.\" Yet if that's the case, it's odd that academia, corporations, and government agencies so aggressively promote DEI. One wouldn't think we'd need to spend billions of dollars to engender something natural . Then again, the DEI industry makes for good living -the average DEI consultant earning more than $80,000 a year .\n\nGerstandt claims that diversity is not only the right thing, but necessary to facilitate professional success. We don't want to steamroll over people and coerce everyone into uniformity, he says, but encourage healthy tension that engenders energy and creativity. It is, in a crude form, a manifestation of the Hegelian dialectic, in which thesis and antithesis clash to form a synthesis, thus propelling forward the positivist vision of human history and technological progress.\n\nThough, of course, some opinions are not welcome in the technocratic model promoted by Gerstandt and other DEI ideologues. Certainly not \"traditional\" (read: archaic) beliefs about gender or sexuality. One's gender and sexuality, like our race, are supposedly so intrinsic to our sense of self that to question or resist DEI doctrine on them is equivalent to fascism . Questioning and resisting, say, traditional gender norms, alternatively, is highly encouraged.\n\nAnd so we see the supreme irony of the DEI regime that now permeate our nation's institutions: a self-described multiculturalist movement that seeks to impose a flat monoculture based on progressive sexual, gender, and racial values. But perhaps that is only my white, cisgender fragility speaking.\n\nCasey Chalk writes about religion and culture issues for The American Conservative and is a contributing editor for the New Oxford Review .

      "text": "Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging: A new name for the same game\n\nArizona State University rebrands 'Inclusive Communities,' expecting the public not to notice that the same divisive content and Marxist ideology remain intact.\n\nIs DEI really on its way out at American universities? Don't be fooled. While many institutions claim to have abandoned diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, they have often rebranded them, continuing the same practices under new names. The values taught in these programs are so deeply ingrained among faculty and administrators that only a fundamental overhaul of American universities can offer an education free from Marxist conflict theory or John Money's gender ideology.\n\nThe Republican landslide victory gave former President Donald Trump and Congress a mandate for change. Within two days, Trump released a video outlining his plan to reshape American universities. He aims to tackle student loans and tuition costs - which rise in direct proportion to the availability of student loans - and to threaten the accreditation of universities that teach \"critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content.\" However, these universities will likely shuffle or rename that material instead of eliminating it.\n\nIs DEI on its way out? Not without fundamental reform of American universities. Is that reform possible? Yes.\n\nHow do I know? I am a tenured professor of philosophy and religion at Arizona State University, and I am suing the university over its mandatory DEI employee training. The Goldwater Institute represents me. Arizona law prohibits using taxpayer funds for classes or training that promote racial blame, yet ASU's \"Inclusive Communities\" training does precisely that. From inside the system, I have seen faculty use university time to denounce Trump, call his supporters evil, and plot ways to keep their favored curriculum alive despite legislative scrutiny. ASU's employee training is just one example.\n\nThe university claims it no longer offers DEI training, now calling it \"DEIB training,\" where the \"B\" stands for \"belonging.\" This rebranding allows administrators to publicly assert that they have abandoned DEI training, expecting the public to believe it without further investigation. However, screenshots I have shared on my Substack reveal that DEIB covers the same material as DEI. Additionally, the Goldwater Institute has posted the transcripts from ASU's \"Inclusive Communities\" training on its website as part of our court case.\n\nHow common is this practice across universities? A quick glance at their websites often reveals the answer. In some cases, DEI or DEIB training materials are hidden behind password-protected systems, requiring current employees to access and share them publicly. It's unlikely there has been a widespread shift away from Marxist conflict theory and racial blame toward an emphasis on the American ideal that all people are created equal and endowed with the same rights.\n\nProfessors and administrators remain the same individuals, with the values they held before the second Trump election. Instead, these ideas are simply being taught under different names.\n\nTake, for example, ASU's sustainability course, a requirement for the university's 180,000 students. At first glance, the course appears to focus on pollution and global warming. But its curriculum includes lessons on social justice and, unexpectedly, a section advising students on where to shop. It concludes with: \"And now watch this video from Starbucks.\" Yes, ASU's students are required to watch a video from Starbucks. And where are the Marxist professors who claim to oppose big business? They remain silent because the corporation is promoting their ideological agenda.\n\nIn the latest development, ASU's attorneys argued that because the required training begins with a statement advising participants not to feel blame, the university can say anything afterward.\n\nConsider the logic: If someone says, \"I don't intend to drive drunk tonight, so do not construe any of my actions as drunk driving,\" would that grant them a valid defense if they do drive drunk? Could a thief say, \"I do not intend to make anyone feel as if I am stealing from them\" and then take whatever he wants?\n\nSimply declaring in advance that you do not intend to break the law does not grant immunity from legal consequences. Telling white people at ASU that the university does not intend to make them feel blame does not justify subsequent discrimination with a shrug of, \"I told you not to feel that way.\" Think of an abusive spouse who professes love before committing abuse. It's a disturbing argument, and whoever made it should be ashamed. ASU risks becoming known as an anti-white, anti-heterosexual institution.\n\nYet this is the rationale a room full of Ph.D.s and J.D.s produced. Even a humble philosophy professor can see its flaws. Why not simply end the required training and stop discriminating based on skin color? The only plausible explanation is that ASU is so ideologically entrenched that this straightforward solution never occurred to the administration. Instead, the university escalates its DEI \"inclusiveness\" training rather than removing the modules that target whiteness and heteronormativity.\n\nIn the next stage of our case against Arizona State University, administrators will testify under oath. The university's spokesman has denied the existence of required DEI training, questioned my standing to bring the lawsuit, and insisted we have no right to feel discriminated against. What will they say in court? Potential students are watching to see how ASU conducts itself.\n\nIs DEI on its way out? Not without fundamental reform of American universities. Is that reform possible? Yes, I believe so. We are witnessing a shifting era, as more students reject DEI and openly demand changes on campus. Parents are also scrutinizing these curricula and exploring alternatives to DEI-heavy institutions. Meanwhile, enrollment in the humanities - where DEI often runs deepest - remains abysmal, suggesting that the current model is unsustainable, despite ASU's talk of \"sustainability.\"\n\nUniversities' persistent use of new labels like \"DEIB\" shows they have not truly embraced reform. Instead, they recycle the same divisive ideologies under different names, hoping the public will not notice. Real change requires sustained pressure from parents, students, accreditors, and lawmakers to hold universities accountable. We must demand transparency, champion an education based on equality and intellectual rigor, and end the misuse of taxpayer dollars to push ideologies that divide rather than unite. The era of unchecked DEI dominance is nearing its conclusion - if we stand firm and see reform through.\n\nOwen Anderson"

      "text": "DEI-vestment: University of Florida sheds 'inclusion' for innovation\n\nThe Sunshine State is now the test case of whether anti-DEI laws can have a meaningful effect in turning back these neo-racist programs.\n\nThe University of Florida boldly advanced to the front of the academic line last week by closing its DEI office. Diversity, equity, and inclusion is the ideology that that depicts an America locked into a permanent struggle of the oppressed against their oppressors, with African-Americans in the starring role as the forever oppressed and the LGBTQ+ contingent in the lead supporting role.\n\nPerhaps what the University of Florida just did could be called DEI-vestment. It definitely has a financial component. The university says it will now reallocate about $5 million per year that it had previously earmarked for racial shakedowns, i.e. DEI personnel and programs.\n\nEven if the administrative apparatus is gone at the University of Florida, a good many of its supporters and former employees remain.\n\nWhile the University of Florida deserves high praise for its initiative, it didn't come up with this reform all on its own. Florida's State Board of Education voted in January to eliminate DEI programs in 28 state colleges. And in November, the board of governors of the state's university system called for the same rescission at Florida's 12 public universities. These bureaucratic bodies acted at the urging of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is an outspoken opponent of the DEI ideology.\n\nMost of these educational institutions have been slow-walking their compliance or looking for ways to evade their legal responsibility to amend their policies. The University of Florida under its president, former U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, was simply the first to step up. The immediate result was the elimination of 13 positions, including that of chief diversity officer. That office alone had a budget of more than $400,000 in the 2022-23 academic year.\n\nIf I may offer some free advice to Sasse: Dig deeper. Eliminating those 13 positions is a fine start, as is the ending of 15 other DEI-based \"administrative appointments.\" The translation of that second category is faculty members who get paid extra for their DEI work, which, one suspects, consist mostly of fitting into a valued identity group that the DEI chiefs wanted to be more conspicuous on campus.\n\nBut DEI on most campuses is something like the green anacondas and other exotic snakes that have found a home in Florida's inland waters and proliferated there, throttling the life out of native species. The DEI anaconda, like its reptile brethren, hides in the recesses and isn't easily done away with. Even if the administrative apparatus is gone at the University of Florida, a good many of its supporters and former employees remain. Will they content themselves with playing by the rules of civil rights law and the university's legitimate educational mission? Sasse should keep his eyes open.\n\nThis story matters because many states have passed laws or taken other steps to uproot DEI programs in their public colleges and universities. Bills have been introduced in 33 states and have become laws in 13 of them. The University of Florida is now the test case of whether such laws can have a meaningful effect in turning back these neo-racist and ideology-driven programs.\n\nProponents of such reform face not only the careerists who staff the programs but much of the higher education establishment. The mere existence of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education testifies to how well established DEI is, and naturally this association is summoning its allies to the cause.\n\nDefenders of DEI argue that \"free speech\" is trampled if DEI is defunded. This is especially notable since one of the major activities of DEI offices is the suppression of everyone else's free speech.\n\nPeter Wood"

      "text": "Whitlock: Texans coach Lovie Smith latest black victim of diversity, inclusion, and equity cult\n\nShotgun marriages don't work, especially in modern America. We have too many options, too much easily accessible temptation to stick with a marriage we don't believe in.\n\nAsk the Houston Texans. Yesterday, they ended their second straight shotgun marriage hours after completing the regular season, divorcing themselves from head coach Lovie Smith less than a year after hiring him.\n\nWhen you're a billionaire, it's not cheaper to keep her.\n\nThe NFL makes all of its employees sign a prenuptial agreement, a contract that limits the divorce settlement. Cal McNair, the owner of the Texans, would rather cut Smith a $15 to $20 million check than continue in a relationship he doesn't believe has a real future. The Texans did the exact same thing a year ago, when they decided to annul their marriage to David Culley, another coach they wed quickly with no real conviction.\n\nThis is the consequence of the racial politics that corporate media foisted upon the NFL and that the league office adopted without pushback. Neither Smith nor Culley got the Houston job because management believed they were the best candidate. Smith and Culley were chosen largely because of their skin color, pressure from Roger Goodell and his top lieutenant, Troy Vincent, and the NFL's desire to avoid being called racist over its treatment of black coaches.\n\nHouston was guilt-tripped into hiring Smith and Culley. Guilt can get a man the job, but it won't allow him to keep that job. You think Cal McNair feels sorry for Smith and Culley after cutting multi-million-dollar severance checks? No way. McNair feels like he did Smith and Culley favors. He did.\n\nCulley was a career-long NFL assistant. He was 66 when he landed his first head coaching job. The longtime receivers coach was working as the passing game coordinator for the Baltimore Ravens when the Texans gave him the job.\n\nPassing game coordinator for Lamar Jackson's Baltimore Ravens? That's like becoming the CEO of Weight Watchers after being the vegetables coordinator for Lizzo.\n\nNo, the Texans gifted Culley the job. Everybody knew it, including the players in the Houston locker room. A football locker room is where false narratives die. Things that sound good on Twitter or during a woke ESPN rant often sound like hot garbage in a locker room where players just want to win games, and they don't really care about the color of their head coach.\n\nCulley inspired no one. The Texans went 4-13 last year. Culley offered no unique strategic advantage or leadership.\n\nYears ago, Lovie Smith offered a unique strategic advantage and impactful leadership. He was an expert at Tony Dungy's Tampa 2 defense, and Smith mimicked the quiet strength and poise of his mentor. Smith had a strong, nine-year run with the Chicago Bears, winning three division titles and one NFC championship.\n\nHe parlayed that into a two-year stint in Tampa and five seasons at the University of Illinois. His last winning season as a head coach was a decade ago in 2012 - his final season in Chicago.\n\nLovie is 64 now. He's lost his magic. The Texans hired him to satisfy the race-baiters in the media. It's a recipe for failure.\n\nYou can't lead 60 men in a locker room when everyone knows you got hired because Roger Goodell, Troy Vincent, and ESPN talking heads forced ownership to hire you.\n\nGuilt and racial idolatry are powerful forces on Twitter. The same woke players tweeting out \"Black Lives Matter\" act completely differently inside a locker room. They want to be led by dynamic coaches of any color.\n\nThe media race-baiters have emasculated black coaches. They've turned them all into sympathy hires. Everyone, including the black players, is suspicious of a black head coach's qualifications and competence. That's the consequence of the pervasive diversity, equity, and inclusion movement. It's 10 times more damaging than affirmative action. That's why I call it D.I.E. It's the death of black male excellence.\n\nD.I.E. will not produce more successful black head coaches or leaders in other industries. D.I.E. creates figurehead jobs for black and white women and members of the LGBTQ community. If it doesn't already, every NFL and NBA franchise will have a woman or gay person running its diversity, inclusion, and equity group.\n\nThat's the real endgame to all of this insanity. It has nothing to do with producing successful leadership of heterosexual black men. It's going to produce more shotgun marriages headed for failure. It's going to produce more young black men who feel like they're owed an opportunity rather than young men looking to create opportunities for themselves.\n\nNFL ownership doesn't have a problem with the color of Brian Flores' skin. It has a problem with his attitude and the attitude of a generation of young people who feel entitled. The world doesn't owe men - regardless of color - anything.\n\nVictims are not leaders. The people trying to shame employers into a job are not leaders. They're cowards.\n\nIf Lovie Smith is a victim of anything, it's the perception created by the diversity, inclusion, and equity proponents that black men as weak and unqualified.\n\nJason Whitlock\n\nBlazeTV Host"

      "text": "Caitlin Clark's NCAA Tournament will be ruined by diversity, equity, and inclusion\n\nThe women's college basketball establishment must root against what's in the best interest of the sport to stay loyal to its destructive agenda.\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion are the biggest threats facing Caitlin Clark and the Iowa Hawkeyes in the NCAA Tournament\n\nIt's not Angel Reese or JuJu Watkins. Or even Dawn Staley's undefeated South Carolina Gamecocks. It's DEI ideology, the sum of allegedly anti-racist brainwashing policies and mindset that rules academia.\n\nThe selection committee should have drawn up brackets that made a Dream Teams Final Four a possibility. Instead, the committee focused on DEI.\n\nDEI persuaded the 12-member NCAA selection committee to hand Clark and the Hawkeyes the most difficult Final Four path in women's basketball.\n\nThe committee - Lisa Dickerson, Derita Dawkins, Denee Barracato, Jill Bodensteiner, Jenny Bramer, Amanda Braun, Amy Folan, Alex Gary, Lizzie Gomez, Josh Heird, Jill Shields, and Lynn Tighe - placed Clark in the same bracket as Kansas State, UCLA, and LSU, giving the second-ranked Hawkeyes the most difficult draw of the tournament.\n\nIowa has played Kansas State three times in the past two seasons. The Hawkeyes have lost twice. The fourth-seeded Wildcats feature arguably the best post player in the country in 6-foot-6 senior Ayoka Lee. Iowa and Kansas State will likely meet in the Sweet 16. If the Hawkeyes get past KSU, odds are good that UCLA's 6-foot-7 Lauren Betts or LSU and Angel Reese will await them in the Elite Eight. LSU, of course, is the defending national champion. The Tigers beat Iowa in last year's title game.\n\nThe Hawkeyes struggle with size and physical play. The selection committee stacked Iowa's region with big, physical teams.\n\nThis makes zero sense unless you understand diversity, equity, and inclusion. Before I connect the dots, let me add one more piece of context.\n\nWhy is it important for Clark and Iowa to advance to the Final Four?\n\nIt should be obvious. Clark has single-handedly carried women's college hoops to a place of unprecedented relevance and importance. She's the Tiger Woods of the sport. She's must-see TV. Television ratings for women's basketball have skyrocketed this year as Clark chased scoring records and performed a female impersonation of Steph Curry.\n\nIf Clark, Reese, USC's freshman sensation JuJu Watkins, and Coach Staley's South Carolina squad all reached the Final Four, the women's Final Four would likely draw a bigger audience than the men's tournament. If Clark fails to reach the Final Four, the audience and relevance are cut in half, if not more.\n\nThe selection committee should have drawn up brackets that made a Dream Teams Final Four a possibility.\n\nInstead, the committee focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion, which is just a fancy configuration of words that means \"punish white people.\"\n\nClark is white. Her coach, Lisa Bluder, is white. Most of Clark's teammates are white. Iowa is seen as the white Cinderella of women's college basketball. Liberal sports fans prefer Staley or Reese over Clark. They don't want Cinderella making it back to the ball. USA Today published a piece about the importance of black players being the face of women's college basketball. A white woman wrote the article.\n\nYou cannot rise as an administrator in women's college athletics without being a devout liberal and proponent of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The women's selection committee is a confederacy of DEI-believing liberals. It's a group of athletics directors and deputy athletics directors who promote DEI.\n\nThey demonstrate their \"anti-racism\" by being racist against white people.\n\nThat's how Iowa received the toughest draw in the tournament. The well-intentioned selection committee bent over backward proving it did not favor Clark and Iowa. It did that by punishing Clark and Iowa.\n\nThe committee would rather the women's tournament underachieve in terms of relevance than risk giving Iowa an easy path to the Final Four. Giving Iowa an easy path is what makes the most sense for women's college basketball.\n\nClark is leaving the NCAA for the WNBA after this season. Women's college basketball has one chance to cash in on the Caitlin Clark phenomenon. Yes, she advanced to the championship game a year ago. But that run caught the public by surprise. We had barely heard of Clark last season. This year, she's been the biggest star in all of college athletics. She's 1979 Larry Bird and Magic Johnson rolled into a female package.\n\nIt would be a tragedy if she doesn't make the Final Four.\n\nMost of the women's college basketball establishment is rooting against Clark. They're hardcore leftists. Clark is the wrong color. She's heterosexual. They have to root against what's in the best interest of the sport to stay loyal to their destructive diversity, equity, and inclusion agenda.\n\nMany of the referees officiating the women's games are slaves to DEI, too.\n\nIf I had to bet, Clark and the Hawkeyes will get bounced from the tournament before the Final Four.\n\nJason Whitlock\n\nBlazeTV Host"

      "text": "Southern Baptist Leaders Release Secret Accused Abuser List\n\nShare This article\n\nIn response to an explosive investigation, top Southern Baptists have released a previously secret list of hundreds of pastors and other church-affiliated personnel accused of sexual abuse.\n\nThe 205-page database was made public late Thursday. It includes more than 700 entries from cases that largely span from 2000 to 2019.\n\nIts existence became widely known Sunday when the independent firm, Guidepost Solutions, included it in its bombshell report detailing how the Southern Baptist Convention's Executive Committee mishandled allegations of sex abuse, stonewalled numerous survivors and prioritized protecting the SBC from liability.\n\nExecutive Committee leaders Rolland Slade and Willie McLaurin, in a joint statement, called publishing the list \"an initial, but important, step towards addressing the scourge of sexual abuse and implementing reform in the Convention.\"\n\n\"Each entry in this list reminds us of the devastation and destruction brought about by sexual abuse,\" they said. \"Our prayer is that the survivors of these heinous acts find hope and healing, and that churches will utilize this list proactively to protect and care for the most vulnerable among us.\"\n\nThe Guidepost report, released after a seven-month investigation, contained several explosive revelations. Among them: D. August Boto, the committee's former vice president and general counsel, and former SBC spokesman Roger Oldham kept their own private list of abusive ministers. Both retired in 2019. The existence of the list was not widely known within the committee and its staff.\n\n\"Despite collecting these reports for more than 10 years, there is no indication that (Oldham and Boto) or anyone else, took any action to ensure that the accused ministers were no longer in positions of power at SBC churches,\" the report said.\n\nThe Executive Committee did not make additions to the published list, but their attorneys did redact several entries as well as the names and identifying information of survivors and others unrelated to the accused, Thursday's joint statement said.\n\nThey made public \"entries that reference an admission, confession, guilty plea, conviction, judgment, sentencing, or inclusion on a sex offender registry,\" and expect some of the redacted entries on the list to be made public once more research is done. The list also includes Baptist ministers that are not affiliated with the SBC.\n\nSurvivors and advocates have long called for a public database of abusers . The creation of an \"offender information system\" was one of the key recommendations in the report by Guidepost, which was contracted by the Executive Committee after delegates to last year's national meeting pressed for an outside investigation.\n\nAlso in the report was a shocking allegation that Johnny Hunt, a Georgia-based pastor and former SBC president, sexually assaulted another pastor's wife during a beach vacation in 2010. Hunt has disputed the allegation, saying in a statement that he has \"never abused anybody.\"\n\nHe resigned May 13 as senior vice president of evangelism and leadership at the North American Mission Board, the SBC's domestic missions agency. On Wednesday, NAMB leaders announced changes to address the issue including committing to investigate abuse accusations and creating an Abuse Prevention and Response Committee to assess and strengthen existing policies and procedures.\n\nAlso in the wake of the report's release, survivors have been calling in information about abuse allegations to the Executive Committee, Guidepost and members of a task force set up to oversee the firm's investigation, according to a joint statement from the three entities.\n\nA hotline is now open for survivors, or someone on their behalf, to report abuse allegations: 202-864-5578 or SBChotline@guidepostsolutions.com. Callers will be provided with care options and connected with an advocate, the statement said.\n\nGuidepost will maintain the hotline and keep the information confidential, but will not be looking into the allegations. The joint statement described the hotline as a \"stopgap measure for survivors\" until delegates can pass reforms during this year's national meeting scheduled for June 14-15 in Anaheim, California.\n\nThe task force expects to make its formal motions based on the Guidepost report public next week. Those recommendations will then be presented for a vote in Anaheim.\n\nShare This article\n\nYou are signing up to receive general newsletters from CBN.

But some Australian workplaces have missed the memo, with staff still being subjected to mind-numbing cultural awareness sessions on 'unconscious bias' and 'microaggressions'.\n\nMajor corporations need to cease with those vacuous, Orwellian declarations about 'inclusion' and concentrate on customer service instead of exploiting staff with minority characteristics for marketing purposes.\n\nInstead of focusing on merit, the DEI agenda is really about having an unhealthy fetish for certain fashionable minority groups without really addressing genuine cases of bigotry like age discrimination.\n\nThe idea that members of a minority group - whether that be based on race or sexuality - need a so-called 'ally' is also downright patronising.\n\nIt's simply demeaning to suggest individuals, because of their demographic status, are somehow too weak for speak for themselves and therefore need to be treated like children who need to be singled out.\n\nNot all mass produced fashions adopted from the United States, that saturate many aspects of Australian life, are worth keeping including 'diversity, equity and inclusion' (pictured are revellers at Sydney's 2023 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras)\n\nDEI also divides up members of minority groups between those who want to use their minority status to get promoted at work and be visible, and those who are more concerned about their privacy and believe such characteristics to be irrelevant.\n\nThe idea of highlighting immutable characteristics like race, ethnicity and sexuality is anathema to the concept of merit where the best man or woman is hired or promoted.\n\nIt would be considered to be politically far-right for white, heterosexual employees in an Australian workplace to establish a specialist network, and that would surely alienate colleagues who don't fit those descriptions. Hardly inclusive.\n\nYet, apparently in the interests of 'equality', staff are forming groups based on race and sexuality.\n\nEmphasising the fact someone is gay or from an ethnic minority also creates the impression, among other colleagues, that they are only being promoted for public relations reasons or to help a chief executive have something to add to their résumé as a so-called champion of inclusion.\n\nAnd it also discriminates against minority employees who simply don't want to talk about their personal characteristics, and would prefer to just get on with their job.\n\nIt's also illegal to ask someone in a job interview about their race or sexuality yet Australia's biggest corporations are actively promoting DEI policies because it's trendy.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank, Australia's biggest home lender, declared it has a  'commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion'.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank, Australia's biggest home lender, declared it has a 'commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion' (pictured is a Brisbane bank branch)\n\nThe public is cynical about the banks so in a bid to have a feelgood agenda, CBA has an 'LGBTIQ+ and ally network' known as Unity that is apparently designed to 'advocate a culture of inclusion and respect regardless of sex, sexuality, gender and expression'.\n\nAirline Virgin has Pride Flights for marketing purposes while rival Qantas has an Illuminate staff network 'to facilitate communication between our LGBTQI+ employees and their allies'.\n\nMining giant BHP has a Jasper program to 'drive a safe, inclusive and supportive work environment for everyone by providing advice on ways to reduce bias and make sure LGBT+ people are respected and valued irrespective or their sexual or gender identity'.\n\nSurely, who someone gets intimate with in the bedroom is a private matter that doesn't need to be mentioned in a workplace.\n\nCommBank, which supported the failed Voice referendum in 2023, also has a Yana Budjari network that 'supports First Nations people'.\n\n'This network empowers our people to connect meaningfully with Indigenous peoples, programs and communities,' it says.\n\n'It's also a safe space for our First Nations people to come together, support each other, discuss community affairs and develop their understanding of the people power across the company.'\n\nCBA also has a 'Mosaic' group described as 'our cultural inclusion employee-led network'.\n\n'Diversity, equity and inclusion' policies in workplaces, for example, have proven to be divisive both here and in America, where they originated from (pictured are Aboriginal and Palestinian flags at Sydney's Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras)\n\nColleagues with things in common can always connect outside of work hours without this being an officially sanctioned workplace policy, based on nothing more than sexual orientation or ethnicity.\n\nBut the DEI groups at big corporations have demonstrated the failure of identity politics where some minority groups are considered more worthy than others.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank's 'connecting through inclusion' website says little about older workers despite having an Advantage network to cater for staff 'no matter what age or life stage our people are going through'.\n\nBut it has no pictures on its website to illustrate older staff and make them feel 'included' and visible, even though an Australian Human Rights Commission survey found 58 per cent of older workers searching for work experienced age discrimination.\n\nMore than a quarter of respondents over 50 in this survey reported experiencing age discrimination, and gay and ethnic minority employees would be affected too as they aged.\n\nThe human resources industry is focused on other matters, apparently.\n\nThe Australian HR Institute last year held a DEI 'belonging, inclusiveness, impact' seminar where 10 out of 14 speakers listed their gender pronouns on their biography to show their support for transgender ideology.\n\nThe United States, the birthplace of the DEI movement, is having second thoughts about the DEI agenda.\n\nMotorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson in August last year announced it no longer had minority-owned supplier goals and would cease with social training for staff.\n\nRetailer Walmart, beer maker Molson Coors, car giant Ford, tractor manufacturer John Deere, home improvement chain Lowe's and whiskey distiller Brown-Forman are also scaling back their involvements in diversity programs.\n\nIt's time for DEI, nothing more than a cynical public relations exercise, to be ditched for good.\n\nEmployers can ensure staff aren't discriminated against, on the basis of birth characteristics, without having to seek public validation via DEI policies.\n\nAustralia has more serious labour market issues to deal with like a productivity crisis, so big corporations should be focusing on that and getting more value for shareholders instead of succumbing to the latest activist trend.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion needs to be scrapped for good.\n\nThat way, a true meritocracy can flourish, making characteristics like race, ethnicity and sexuality irrelevant so the best man or woman gets ahead in their chosen career.\n\nLet's get toxic and divisive politics out of the workplace.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe

These grossly overpaid roles need to be scrapped.'\n\nReform MP Rupert Lowe posted on X: 'We must scrap the licence fee, make it a subscription service and let the people decide - suck the poison out.'\n\nThe Head of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging will be in charge of creating 'an inclusive workplace culture' (Pictured: BBC Director-General Tim Davie)\n\nA BBC source said the hybrid post would consolidate two roles in the diversity and inclusion team, which is part of its HR department (Pictured: The BBC building)\n\nA BBC source said the hybrid post, which is 35 hours a week, would consolidate two roles in the diversity and inclusion team, which is part of its HR department.\n\nIt comes as disgraced broadcaster Huw Edwards has been 'unwilling' to pay back the £200,000 salary he pocketed between his arrest and resignation, a BBC top boss has revealed.\n\nChairman Samir Shah admitted today that the corporation has not been able to recover any salary as yet from the former BBC star, who was convicted of downloading child sex abuse images last year, and described the situation as 'quite frustrating'.\n\nLast year, Edwards, 63, was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after he admitted to having indecent images of children .\n\nAfter his guilty plea in July, the BBC asked him to return his salary, which he was paid during the period following his arrest in November 2023 until he resigned in April 2024.\n\nAsked if they have been able to recover any salary from Edwards during the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Tuesday, Dr Shah said: 'We have not... We've obviously asked, and we've said it many times, but he seems unwilling.'\n\nAnd in another controversy for the BBC, A Hamas leader's teenage son who narrated the BBC's Gaza documentary has warned the corporation he holds it responsible if 'anything happens' to him.\n\nAbdullah al-Yazouri, from Gaza, Palestine, contributed to the recent controversial documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone .\n\nDisgraced broadcaster Huw Edwards (pictured) has been 'unwilling' to pay back the £200,000 salary he pocketed between his arrest and resignation, a BBC top boss has revealed\n\nThe film was pulled from iPlayer last month after the BBC acknowledged 'serious flaws' in how it was produced.\n\nViewers were not told that Abdullah, the 14-year-old boy who narrated it, was the son of a senior Hamas minister.\n\nIt also later emerged that around £790 was paid into a bank account belonging to Abdullah's sister.\n\nTheir father, Ayman al-Yazouri, is the deputy agriculture minister in Gaza's Hamas-run government.\n\nThe funds, which are equivalent to a month's salary in Gaza, were transferred by the production company Hoyo Films, who made the programme. A full audit of the money used to make the programme has been demanded by the BBC.\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: 'The BBC has a duty, under its Royal Charter, to ensure the views and voices of all communities across the UK are reflected and represented in our workforce and our output, which this role will be key in supporting.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

      "text": "Trump obliterates DEI with new demand to place every federal diversity program employee on paid leave by 5 pm Wednesday\n\nBy WILL POTTER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 21:41 EDT, 21 January 2025 | Updated: 10:39 EDT, 23 January 2025\n\n2.9k\n\nView comments\n\nDonald Trump quickly made good on his pledge to sever diversity, equity and inclusion policies in the federal government as he is set to lay off all DEI hires within 24 hours.\n\nThe new Trump administration sent a letter to all heads and acting heads of government agencies on Tuesday, informing them all federal employees in DEI roles must be placed on paid leave by 5 pm Wednesday.\n\nAll DEI offices in federal agencies are also being shuttered in the move, which comes after Trump signed an anti-DEI executive order in front of a cheering crowd at his inauguration on Monday .\n\nIn a letter first obtained by CBS News , the agencies were ordered to 'take prompt actions' against all departments 'focusing exclusively on DEI initiatives and programs.'\n\nThe letter also demands all public DEI focused webpages be taken offline, and orders employees within the departments to report 'any efforts to disguise these programs by using coded or imprecise language.'\n\nAny employees that are aware of 'coded or imprecise language' intended to keep DEI programs alive but do not report them within 10 days are warned of 'adverse consequences.'\n\nTrump's executive order, titled 'Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing and Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions', directly reverses a DEI executive order enacted by President Biden on his first day in office four years ago .\n\nTuesday's order concludes: ' These programs divided Americans by race, wasted taxpayer dollars, and resulted in shameful discrimination.'\n\nDonald Trump quickly made good on his executive order cutting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies in the federal government by putting all DEI hires on paid leave\n\nAfter all DEI hires are placed on leave by 5pm Wednesday, agencies are ordered to develop plans to lay off each employee that was hired under DEI policies, with a deadline of next Friday given to develop a list for a 'reduction in force action.'\n\nAgencies must then report to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on 'all steps taken' to remove DEI programs by January 23, including a complete list of all employees that had been in DEI offices as of November 5, 2024.\n\nA written plan for firing all DEI employees must then be submitted to the OPM by January 31, 2025, including a list of all 'contract descriptions or personnel position descriptions that were changed since November 5, 2024' to conceal their DEI intentions.\n\nThe executive order slammed the 'infiltration' of DEI programs into the federal government, and cited the executive order signed by Biden on the first day of his presidency that aimed to tackle racial inequalities in government.\n\nAnother similar executive order signed by Trump on Tuesday also rolled back affirmative action in federal contracting, reversing a longstanding order first signed by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965.\n\nShortly after signing the anti-DEI executive order this week, Trump fired the female leader of the US Coast Guard, Admiral Linda Fagan, over concerns about her obsession with DEI policies .\n\nIn a memo issued by the White House on Tuesday night, the Trump administration claimed progress made by the passage of civil rights legislation decades ago as having been lost to DEI programs.\n\nTrump's anti-DEI executive order directly reverses one signed by President Biden on the first day of his presidency four years ago aimed at tackling racial inequalities in government (pictured signing the order on January 20, 2021)\n\nProtestors seen outside the Supreme Court in June 2023 after the court struck down affirmative action in college admissions, one of the first major hits to DEI practices under the Biden administration\n\nOBTAINED FIRST BY @cbsnews ' @kristincbrown : All federal employees in DEI roles have to be placed on paid leave by 5pm Wednesday as those offices and programs are being ordered shut down, according to @USOPM memo. pic.twitter.com/PhTn4QrQqB\n\n'Today, roughly 60 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, critical and influential institutions of American society, including the Federal Government, major corporations, financial institutions, the medical industry, large commercial airlines, law enforcement agencies, and institutions of higher education have adopted and actively use dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called 'diversity, equity, and inclusion,' the memo read.\n\nTrump's order argued that DEI programs 'not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity.'\n\n'They deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system,' the memo continued.\n\n'Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex.\n\n'The American people have witnessed first-hand the disastrous consequences of illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing.'\n\nDismantling the federal government's DEI programs was just one of a wave of executive orders Trump signed in his first hours back in power .\n\nMany of the orders reversed policies his predecessor put into effect during his four years in the White House - and a number of the orders even include language hitting out at former President Biden.\n\nThe orders range in topics from national security, migration at the southern border, the use of natural resources and even gender ideology.\n\nDismantling the federal government's DEI programs was just one of a wave of executive orders Trump signed in his first hours back in power\n\nThe very first executive action Trump signed into law was to rescind 78 Biden-era executive orders .\n\n'The previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular inflationary, illegal and radical practices within every agency and office of the federal government,' Trump's own executive action reads.\n\n'Orders to open the borders have endangered the American people and dissolved federal, state and local resources that should be used to benefit the American people. Climate extremism has exploded inflation and overburdened businesses with regulation.\n\n'To commence the policies that will make our Nation united, fair, safe and prosperous again, it is the policy of the United States to restore common sense to the federal government.'\n\nAmong the executive actions he rescinded were some Biden signed on the first day of his previous administration, and a number dealing with migration-related issues.\n\nOne such action was Biden's order Enabling All Qualified Americans to Serve Their Country in Uniform, which said gender identity is not a bar from service.\n\nTrump also rescinded policies establishing a White House Gender Policy Council and ending Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of Terrorism.\n\nThe 'Initial rescissions of harmful executive orders and actions' memo included a reversal on sanctions against the International Criminal Court.\n\nOther executive orders pledged to restore free speech and end censorship, to end the 'weaponization' of the federal government against 'political opponents', and ordering the return of all federal employees to in-person work.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It's almost as bad as \"Brian Kilmeade's here,\" but DEI has done it again.\n\nNow, the Seattle Public School system is phasing out its highly capable cohort schools designed for gifted students who could skip the lessons designed for other kids their age. You know, nerds. But just when you thought Seattle couldn't get any dumber, it does something literally to do just that, and can you guess why? That's right, because it's racist.\n\nYou see, those programs have too many students from the bad races. Last year, over 50% of the advanced students were White, 16% Asian, 3.4% Black. There just weren't enough Black, Latino, Indigenous, Alaskan and Pacific Islander students.\n\nSEATTLE PUBLIC SCHOOLS REPLACING GIFTED STUDENTS PROGRAM TO BE MORE 'INCLUSIVE,' CITING DIVERSITY CONCERNS\n\nSo I guess we could say goodbye to the NBA real soon, right? What's that? Oh, we don't use that type of insane reasoning when it's sports? What a strange demarcation. People say, \"Don't do that with basketball, but let's do it with less important stuff. You know, like education.\"\n\nSo the schools got canceled like it was hosted by Don Lemon . And why? Well, it's not about how smart these kids are. It's not about what's up here. It's about what's on here. It's about what these kids look like when they're in a classroom together.\n\nIt's about embarrassing their teachers and administrators just by being themselves. I don't know, but that sounds pretty racist to me. So now, instead of putting the brainiacs in their own class with their own teacher and curriculum, all those brats are being lumped together, and the teacher's expected to come up with different lesson plans for different levels.\n\nOK, kids, today's vocabulary word is mediocrity. Does anyone here know what that means? Mediocrity is what happens when the people who run our country force us all to lower our standards so the elites can pat themselves on the back for their atrocious beliefs. And that's what it's about: the continuing destruction caused by luxury beliefs, which are bad ideas that bestow status on the elites who hold them while inflicting pain on everyone else who must endure them.\n\nYou see it with climate activism, criminal justice, and now here in education. An enlightened progressive already has their college degrees, their house and two electric cars, so they're immune from their own destruction, but God help your kids.\n\nSTOP PUNISHING GIFTED STUDENTS: WAR ON MERIT, HONORS PROGRAMS IS HURTING BLACK CHILDREN, OTHERS\n\nAnd so in Seattle, the smart kids will be reading \"The Gutfeld Monologues,\" while in the same classroom, the slow kids will be reading \"Get It Together\" by Jesse Watters. The kids who are already reading Shakespeare are stuck in the same room with the kids still eating boogers and paste.\n\nIn my case, it was both. Glue tastes great, but now I get to eat the whole horse. But today, helping kids of all races advance at their own pace is now considered inequitable, and holding highly intelligent children back is now considered equitable. And yes, that includes Black kids.\n\nIn fact, those who complained about shutting down these schools included Black parents. And guess what the school board VP reportedly told them: They were being tokenized by the White parents.\n\nShe was probably in the slow class, which once again, is mind-numbingly racist, but to the elites, it's as if Black parents don't have minds of their own, as if they don't have the same hopes and concerns about their children as everybody else to one day be like me, you know - rich enough to own a helicopter that could drop porta-potties into Kilmeade's swimming pool.\n\nNot only are some of the smartest kids in school being punished for what they look like, but so are the smart kids these DEI fanatics claim to be helping.\n\nPARENTS SPEAK OUT AGAINST SCHOOL CANCELING HONORS CLASSES IN THE NAME OF EQUITY: 'IT'S NOT WORKING'\n\nCall me old-fashioned, but the only reason kids should be punished for what they look like is if they're chubby. The smartest kid might be Black, but now he has to sit next to the dumbest kid in school who might be White or Asian. Well, probably not Asian. When I was a kid and we had a test coming up, everybody wanted to sit next to the Asian kid. It's the only reason George Takei had friends.\n\nBut sadly, like it or not, these kids are learning what modern America is all about. It's not about living up to your potential as an individual. It's about what you look like as part of the herd, you're just part of the group you have no control of - which is why I quit Menudo.\n\nAnd of course, anybody who dares to question this is racist, and that includes Black parents who realize their gifted children are being punished, and they're exactly right. Finally, something every race can agree on, which is why the idiots who make the rules won't let us.\n\nGreg Gutfeld currently serves as host of Gutfeld!

      "text": "CASEY RYAN: It's Time For DEI-Pushing Accreditors To Change Their Ways\n\nAs the Trump administration and state legislatures work to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives from America's education system, universities continue to promote and support the controversial ideology because they rely on accreditors to remain afloat. In recent years, accreditors have encouraged or outright demanded universities adopt DEI goals and standards.\n\nCollege accreditors determine which universities can grant recognized degrees or even receive federal funding. The Department of Education (ED) explains that accreditation serves the purpose of \"verifying that an institution or program meets established standards\" and \"helping to identify institutions and programs for the investment of public and private funds.\"\n\nThe department explicitly states that universities must have \"nationally recognized\" accreditation for students to receive federal student aid. This creates a system in which accreditors set standards that often include DEI initiatives that universities must adopt to be recognized by ED.\n\nThere are different types of accreditors. For example, regional accreditors divide the country into states and provide accreditation for the colleges in their specific territories. Two regional accreditors include the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) and the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE).\n\nDespite covering predominantly conservative states such as Texas and Florida, the SACSCOC has widely adopted DEI ideology and encouraged universities in its territory to do the same. The accreditor provides colleges with strategies to implement DEI such as \"dedicating staff to advocate for and lead diversity initiatives (e.g. Chief Diversity Officer, Office of Diversity or Multicultural Affairs).\"\n\nThe NECHE covers the northeast from Connecticut to Maine and demands that universities adopt DEI initiatives as part of the accreditor's \"standards for accreditation.\" Any university that expects accreditation must address \"its own goals for the achievement of diversity, equity, and inclusion among its personnel and assesses the effectiveness of its efforts to achieve those goals.\"\n\nWhile demanding that universities adopt DEI to receive accreditation is terrible, the problem becomes significantly worse when medical programs at universities are specifically mandated to adopt DEI standards.\n\nThe Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) is an accreditor for medical schools that claims to be recognized by ED \"as the notable authority for the accreditation of medical education programs leading to the MD degree.\"\n\nThe accreditor mandates that medical schools engage \"in ongoing, systematic, and focused recruitment and retention activities, to achieve mission-appropriate diversity outcomes among its students.\" This is included in the standards of accreditation that will be effective on July 1.\n\nUnfortunately, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) is not any better. The nursing school accreditor defiantly promotes \"upholding the concepts of diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, and justice.\" The accreditor notably quotes far-left activist Ibram X. Kendi in stating that we must \"believe in the possibility that we can transform our societies to be antiracist from this day forward.\"\n\nThe fact that medical and nursing accreditors prioritize DEI dogma over talent and skill is scary, but should come as a surprise to no one at this point.\n\nIf our leaders want to eradicate DEI from higher education, they must start with ED. University accreditors are now controlled by radical ideologues. ED must stop using them to determine what universities receive federal funding and recognition.\n\nOur universities must also step up and refuse to pay these accreditors. These groups receive funding through dues paid by universities that use their services. Accreditors are essentially being paid with taxpayer dollars to promote DEI.\n\nA 2017 report from the Center for American Progress reveals that membership dues can vary widely depending on the college and number of students, with some dues extending well beyond $100,000. The LCME alone charges medical schools $25,000 just to submit an application to seek accreditation.\n\nThe status quo is hazardous to Americans' health.\n\nAmerica's leaders - and more specifically ED- must work in tandem with universities to strip accreditors of their standing and power if they continue to prioritize DEI over merit.\n\nCasey Ryan is a writer and investigative reporter at Parents Defending Education.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Plurality of Voters Support Eliminating DEI Programs Amid Trump's Crackdown\n\nA plurality of Americans support efforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs across the government, workplaces and schools, according to two recent polls.\n\nHalf of voters, or 49%, think that DEI programs should be terminated \"because they create divisions and inefficiencies in the workplace by putting too much emphasis on race and other social factors over merit, skills and experience,\" according to an NBC News poll released Tuesday. Meanwhile, just 48% of voters think that DEI programs in the workplace should continue \"because diverse perspectives reflect our country, create innovative ideas and solutions, encourage unity and make our workplaces fair and inclusive.\"\n\nA slightly higher number of voters, 43%, said they have negative feelings towards DEI programs, while just 39% had positive views and 14% said they were neutral, according to the NBC News poll.\n\nRelatedly, a survey from The Economist/YouGov published in January found that the majority of voters, 45%, support ending DEI programs in schools and the government. Of those surveyed, just 40% said they did not support dismantling the diversity programs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made dismantling DEI programs in K-12 schools , universities and federal government agencies a priority thus far in his second presidency. Trump signed a Jan. 20 executive order to terminate DEI initiatives and preferencing across the federal government, claiming that the programs are \"radical and wasteful.\"\n\n\"The Biden Administration forced illegal and immoral discrimination programs, going by the name 'diversity, equity, and inclusion,' into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government, in areas ranging from airline safety to the military,\" Trump wrote in the executive order.\n\nDespite many Americans supporting the Trump administration's ongoing attempts to crack down on any DEI initiatives in schools and the government, the efforts have been met with significant pushback from Democrats. Nevertheless, a string of U.S.-based businesses have begun walking back their DEI efforts over the past year amid intense public scrutiny .\n\nThe NBC News poll was conducted March 7-11 and surveyed 1,000 registered voters nationally. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nThe Economist/YouGov poll was conducted Jan. 19-21, and surveyed 1609 U.S. adults.

      "text": "University Of Michigan Overhauls Massive DEI Program\n\nThe University of Michigan announced Thursday it is ending its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) program.\n\nThe massive DEI bureaucracy is the largest and most expensive in the nation, totaling over $250 million since 2016. The university has been considering shuttering the program as far back as November but finally announced its plan to \"evolve\" its approach, which includes closing its DEI office, ending its strategic plan and reviewing \"all policies, programs and practices.\"\n\n\"Student-facing services in ODEI [Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion] will shift to other offices, which will continue to support access and opportunity,\" the university wrote. A UM spokesman did not clarify whether DEI staff would just be relocated to other departments.\n\n\"Since the inception of our DEI strategic plan in 2016, we have made important progress in opening opportunities and supporting the success of all students,\" the announcement says. \"Over the course of our strategic efforts, we have heard strong pride in the university's support for student-facing programs. We have also heard concerns about the balance of resources between administration and direct student support. Some in our campus community have voiced frustration that they did not feel included in DEI initiatives and that the programming fell short in fostering connections among diverse groups.\"\n\n\"The University of Michigan is moving forward with important changes to our diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs,\" Kay Jarvis, UM's director of public affairs, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. \"In a message today to the Ann Arbor campus and Michigan Medicine, the university announced it will reallocate funding away from administrative functions and toward student-facing initiatives that directly enhance student success and foster a sense of belonging for all members of our community. This will include closing the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and the Office for Health Equity and Inclusion and discontinuing the DEI 2.0 strategic plan, among other changes.\"\n\nUM said it will expand financial aid, enhance mental health support, and improve counseling and advising services. It also said it will work \"to expand student life programs that strengthen community, promote a sense of belonging and expand accessibility,\" maintain its multicultural spaces and \"continue to support cultural and ethnic events that enrich our campus and foster a vibrant, inclusive environment.\"\n\nThe decision was made in part due to President Donald Trump's recent crackdown on DEI efforts, axing teams and directives at the federal level and cutting DEI grants . Trump's day-one executive order called for the dismantling of \"radical and wasteful government DEI programs and preferencing\" throughout all federal agencies.\n\nThe university's board of regents in November reportedly asked UM President Santa Ono \"to defund or restructure\" DEI at the university after reports circulated about the program's failures, such as students and faculty reporting a deteriorating campus climate since the program began and being less likely to interact with people of a different race, religion or political ideology. Furthermore, attempts to create a more diverse campus fell flat, with black enrollment at the university remaining a steady 5%.\n\nThe program also reportedly created a \"culture of grievance,\" with the office's conception coinciding with an \"explosion\" of complaints on campus involving race, gender and religion. Meanwhile, nearly 250 university employees were engaged in some form of DEI efforts on campus.\n\nBy December, UM announced it was abandoning diversity statements for hiring, promotion and tenure decisions after an apparent push from faculty, saying the statements had the \"potential to limit freedom of expression and diversity of thought on campus.\"\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screen Capture/University of Michigan)\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: GOP Sens Seek Answers For Taxpayers Who Picked Up Tab For Biden's DEI Initiatives\n\nSenate Judiciary Republicans are seeking accountability for taxpayers who footed the bill for the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives under former President Joe Biden.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa and GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas and Ashley Moody of Florida wrote to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) Thursday to ask the nonpartisan watchdog to perform an audit of the DOJ's DEI practices under the Biden-Harris administration. The senators asked that GAO investigate how much time and money were spent executing the Biden administration's executive orders cementing DEI initiatives across the federal government, according to the letter obtained exclusively by the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\n\"The Biden-Harris EO [Executive Order] was a divisive bureaucratic burden on the Executive Branch,\" the GOP senators wrote to GAO Comptroller General Gene Dodaro. \"The taxpayer deserves to know how much time and money the Biden-Harris DOJ spent on these efforts.\"\n\n\"Specifically, the taxpayer has a right to know how many DOJ employees were hired to work on DEIA [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility] programs or initiatives and how much money the DOJ spent on these functions, including salaries, fringe benefits, rent for office space, and supplies for employees,\" the senators said.\n\nSenate Republicans' request for an audit of the Biden administration's DEI initiatives comes as President Donald Trump's administration has moved to roll back Biden's DEI practices, which Trump has referred to as \"illegal and immoral discrimination.\"\n\n\"[N]early every Federal agency and entity [under Biden] submitted 'Equity Action Plans' to detail the ways that they have furthered DEIs [sic] infiltration of the Federal Government,\" Trump wrote in his executive order banning government DEI initiatives on Jan. 20. \"The public release of these plans demonstrated immense public waste and shameful discrimination. That ends today. Americans deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great.\"\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans are specifically requesting that the GAO probe the Biden administration's EO 14035 titled, \"Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce,\" issued in June 2021.\n\n\"As the Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government must be a model for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, where all employees are treated with dignity and respect,\" Biden wrote.\n\nThe EO led to the creation of new DEI offices in the federal government and new federal spending on DEI initiatives. The GOP senators cited a Parents Defending Education analysis that found that the Biden-Harris DOJ alone spent more than $100 million on promoting DEI initiatives in K-12 school districts.\n\nThe EO also required federal agencies to create individual \"strategic plans\" to advance DEI priorities. \"GAO should review the time and money the DOJ dedicated to these efforts,\" the senators wrote.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has worked to undo the Biden DOJ's DEI practices and carry out Trump's EO prohibiting certain DEI practices in the private sector and in educational bodies that receive federal funds.\n\nThe DOJ announced an investigation into four California universities Friday for allegedly using DEI practices in their admission policies.\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screen Capture/CSPAN)\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Even before, companies were having second thoughts.\n\nEven before, companies were having second thoughts.\n\nVictoria's Secret changed \"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\" to \"inclusion and belonging.\"\n\nNow, even woke Disney, despite squandering 270 million shareholder dollars on a moronic new version of \"Snow White,\" joined the mob of companies dropping DEI programs.\n\nWhy? Diversity, equity and inclusion sound good.\n\nThe problem is that DEI programs were captured by activists who obsess about victimhood. They divide people more than they empower.\n\n\"Diversity, equity and inclusion,\" says activist Robby Starbuck  \"don't mean what they pretend to mean.\"\n\nBefore Trump ended federal DEI programs by executive order, Starbuck ended them at some companies merely by using the power of speech. His strategy: warn companies that he'll tell his social media followers what stupid things they do.\n\nRemarkably, that worked!\n\nAfter he criticized John Deere on Twitter for encouraging \"preferred pronouns\" and holding woke diversity trainings, John Deere quickly dropped those policies.\n\nToyota, Target and Harley Davidson did, too.\n\n\"Why did they listen to you?\" I ask.\n\n\"We go to them like any other investigative journalist and we say, 'Hey, we have a story we're working on.'\"\n\nThen, if they don't change their policies, he goes public - posting the policies and his criticism on YouTube, Twitter, etc.\n\nOne week after he posted that Toyota sponsored pride parades and divided workers into identity-based groups such as LGBT, Black and Christian, Toyota stopped sponsoring LGBTQ events and opened employee groups to all workers.\n\nCoors has been requiring DEI trainings and donating to pride events. All it took was Starbuck looking into the company, and they stopped.\n\nSo did Jack Daniels, McDonald's, Walmart, AT&T, Lowe's and Ford.\n\n\"I like diversity,\" I tell him, suggesting DEI programs were good.\n\n\"They sound warm and fuzzy,\" says Starbuck. \"It's why at the beginning, it got a lot of buy-in ... I want to include everybody. I don't want to be mean. What it actually turned out to be in reality looked more like crazy trainings, overtly racist hiring practices, diametrically opposed to the very warm, fuzzy sounding words they try to sell.\"\n\nI think private companies should be able to have whatever policies they want. Customers and workers can buy other products or work someplace else.\n\nBut over the past few years, DEI mandates became so prevalent, you couldn't avoid them.\n\nI'm a Chase Bank customer. The bank is run by a very smart guy, Jamie Dimon.\n\nJust last year, Dimon said DEI is \"good for business; it's morally right; we're quite good at it.\"\n\nBut after Starbuck revealed JPMorgan's policies, Dimon quickly changed his mind.\n\n\"I saw how we were spending money on some of this stupid s-t,\" Dimon said, \"and it really pissed me off ... I'm just going to cancel them. I don't like wasted money in bureaucracy.\"\n\nIn my years of reporting, I've never seen changes this fast.\n\nDEI activists are angry about it.\n\nThe president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation says, \"We will not be erased!\"\n\n\"What existed before DEI?\" replies Starbuck. \"Did black people not exist before that?\"\n\nOn \"The View,\" host Sunny Hostin claims, \"This will specifically harm women ... African Americans and Latinos.\"\n\n\"What she's actually saying is that minorities are not going to be able to get jobs if the sole thing you're looking at is merit. The way I was raised, you call that racism,\" replies Starbuck. \"She's being racist.\"\n\nI push back:\n\n\"They're just saying, 'We have a history of disadvantage. We were slaves in this country.'\"\n\n\"None of them were,\" he points out. \"I'm Cuban. I could say my family went through this and that. I didn't go through it. I'm not going to claim their disadvantage as my own.\"\n\n\"We're not going to fall for the same stupid stuff anymore. We're going to judge people based on merit.\"\n\nEvery Tuesday at JohnStossel.com, Stossel posts a new video about the battle between government and freedom.

When the people making decisions on behalf of the American people don't reflect the full diversity of our nation, we all lose, and our national security is weaker,\" Blinken added in the announcement.\n\nThe latest appointment comes after Blinken created the chief diversity and inclusion officer position was created in 2021. Blinken stated during the approval of the new position that it will \"hold senior leadership accountable\" for implementing new diversity and inclusion programs and report directly to him.\n\nEver since Biden took over the White House, his administration has put diversity, equity, and inclusion at the top of the priority list for America.\n\nAdditionally, Blinken sent a memo to State Department employees to not use gender-specific language.\n\n\"When speaking, avoid using phrases like \"brave men and women on the front lines,\" said Blinken's February 5 th memo, which was first obtained by the National Review . Instead, State Department staffers were urged to \"use more specific language such as 'brave first responders,' 'brave soldiers,' or 'brave DS agents.'\"\n\nThe newly added DEI guidance runs through a list of certain gendered phrases and words that should be avoided, including: \"you guys,\" \"ladies and gentlemen,\" \"mother/father,\" \"son/daughter\" and \"husband/wife.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the State Department is assigned to advise the president on foreign policy, as well as negotiating agreements with other countries. The memo was released as the U.S. is dealing with two wars between Israel and Hamas, as well as Ukraine and Russia.\n\nStay informed! Receive breaking news blasts directly to your inbox for free.

      "text": "Delta's DEI Officer Calls For Banning Of 'Ladies And Gentleman' Gate Announcements As Part Of Inclusivity Push\n\nOAN Staff James Meyers 2:07 PM - Friday, August 9, 2024\n\nDelta Airlines has fully embraced the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) agenda over the past few years and now the chief officer of that department believes the phrase \"ladies and gentlemen\" isn't inclusive enough.\n\nDelta's Chief Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Social Impact Officer Kyra Lynn Johnson has said publicly Delta is continuing to \"boldly pursue equity.\"\n\nAs a result, it has impacted every level of the company, from its hiring practices to the language it now uses in gate announcements.\n\n\"So we're beginning to take a hard look at things like our gatehouse announcements. You know, we welcome 'ladies and gentlemen.' And we've asked ourselves, 'Is that as gender inclusive as we want to be?'\" Johnson said during a February 2021 panel with other DEI insiders. \"You know, we're looking at some legacy language that exists in some of our employee manuals. And getting to the root of the way some things are described and saying, 'Does that actually send a message of inclusivity?'\"\n\nThis comes after Delta released an inclusive language guide in December 2020, which advised employees and leaders against using terms that state there are only two genders.\n\n\"Use gender-neutral language and pronouns. Do not use language that suggests a gender binary (male-female),\" the Delta guide said.\n\nA Delta spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the company wants its employees to use inclusive language.\n\n\"Delta encourages our people to use language that is inclusive of everyone as our global customer base includes a broad range of diversity in cultural backgrounds, identity and experiences,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nIn 2021, during a DEI panel meeting, Johnson stressed how it was important for Delta to be an \"antiracist company.\"\n\n\"To really come out and say, as an organization, that we are an antiracist company was really important to us,\" she said. \"We are going to actively seek diversity. We're also talking about how we're going to boldly pursue equity. And we're talking about the steps we're taking to consciously promote inclusion.\"\n\n\"So, we realize, like many of you have, that it's not enough just to say, 'We aren't racist,' but to say that you are anti racist,\" Johnson added.\n\nDelta has also doubled-down on its approach for who they hire.\n\n\"We said we're going to reimagine and redefine our talent strategy,\" Johnson said, with a focus on being \"intentional about the representation that we need.\"\n\nShe added that the metrics of DEI would be closely monitored and measured by Delta's DEI team.\n\n\"We're starting on a quarterly basis to specifically measure those representation gaps at every level of the company. So we're looking at the front line representation gap,\" she said.\n\nJohnson said in a November 2021 interview with The Airline Tariff Publishing Company, that Delta was looking to push DEI externally.\n\nShe said the airline looked at how it was spending its \"PAC dollars\" and which \"legislation we should support\" to mitigate what it deemed \"inequity,\" she said.\n\n\"The next thing we said is we were just going to flat out address inequity,\" she said. \"And when we say we're boldly pursuing equity, that's what we mean. So we were going to lend our voice and our brand to things that support... justice and... equity. We're going to look at where we spend our PAC dollars. We're going to look at what legislation we should support,\" Johnson said on the DEI panel.\n\nDespite the push, other employees have not been \"comfortable\" with the changes, according to the DEI Officer.\n\n\"Perhaps the greatest challenge has been normalizing those conversations,\" she said. \"So, notice I said the company has set an expectation that those conversations are to be normalized... That doesn't mean everyone feels that way. It doesn't mean that everyone's comfortable having those conversations.\"\n\nStay informed! Receive breaking news blasts directly to your inbox for free.

      "text": "University of South Carolina Requires Students To Affirm Value of 'Diversity And Inclusion'\n\nThe University of South Carolina required students to affirm the value of \"diversity and inclusion\" as part of a mandatory training this summer, underscoring the tenacity of diversity programs in the face of public blowback and raising concerns about compelled speech at a school that has marketed itself as a bastion of free expression.\n\nIn a module on \"Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging,\" which included 10 multiple choice questions, the training asked students how \"diversity and inclusion help create a healthy, positive campus environment.\" Students who said these values do not create such an environment-or that they give \"unfair advantages\" to \"people from marginalized identity groups\"-were told that their answers were \"incorrect,\" according to screenshots shared with the Washington Free Beacon by the First Amendment watchdog Speech First.\n\nThe right answer was that \"diversity and inclusion exposes students to people from different backgrounds, thus enriching the overall campus experience.\"\n\nThough students could complete the module without answering every question correctly, they needed at least an 80 percent-on a quiz with just 10 questions-to pass the training and register for classes, according to the screenshots.\n\nCherise Trump, the executive director of Speech First, said the requirement was \"a blatant attempt at coercive brainwashing.\"\n\n\"Students here are clearly expected to maintain a certain viewpoint designated by the state school or else they risk losing access to courses,\" Trump told the Free Beacon . \"Online modules like the one at University of South Carolina clearly work against the spirit of the First Amendment.\"\n\nReached for comment about Trump's concerns, a university spokesman, Jeffrey Stensland, claimed the diversity module was \"optional, not mandatory,\" and that students only needed to complete units on alcohol and sexual assault. But an online portal for USC's 35,000 students says otherwise, indicating the diversity unit is \"required\" for all undergraduates.\n\nUSC also warned students in emails that \"registration holds will take effect if you do not complete\" the module, which was offered through an outside vendor, Vector Solutions, and includes lessons on \"allyship,\" \"privilege,\" and \"cultural appropriation.\"\n\n\"You are receiving this email because you have not yet completed all of the Required Community Education modules,\" the emails read. \"Completion of your courses is required for all students at the University of South Carolina.\"\n\nThe requirements could set back a yearlong campaign by USC to preempt the sort of controversies that have embroiled higher education amid a wave of anti-Israel protests, which amplified critiques of campus diversity programs and sparked heated debate about double standards and free speech.\n\nUnder pressure from state lawmakers, USC last year renamed its top diversity office to avoid the terms \"diversity,\" \"equity,\" and \"inclusion.\" With tensions rising over the Oct. 7 attacks, it also promised in a press release to \"strengthen its free speech expression policies\" and promote \"a variety of opinions and ideas\"-commitments that earned the university a top rating for free speech from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) in June of this year.\n\n\"USC went above and beyond to make its campus friendly to free expression,\" FIRE's Mary Griffin said in a statement . \"Not only did the institution seek to ensure its written policies aligned with the First Amendment, but it also prioritized communicating the importance of free expression as a valued principle to students, faculty, and staff.\"\n\nThe training, which also included a module on mental health, suggests some leaders at USC didn't get the memo. It forced students to affirm a range of propositions aimed at policing speech and micromanaging relationships, docking points for answers deemed insensitive or prejudiced.\n\nOne true/false question, for example, indicates that students should not support a \"friend in need\" by suggesting that exercise will help them feel better.\n\n\"While you may want to offer positivity or ideas on how they can move forward, now might not be the best time or place,\" the correct answer reads. \"Rather than offering advice, try simply validating their feelings.\"\n\nAnother question asks what students should do if they \"have a great idea for a costume\" but are \"concerned about cultural appropriation.\" Dismissing the concerns as \"not that serious\"-even if nobody from the relevant culture will be at the party-is \"incorrect,\" according to the training. Instead, students should \"educate\" themselves through online research to determine whether the costume is acceptable.\n\nStill another question asks why students might not learn about the \"experience of the LGBTQIA+ community\" before arriving at college. Incorrect answers include \"there wasn't enough time in high school to cover LGBTQIA+ perspectives\" and \"this probably wasn't an intentional or deliberate decision to exclude.\" To get the question right, students must affirm that \"history is frequently told through the lens of those in charge rather than those from marginalized identity groups.\"\n\nUniversities across the country have required similar trainings. A Title IX training at Boston University forced faculty to affirm, via a multiple choice quiz, that people \"rarely\" make false accusations of sexual assault, while a Title IX training at Harvard told students that \"using the wrong pronouns\" can constitute \"abuse.\"\n\n\"The level of coercion we are seeing around campuses today is at an all-time high,\" Trump said. \"Almost every campus prioritizes DEI topics during orientation programs and often requires students to undergo training sessions where they learn about 'white privilege,' 'implicit bias,' and other radical and ideologically charged themes.\"\n\nAt USC, the multiple-choice quiz penalized students who said that refusing to use a roommate's preferred pronouns did not constitute bigotry.\n\nStudents were also dinged for saying that it would be best to let a Jewish roommate stand up for himself if a \"mutual friend\" were \"making fun\" of his \"religious headwear.\" \"Pull them aside later to educate them on why their comments may have been offensive,\" the training enjoins.\n\nStensland, the university spokesman, said the quiz was \"not intended to reflect university policy\" but rather \"encourage student reflection.\" Pressed on why the \"optional\" module had been listed as a requirement, he promised in an email to \"follow-up with our team to ensure the information sent to incoming [students] is accurate.\"\n\n\"I appreciate you bringing this to our attention,\" he wrote.\n\nUpdate 10:30 a.m.: A previous version of this story stated that the University of South Carolina had earned a top spot on the college free speech rankings put together by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. The school did earn FIRE's \"green light\" rating, meaning it has no written policies that threaten free speech, but only ranked 34th for free expression overall.\n\nPublished under: DEI , First Amendment , Free Speech , University of South Carolina\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Party of Inclusion\n\nJust the facts : The Republican Party has always been a champion of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Unlike the Democratic Party, which seeks to demonstrate its commitment to inclusive values through performative rhetoric and condescending lectures, the GOP leads by example.\n\nWin back the White People's House or DEI trying : Republicans are assembling one of the most diverse, equitable, and inclusive slates of candidates who will compete for the opportunity to challenge President Joe Biden, an 80-year-old white man sometimes referred to as \"Sleepy Joe.\"\n\nAs it stands, a majority of the projected GOP primary candidates are people of color under 60 years of age. Let's take a closer look at this historic Republican field heading into the 2024 election.\n\nTIM SCOTT\n\nAge : 57\n\nYears younger than Joe Biden : 23\n\nOccupation : United States senator from South Carolina\n\nAccomplishments : First black Republican to represent a Southern state in the U.S. Senate since Reconstruction, would be the first fully black president in American history (Barack Obama was half white)\n\nWhy Democrats hate him : There are few things Democrats hate more than a black person who doesn't agree with their policy preferences. (See also: Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas .)\n\nBiden has argued that Scott and other black Americans who don't support him \" ain't black .\" Democrats and other racists have called him \"Uncle Tim,\" a \"token\" black \"prop,\" and a \"clown\" whose \"ancestors are ashamed of him.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Washington Post published a racially charged investigation into Scott's family history, implying the senator's grandfather-who grew up in segregation-era South Carolina during the Great Depression-was actually a privileged nepo baby.\n\nScott would be a national celebrity by now if he weren't a Republican. Raised by a single \"prayin' momma\" in South Carolina, recipient of a non-Ivy League education, the senator has arguably overcome more challenges than Obama did throughout his historic career.\n\nNIKKI HALEY\n\nAge : 51\n\nYears younger than Joe Biden : 29\n\nPast her prime? Hell no .\n\nOccupation : Former governor of South Carolina, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations\n\nAccomplishments : First female governor of South Carolina, first Asian-American female governor of any state, first Indian-American member of a presidential cabinet, would be the first female president of the United States (sorry, Hillary) and the first fully non-white president in history\n\nWhy Democrats hate her : The usual reasons. CNN's Don Lemon hates her because she's a woman, while others hate her because of her ethnic background and political affiliation. Last year, for example, television personality Asunción \"Sunny\" Hostin smeared the Indian-American icon as a racial \"chameleon\" for changing her name. (Haley's middle name is Nikki.)\n\nVIVEK RAMASWAMY\n\nAge: 37\n\nYears younger than Joe Biden : 43\n\nOccupation : Tech entrepreneur, anti-ESG investor\n\nAccomplishments : Nine-figure net worth, attractive wife, nationally ranked junior tennis player, would be the youngest (and first fully non-white) president in American history\n\nWhy Democrats hate him : Being a rich tech guy is fine so long as you are \"woke\" and fund the Democratic Party's radical agenda. Otherwise you're bad. Ramaswamy is also a person of color who speaks out against the Democratic Party's entitled and paternalistic attitude toward people of color, which annoys them to no end.\n\nDONALD TRUMP\n\nAge : 76\n\nAge (adjusted for stamina) : 39\n\nYears younger than Joe Biden (adjusted) : 41\n\nOccupation : President of the United States (disputed), real estate tycoon, reality TV legend, loving husband, caring father, skilled amateur golfer\n\nAccomplishments : First indicted president in American history, first twice-impeached president in American history, involved in more perfect phone calls than any president in American history, has done more for the black community than any other American president-with the (possible) exception of Abraham Lincoln\n\nWhy Democrats hate him : They want to be him. Trump's otherworldly combination of handsomeness, strength, stamina, hair quality, intellect, and moral courage is something they will never possess. Also, they will never get over the fact that he shattered Hillary Clinton's dream of becoming president.\n\nPublished under: 2024 Election , DEI , Diversity , Donald Trump , Equity , Joe Biden , Nikki Haley , Racism , Republican Party , Tim Scott\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Woke Agenda Survives: These House Republicans Are Sticking With 'Diversity and Inclusion'\n\nDemocrats may have lost control of the House of Representatives, but it appears Republicans are embracing their legacy of so-called diversity and inclusion.\n\nRepublican congressman Patrick McHenry (N.C.), now the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, announced earlier this month that there would be six subcommittees-and all of them will count advancing \"diversity and inclusion\" as one of their top priorities, according to the committee's announcement.\n\nThe Subcommittee on Capital Markets, led by Republican Ann Wagner of Missouri, for example, will identify \"best practices and policies that continue to strengthen diversity and inclusion in the capital markets industry.\" And the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, led by Republican Bill Huizenga of Michigan, is tasked with making sure there is \"agency and programmatic commitment to diversity and inclusion policies.\" No other specific oversight focuses were listed.\n\nDiversity and inclusion, two members of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion triumvirate now commonly referred to as DEI, have become an obsession for Democrats and left-wing activists in recent years. Republicans won a narrow majority in the midterm elections at least in part due to promises that they would end the Democrats' DEI craze. It was a common barb from the Republican National Committee, for example, that \"Democrats prioritize wokeness over solving real problems.\"\n\nMcHenry, a close ally of Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), was tapped to chair the influential committee in December. His initial announcement of committee priorities under his leadership included conducting \"aggressive oversight\" of the Biden administration, putting Americans back in control of their financial data, and regulating the crypto market. In a statement to the Washington Free Beacon , McHenry said the committee's Republican leadership would \"refocus the committee on the kitchen table issues that matter to American families.\"\n\n\"For four years, Democrats wasted the valuable and limited time and resources of our committee to push burdensome mandates on American job creators,\" McHenry said. \"Democrats' goal was to name and shame companies until they parroted their woke social agenda.\"\n\nThe statement made no mention of diversity and inclusion.\n\nAlthough one of McHenry's first acts as chairman was to dissolve the Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion established by his predecessor Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.), the task set out by that subcommittee now appears to have bled into the entire committee's work. Each of those subcommittees, all led by Republicans, includes the term \"diversity and inclusion\" in the brief description of its jurisdiction.\n\nMcHenry also established a new committee, the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion. Under the leadership of Arkansas Republican French Hill, the subcommittee is tasked with \"identifying best practices and policies that continue to strengthen diversity and inclusion in the digital asset ecosystem.\"\n\nRep. Warren Davidson (R., Ohio), who chairs the Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance, will work on \"identifying best practices and policies that continue to strengthen diversity and inclusion in the housing industry.\" Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer's (R., Mo.) Subcommittee on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial Institutions will \"continue to strengthen diversity and inclusion within the national security and international finance industry,\" and Rep. Andy Barr's (R., Ky.) Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy will identify \"best practices and policies that continue to strengthen the financial industry's commitment to diversity and inclusion.\"\n\nNone of the six subcommittee chairs would comment on how they plan to follow through on their \"diversity and inclusion\" goals.\n\nRepublicans reportedly struggled with the decision to eliminate the Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion, with Politico reporting that McHenry considered making it \"part of another committee.\" The Consumer Bankers Association, a trade organization, wrote in a February 2019 memo that McHenry \"expressed his support for the creation of the new subcommittee\" during a hearing on \"diversity trends in the financial services industry.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether Democrats pressured Republicans into including \"diversity and inclusion\" in the announcement, but the inclusion of the woke term did not satisfy Waters. The committee's former Democratic chairwoman on Thursday slammed her Republican colleagues for the \"insufficient\" step.\n\n\"Their pledge to make diversity a component of each sub-panel is simply insufficient,\" Waters said. \"We know that a diversity and inclusion strategy with no tangible goals, accountability measures, or a senior point of contact, rarely leads to significant impact.\"\n\n\"My Democratic colleagues and I will continue to hold our Republican colleagues accountable,\" Waters added, \"and do the work to make sure diversity and inclusion is at the forefront of our agenda because as we've proven these past four years, diversity matters, and we will not be silent on this important topic.\"\n\nUnder Waters, only the House Financial Services subcommittee she specifically tasked with diversity and inclusion pledged to focus on it.\n\nPublished under: House of Representatives , Kevin McCarthy , Patrick McHenry\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Analysis: Trump's Kennedy Center Purge Is a Total Coup-for Equity and Inclusion\n\nPresident Donald Trump has revolutionized the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts by ousting 18 Democratic appointees from the board of trustees and replacing them with normal Americans. On Wednesday, the new board unanimously elected a fabulous chairman (Trump) who is determined to preside over a \"Golden Age of Arts and Culture\" in this country after four years of vapid slop under former president Joe Biden. \"I think we're going to make it hot,\" Trump said on a conference call with Kennedy Center board members. \"And we made the presidency hot, so this should be easy.\"\n\nLiberal elites have grumbled that Trump's actions amount to a sinister \"purge\" or \"coup.\" The New Republic , a once-respected left-wing publication, accused Trump of appointing \"the weirdest board ever\" at the Kennedy Center. This couldn't be more wrong, according to an in-depth analysis of the new and outgoing members. Based on the available evidence, it's safe to say that Trump has assembled one of the most diverse, equitable, and inclusive groups of qualified experts since the Kennedy Center opened its doors in 1971. By purging the board's ranks of likeminded elites and replacing them with individuals who are more relatable and representative of our country's beautiful and complex demographic tapestry, Trump has pulled off an impressive coup-for DEI.\n\nRespecting victims' voices\n\nBrown is beautiful\n\nLove is love\n\nAmerica was built by immigrants\n\nGlass ceiling, shattered\n\nKickin' ass for the working class\n\nIn Trump's America, nice guys finish first\n\nPublished under: Diversity , Donald Trump , Karine Jean-Pierre , Kennedy Center , Stephanie Cutter\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
