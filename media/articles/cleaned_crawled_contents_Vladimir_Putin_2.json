      "text": "The only 'winner' here is Putin as Ukraine resigns itself to a new reality\n\nDaily newspapers with covers, dedicated to the recent phone call of Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, are laid out at a newsstand in a street in Moscow, Russia, February 13, 2025.\n\n\"A president just disrespected America in the Oval Office. It wasn't Zelenskyy.\"\n\nThat was the verdict of the editorial team at the Kyiv Independent, one of Ukraine's leading media outlets, on a remarkable spat in the Oval Office that played out on Feb. 28, 2025.\n\nThe online newspaper European Pravda characterized the \"quarrel at the highest level\" as a diplomatic failure, but added that it was \"not yet a catastrophe.\"\n\nSome Ukrainians I have spoken to since the fractious encounter, during which Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy was repeatedly hectored by U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, have indeed characterized it as disastrous for the country . But for others, the incident has been calmly accepted as the new reality in U.S.-Ukraine relations .\n\nThere have been some questions directed at Zelenskyy - did he allow himself to be baited into an an argument that could have real consequences? Should he have remained silent? But for the most part, the treatment of Ukraine's president by Trump and Vance has produced a presumably unintended consequence: It has unified a war-weary Ukrainian people .\n\nAs one friend who has been displaced by war from the now occupied city of Nova Kakhovka told me, there has not been this level of mobilization and patriotism in three years.\n\nThis unity is seen in the response across Ukraine's political divide.\nPetro Poroshenko, an often outspoken opponent of Zelenskyy and leader of the opposition party European Solidarity, said on March 1 that, to the surprise of many, he will not criticize Zelenskyy's performance at the White House. \"The country does not need criticism, the country needs unity,\" he said in the video posted on X.\n\nAnecdotally, even those Ukrainians who did not vote for Zelenskyy have told me that events in the Oval Office made them feel more supportive of Zelenskyy.\n\nHowever, a sense of realism is sinking in over the shifting stance of the U.S. administration. Trump's stated trust in Vladimir Putin and his conciliatory comments over Russian aggression - including a refusal to acknowledge Russian war crimes - have, for many Ukrainians, set low expectations that the White House can help achieve a quick and lasting peace. Yet, as Inna Sovsun of the opposition party Holos noted , \"It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world.\"\n\nThe Feb. 28 meeting between the U.S. and Ukrainian leaders followed weeks of increasingly harsh Trump rhetoric toward Zelenskyy. Since being inaugurated on Jan. 20, Trump has called the Ukrainian leader a \"dictator without elections,\" claiming - incorrectly - that Zelenksyy had 4% approval ratings. He also indicted that the invasion by Russian troops in February 2022 was Ukraine's fault .\n\nSuch comments had already made Ukrainians rally around Zelenskyy, who has a healthy 63% approval rating, according to the latest polls .\n\nThe ugly scenes in the Oval Office could see a further rallying around Zelenskyy, especially if he can successfully characterize his role in the dispute as that of defender of his people. Doing so would tap into growing popular resentment over the new U.S. administration's apparent unwillingness to acknowledge Russian war crimes .\n\nIn the days leading up to the Zelenskyy-Trump meeting, the U.S. voted with Russia against a United Nations resolution condemning Russian aggression and opposed the wording of a draft G7 statement marking the third anniversary of the war, which depicted Russia as the aggressor.\n\nThe angry exchanges in the Oval Office seemed to have been sparked by Zelenskyy's objection to Trump's assertion that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a man of his word.\n\nThat refusal to call out Putin - who faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court - angers Ukrainians who have suffered Russian aggression for three years. To hammer that point home, Zekenskyy showed Trump and others in the Oval Office photos of Ukrainian prisoners of war who return from Russian captivity tortured and abused.\n\nAs Ukrainian human rights lawyer and Nobel Prize winner Oleksandra Matviichuk noted in a Feb. 17 speech , 65% of Ukrainians polled early in the conflict said their main disappointment in ending the war would be \"impunity for Russian crimes.\" Three years of conflict will have only hardened that sentiment - yet the U.S., under Trump's leadership, looks increasingly willing to let Putin off the hook .\n\nA large section of Ukrainian media - both traditionally pro- and anti-Zelenskyy alike - have since Feb. 28 portrayed the president in the role of a defender of both his nation and the truth.\n\nHe was, this framing has it, forced into the difficult position of having to set the record straight and challenge untrue statements in real time, and in front of the seemingly antagonistic leader of the world's largest economy, whose support has been crucial in Ukraine's attempt to repel the invading Russian army .\n\nTo some, keeping silent would have been tantamount to capitulation, but others have questioned Zelenskyy's approach.\n\nWhile still maintaining that Zelenskyy's key message was correct, some Ukrainians have suggested that his emotional tone in the Oval Office was not constructive.\n\nOpposition lawmaker Oleskiy Goncharenko suggested in an interview on CNN that Zelenskyy should have been more \"diplomatic\" and more \"calm \" given that the stakes were so high.\n\nMeanwhile, there were also those who questioned the decision to hold such an important conversation in front of the press, especially without the use of professional translators who potentially could have tamped down the rhetoric and slowed the pace of the exchange. Thus, as Tymofiy Mylovanov, the adviser to the office of the president and head of the Kyiv School of Economics put it, some things could \" have been lost in translation .\"\n\nSo where does the Oval Office dispute leave both Zelenskyy and U.S.-Ukrainian relations?\n\nIn the aftermath of the dispute, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham - who has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine - suggested that Zelenskyy should resign , the implications being that his relationship with Trump was so broken that his presence is now counterproductive for Ukraine's priorities.\n\nIt is a line that hasn't gone down well in Ukraine. Kira Rudyk, the leader of  opposition party Holos, retorted that it was up to the Ukrainian people alone to decide on their leadership and future .\n\nMoreover, to many Ukrainians the barrier to harmonious Ukraine-U.S. relations is not Zelenskyy, but Trump.\n\nMustafa Nayyem, who served in Zelesnkyy's government, summed up the view of many Ukrainians by claiming in a social media post that the Trump administration \"does not just dislike Ukraine. They despise us.\" The \"contempt is deeper than indifference, and more dangerous than outright hostility,\" he added in the Feb. 28 post.\n\nSerhii Sternenko, a Ukrainian activist lawyer and blogger, described the Oval Office spat as an intentional provocation on behalf of Trump to discredit Ukraine as an unreliable partner in the peace negotiations.\n\nSternenko is not alone in his assessment. Journalist and blogger Vitaly Portnikov argued that the spat was the result of Trump's unrealistic promise of ending the war quickly being confronted with the reality that perhaps Russia does not want to make any concessions. The thinking here is Putin has shown no indication that he will bend on his war goals , so for Trump, framing Zelenskyy as \"not ready for peace\" allows the U.S. president to walk away from his campaign promise without accepting defeat.\n\nBeyond the headlines and initial reactions from Ukrainian politicians, journalists and civilians, there is also another sentiment that is emerging: resignation to the new reality.\n\nMost Ukrainians want an end to war , but in a way that preserves their sovereignty and guarantees future security . Until recently, that was shared by the occupants of the White House. It is becoming increasingly clear to many Ukrainians that, in regards the war in Ukraine, the U.S. will play a different role under Trump - meaning Ukraine will increasingly look to European leaders as primary partners.\n\nPerhaps Goncharenko, the opposition member of Ukraine's Parliament, best summed up the consequences of the Oval Office spat: \"It was not Ukraine, it was not the United States who won ... it was Putin.\"\n\nLena Surzhko Harned , Associate Teaching Professor of Political Science, Penn State\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Trump's desire to 'un-unite' Russia and China is likely to backfire\n\nIs the U.S. angling for a repeat of the Sino-Russian split ?\n\nIn an Oct. 31, 2024, interview with right-wing pundit Tucker Carlson , President Donald Trump argued that the United States under Joe Biden had, in his mind erroneously, pushed China and Russia together. Separating the two powers would be a priority of his administration. \"I'm going to have to un-unite them, and I think I can do that, too,\" Trump said.\n\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has been eager to negotiate with Russia , hoping to quickly bring an end to the war in Ukraine. One interpretation of this Ukraine policy is that it serves what Trump was getting at in his comments to Carlson. Pulling the U.S. out of the European conflict and repairing ties with Russia, even if it means throwing Ukraine under the bus , can be seen within the context of a shift of America's attention to containing Chinese power .\n\nIndeed, after a recent call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump told Fox News : \"As a student of history, which I am - and I've watched it all - the first thing you learn is you don't want Russia and China to get together.\"\n\nThe history Trump alludes to is the strategy of the Nixon era , in which the U.S. sought to align with China as a counterbalance to the Soviet Union, encouraging a split between the two communist entities in the process.\n\nYet if creating a fissure between Moscow and Beijing is indeed the ultimate aim, Trump's vision is, I believe, both naive and shortsighted. Not only is Russia unlikely to abandon its relationship with China, but many in Beijing view Trump's handling of the Russia-Ukraine war -- and his foreign policy more broadly - as a projection of weakness, not strength .\n\nAlthough Russia and China have at various times in the past been adversaries when it suited their interests, today's geopolitical landscape is different from the Cold War era in which the Sino-Soviet split occurred . The two countries, whose relationship has grown steadily close since the fall of the Soviet Union,have increasingly shared major strategic goals - chief among them, challenging the Western liberal order led by the U.S.\n\nBoth China and Russia have, in recent years, adopted an increasingly assertive stance in projecting military strength: China in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, and Russia in former Soviet satellite states, including Ukraine.\n\nIn response, a unified stance formed by Western governments to counter China and Russia's challenge has merely pushed the two countries closer together.\n\nIn February 2022, just as Russia was preparing its invasion of Ukraine, Presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping announced a \"friendship without limits \" - in a show of unified intent against the West.\n\nChina has since become an indispensable partner for Russia, serving as its top trading partner for both imports and exports . In 2024, bilateral trade between China and Russia reached a record high of US$237 billion , and Russia now relies heavily on China as a key buyer of its oil and gas. This growing economic interdependence gives China considerable leverage over Russia and makes any U.S. attempt to pull Moscow away from Beijing economically unrealistic.\n\nThat doesn't mean the Russian-Chinese relationship is inviolable; areas of disagreement and divergent policy remain.\n\nIndeed, there are areas that Trump could exploit if he were to succeed in driving a wedge between the two countries. For example, it could serve Russia's interests to support U.S. efforts to contain China and discourage any expansionist tendencies in Beijing - such as through Moscow's strategic ties with India, which China views with some alarm - especially given that there are still disputed territories along the Chinese-Russian border .\n\nPutin isn't naive. He knows that with Trump in office, the deep-seated Western consensus against Russia - including a robust, if leaky, economic sanctions regime - isn't going away anytime soon. In Trump's first term, the U.S. president likewise appeared to be cozying up to Putin, but there is an argument that he was even tougher on Russia , in terms of sanctions, than the administrations of Barack Obama or Joe Biden.\n\nSo, while Putin would likely gladly accept a Trump-brokered peace deal that sacrifices Ukraine's interests in favor of Russia, that doesn't mean he would be rushing to embrace some kind of broader call to unite against China. Putin will know the extent to which Russia is now reliant economically on China , and subservient to it militarily. In the words of one Russian analyst, Moscow is now a \" vassal\" or, at best, a junior partner to Beijing.\n\nChina for its part views Trump's peace talks with Russia and Ukraine as a sign of weakness that potentially undermines U.S. hawkishness toward China.\n\nWhile some members of the U.S. administration are undoubtedly hawkish on China - Secretary of State Marco Rubio views the country as the \"most potent and dangerous\" threat to American prosperity - Trump himself has been more ambivalent. He may have slapped new tariffs on China as part of a renewed trade war, but he has also mulled a meeting with President Xi Jinping in an apparent overture.\n\nBeijing recognizes Trump's transactional mindset , which prioritizes short-term, tangible benefits over more predictable long-term strategic interests requiring sustained investment.\n\nThis changes the calculation over whether the U.S. may be unwilling to bear the high costs of defending Taiwan. Trump, in a deviation from his predecessor, has failed to commit the country to defending Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by Beijing.\n\nRather, Trump had indicated that if the Chinese government were to launch a military campaign to \"reunify\" Taiwan, he would opt instead for economic measures like tariffs and sanctions. His apparent openness to trade Ukraine territory for peace now has made some in Taiwan concerned over Washington's commitment to long-established international norms.\n\nChina has taken another key lesson from Russia's experience in Ukraine: The U.S.-led economic sanctions regime has serious limits.\n\nEven under sweeping Western sanctions, Russia was able to stay afloat through subterfuge and with support from allies like China and North Korea. Moreover, China remains far more economically intertwined with the West than Russia, and its relatively dominant global economic position means that it has significant leverage to combat any U.S.-led efforts to isolate the country economically.\n\nIndeed, as geopolitical tensions have driven the West to gradually decouple from China in recent years, Beijing has adapted to the resulting economic slowdown by prioritizing domestic consumption and making the economy more self-reliant in key sectors.\n\nThat in part also reflects China's significant global economic and cultural strength. Coupled with this has been a domestic push to win countries in the Global South around to China's position. Beijing has secured endorsements from 70 countries officially recognizing Taiwan as part of China .\n\nAs such, Trump's plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war by favoring Russia in the hope of drawing it into an anti-China coalition is, I believe, likely to backfire.\n\nWhile Russia may itself harbor concerns about China's growing power, the two country's shared strategic goal of challenging the Western-led international order - and Russia's deep economic dependence on China - make any U.S. attempt to pull Moscow away from Beijing unrealistic.\n\nMoreover, Trump's approach exposes vulnerabilities that China could exploit. His transactional and isolationist foreign policy, along with his encouragement of right-wing parties in Europe, may strain relations with European Union allies and weaken trust in American security commitments. Beijing, in turn, may view this as a sign of declining U.S. influence, giving China more room to maneuver, noticeably in regard to Taiwan.\n\nRather than increasing the chances of a Sino-Russia split, such a shift could instead divide an already fragile Western coalition.\n\nLinggong Kong , Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science, Auburn University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "'Great benefit': How a Trump-Putin summit may lead to Greenland, Panama Canal handover\n\nWith President Donald Trump back in office, the United States' approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin is already remarkably warmer. And a proposed summit between Trump and Putin could result in Trump getting some of his biggest wishes fulfilled.\n\nIn a Wednesday analysis , Daily Beast chief national correspondent David Gardner wrote about the prospect of a summit in Fiji between Trump, Putin and possibly even Chinese President Xi Jinping during Trump's second term. Garnder pointed to a 2024 Vanity Fair article by Russian opposition journalist Mikhail Zygar, who wrote that a potential new cold war between China and the U.S. could be brokered by Russia - and that Putin's regime could come out much stronger as a result.\n\nZygar recalled how the Yalta summit (which took place at a resort in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula) in the wake of World War II - which involved the United States, Great Britain and Russia - resulted in then-Russian leader Josef Stalin adding vast swaths of Eastern Europe to the U.S.S.R., Additionally, all three secured permanent positions for themselves on the United Nations' powerful Security Council of the United Nations.\n\nThat power structure remained in place for decades until the U.S.S.R.'s collapse in 1991. Gardner posited that a \"Yalta 2.0\" summit in Fiji could lead to a new power structure in which, once again, Russia comes out on top. And it may even lead to Trump's own ambitions of adding new U.S. territories coming to fruition.\n\n\"Trump has made his interest clear in Greenland, Canada, and the Panama Canal. Xi covets Taiwan and the South China Sea, potentially the world's next big flashpoint,\" Gardner wrote. \"And while Putin may not get carte blanche to reclaim Eastern Europe, he would at least guarantee being back on the superpower big table.\"\n\nWhile no summit has been officially proposed, Trump has floated the idea of meeting Putin in Saudi Arabia after the two leaders spoke about Ukraine on Wednesday. Trump said there was a \"great benefit\" to the two countries working together, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signaled that the Trump administration could back the idea of Ukraine ceding the Crimean Peninsula - which Russia has illegally occupied since 2014 - and some or even all of the contested territory in Ukraine's Donbass region in the east as part of a ceasefire agreement. Hegseth also hinted that the U.S. would not supporting a bid by Ukraine to join the NATO alliance.\n\nSince his second term began, Trump has repeatedly asserted that he intends to purchase Greenland from Denmark , though Denmark has insisted that the island is not for sale. He has also indicated he hopes to have the U.S. control the Panama Canal during his second term, and has not ruled out using the military to take the canal from Panama."

But President Donald Trump , in contrast, isn't nearly as critical of Putin.\n\nThe Guardian's Stephanie Kirchgaessner, in an article published on March 1 , reports that \"two recent incidents\" point to the United States \"no longer characterizing Russia as a cybersecurity threat.\"\n\n\"The Trump Administration has publicly and privately signaled that it does not believe Russia represents a cyber threat against U.S. national security or critical infrastructure, marking a radical departure from longstanding intelligence assessments,\" Kirchgaessner explains . \"The shift in policy could make the U.S. vulnerable to hacking attacks by Russia, experts warned, and appeared to reflect the warming of relations between Donald Trump and Russia's president, Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nKirchgaessner notes that when Liesyl Franz, deputy assistant secretary for international cybersecurity at the U.S. State Department, recently spoke at a United Nations gathering on cybersecurity, she mentioned Iran and the People's Republic of China but made \"no mention of Russia in her remarks.\"\n\n\"In contrast to Franz's statement,\" Kirchgaessner observes , \"representatives for U.S. allies in the European Union and the UK focused their remarks on the threat posed by Moscow, with the UK pointing out that Russia was using offensive and malicious cyberattacks against Ukraine alongside its illegal invasion.\"\n\nThe Guardian reporter also points out that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) - which is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - \"did not mention Russia\" in a recent memo describing \"new priorities for the agency.\"\n\nA Guardian source described as someone \"familiar with the matter\" told the publication, \"Russia and China are our biggest adversaries.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nThe National Security Agency was reportedly aware of vulnerabilities in the messaging app Signal weeks before 18 top Trump administration national security and defense officials used the app in a group chat to plan the recent bombing of Yemen. Those vulnerabilities, an NSA memo warned, were being exploited by Russian hackers. Details have also emerged that at least two top administration officials who were in the chat were overseas, including one in Moscow - where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin .\n\nThe use of the Signal app by the upper echelon of Donald Trump's national security and defense team has rocked the nation, fueling concerns over the mishandling of sensitive-and potentially classified-information in ways that may be unlawful. These fears are seemingly compounded by Trump's alleged mishandling of hundreds of classified documents, which led to criminal charges that were ultimately dropped after the U.S. Supreme Court granted presidents broad immunity from prosecution for official acts.\n\nCBS News reports that the National Security Agency (NSA), an arm of the Pentagon, had \"sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees in February 2025 warning them of vulnerabilities in using the encrypted messaging application Signal.\"\n\nThe NSA operates under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nThe Pentagon also sent out a memo warning of Signal's vulnerabilities and use by Russian hackers, just days after that group chat.\n\nRELATED: 'Sloppy, Careless, Incompetent': National Security Chiefs Slammed in Senate Hearing\n\n\"Several days after top national security officials accidentally included a reporter in a Signal chat about bombing the Houthi sites in Yemen, a Pentagon-wide advisory warned against using the messaging app, even for unclassified information,\" NPR reported Tuesday.\n\n\"Russian professional hacking groups are employing the 'linked devices' features to spy on encrypted conversations,\" the Pentagon's memo warned.\n\nIt also notes that Google has identified Russian hacking groups who are \"targeting Signal Messenger to spy on persons of interest.\"\n\nThe Pentagon memo reminded users that \"third-party messaging apps (e.g. Signal) are permitted by policy for unclassified accountability/recall exercises but are not approved to process or store non-public unclassified information.\"\n\nNPR's Quil Lawrence noted that \"NPR has seen DoD memo as far back as 2023 prohibiting mobile apps for discussing even much less sensitive info like 'controlled unclassified information.'\"\n\nLast month, a Google Threat Intelligence memo warned of the use of apps like Signal by \"military personnel, politicians, journalists, activists, and other at-risk communities.\"\n\nCritics argue that the use of Signal for \"war plans\" was against policy. During Tuesday's Senate Intelligence Committee hearing CIA Director John Ratcliffe had insisted Signal was approved for use .\n\nNational security experts, including at least one former Trump administration official , have been highly critical of the use of the app by the 18-members in a chat.\n\nRELATED: 'Who Exactly Is Running the Government?': Trump's War Plans Leak Denial Backfires\n\nPresident Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff \"was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials - and inadvertently, one journalist - on the messaging app Signal,\" CBS News reported on Tuesday. \"Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.\"\n\nTrump's Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, acknowledged on Tuesday during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that she was overseas during the Signal chat. The Associated Press reported the DNI \"wouldn't say whether she was using her personal or government-issued phone because the matter is under review by the White House National Security Council.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's chief foreign-affairs correspondent Yaroslav Trofimov appears to be one of the first to note that Witkoff had been in Moscow during the time the chat had been organized. He notes : \"The Signal app itself has high encryption. But if your phone is inside Russia, and especially if your WiFi and Bluetooth are not disabled, Russia can see what is inside your phone pretty easily.\"\n\nOn Tuesday morning, U.S. Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) noted : \"Not a single person out of 18 of the very most senior officials in this Admin - including the Director of National Intelligence and the CIA Director - voiced any concern with highly classified military plans circulated on Signal. You also can be sure this is not the only time.\"\n\nThe Atlantic's Dr. Norman Ornstein, a political scientist and scholar, responded to Congressman Goldman, writing : \"Putin is giddy. He has compromised the phones of every top national security official in the Trump administration. No doubt has enough juicy information from what is likely to be multiple Signal chats to deeply damage American security. And possibly to blackmail some of them.\"\n\nRELATED: Trump Shrugs Off Signalgate, Backs Advisor at Center of National Security Scandal"

      "text": "What we learned from Trump and Putin's phone call\n\nDaily newspapers with covers, dedicated to the recent phone call of Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, are laid out at a newsstand in a street in Moscow, Russia, February 13, 2025.\n\nAnnalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, spoke for much of the European diplomatic community when she reacted to news of Donald Trump's phone chat with Vladimir Putin: \"This is the way the Trump administration operates,\" she declared. \"This is not how others do foreign policy, but this is now the reality.\"\n\nThe resigned tone of Baerbock's words was not matched by her colleague, defence minister Boris Pistorius, whose criticism that \"the Trump administration has already made public concessions to Putin before negotiations have even begun\" was rather more direct.\n\nTheir sentiments were echoed, not only by European leaders, but in the US itself: \"Putin Scores a Big Victory, and Not on the Battlefield\" read a headline in the New York Times. The newspaper opined that Trump's call had succeeded in bringing Putin back in from the cold after three years in which Russia had become increasingly isolated both politically and economically.\n\nThis was not lost on the Russian media, where commentators boasted that the phone call \"broke the west's blockade\". The stock market gained 5% and the rouble strengthened against the dollar as a result.\n\nReflecting on the call, Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, continued with operation flatter Donald Trump by comparing his attitude favourably with that of his predecessor in the White House, Joe Biden. \"The previous US administration held the view that everything needed to be done to keep the war going. The current administration, as far as we understand, adheres to the point of view that everything must be done to stop the war and for peace to prevail.\n\n\"We are more impressed with the position of the current administration, and we are open to dialogue.\"\n\nTrump's conversation with Putin roughly coincided with a meeting of senior European defence officials in Brussels which heard the new US secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, outline America's radical new outlook when it comes to European security. Namely that it's not really America's problem any more.\n\nHegseth also told the meeting in Brussels yesterday that the Trump administration's position is that Nato membership for Ukraine has been taken off the table, that the idea it would get its 2014 borders back was unrealistic and that if Europe wanted to guarantee Ukraine's security as part of any peace deal, that would be its business. Any peacekeeping force would not involve American troops and would not be a Nato operation, so it would not involve collective defence.\n\nInternational security expert David Dunn believes that the fact that Trump considers himself a consummate deal maker makes the fact that his administration is willing to concede so much ground before negotiations proper have even got underway is remarkable . And not in a good way.\n\nDunn, who specialises in US foreign and security policy at the University of Birmingham, finds it significant that Trump spoke with Putin first and then called Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky to fill him in on the call. This order of priority, says Dunn, is a sign of the subordination of Ukraine's role in the talks.\n\nHe concludes that \"for the present at least, it appears that negotiations will be less about pressuring Putin to bring a just end to the war he started than forcing Ukraine to give in to the Russian leader's demands\".\n\nHegseth's briefing to European defence officials, meanwhile, came as little surprise to David Galbreath. Writing here , Galbreath - who specialises in defence and security at the University of Bath - says the US pivot away from a focus on Europe has been years in the making - \"since the very end of the cold war\".\n\nThere has long been a feeling in Washington that the US has borne too much of the financial burden for European security. This is not just a Donald Trump thing, he believes, but an attitude percolating in US security circles for some decades. Once the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union disintegrated, the focus for Nato become not so much collective defence as collective security, where \"conflict would be managed on Nato's borders\".\n\nBut it was the US which invoked article 5 of the Nato treaty, which establishes that \"an armed attack against one or more [member states] in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all\". The Bush government invoked Article 5 the day after the 9/11 attacks and Nato responded by patrolling US skies to provide security.\n\nGalbreath notes that many European countries, particularly the newer ones such as Estonia and Latvia, sent troops to Iraq and Afghanistan. \"The persistent justification I heard in the Baltic states was \"we need to be there when the US needs us so that they will be there when we need them\".\n\nThat looks set to change.\n\nThe prospect of a profound shift in the world order are daunting after 80 years in which security - in Europe certainly - was guaranteed by successive US administrations and underpinned, not just by Nato but by a whole set of international agreements.\n\nNow, instead of the US acting as the \"world's policeman\", we have a president talking seriously about taking control of Greenland, one way or another, who won't rule out using force to seize the Panama Canal and who dreams of turning Gaza into a coastal \"riviera\" development.\n\nMeanwhile Russia is engaged in a brutal war of conquest in Ukraine and is actively meddling in the affairs of several other countries. And in China, Xi Jinping regularly talks up the idea of reunifying with Taiwan, by force if necessary, and is fortifying islands in the South China Sea with a view to aggressively pursuing territorial claims there as well.\n\nAnd we thought the age of empires was in the rear view mirror, writes historian Eric Storm of Leiden University. Storm, whose speciality is the rise of nation states, has discerned a resurgence of imperial tendencies around the world and fears that the rules-based order that has dominated the decades since the second world war now appears increasingly tenuous.\n\nIn any given week, you'd expect the imminent prospect of the collapse of the Gaza ceasefire to be the big international story. And certainly, while Trump and Putin were \"flooding the zone\" (see last week's round-up for the origins of this phrase) the prospects of the deal lasting beyond its first phase have become more and more uncertain.\n\nHamas has recently pulled back from its threat not to release any more hostages. Earlier in the week it threatened to call a halt to the hostage-prisoner exchange, claiming that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had  breached the terms of the ceasefire deal. Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, responded - with Trump's backing - saying that unless all hostages were released on Saturday, all bets were off and the IDF would resume its military operations in the Gaza Strip. Trump added that \"all hell is going to break out\".\n\nThe US president has also doubled down on his idea for a redeveloped Gaza and has continued to pressure Jordan and Egypt to accept millions of Palestinian refugees. This, as you would expect, has not made the population of Gaza feel any more secure.\n\nNils Mallock and Jeremy Ginges, behavioural psychologists at the London School of Economics, were in the region last month and conducted a survey of Israelis and Palestinians in Gaza to get a feel for how the two populations regard each other. It makes for depressing reading.\n\nThe number of Israelis who reject the idea of a two-state solution has risen sharply since the October 7 2023 attacks by Hamas, from 46% to 62%. And roughly the same proportion of people in Gaza can now no longer envisage living side by side with Israelis. Both sides think that the other side is motivated by hatred, something which is known to make any diplomatic solution less feasible.\n\nWe also asked Scott Lucas, a Middle East specialist at University College Dublin, to assess the likelihood of the ceasefire lasting into phase two, which is when the IDF is supposed to pull out of Gaza, allowing the people there room to being to rebuild, both physically and in terms of governance.\n\nHe responded with a hollow laugh and a shake of the head, before sending us this digest of the key developments in the Middle East crisis this week.\n\nWe've become very used to seeing apocalyptic photos of the devastation of Gaza: the pulverised streets, choked with rubble, that make the idea of rebuilding seem so remote. But the people of Gaza also cultivated a huge amount of crops - about half the food they ate was grown there. Gazan farmers grew  tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and strawberries in open fields as well as cultivating olive and citrus trees.\n\nGeographers Lina Eklund, He Yin and Jamon Van Den Hoek have analysed satellite images across the Gaza Strip over the past 17 months to work out the scale of agricultural destruction. It makes for terrifying reading .\n\nJonathan Este , Senior International Affairs Editor, Associate Editor, The Conversation\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "How Putin, Xi and now Trump are ushering in a new imperial age\n\nA dog is seen next to an artwork depicting U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping at an exhibition, which is called \"Yalta 2.0\" and opened to make a reference to the 1945 Yalta Conference, at an art gallery in Livadia park in Yalta, Crimea, February 8, 2025.\n\nOver the past few weeks the new US president, Donald Trump , has repeatedly claimed that the United States should \"take back\" the Panama Canal and that it should assume control of Greenland - one way or another. He has talked of Canada becoming America's 51st state and now he even wants to \"take over\" the Gaza Strip to convert it into a \"Riviera\" on the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nIt's as if the US president believes that his country should be an empire. In this Trump seems to be emulating China's Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin of Russia, leaders he has said he admires and who have themselves shown some clear imperial tendencies in recent years.\n\nUnder Putin, Russia has supported secessionist regions, such as Transnistria and Abkhazia, fought wars in Georgia and Ukraine and actively interfered in the affairs of Syria and assorted African countries. In 2022 Russia even launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, claiming that Ukraine was historically inseparable from Russia , but that hostile western influences were trying to destroy that unity.\n\nChina, meanwhile, has militarised a number of small uninhabited islands in the South China Sea. It has built 27 installations on disputed islands in the Spratly and Paracel island group that are also claimed by other countries including Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia. This has prompted a flurry of development , as other countries in the region have raced to establish their own footholds in the disputed, but very resource-rich, region.\n\nBeijing also maintains its claim over Taiwan, which it says is an inalienable part of China which it wants to \"come home\" .\n\nMost people assumed that the age of empires had been relegated to the dustbin of history. But this is by no means a straightforward proposition. Until relatively recently, the rise and fall of empires had dominated much of recorded history. Nation-states only appeared at the end of the 18th century . And as those states rose to prominence many too displayed imperial inclinations.\n\nSo the US, fresh from throwing off the yoke of the British empire, wasted little time in expanding its borders westward , acquiring - whether by conquest or purchase - large swaths of new territory in what effectively turned a small group of east coast states into a continental empire.\n\nMeanwhile other newly minted nation-states such as Italy and Germany also aspired to acquire overseas empires and involved themselves, with varying success, building what turned out to be relatively shortlived colonial empires in Africa and elsewhere.\n\nMost traditional dynastic empires, meanwhile, began to adopt various aspects of the nation-state model, such as conscription, legal equality and political participation. The decades following the second world war are often seen by historians as a period of decolonisation by traditional imperial powers such as Britain and France. But the transition from empire to nation-states was far from smooth. Most imperial governments hoped to transform their empires into more egalitarian commonwealths, while retaining a degree of influence.\n\nThis they did with varying degrees of success and often under extreme duress, as with France in Algeria and Vietnam, or under great economic pressure, such as with Britain and India . The real age of the nation-state didn't begin until the 1960s.\n\nToday, the world consists of about 200 independent countries , the overwhelming majority nation-states. Nonetheless, one could argue that empires - or at least imperial tendencies - have never totally disappeared. France, for instance, frequently interfered in many of its former colonies in Africa. However, these military interventions were not meant to permanently occupy new territories.\n\nToday, imperial tendencies seem to resurface around the world. The past, however, tends not to repeat itself. Massive wars of conquest or attempts to create new overseas empires are unlikely in the immediate future. Most imperial expansions are currently sought close to home.\n\nWhat is striking is that Putin, Xi and Trump all use fierce nationalist rhetoric to justify their imperialist designs. Putin, as we have seen, claims the indivisibility of Ukraine and Russia and blames \"Nazis\" for trying to turn Russia's sister state towards the west. He used it as a justification for invading Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nXi, in turn, often maintains that Communist China has finally overcome the century of humiliation , in which the country was the plaything of foreign powers. They both seem to yearn for past imperial greatness. The Russian Federation aims to undo the dissolution of the Soviet Union, communist China looks back to the Qing empire . Interestingly, under its increasingly authoritarian leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey - another regional power with imperial inclinations - similarly finds inspiration in the Ottoman Empire .\n\nThe US case seems to be more complex, but in fact is very similar. Thus, Trump argues that the Panama Canal, which has long been administered by the US, was foolishly returned to Panama by Jimmy Carter and claims that it is now controlled by China. He will, he says, return it to the US .\n\nTrump also refers to America's \"Manifest Destiny\" , the 19th-century belief that American settlers were destined to expand to the Pacific coast. These days his aspirations are northwards rather than to the west. The president also wants to plant the US flag on Mars, taking his imperial dreams into outer space.\n\nIf the US joins China and Russia in violating recognised borders, the international, rights-based order could be in danger. The signs are not very positive. Taking steps to illegally annex territories could blow up the entire international edifice.\n\nEric Storm , Senior Lecturer in General History, Leiden University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "How Putin seized control of the GOP\n\nThere's little doubt that Russian President Vladimir Putin has succeeded in achieving near-total control over the Republican Party. They're gutting aid to Ukraine (and have been for over a year), working to kneecap our economy, whipping up hatred among Americans against each other, promoting civil war, and openly embracing replacing American democracy with authoritarian autocracy.\n\nPutin has declared war on queer people, proclaimed Russia a \"Christian nation,\" and shut down all the media he called \"fake news.\" Check, check, check.\n\nMost recently, the three-year \"Biden bribery\" hysteria Republicans in the House have been running - including thousands of hits on Fox \"News\" and all over rightwing hate radio - turns out to have been a Russian intelligence operation originally designed to help Trump win the 2020 election. The Russian spy who'd been feeding this phony info to \"Gym\" Jordan and James \"Gomer Pyle\" Comer is now in jail.\n\nREAD: The problem isn't just Biden's age\n\nOver the past two years, as America was using Russia's terrorist attacks on Ukraine to degrade the power and influence of Russia's military, Putin was using social media, Republican politicians, and rightwing American commentators to get Republican politicians on his side and thus kill off US aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe war in Gaza is making it even easier, with Putin-aligned politicians like Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) tweeting : \"Any funding for Ukraine should be redirected to Israel immediately.\"\n\nRussia's battlefield, in other words, has now shifted from Ukraine to the US political system and our homes via radio, TV, and the internet, all in the hopes of ending US aid to the democracy they've brutally attacked.\n\nAnd the momentum is following that shift: Russia is close to having the upper hand in Ukraine because of Putin's ability - via Trump and Johnson - to get Republican politicians to mouth his talking points and propaganda.\n\nNow, with Speaker \"Moscow Mike\" Johnson shutting down the House of Representatives so nobody can offer a discharge petition that would force a vote on Ukraine aid (and aid for Palestinian refugees, Taiwan, and our southern border), it's becoming more and more clear that Vladimir Putin is running the Republican party via his well-paid stooge, Donald Trump.\n\nI say \"well paid\" because Donald Trump would have been reduced to homelessness in the early 1990s if it weren't for Russian money, as both of his sons have said at different times. He'd burned through all of his father's estate, even stealing a large part of it from his siblings. He'd lost or hidden almost two billion dollars running a casino.\n\nAs Michael Hirsch noted for Foreign Policy magazine:\n\nHe'd been forced to repeatedly declare bankruptcy - sticking American banks for over a billion dollars in unpaid bills - after draining his businesses of free cash and stashing the money in places he hoped nobody would ever find.\n\nNo American bank would touch him, and property developers in New York were waiting for his entire little empire to collapse. Instead, a desperate Trump reached out to foreign dictators and mobsters, who were more than happy to supply funds to an influential New York businessman...for a price to be paid in the future.\n\nHe sold over $100 million worth of condos to more than sixty Russian citizens during that era, and partnered with professional criminals and money launderers to raise money for Trump properties in Azerbaijan and Panama. According to Trump himself, he sold $40 to $50 million worth of apartments to the Saudis.\n\nHe then partnered with a former high Soviet official, Tevfik Arif, and a Russian businessman, Felix Sater, who'd been found guilty of running a \"huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia.\"\n\nAs the founders of Fusion GPS wrote for The New York Times in 2018:\n\nThus, when it came time to run for president, Trump had to pay the price. He and the people around him were inundated with offers of \"help\" from Russians, most associated directly with Putin or the Russian mafia.\n\nTrump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had been paid millions by Putin's oligarchs and ran Trump's campaign for free. Reporters found over a dozen connections between Russia and the Trump campaign, and during the 2016 campaign Trump was secretly negotiating a deal to open a Trump tower in Moscow. Trump's son and his lawyer met with Putin's agents in Trump Tower.\n\nPutin's personal troll army, the Internet Research Agency (IRA) based out of St. Petersburg but operating worldwide, began a major campaign in 2016 to get Trump elected president.\n\nManafort fed Russian intelligence raw data from internal Republican polling that identified a few hundred thousand individuals in a half-dozen or so swing states the GOP thought could be persuaded to vote for Trump (or against Hillary), and the IRA immediately went to work, reaching out to them via mostly Facebook.\n\nMueller's report and multiple journalistic investigations have noted that the most common message out of Russia then was directed at Democratic-leaning voters and was, essentially, \"both parties are the same so it's a waste of time to vote.\"\n\nA report from Texas-based cybersecurity company New Knowledge, working with researchers at Columbia University, concluded, as reported by The New York Times :\n\nAnd it appears to have worked in suppressing the potential Black Democratic vote in swing states.\n\nA 2018 bipartisan Senate report found the Russian efforts consequential, as the BBC headline on that analysis summarizes:\n\nThe news story summarizes :\n\nBetween the information compiled by Oxford Analytica and the details passed along from the GOP to Prigozhin via Manafort, a mere margin of 43,000 votes across a handful of swing states -all microtargeted by Russia - handed the electoral college to Trump, even though he lost the nationwide vote to Hillary Clinton by almost 3 million ballots.\n\nSo now Trump has succeeded in making the entire GOP a party to his long-term debt to Putin and his oligarchs. \"Moscow Mike\" Johnson has blocked any aid to Ukraine for over a year; the last congressional appropriation for foreign aid was passed in 2022, when Nancy Pelosi ran the House.\n\nMeanwhile, under Trump's and Putin's direction, Republicans in Congress are doing everything they can to damage the people of the United States.\n\nThey believe it will help them in the 2024 election if they can ruin the US economy while convincing American voters that our system of government is so corrupt (\"deep state\") that we should consider replacing democracy with an autocratic strongman form of government like Putin's Russia. Tucker Carlson is even suggesting that Russia is a better place to live than the US.\n\nThey revel in pitting racial, religious, and gender groups against each other while embracing a form of fascism that pretends to be grounded in Christianity, all while welcoming Putin's social media trolls who are promoting these divisions.\n\nRepublican-aligned think tanks are working on Project 2025, a naked attempt to consolidate power in the White House to support a strongman president who can override the will of the people, privatize Social Security and Medicare, shut down our public school system, fully criminalize abortion and homosexuality (Sam Alito called for something like that this week), and abandon our democratic allies in favor of a realignment with Russia, China, and North Korea.\n\nTrump got us here by openly playing to the fears and prejudices of white people who are freaked out by the rapid post-1964 \"browning\" of America. Putin jumped in to help amplify the message a thousandfold with his social media trolls, who are posting thousands of times a day as you read these words.\n\nNow that Putin largely controls the GOP, today's question is how far Republicans are willing to go in their campaign to bring the USA to her knees on behalf of Putin and Trump.\n\n- When Congress comes back into session next week, will they take up Ukraine aid?\n\n- Will they continue their opposition to comprehensive immigration and border reform?\n\n- Will they keep pushing to privatize Social Security with their new \"commission\"?\n\n- Will they work as hard to kneecap Taiwan on behalf of President Xi as they have Ukraine on behalf of Putin?\n\n- Will they continue to quote Russian Intelligence propaganda in their effort to smear President Biden?\n\n- Instead of just 7 Republicans going to Moscow to \"celebrate\" the Fourth of July, will the entire party move their event to that city like the NRA did? Or to Budapest, like CPAC did?\n\nOr will the GOP suddenly start listening to the rational voices left in their party, the Mitt Romneys and Liz Cheneys who still believe in democracy (even if they want to gut the social safety net and turn loose the polluters)?\n\nAs the old curse goes, we live in interesting times. Stay tuned...\n\nNOW READ: If Trump takes power again, he'll owe it to one of the richest Americans alive - in 1920"

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for Trump's Return , a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nHistorians like to play a parlor game called periodization, in which they attempt to define an era, often by identifying it with the individual who most shaped the times: the Age of Jackson , the Age of Reagan . Usually, this exercise requires many decades of hindsight, but not so in the 21st century.\n\nOver the past 25 years, the world has bent to the vision of one man. In the course of a generation, he not only short-circuited the transition to democracy in his own country, and in neighboring countries, but set in motion a chain of events that has shattered the transatlantic order that prevailed after World War II. In the global turn against democracy, he has played, at times, the role of figurehead, impish provocateur, and field marshal. We are living in the Age of Vladimir Putin.\n\nPerhaps, that fact helps explain why Donald Trump's recent excoriation of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office felt so profound. The moment encapsulated Putin's ultimate victory, when the greatest impediment to the realization of the Russian president's vision, the United States, became his most powerful ally. But Trump's slavish devotion to the Russian leader-his willingness to help Putin achieve his maximalist goals-is merely the capstone of an era.\n\nNothing was preordained about Putin's triumph. Twenty years ago, in fact, his regime looked like it might not survive. With the color revolutions in Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan, Russian influence in its old Soviet satellites quickly withered. The threat was that democratic revolution would spread ever closer to the core of the old empire, Moscow, as it had in the dying days of communism. Indeed, as Putin prepared to return to Russia's presidency in 2012, after a stint as prime minister, protests swelled in Moscow and spread to other Russian cities, and then kept flaring for more than a year.\n\nRead: Putin is loving this\n\nPreserving his power, both at home and abroad, necessitated a new set of more aggressive tactics. Resorting to the old KGB playbook, which Putin internalized as a young officer in the Soviet spy agency, Russia began meddling in elections across Europe, illicitly financing favored candidates, exploiting social media to plant conspiracy theories, creating television networks and radio stations to carry his messaging into the American and European heartlands.\n\nJust as the Soviet Union used the international communist movement to advance its goals, Putin collected his own loose network of admirers, which included the likes of the French right-wing leader Marine Le Pen , the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson , and Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon , who venerated Putin for waging a robust counteroffensive on behalf of traditional values, by claiming the mantle of anti-wokeness. The fact that so many Western elites abhorred him titillated these foreign fans.\n\nPutin's objectives were always clear: He craved less hostile leaders in the West, people who would work to dismantle NATO and the European Union from within. Above all, he hoped to discredit democracy as a governing system, so that it no longer held allure for his own citizens. Scanning this list, I'm dismayed to see how many of these objectives have been realized over time, especially in the first weeks of the second Trump administration\n\nOne of Putin's core objectives was the protection of his own personal fortune, built on kickbacks and money quietly skimmed from public accounts. Protecting this ill-gotten money, and that of his inner circle, relies on secrecy, misdirection, and theft, all values anathema to democracy.\n\nRead: The simple explanation for why Trump turned against Ukraine\n\nKleptocrats, in the mold of Russian oligarchy, ardently desire to sock away their money in the relative safety and quiet anonymity of American real estate and banks. Not so long ago, a bipartisan consensus joined together to pass laws that would make it harder for foreign kleptocrats to abuse shell companies to move their cash to these shores. But, as one of his first orders of business, Trump has shredded those reforms. His Treasury Department announced that it would weaken enforcement of the Corporate Transparency Act; his Justice Department disbanded a task force charged with targeting Russian oligarchs and relaxed the Foreign Agents Registration Act, such that Putin's allies can hire lawyers and lobbyists without having to worry about the embarrassing disclosure of those relationships. The Trump administration has essentially announced that the American financial system is open for Russia's kleptocratic business.\n\nAs Putin has sought to impose his vision on the world, Ukraine has been the territory he most covets, but also the site of the fiercest resistance to him-a country that waged revolution to oust his cronies and that has resisted his military onslaught. Until last week, the United States served as the primary patron of this Ukrainian resistance. But the Trump administration has surrendered that role, thereby handing Russia incredible battlefield advantages. Because the Trump administration has cut off arms to Ukraine, it will exhaust caches of vital munitions in a few months , so it must hoard its stockpiles, limiting its capacity to fend off Russian offensives. Because the U.S. has stopped sharing intelligence with Kyiv, the Ukrainian army will be without America's ability to eavesdrop on Russia's war plans. All of these decisions will further demoralize Ukraine's depleted, weary military.\n\nJust three years ago, as European and American publics draped themselves in Ukrainian flags, Putin's Russia seemed consigned to international isolation and ignominy. For succor and solidarity, Putin was forced to turn to North Korea and Iran, an axis of geopolitical outcasts. But Trump is bent on reintegrating Putin into the family of nations. He wants Russia restored to the G7, and it's only a matter of time before he eases up on sanctions that the Biden administration imposed on Russia. And Trump has done more than offer a place among the nations. By repeating Russia's own self-serving, mendacious narrative about the origins of the Ukraine war, he lent American legitimacy and moral prestige to Putin.\n\nThe Russian leader's rise wasn't uninterrupted, but the ledger is filled with his victories, beginning with Brexit, an event he deeply desired and worked to make happen. That was a mere omen. His populist allies in France and Germany now constitute the most powerful opposition blocs in those countries. Within the European Union, he can count on Viktor Orbán to stymie Brussels when it is poised to act against Russian interests. Meanwhile, the European Union's foreign-policy chief claims that the \"free world needs a new leader,\" and former heads of NATO worry for the organization's very survival.\n\nGarry Kasparov: The Putinization of America\n\nPutin is winning, because he's cunningly exploited the advantages of autocracy. His near-total control of his own polity allows him to absorb the economic pain of sanctions, until the West loses interest in them. His lack of moral compunction allowed him to sacrifice bodies on the battlefield, without any pang of remorse, an advantage of expendable corpses that Ukraine can never match. Confident in the permanence of his power, he has patiently waited out his democratic foes, correctly betting that their easily distracted public would lose interest in fighting proxy wars against him.\n\nWhat's most devastating about Putin's reversal of fortune is that he read Western societies so accurately. When he railed against the decadence of the West and the flimsiness of its democracy, he wasn't engaging in propaganda, he was accurately forecasting how his enemy would abandon its first principles. He seemed to intuit that the idealism of American democracy might actually vanish, not just as a foreign-policy doctrine, but as the consensus conviction of its domestic politics.\n\nNow, with a like-minded counterpart in the White House, he no longer needs to make a case against democracy to his own citizens. He can crow that the system is apparently so unappealing that even the United States is moving away from it."

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nW e are barely a month into the second presidential term of Donald Trump and he has made his top priorities clear: the destruction of America's government and influence and the preservation of Russia's.\n\nUnleashing Elon Musk and his DOGE cadres on the federal government, menacing Canada and European allies, and embracing Vladimir Putin's wish list for Ukraine and beyond are not unrelated. These moves are all strategic elements of a plan that is familiar to any student of the rise and fall of democracies, especially the \"fall\" part.\n\nThe sequence is painfully familiar to me personally, because I marched in the streets as it played out in Russia at the start of the 21st century. With ruthless consistency, and the tacit approval of Western leaders, Putin and his oligarch supporters used his fair-ishly elected power to make sure that elections in Russia would never matter again.\n\nOf course, American institutions and traditions are far stronger than Russia's fragile post-Soviet democracy was when Putin took over from Boris Yeltsin, who had already done his share of damage before anointing the former KGB lieutenant colonel to be his successor in 1999. But those who dismissed my warnings that yes, it can happen here at the start of Trump's first term, in 2017, got quieter after the insurrection on January 6, 2021, and are almost silent now.\n\nTrump's personal affinity for dictators was apparent early on. His praise for Putin and other elected leaders turned strongmen, such as Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Hungary's Viktor Orbán, was tinged with undisguised envy. No feisty parliament to wrangle. The free press turned into a propaganda machine for the administration. The justice system unleashed against the opposition. Elections staged only for show. What's not to like?\n\nRead: Behind the American right's fascination with Viktor Orbán\n\nPutin and Russia always held a special place in Trump world, however. Russian intelligence and propaganda worked full-time to promote Trump once he won the Republican nomination to face Hillary Clinton in 2016. WikiLeaks, long in the service of Russian intelligence but still nurturing its old whistleblower image, fed hacked documents to a naively cooperative American media. The Mueller Report makes the degree of cooperation between various Russian assets and the Trump campaign clear- damningly so , despite years of MAGA crying \"Russia hoax\" because Special Counsel Robert Mueller decided not to prosecute.\n\nTrump made Paul Manafort his campaign chair in May 2016, turning the Russia alarm bells into air-raid sirens for anyone paying attention. Manafort was a former fixer for Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych, who attempted to thwart Ukrainians' desire to join Europe only to be deposed by the Maidan Revolution of Dignity and forced to flee to Moscow in 2014.\n\nManafort's recent expertise was mostly in money and reputation laundering. Adding him to the campaign when Trump's oddly pro-Putin rhetoric (\"strong leader,\" \"loves his country,\" \"you think our country is so innocent?\") was already drawing attention seemed a little too on the nose: Why double down? From affinity, the campaign tilted into deeply suspicious fealty toward the Kremlin. Manafort's subsequent plea of guilty for conspiracy to defraud the United States, and Trump's later pardon, only threw more wood on the raging collusion fire.\n\nR ussia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, during President Barack Obama's second term. It annexed Crimea and entered eastern Ukraine, offering up feeble pretexts about protecting Russian speakers (whom it bombed indiscriminately), Nazis in Ukraine (also, naturally, the Jews running Ukraine ), NATO expansion, and so-called Ukrainian separatists . Russia launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, in the second year of Joe Biden's presidency, attempting to take Kyiv in what the Kremlin famously planned to be a three-day special military operation. The timing led Trump and his defenders to say that he had been tough on Russia : The invasion would never have occurred on Trump's watch.\n\nNow that the second Trump administration is racing to tick off every point on Putin's long wish list, the reason for this has become clear. In Trump's second term, Putin was expecting him to abandon Ukraine, lift sanctions on Russia, create divisions within NATO, and leave Ukraine relatively defenseless before Europe could get organized to defend it. That is, exactly what is happening today.\n\nBut Trump lost to Biden in 2020, and, entering his 23rd year in power, Putin needed a new conflict to distract from the dismal conditions in Russia. Dictators always wind up needing enemies to justify why nothing has improved under their eternal rule, and once the domestic opposition is eliminated, foreign adventures are inevitable. Putin didn't expect much resistance from Ukraine or from the West, which he had successfully corrupted, bluffed, and bullied for decades. But then an unlikely hero appeared in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a former comedian and actor who, it turned out, could perform a phenomenal impression of Winston Churchill under enemy fire.\n\nUkraine's brave resistance to the supposedly overwhelming might of the Russian military lasted long enough to force the United States and Europe to join its defense, albeit reluctantly and slowly. Three long years have passed. Iranian drones crash nightly into Ukrainian civilian centers; Russian artillery and missiles reduce entire cities to rubble; China supports Russia's attempt at conquest while hungrily eyeing Taiwan. Three years of documented reports of Russian torture, rape, and the mass kidnapping of children. North Korean soldiers have arrived to fight and die in Russia's invasion, while NATO nations stand by, letting Ukrainians die in the war NATO was created to fight. Yet somehow Ukraine holds the line while Russia's military losses grow and its economy wobbles.\n\nOnce more unto the breach arrives Donald Trump, back in office with more help from the Kremlin-and the inept Democrats-ready to throw his old pal Putin a lifeline. At his side is someone new: the richest private citizen in the world, Elon Musk. (Putin controls far more money than Musk or Trump-do not underestimate how that affects their perceptions of him as the big boss.) With Musk arrives an overused and misunderstood word in the American vernacular: oligarch .\n\nRead: The party of Reagan is selling out Ukraine\n\nAlthough it's not a Russian word, post-Soviet Russia popularized its use and attempted to perfect the system it described. In the 1990s, those most capable of manipulating the newly privatized markets became the richest people in Russia. They quickly seized the levers of political power to expand their resources and fortunes, persecute their rivals, and blur the lines between public and private power until they were erased.\n\nPutin, a nondescript technocrat, was a useful front for billionaires such as Boris Berezovsky: Putin appeared to be the hard veteran of the KGB, cleaning up corruption-while what he was really doing was bringing it inside, legitimizing it, and creating a mafia state. Oligarchs could bend the knee and profit, or resist and end up in jail or in exile , their assets ripped away.\n\nRussian democracy had no institutional memory, no immune system to fight off these attacks. It was like a baby deer hit by a locomotive. The Russian Duma, purged of real opposition, became a Putin cheer squad under the new United Russia party. Judges and the security services fell in line or were removed in purges. Oversight was twisted into enforcement of the presidential will. Economic policy aimed to nationalize expenses and privatize profits, looting the country to line the pockets of a few dozen well-connected oligarchs. Foreign policy also moved out of public view, conducted by billionaires in resorts and on yachts. A flood of Russian money washed over European politicians and institutions. Kremlin troll farms and bots made social media into a national and then global weapon.\n\nIf all of this is starting to sound a little familiar, welcome to the Putinization of America, comrade! Trump's deference to the Russian autocrat has become full-blown imitation. Musk's promotion of Kremlin-friendly candidates in Germany and Romania and his attacks on Ukraine are bizarre but not random. Berezovsky, who elevated Putin to power from behind the scenes, was soon exiled and replaced with more compliant oligarchs. He also met a grisly end- found hanged at his Berkshire mansion at 67-a precedent that might give pause to anyone thinking of risking his business empire to play that gray-cardinal role for the likes of Trump and J. D. Vance.\n\nTrump didn't campaign on cutting cancer research and foreign aid any more than he did on threatening to annex Greenland and Canada or lifting sanctions on Putin's dictatorship and extorting Ukraine. What these things have in common is that they provoke conflicts with allies, which then allow him to distinguish the truly loyal.\n\nImitation and servility aren't the same thing. Trump and Musk could attempt to undermine American democracy and create a Russian-style power vertical without kowtowing to Putin or abandoning Ukraine. But they haven't. And while imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, affinity and envy aren't enough to explain the abruptness and totality of the Trump administration's adoption of every Russian position. On Monday, the anniversary of Russia's all-out invasion, the United States even joined Russia in voting against a United Nations resolution condemning Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\nRonald Reagan gave a famous speech supporting Barry Goldwater for president in 1964 in which he said, \"No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size ... A government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth.\" As a \"Reagan Communist\" myself back in the U.S.S.R., I sympathize with those who want to shrink and limit government power. But replacing it with a junta of unaccountable elites-the Putin model-is not an improvement.\n\nCutting bureaucracy isn't usually associated with despotism and power grabs. We tend to think of wannabe dictators packing the courts and increasing the size and power of the state. But that isn't what you do when you want to make the government impotent against private power- your private power. The Putin model was to weaken any state institution that might defy him and to build state power back up only when he had total control.\n\nBut why has Trump made Putin's agenda his top priority? The GOP has been compliant with every Trump move so far, but a few members still take issue with Trump calling Zelensky a dictator while cozying up to Putin. So why pick fights with his narrow congressional majorities over Russia so early, with such urgency? The same could be asked of Musk's reckless slash-and-burn tactics with DOGE, which are beginning to provoke backlash as popular programs are cut and job losses pile up, along with lawsuits.\n\nWe may never know why Trump is so perversely loyal to Putin. We don't know exactly why Musk went all in for Trump and Russia or what his deep conflicts of interest in the U.S. and China portend. But the urgency of their actions I do understand, and it's a dire warning.\n\nRead: There's a term for what Trump and Musk are doing\n\nThese are not the acts of people who expect to lose power any time soon, or ever. They are racing to the point where they will not be able to afford to lose control of the mechanisms they are ripping up and remaking in their image. What such people will do when they believe that mounting a coup is the lesser risk to their fortunes and power cannot be predicted.\n\nThere may be a Pulitzer Prize awaiting the person who discovers the answer to the question \"Why?\" But stopping Putinization-the looting by cronies, the centralization of authority, the moving of decisions into unaccountable private hands-is the vital matter of the moment. Trump admiring Putin is far less dangerous than Trump becoming him."

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nH itler regretted the deal he made with Neville Chamberlain at Munich in 1938. What he actually wanted was war-his goal was to conquer all of Czechoslovakia by force as a first step toward the conquest of all of Europe.\n\nHe didn't imagine that the British and French governments would be so craven as to give him everything he publicly asked for, including the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia and the occupation of the Sudetenland by the German army. When they did, Hitler found himself trapped into accepting, but he was unhappy. Within five months he ordered the military occupation of all Czechoslovakia, in violation of the Munich Agreement, and six months after that, he invaded Poland.\n\nToday the Trump administration is offering Vladimir Putin a Munich-like settlement for Ukraine. Trump's negotiators have offered Putin almost everything he has publicly asked for without demanding anything in return. They may assume that if they give him everything up front, he will agree to a cease-fire and some kind of deal that will save face for President Donald Trump, allowing him to claim the mantle of peacemaker, just as Chamberlain did, albeit for only a few months.\n\nWill Putin accept? At the moment, thanks to Trump's anti-Ukraine maneuvers, he has the luxury of watching Washington and Kyiv wrangle over terms while he pummels Ukraine's population and energy grid and brings the country closer to collapse. But so far, Putin has been clear about the terms he is willing to accept to achieve peace. Like Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II , his offer is this: nothing.\n\nNo security guarantee; no independent, sovereign Ukraine; perhaps not even a cease-fire. Putin's goal, as it has been from the beginning, is the incorporation of Ukraine into Russia and the complete erasure of the Ukrainian nation, language, and culture. He will gladly accept Ukraine's surrender whenever Kyiv is ready to concede, but short of that he is going to keep the war going until he takes everything.\n\nRead: Putin is loving this\n\nLet's start with security guarantees. Putin has never agreed to them for Ukraine- in any form . Putin and his spokesmen have stated repeatedly that Moscow will never accept European troops on Ukrainian soil as part of a peace deal. To accept European troops in Ukraine is no different in Putin's mind than to accept NATO presence there, as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said as recently as last week.\n\nNor is Putin's refusal hard to understand. Any deal that put Western troops on Ukrainian soil would leave Russia in an objectively worse strategic situation than before the invasion. After three years of conflict, as many as 1 million casualties, and widespread economic suffering, Putin would have succeeded only in tightening the circle of containment around Russia, including the admission to NATO of Sweden and Finland; bringing hostile forces closer to Russia's border; and substantially increasing even peacetime defense requirements. His broader ambitions in Europe would be blocked, perhaps forever. If Trump could see past the aura of his own dealmaking genius, he would see that for Putin to end the war with European troops on Ukrainian soil for any purpose would be a colossal strategic failure.\n\nPutin has also rejected the idea of an international guarantee of Ukraine's security even without troops on the ground. Early negotiations in 2022 broke down precisely over that point. Ukraine wanted an international commitment to come to Ukraine's aid in the event that Russia launched another attack-something equivalent to the Article 5 guarantee in the NATO treaty. This would not have meant foreign troops on Ukrainian soil-or even any official relationship between Ukraine and NATO-but rather a commitment by signatory states to come to a \"neutral\" Ukraine's aid if it was invaded. Putin rejected this, insisting on a Russian veto over any such action.\n\nPutin has even insisted that Ukraine should not be permitted to maintain a military capable of resisting another Russian invasion. He has demanded strict limits on the number of Ukrainian forces and rejected any notion of allowing the U.S. or Europe to continue providing weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against future attack. In short, Putin's unwavering demand in any peace settlement has been to leave Ukraine essentially defenseless.\n\nFurther, Putin has from the beginning demanded an end to the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a prior condition before any agreement. That he ever expected this demand to be met is doubtful: What nation agrees to the toppling of its government as the price for peace, except as terms of surrender? Yet he's sticking to this demand. According to reports, Trump officials are right now working to force Zelensky from power and replace him with someone presumably friendlier to Moscow. Judging by the reaction of most Ukrainians to the ambush of their president in the Oval Office, this effort will not succeed. But the fact that Trump officials are trying shows that Putin has not budged an inch in response to Trump's many concessions.\n\nHe has also not budged from his broader demand for \"de-Nazification,\" by which he means the suppression of Ukrainian as the official language of Ukraine, to be replaced by Russian, and of Ukrainian culture and nationalism, which Putin sees as tantamount to resistance to Moscow's domination. If anyone wants to know what Putin hopes to do with Ukraine once he has control, they have only to look at what he is already doing in the territories Russia occupies, where Ukrainians are being forced to become Russian citizens, and any resistance leads to imprisonment, torture, and execution.\n\nEveryone in the West seems to agree that there will be a cease-fire in Ukraine at some point. But one person who never talks about a cease-fire is Vladimir Putin. He does not talk about a cease-fire with his own people. He has at no time offered a cease-fire to the Ukrainians or the Americans. People assume he wants a cease-fire because his losses are staggering and his economy is suffering. But, as I and others have argued, Putin has to believe only that Ukraine is closer to collapse than he is, and that though he is suffering, the Ukrainians are suffering more. Trump's latest moves to paralyze Ukraine's defenses against missile and drone attacks by denying vital U.S. intelligence sharing can only bolster that assessment.\n\nPutin might be tempted to strike a Munich-like deal with Trump just to strengthen an American president who seems determined to give Putin what he may never have imagined possible-a complete American capitulation in the global struggle, the destruction of the NATO alliance, the isolation of a weak Europe, and an open field for further actions to fulfill Putin's overarching goal, which is the reconstitution of the Soviet Union and its empire in Eastern and Central Europe. This is where the Munich analogy breaks down, because whatever else Chamberlain's appeasement was, it did not include changing sides in the ongoing European crisis and joining Hitler to carve up the continent.\n\nRead: The oligarchs who came to regret supporting Hitler\n\nYet Putin may calculate that he is getting that for free already. The damage Trump has done to NATO is probably irreparable. The alliance relied on an American guarantee that is no longer reliable, to say the least. But Trump is mercurial and could reverse course, at least partially, at any time. That's a reason for Putin to seek victory as quickly as possible. He may never have a chance as good as this one to complete the task he set out to achieve when he launched his invasion three years ago.\n\nOne thing is certain: Trump is no poker player. Thanks to his actions so far, Putin hasn't had to reveal any of his cards. Trump claims to know what Putin wants, but his own actions show that he actually has no clue. One day Trump says Russia wants peace for reasons \"only I know.\" The next, he warns Putin that he'll impose more sanctions. Putin must be laughing up his sleeve. He's weathered American sanctions for the better part of three years now; more of the same is not much of a threat. If that's the only card Trump intends to play, Putin will soon be cashing in, and Ukraine will soon be doomed. Neville Chamberlain believed that Hitler wouldn't violate the Munich deal because Hitler respected him. Trump shares that delusion about Putin. We may all pay the price."

How hard is Trump willing to push for the peace he promises?\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nVladimir Putin isn't going to make this easy for Donald Trump.\n\nFor weeks, Trump has bragged about his close relationship with his Russian counterpart and declared that Putin wanted to bring a quick end to the war that he, of course, started more than three years ago. Trump's national-security team worked with Ukraine to come up with a 30-day cease-fire proposal in hopes of persuading Moscow to accept it. And his press secretary declared yesterday that Ukraine and Russia were on the \"10th yard line of peace.\"\n\nBut when the two men spoke today, Putin had his own ideas.\n\nPutin did agree during the more-than-two-hour call to halt strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, and he pledged to continue negotiations. But that limited deal fell far short of what the White House had forecast in recent days, and it now confronts Trump with a dilemma. In order to secure the peace he has promised, he might have to engage in something he has yet to do: get tough with Putin.\n\nTrump, predictably, dressed up his call with Putin as a win, posting on social media that the conversation was \"a very good and productive one.\"\n\nThe peace process \"is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of Humanity, get the job done!\" he wrote.\n\nIn truth, Putin offered next to no concessions, and his goal, according to a Kremlin readout of the call, remains maximalist: preventing Ukraine's rearmament and sovereignty. In order for him to accept Trump's full cease-fire proposal, Putin said, Ukraine would have to stop rearming its military and sending new soldiers to the front lines, and all foreign governments-including the United States and Kyiv's European allies-would have to stop sending military assistance or intelligence to Ukraine.\n\nRead: Trump is Nero while Washington burns\n\nTaken together, those demands would severely weaken Ukraine's ability to defend itself, and Trump did not agree to them in the call. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking with reporters in Ukraine after the Trump-Putin call, expressed \"skepticism\" about Putin's motivations and made clear that no lasting deal could be made without his nation's involvement. Still, he added, \"if there is a partial cease-fire, this is a positive result,\" and he signaled that Ukraine would accept the limited agreement, even though it would allow Russia to continue to pummel his nation's cities and towns.\n\nIf the strikes on energy infrastructure indeed stop, it would be the most significant mutually agreed suspension of attacks in the war. A senior White House aide framed that to me as a major achievement, the first step toward a broader peace (Trump long ago abandoned his campaign promise to end the war in 24 hours). But Trump's national-security team will now need to debate a course of action, and the aide, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations, conceded that difficult decisions lie ahead. Will Trump allow the U.S. to pressure Moscow-by toughening sanctions on Russia or increasing aid to Ukraine-to push Putin to soften his demands? Or will Trump once more defer to Putin and isolate Kyiv?\n\nThe partial cease-fire holds benefits for both sides. Ukraine has struggled for years with Russia's attacks on its energy grid, which at times have plunged cities into darkness and cold. But agreeing to the deal also was in Putin's interest-Ukraine has recently ratcheted up its attacks on gas and oil facilities deep in Russian territory, weakening Moscow's most crucial stream of revenue at a time when the nation's war-weary economy is struggling.\n\nMarc Polymeropoulos, a former U.S. intelligence official who is a Trump critic, told me that Putin's demand for an end to those strikes-and his willingness to relinquish his own military's ability to do the same-is proof that the strikes \"are having a much more severe effect than even we imagined. Putin wants them to stop. That's a pretty good measure of effectiveness.\"\n\nThat's all that Putin was willing to give up, though, and he telegraphed his intent to keep the war going or, at least, to end it only on terms that he could dictate. According to the Kremlin readout of the call, Putin insisted on the \"absolute need to eliminate the root causes of the crisis,\" which include, in Moscow's view, Ukraine seeking security guarantees from the West, such as admission to NATO or the European Union. Putin also suggested cutting Kyiv out of future negotiations, leaving the talks solely between Washington and Moscow. And his demand for a complete end to all foreign military support to Ukraine is simply a nonstarter: Even though Trump and Vice President J. D. Vance have previously threatened to discontinue American support for Kyiv, Ukraine's European partners have in recent weeks only increased their pledges.\n\n\"It's clear that Russia remains the obstacle to peace in Europe,\" Democratic Senator Chris Coons told me in a statement. \"I'm glad to see a halt on infrastructure strikes but many of Putin's 'requests'-like a ban on arms or intel sharing-make clear what he is after: a neutered Ukraine that can't defend itself.\"\n\nOf note: Neither the White House's nor the Kremlin's readout of the call described any discussions between the two leaders over the fate of the territory Russia has seized from Ukraine. Russia has claimed about 20 percent of Ukraine's land, beginning with the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. Air-raid sirens continued to go off around Ukraine today. Still, the call yielded some positives for Ukraine, which will at least for now continue to receive U.S. assistance as it tries to work out backup plans with Europe in case Trump eventually cuts off Kyiv.\n\n\"Frankly, this is the Russian playbook of using negotiations as an instrument of armed conflict,\" Polymeropoulos, the former intelligence officer, told me. \"But in the grand scheme of things, it's probably less bad than everyone imagined. At least the U.S. didn't sell Ukraine down the river.\"\n\nRead: Trump is offering Putin another Munich\n\nFew in the national-security community are counting on Trump to suddenly align himself more solidly with Kyiv. For weeks, he and his administration have embraced Moscow's view of the war in Ukraine. Trump has decreed that Zelensky is \"a dictator,\" repeated Putin's lie that Ukraine started the conflict, declared that Ukraine didn't have any \"cards\" in the negotiations, and already denied Kyiv's top wish-that it be allowed to enter NATO, the alliance designed as a bulwark against Russian aggression. The pause in U.S. intelligence-sharing and shipments of military supplies to Ukraine earlier this month allowed Moscow to make gains on the battlefield, most notably in the Russian territory of Kursk, land that had been Ukraine's strongest bargaining chip in possible upcoming negotiations. And, of course, in Trump's first term, the United States at times levied tough sanctions against Moscow, only to be undermined by the president's warm words for Putin, including during their infamous 2018 Helsinki summit.\n\nSo far, Trump hasn't done anything to suggest that he's cooling on Putin. When Zelensky didn't give Trump everything he wanted in their Oval Office meeting last month, the U.S. president berated his Ukrainian counterpart, and Trump's allies called for new elections in Kyiv. When Putin didn't give Trump everything he wanted today, the Russian leader still got a friendly Truth Social post from Trump, pledges of further talks, and possibly some hockey games featuring the best players from each country.\n\nBut there were signs that Trump wasn't happy with how Putin played his hand. Trump has rarely missed opportunities to chat with reporters during the first eight weeks of his presidency; just yesterday, he fielded questions multiple times, including when predicting that Putin wanted peace, and he often boastfully engages with the press while signing executive orders.\n\nAnother such signing was scheduled for the Oval Office this afternoon. But reporters were not invited to watch, depriving them of the chance to ask questions about the Putin call. Trump remained behind closed doors."

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nOut of all the ugly and dishonest things that Donald Trump said about Volodymyr Zelensky last week, the ugliest was not dishonest at all. \"I've been watching for years, and I've been watching him negotiate with no cards,\" Trump said of Zelensky. \"He has no cards. And you get sick of it.\"\n\nSick of it . Stop and think about that phrase. Trump inserted it into a stream of falsehoods, produced over several days, many of which he must have known to be untrue. He has been lying about the origins of the war, about Zelensky's popular support, about the levels of U.S. funding for Ukraine, about the extent of European funding, about the status of previous negotiations. But sick of it -that, at least, has the ring of truth. Trump is genuinely bored of the war. He doesn't understand it. He doesn't know why it started. He doesn't know how to stop it. He wants to change the channel and watch something else.\n\nAlso, he has no cards : That probably reflects Trump's true belief as well. For Donald Trump, the only real cards are big money and hard power. Players, in his world, are people whom no court can block, no journalist can question, no legislator can oppose. People whose money can buy anything, whose power cannot be checked or balanced.\n\nBut Trump is wrong. Zelensky might not have money, and he might not be a brutal dictator like Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping. Yet he does have other kinds of power. He leads a society that organizes itself, with local leaders who have legitimacy and a tech sector dedicated to victory-a society that has come, around the world, to symbolize bravery. He has a message that moves people to act instead of just scaring them into silence.\n\nEliot A. Cohen: Incompetence leavened with malignity\n\nToday, on the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion, stop and remember what happened on the night it began. I'd had plane tickets to Kyiv that week, but my flights were canceled, and on February 24, 2022, I stayed up and watched the war's start on television, listening to the sounds of explosions coming from the screen. That night, everyone expected Russia to overrun its much smaller neighbor. But that capitulation never came. Six weeks later, I made it to Kyiv and heard and saw what had happened instead: the hit squads that had tried to kill Zelensky; the murders of civilians in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb; the Ukrainian journalists who had driven around the country trying to tell the story; the civilians who had joined the army; the waitresses who had started cooking for the troops.\n\nThree years later, against all obstacles and all predictions, the civilians, journalists, soldiers, and waitresses are still working together. Ukraine's million-man army, the largest in Europe, is still fighting. Ukraine's civil society is still volunteering, still raising money for the troops. Ukraine's defense industry has transformed itself. In 2022, I saw tiny workshops that made drones out of what looked like cardboard and glue. In 2024, Ukrainian factories produced 1.5 million drones, and this year they will make many more. Teams of people in underground control centers now use bespoke software to hit thousands of targets every month. Their work explains why Russia has taken territory only slowly, despite being on the offensive for most of the past year. At the current rate of advance, the Institute for the Study of War estimates , Russia would need 83 years to capture the remaining 80 percent of Ukraine.\n\nRussia doesn't have the resources to fight indefinitely against that kind of organization and determination. Putin's military production is cannibalizing his country's civilian economy. Inflation has skyrocketed. The only way Putin wins now-the only way he finally succeeds in destroying Ukraine's sovereignty-is by persuading Ukraine's allies to be sick of the war.\n\nHe wins by persuading Trump to cut off Ukraine, because Zelensky has no cards, and by convincing Europeans that they can't win either. That's why Putin's money bought American influencers in Tennessee and probably many other places, too, and it's why his propaganda supported the pro-Russian far right in Germany's elections yesterday, along with other pro-Russian parties across the continent. Putin can't win on the ground, but he can win in his enemies' heads-if we let him.\n\nRobert Kagan: Trump is facing a catastrophic defeat in Ukraine\n\nEuropeans and Americans, Democrats and Republicans, can resist the temptations of boredom and distraction. We can refuse to give in to the cynicism, nihilism, and lies of Russian propaganda, even when they are repeated by the president of the United States. And we can refuse to believe that Ukraine has no cards, that we have no cards, and that the democratic world has no sources of power other than Donald Trump and Elon Musk.\n\nThree years into this war, the stakes are the same as they were on the night it began. Putin, who yesterday launched one of the largest attacks of the entire war, still seeks to destroy Ukraine's sovereignty, civil society, democracy, and freedom. He still wants to show the world that the era of American power is over, that America will not defend allies in Europe, Asia, or anywhere else. He still wants to nullify the rules and laws that kept Europe peaceful for eight decades, to create instability and fear, not only in the countries that border Russia but across the continent and even around the world.\n\nThe war will only end, truly end, when Putin gives up these goals. Don't accept any peace deal that allows him to keep them."

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nUpon hearing the news that President Donald Trump had suspended military aid to Ukraine, I sat down for some Russian must-see TV: white guys screaming about international relations. Curious to understand how Trump's Kremlin-friendly move was playing in the motherland, I wanted to compare the reaction of Russian state news to that of American right-wing channels. Pretty soon, I started thinking about that meme from The Office in which Pam holds up two photos, saying, \"Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture,\" before the camera cuts to her privately admitting, \"They're the same picture.\"\n\nOver the past few days, Russian news talk shows have consisted almost entirely of translated clips of Trump-administration officials and Trump surrogates-Vice President J. D. Vance, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, and National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, among others-defending the president and attacking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Fox News. The interview clips were interspersed with video of the fateful meeting between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office last week, along with readings, in Russian, of Trump's posts on Truth Social and Elon Musk's posts on X, which is funnier than it sounds.\n\nSoon after the Trump-Zelensky blowup, the Kremlin said that America's foreign policy now \"largely aligns with our vision.\" Across three different news shows on the state-owned Channel One and Russia-1, which take their marching orders directly from Russian President Vladimir Putin, this cozy alignment was on full display. It seemed that Russian state TV, and Putin by extension, could not be more pleased with what has been happening. The shows I watched simply broadcast clips of Trump officials, and then their all-male panels of analysts-no DEI in Russia!-echoed their exact words, approvingly.\n\nRead: The simple reason for why Trump turned against Ukraine\n\nEven when the shows' panelists admitted to some nervousness about Trump's next moves, they said his decision to cut off aid to Ukraine \"raised our spirits,\" as one guest put it. At times, they sounded like they were discussing a problematic friend who everyone agrees is crazy but who inadvertently did something useful.\n\nPanelists repeatedly made reference to Ukraine drawing the world closer to \"World War III\"-a direct quote from Trump, which has since been parroted in various U.S. media appearances by his loyalists . They fawned over Trump's prowess and insulted Zelensky; one guest called the Ukrainian president \"dust under the feet of Trump,\" an even nastier take on the man whom Trump called \"no angel\" and \"a dictator.\"\n\nOn the show The Great Game , panelists derided Zelensky as someone who believes himself, wrongly, to be \"the great leader of the West.\" One panelist referred to Zelensky's conduct during the Oval Office meeting as \"hysterical diplomacy\" and said, \"He couldn't figure out how to behave himself in the interest of his own country.\" The panelist declared that the showdown probably \"shortened the war by many months.\" Presumably, he said this because he believes Russia will win.\n\nOn Evening With Vladimir Solovyov , panelists discussed how the confirmation of Elbridge Colby, Trump's nominee for undersecretary of defense for policy, \"would be very good news for us, because the part of Trump's team that supports putting Ukraine on Europe's shoulders would be strengthened considerably,\" as one analyst put it. Solovyov noted favorably that Trump hit Europe and Zelensky \"on the nose.\" The show played a clip of Vance saying that the United States and Europe can't support Ukraine indefinitely, and one panelist heartily agreed. Actually, they all agreed-they aren't allowed to disagree-and they voiced this agreement at an eardrum-popping volume. They sounded mad, but they were very, very happy.\n\n60 Minutes -Russia's version-pointed out how reasonable Trump was being, highlighting that Trump had praised Ukrainian soldiers during the Oval Office meeting. Zelensky, however, called Vance \"J.D.,\" \"as though they are schoolyard buddies,\" and was \"biting the hand that feeds him.\" The show then played clips of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying that he wished Zelensky had said \"We love America,\" and of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard claiming on Fox News Sunday that Zelensky's government is canceling elections and silencing the opposition. (Elections there have been postponed because of the war.)\n\nThe panelist Spiridon Kilinkarov added that Zelensky \"presented not the interests of Ukraine but of the anti-Trump European globalists,\" a nearly verbatim echo of Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville's claim that Zelensky has been \"brainwashed by the globalist socialist group in Europe.\" The show played a clip of Tuberville saying on Newsmax that \"Putin and President Trump and the people on our side ... will end up making this decision for the future of Ukraine.\" They liked the sound of that.\n\nPhillips Payson O'Brien: Trump sided with Putin. What should Europe do now?\n\nAnother panelist jumped in with a claim that Zelensky once campaigned for the Democrats in Pennsylvania-a misleading statement, originally made by Vance, that referred to a fall meeting between Zelensky and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro at an ammunition plant. Then, in an ouroboros of surreality, the show played a clip of The Daily Show , which itself featured a clip of that same Russian show in which a host expressed joy at the crumbling of the U.S.-Ukraine alliance. Perhaps DOGE can make the Russian news industry more efficient by firing all its commentators and broadcasting a direct feed of One America News instead.\n\nFinally, the panelist Igor Korotchenko put a bow on everything by remarking with relief that \"Biden financed this war, but the priorities of the new administration are different.\" He suggested that the Trump administration should go further than pausing military aid, that it should have Elon Musk cut Ukraine's access to the Starlink satellite-internet system-something the Trump administration has already threatened to do.\n\n\"If Trump is able to remove Zelensky as a political figure from the global chessboard,\" Korotchenko added, \"he should be eligible for the Nobel Peace Prize.\" Darrell Issa, the Republican U.S. representative who nominated Trump for the award on Monday, couldn't have said it better himself."

      "text": "The Tragic Success of Global Putinism\n\nHow the West underestimated an ideology's animating force\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nF or three years, I was President Barack Obama's Russia adviser on the National Security Council and, for two, the U.S. ambassador to Russia. In that time, no assumption drove me crazier than this one about Russian President Vladimir Putin: \"He's a transactional leader.\" I heard this characterization dozens and dozens of times. And in my view, it expressed a fundamental misunderstanding of Putin's thinking and intentions.\n\nI first met Putin in St. Petersburg in the spring of 1990. He was in charge of international contacts for Mayor Anatoly Sobchak. I was working for the National Democratic Institute, an American NGO dedicated to advancing democracy abroad. Back then, Putin was already known as a dealmaker of the corrupt kind, using his government position to make money for newly emerging private companies and foreign investors. He's been doing that ever since, and some observers believe that it has made him the richest man in the world. But these sorts of transactions, as important as they were to his rise, don't define the whole of his project.\n\nThe Putin who has governed Russia this past quarter century is an ideologue. He has developed a strong set of ideas about how Russia should be ruled and what place it should occupy in the world. On these matters, he is not guided by rational cost-benefit analysis or dealmaking so much as by real animus against democracy, liberalism, and the West, together with a determination to resurrect the Russian empire.\n\nFor too long, we in the West have underestimated Putin's global ideological vision as an animating force for his foreign-policy agenda. The tragic consequence is that today Putinism is advancing across Europe and the United States.\n\nI n the beginning, Putin was an accidental leader. After Russia's 1998 financial crash, its president, Boris Yeltsin, and the oligarchs around him scrambled to find a viable candidate to run against the Communists in the 2000 presidential election. They settled on an obscure KGB agent, selecting Putin to become first prime minister in August 1999, then acting president at the end of 1999, and then the ruling elite's choice to succeed Yeltsin in the March 2000 election. Voters ratified Yeltsin's pick, not the other way around.\n\nRead: Putin is loving this\n\nAt the time, Putin was not anti-Western. He had not joined forces with the neo-imperialist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, or the Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. Rather, he had spent the '90s working as a mid-level bureaucrat for pro-democratic, pro-Western politicians, first Sobchak in St. Petersburg and later Yeltsin in Moscow. So the failure to anticipate his pivot away from these people and ideas is understandable.\n\nBut Putin made his disdain for democracy clear early in his rule. (I wrote about his autocratic proclivities just three weeks before Russia's 2000 election.) On other issues, he initially signaled continuity with the Yeltsin era. For instance, Putin expressed pro-Western positions, adopted free-market policies, cut corporate and income taxes, and even suggested that Russia should join NATO: \"Why not?\" Putin answered when asked this in 2000. \"I do not rule out such a possibility ... Russia is a part of European culture, and I do not consider my own country in isolation from Europe ... Therefore, it is with difficulty that I imagine NATO as an enemy.\" After the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, Putin fully embraced President George W. Bush's idea of a global war on terror and even helped the U.S. open military bases in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan to support its war effort in Afghanistan.\n\nOver time, however, Putin became less enamored with free markets and relations with the West. He began to gradually reassert state control over Russia's economy and media. In 2003, for instance, he arrested Russia's richest businessman, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and handed Khodorkovsky's oil company to one of his KGB comrades, Igor Sechin, because Khodorkovsky was becoming too active in supporting the political opposition. By 2003, all of Russia's independent television networks-TVS, TV6, and NTV-were either shut down or had become state channels.\n\nPutin initially reacted calmly to NATO expansion, announced in 2002 and completed in 2004, because he still sought cooperation with the United States. But then popular protest movements that the Kremlin came to call \"color revolutions\" brought democratic, pro-Western governments to power in Georgia in 2003 and Ukraine in 2004. Putin saw the sinister, orchestrating hand of the United States and the West behind these \"coups\" in countries too close to Russia for his comfort. At the Munich Security Conference in 2007, Putin berated the U.S. for interfering in the domestic politics of other countries in the service of its own ideas. He asserted , \"One state and, of course, first and foremost, the United States, has overstepped its national borders in every way. This is visible in the economic, political, cultural, and educational policies it imposes on other nations. Well, who likes this? Who is happy about this?\"\n\nIdeas such as freedom, democracy, and liberalism threatened Putin's autocratic style of rule. Sure enough, in 2011, what happened in Georgia and Ukraine seemed poised to occur in Russia too. That December, Russia held a parliamentary election that was falsified in Putin's favor, in the manner usual at the time. On this occasion, however, Russia's election observers documented the irregularities, and political opposition leaders mobilized the biggest nationwide demonstration since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. At Moscow's Bolotnaya Square, Russian protesters chanted for free and fair elections-also for \"Russia without Putin.\"\n\nRead: The Putinization of America\n\nPutin was frightened, and so he pushed back hard. He blamed President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and me (I arrived as the U.S. ambassador in 2012, right as these demonstrations were taking place) for fomenting regime change against him and his government. He told his citizens that the U.S. sought the destruction of Russia as a country and was using \"fifth column\" agents such as Alexei Navalny and Boris Nemtsov (both later allegedly assassinated by Putin's regime) as domestic agents to achieve these goals.\n\nAfter his return to the presidency in 2012, Putin used ever more coercive methods to weaken opposition leaders, civil society, and independent media. In 2012, he closed down USAID's operations in Russia-the very organization the Trump administration is shutting down today. Since then, Putin has consolidated his views and repressive policies, cracking down on the last remaining opposition after launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nTo justify this clampdown, Putin has evoked the defense of Russian sovereignty and conservative Christian values against the decadent liberal West. Not unlike other populists, he blamed international forces for Russia's economic woes, but his real bread-and-butter issues were cultural clashes. He devoted obsessive attention to issues of sexual orientation, blaming the West for promoting homosexuality, LGBTQ identities, and other ideas he considers deviant and antithetical to Russian culture and traditions. As he bluntly claimed at the annual forum held by the Moscow-based Valdai Discussion Club in 2013, \"Many of the Euro-Atlantic countries are actually rejecting their roots, including the Christian values that constitute the basis of Western civilization. They are denying moral principles and all traditional identities: national, cultural, religious, and even sexual. They are implementing policies that equate large families with same-sex partnerships, belief in God with the belief in Satan.\"\n\nPutin has also repeatedly attacked the liberal international order, calling it a setup to maintain American hegemonic rule over the entire world. He wants to return to a 19th-century-style world, in which a handful of great powers dominate their spheres of influence unconstrained by multilateral institutions, international laws, or global norms. If the Cold War's central ideological struggle of communism versus capitalism was between states, this new ideological struggle of illiberal nationalism versus liberal internationalism is being fought primarily within states.\n\nA fter consolidating power at home, Putin began to propagate his conservative, populist, autocratic ideas internationally, but especially in the developed world. To do so he invested heavily in several instruments of influence and used them in support of largely far-right movements across the West.\n\nHe allocated considerable resources to Russian state media operating abroad, including the flagship television network Russia Today, the Sputnik news agency, and armies of propagandists across all social-media platforms. Russia's ideological efforts in this domain were so effective in Romania's 2024 presidential election, for instance, that an obscure far-right presidential candidate, Cǎlin Georgescu, came out of nowhere and won the first round. The violation of Romanian sovereignty was assessed by intelligence services to be so acute that the country's supreme court felt compelled to cancel the second round of the election.\n\nPutin deputized the Russian Orthodox Church to nurture relations with like-minded churches in the West, including evangelical ones in the United States. He personally fostered ties between the Orthodox Church in Moscow and its counterpart in the United States, a union that later helped him win endorsement of his annexation of Crimea from many in the Russian diaspora. When I was the U.S. ambassador to Russia, I witnessed the Russian Orthodox Church's aggressive courtship of conservative Christian leaders from the United States. In 2013, Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage traveled to Moscow, where he gave a speech opposing the adoption of children by same-sex couples-something Putin sharply limited by law that same year, leading the American conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh to remark on his radio show, \"I have to tell you that it freaks me out that Vladimir Putin is saying things I agree with.\" In 2015, Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church hosted Franklin Graham, the CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, who praised Putin for \" protecting Russian young people against homosexual propaganda .\"\n\nAt the same time, Putin cultivated ties with illiberal populists across Europe. He shared with these leaders a rejection of liberalism, a commitment to traditional values, an embrace of national and ethnic identities, and a disdain for alleged constraints on sovereignty-whether those of the European Union on its members or of American \"imperialism\" on Russia. Putin's closest ideological ally in Europe is Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán-the only EU leader who did not condemn Putin's invasion of Ukraine and who subsequently tried to block EU aid to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. No European leader has done more to weaken the EU than Orbán, and weakening the EU is precisely what Putin wants.\n\nIn France, Putin has nurtured a relationship with the far-right politician Marine Le Pen, providing financial assistance for her 2017 presidential campaign and meeting her at the Kremlin that year in a public show of support. In turn, Le Pen enthused , \"The model that is defended by Vladimir Putin, which is one of reasoned protectionism, looking after the interests of his own country, defending his identity, is one that I like, as long as I can defend this model in my own country.\" In Italy, Putin has nurtured personal relations with the illiberal nationalist leader Matteo Salvini. Secret audio recordings revealed that Salvini's Lega Nord allegedly participated in backroom deals with Russian operatives to receive funds from a Russian state-owned company. The United Kingdom's Nigel Farage is a longtime Kremlin favorite thanks to his disdain for the EU; Putin's government supported Farage's Brexit campaign.\n\nShared anti-liberal and culturally reactionary values have also undergirded Putin's relationships with Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom in the Netherlands, and nationalist-conservative-party leaders in Austria, Bulgaria, and Germany. More proximately, Putin has supported the Belarusian dictator Aleksandr Lukashenko for decades, helping his autocratic partner hang onto power despite mass demonstrations following a fraudulent election in 2020. In Georgia, Putin has linked up with the billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, whose political party, Georgian Dream, has undermined democratic institutions and suspended the country's accession talks with the European Union for four years. In Ukraine, of course, Putin's man was Viktor Yanukovych, who also tried to turn his country away from European ties and ideas, only to lose power to a popular uprising in 2014.\n\nF or the past decade, however, Putin's most important target for ideological promotion was not Europe but the United States. He courted like-minded conservatives within the U.S. as a strategy for dividing and thereby weakening Russia's foremost enemy. The conservative populist Pat Buchanan was an early darling of the Russian right. More recently, several major MAGA influencers, including Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson , have embraced the militant Russian nationalist Alexander Dugin as an ideological hero . Dugin is now a regular guest on American conservative podcasts, whose hosts frequently amplify their common ideas on social media. When Elon Musk publicly stated on X at the beginning of the month that the U.S. should quit NATO and the United Nations, Dugin echoed him. American and Russian nationalists share many common enemies these days, including the \"globalists,\" the \"neocons,\" the \"gays,\" and the \"woke.\"\n\nPutin's ideological promotion in the United States turned aggressive with the Kremlin's direct meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russian cyberintelligence officers stole thousands of emails and documents from Hillary Clinton's campaign staff. They then publicized this content to embarrass the Democratic Party's presidential candidate and help the Republican Party's candidate, Donald Trump. Kremlin surrogates, in both traditional media and social media, campaigned in support of Trump and against Clinton. The extent to which these Russian efforts affected the outcome of that election is hard to measure. That Putin tried is clear.\n\nDuring his first term as president, Trump made his support for Putin, his ideas, and his style of rule explicit. He never once criticized the Russian dictator over his human-rights record or anything else, but instead praised him as a strong leader. Unlike previous presidents, Trump did not publicly meet with Russian human-rights activists or opposition figures, and he paid zero attention to the Russian-supported war in eastern Ukraine, which started in 2014 and continued throughout his term. When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a cease-fire with Putin in 2019, Europeans were at the table, but Trump's team was absent. Most shockingly, at a summit meeting in Helsinki in 2018, Trump sided with the Russian dictator against his own intelligence community and would not acknowledge Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. He also refused to debrief his senior staff after his one-on-one with Putin at that summit; one official characterized his attitude as suggesting,\" This is between me and my friend .\"\n\nTrump did not succeed in enacting Putin's full ideological agenda during that first term, however. Some of Trump's senior national-security officials slowed or even altogether stopped the president from achieving the objectives he and Putin shared-for instance, ending NATO. In an unprecedented divide between a president and his national-security team, the first Trump administration at times pursued confrontational policies toward Russia, including expelling its diplomats with ties to intelligence, sanctioning its companies, and sending a modest military package to Ukraine. Putin blamed the American \"deep state\" for Trump's failure to deliver. Trump sometimes hinted that he agreed.\n\nA fter a four-year interregnum, Putin's ideological ally is back in the White House. This time around, however, Trump is no longer constrained by old-school generals trying to slow him down. And this time around, the ideological solidarity between MAGA-ism and Putinism has become even more pronounced. Putin's ideologues and Trump's ideologues are both militantly anti-Zelensky, anti-Ukraine, and anti-Europe. They each admire the other's \"strong\" leaders. Russian nationalists have pushed for the destruction of the alleged American deep state; Elon Musk and his aides express agreement and are attempting to do just that.\n\nRead: The simple explanation for why Trump turned against Ukraine\n\nTrump has now made the restoration of his personal relationship with Putin a top foreign-policy priority; negotiating an agreement to end the war in Ukraine is a secondary or tertiary concern. How else to explain why Trump has delivered to Putin multiple concessions without asking for anything in return?\n\nAfter just a few weeks in office, the list of Trump's concessions to Russia is truly extraordinary. It includes (1) intelligence sharing with Ukraine has been discontinued; (2) USAID assistance for Ukraine, including funding to repair its energy grid and for anti-corruption programs, has been discontinued; (3) U.S. funding for Russian civil society and independent media operating in exile has been stopped; (4) diplomatic relations with Moscow have been restored, beginning with a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in Saudi Arabia a few weeks ago; and (5) in radical reversal of past policy, the United States voted with Russia, Belarus, North Korea, and a handful of other rogue autocracies against a UN resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In addition, Trump has insisted that (6) Ukraine cannot join NATO; (7) Zelensky must give up territory to Russia; (8) no new military aid for Ukraine will be made available, even previously appropriated funding; (9) U.S. forces deployed in Europe might be reduced and will not participate in any peacekeeping mission in Ukraine; and (10) sanctions on Russia could be lifted, although Trump suddenly reversed himself last week when he said he was \" strongly considering \" new sanctions and tariffs.\n\nTo use Trump's favorite metaphor for dealmaking, these are not clever \"cards\" played to shape a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Trump has secured nothing for either the United States or Ukraine by playing them. Instead, the concessions are meant to rekindle a personal relationship between Trump and Putin, anchored by a shared ideology. In all of American history, I cannot think of a more radical change in U.S. foreign policy in such a short period of time.\n\nM any Russians reject Putinism. They remain liberal internationalists, not illiberal nationalists. However, these Russians have no ability to influence politics in Putin's dictatorship. Many of them now live abroad.\n\nMany Americans likewise reject Trump's ideological mind meld with Putin. I am one of them; most Americans seem to share my view. A recent Quinnipiac poll shows that 81 percent of Americans do not trust Putin, and only 9 percent do. Unlike Russians, Americans still live in a democracy and therefore have the ability to influence their country's foreign policy. The question moving forward is whether this overwhelming majority of Americans cares enough about this issue to try to do something about it, to try to slow Trump's historic pivot of putting America on the side of the autocrats and against the democrats. To date, the answer is unclear.\n\nThe same question can be posed worldwide. Putinism resonates with millions in Europe, America, and other parts of the world. In Europe and the United States, Putin's illiberal orthodox populism is more attractive than Xi Jinping Thought, which has some tepid followers in the developing world but very few fans in the developed world. For years, American national-security experts have rightly focused on addressing the rising threat from China, but wrongly neglected the threat from Russia, including this ideological menace.\n\nIn our new era of great-power competition between dictators and democrats, Russia is the generally junior partner to China in the axis of autocracies, except when it comes to the appeal of its style of governance. Xi, after all, has courted no ideological allies as powerful as the current president of the United States of America. And yet, the supporters of Putinism are not the majority anywhere-not even in Hungary.\n\nRight now, the transnational movement of illiberal nationalism is more organized, united, and strategic in its collective actions than the liberal democratic movement. But those in Europe and the United States who support liberal democracy should remember that they far outnumber those who embrace illiberal autocracy, and that they have a history of victory over the forces that oppose them. During the Cold War, political parties, trade unions, intellectuals, civil-society organizations, and even religious leaders forged transnational ties in defense of democratic ideas-remember the AFL-CIO's embrace of Poland's Solidarity movement? The global anti-apartheid movement? We can do these things again now.\n\nThis is not the first time in history, or even in the past century, that democratic ideas appeared to wane as autocratic ideas appeared to surge. That happened in the 1930s. It happened again in the 1970s, when Marxist-Leninist regimes were seizing power in Southeast Asia, southern Africa, Nicaragua, and Afghanistan, and the practice of American democracy at home was inspiring few worldwide, thanks to the violent suppression of protesters, the assassinations of political figures, and the resignation of President Nixon.\n\nThe world democratic movement eventually recovered from those dark periods. It has to find its nerve and recover now. The challenge of fighting for democracy, liberalism, and the rule of law just got a lot harder because the president of the United States-a title that used to be synonymous with the leader of the free world -just switched sides. That puts the onus on those within the United States, Europe, and the rest of the world who still support these ideals to get organized if they are to prevail over Putin's ideology of illiberal nationalism."

      "text": "Did Russia Invade Ukraine? Is Putin a Dictator? We Asked Every Republican Member of Congress\n\nTwo simple questions, few straight answers\n\nSign up for Trump's Return , a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nUpdated at 4:05 p.m. ET on February 27, 2025\n\nI n just three weeks , President Donald Trump has exploded long-standing U.S. foreign policy and sided with Russia against Ukraine and the rest of NATO. He sent American diplomats to open negotiations with Russian counterparts-without inviting Kyiv to participate. He falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war with Russia, and echoed the Kremlin line by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator.\" Then, in a press conference on Monday, Trump declined to say the same of Vladimir Putin. \"I don't use those words lightly,\" he told a reporter.\n\nMost Republicans strongly condemned Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and have voted on multiple occasions to send the country military aid. But with their party's leader back in the White House, many of them have grown quiet. Are any GOP lawmakers willing to say, in plain terms, what is true?\n\nI reached out to all 271 Republican members of the House and Senate to find out, asking each of them two straightforward questions: Did Russia invade Ukraine? And is Putin a dictator? So far, I have received 25 responses.\n\nSome members were unambiguous: \"Yes and yes,\" a spokesperson for Senator Susan Collins of Maine replied in an email. \"Vladimir is undisputedly an enemy of America and a dictator,\" read part of the statement from the office of Representative Jeff Hurd of Colorado.\n\nOthers chose to send excerpts of previous non-answer statements or links to past TV interviews rather than answer either \"yes\" or \"no.\" A spokesperson for the GOP's House leader, Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, replied only with a readout of Johnson's praise for Trump's dealmaking prowess. A spokesperson for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas replied with a link to an interaction with ChatGPT in which the chatbot noted that Cruz had in 2022 acknowledged Russia's invasion of Ukraine and did in 2020 call Putin a dictator. (Still, no straightforward \"yes\" from Cruz today.)\n\nThe House Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by Representative Brian Mast of Florida, opted to stake out a position that seemed different from Trump's: The panel posted a screenshot of our questions on X, with the caption: \"ON THE RECORD: Russia invaded Ukraine & Putin is a dictator. But that doesn't mean our European allies shouldn't match Russian military spending & recruitment.\" (Another post referred to our questions as \"BS.\") The Atlantic followed up to ask whether this statement represented Mast's personal view, but received no further response.\n\nOthers refused to answer entirely: \"Does the Atlantic believe we're here to answer gotcha questions to advance narrow opinion journalism?\" Jonathan Wilcox, communications director for Representative Darrell Issa of California, said in an email.\n\nIn fact, it is clearly in the public interest to know how elected officials, particularly those who make decisions about national security, regard foreign powers that have long positioned themselves against the United States. And it is also clearly in the public interest for citizens to know if their representatives' views have shifted on who is-or is not-a foreign adversary.\n\nWhat follows is the full list of responses from every Republican member of Congress. It will be regularly updated with any additional responses.\n\nRepresentative Don Bacon of Nebraska : A spokesperson pointed to a statement on X from Bacon on February 19, in which he said: \"Putin started this war. Putin committed war crimes. Putin is the dictator who murdered his opponents. The EU nations have contributed more to Ukraine. Zelensky polls over 50%. Ukraine wants to be part of the West, Putin hates the West. I don't accept George Orwell's doublethink.\"\n\nRepresentative Michael Baumgartner of Washington : \"The Congressman expressed all his thoughts on the Russia-Ukraine War to the Spokane-Review on February 19. He was very clear that Russia and Vladimir Putin were the aggressors of the war in Ukraine,\" a spokesman said, adding this link .\n\nSenator Susan Collins of Maine : \"As Senator Collins has said multiple times, yes and yes,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas : A spokesperson for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas replied with a link to an interaction with ChatGPT in which the chatbot noted that Cruz had in 2022 acknowledged Russia's invasion of Ukraine and did in 2020 call Putin a dictator.\n\nSenator John Curtis of Utah : A spokesperson pointed to Curtis's bipartisan resolution supporting Ukraine and a February 25 interview on KSL NewsRadio , in which Curtis said, \"Ukraine was invaded by a dictator.\"\n\nRepresentative Julie Fedorchak of North Dakota : \"Yes, Vladimir Putin and Russia invaded Ukraine and yes, he is a dictator,\" the representative told me. \"This war has cost countless lives and destabilized the world. I believe President Trump has the strength and leadership to bring peace and restore stability in a way that puts America's interests first.\"\n\nRepresentative Jeff Hurd of Colorado : \"Did Russia invade Ukraine? Russia's invasion of Ukraine was an unprovoked act of war. Russian President Vladimir Putin is a dictator? Vladimir is undisputedly an enemy of America and a dictator.

Russia is also demanding guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO . Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said Russia must surrender all of the territory it has seized."

Trump opposed the United States' financial involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war during his campaign, distinguishing himself from the Biden administration's funding of Ukraine's military. Trump's Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth broke with years of U.S. foreign policy precedent in a recent statement asserting that Ukraine would not join NATO , a key provision for Putin. Trump has also been pushing for U.S. access to Ukraine's mineral resources in any potential deal. We speak to The Nation 's Katrina vanden Heuvel about these latest developments. \"There is an importance of what [Trump] is beginning to do, which is open up a process to end a war\" that is \"impoverishing Ukraine,\" she says. \"Both countries are war-weary\" three years after the Russian invasion.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : We begin today's show with Russia and Ukraine. On Wednesday, President Trump spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin for 90 minutes about ending the war in Ukraine. Trump said they agreed to meet soon and immediately to begin negotiations to end the war. Trump then held a separate call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. After the swearing-in ceremony for the new director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump spoke to reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I'll be dealing with President Putin, largely on the phone, and we ultimately expect to meet. In fact, we expect that he'll come here and I'll go there, and we're going to meet also probably in Saudi Arabia the first time. We'll meet in Saudi Arabia, see if we can get something done. But we want to end that war. That war is a disaster. It's a really bloody, horrible war.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : President Trump also addressed questions from reporters about whether Ukraine was being sidelined.\n\nREPORTER 1: Are you freezing out President Zelensky of this process a bit? Isn't there a danger of that?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : No, I don't think so, as long as he's there, but, you know, at some point you're going to have to have elections, too. You're going to have to have an election.\n\nREPORTER 2: Putin says he wants security assurances, Mr. President. What does that look like?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : In terms of what?\n\nREPORTER 2: If the war were to end, he says he wants guarantees of security.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : We'll see what that means. We have - I think when the war ends, one thing he was very strong about, he wants - if it ends, he wants it to end. And that's President Putin said that. He wants it to end. He doesn't want to end it and then go back to fighting six months later. We talked about the possibility - I mentioned it - of a ceasefire so we can stop the killing. And I think we'll probably end up at some point getting a ceasefire in the not-too-distant future.\n\nREPORTER 3: Do you view Ukraine as an equal member of the peace process?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Say it. What?\n\nREPORTER 3: Do you view Ukraine as an equal member of this peace process?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Umm, it's an interesting question. I think they have to make peace. Their people are being killed, and I think they have to make peace.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : President Trump's phone call with Putin came as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke at a NATO meeting in Brussels, where he said a return to Ukraine's prewar borders is, quote, \"unrealistic.\" Hegseth also ruled out Ukraine's future membership in NATO .\n\nDEFENSE SECRETARY PETE HEGSETH : As the war approaches its third anniversary, our message is clear: The bloodshed must stop, and this war must end. ... We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering. ... That said, the United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops. If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non- NATO mission. ... To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This comes as Germany and other European nations have rejected any peace talks with Moscow that do not include Kyiv.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has traveled to Kyiv to discuss a Trump proposal for Ukraine to give the U.S. access to its natural resources in exchange for continued U.S. military assistance. According to the State Department, Trump's envoy to Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, will travel to Germany and Ukraine in the coming days to, quote, \"engage with allies and partners across Europe who are willing to work with the United States to end Russia's war against Ukraine,\" unquote.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Katrina vanden Heuvel, Russia expert and publisher of The Nation magazine.\n\nMassive developments in this last 24 hours, Katrina. Is this the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine? And can you talk about the significance of Trump's call, 90 minutes, with President Putin, his first, at least we know publicly, with him since he became president? Also spoke with Zelensky and says his first talks will be Russia and the United States in Saudi Arabia.\n\nKATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL : This is a monumental shift, Amy, for the - let's begin with the fact that Russia launched this war of aggression. But from there on, this is a monumental shift, that, for example, the U.S. is not going to back Ukraine going into NATO . I think the defense secretary saying that has laid down a line that is in opposition to what we've seen for the last several - 17 years. That's huge. I think the fact that the sides are talking is critical, because for too long it's been a militarized relationship. It's all been about Zelensky's weapons and then the Russian weapons. Both countries are war-weary. The soldiers are demoralized. You're entering a period of mud in coming out of the winter.\n\nI do think the key will be the security apparatus or the security framework that will be discussed. The Europeans - Macron the other day called for 150,000 security forces or peacekeeping forces. That seems very unrealistic. I think a lot will depend on what kind of security architecture emerges to keep Ukraine sovereign, free. There are elections that will be held, and that is mandated by the Ukrainian Constitution. And Zelensky has declared martial law.\n\nBut in the end, what we're witnessing is - and, listen, I mean, Trump - I don't need to tell you how I feel about Trump, how The Nation feels about Trump, but there is an importance in what he is beginning to do, which is open up a process to end a war, to move toward ceasefire. And I think that is to be welcomed, because the war is impoverishing Ukraine. The question also will be, with a country, Ukraine, that has some of the vast reserves of titanium and uranium, how those will be allocated to reconstruct a ravaged country, Ukraine, what role Russia will play. There are many, many questions. But the important thing is to get to a table - round, square, oval - and to begin to discuss, talk, talk, talk, jaw, jaw, jaw.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Katrina, if you could say - you know, these comments that Hegseth made and that Trump has reiterated, namely that - as you mentioned, that NATO membership for Ukraine is ruled out, also that a return to pre-2014 borders is not realistic - so, insofar as what we know of Ukraine's demands, is there any likelihood within the negotiations, given what's already been said, that concessions can be made?\n\nKATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL : Yeah, I mean, I think the membership in the EU, which triggered this crisis in 2014, could be put back on the table. That's one element. I do think that the reconstruction, the role Russia may play in helping fund reconstruction, is something important. I do think that Crimea and elements of the Donbas region may be put sort of de jure free, but possibly also negotiated into. That's very tricky, the border there, the contact line. We may see a kind of armistice situation that we saw after the Korean War, so it's left there. The trick is not to leave situations on the ground that can trigger, retrigger conflict.\n\nThe NATO issue, I think, is critical, because I don't know if people know, but it is basically a military-industrial complex lobbying operation. Members of NATO have to buy U.S. weapons. There's an interoperability clause. In the same way, these security conferences that Hegseth is at or was going to, these are military-industrial complex lobbying parties. So, again, I come back to the fact, as much as can be demilitarized in the future regarding the security architecture of Ukraine will be helpful and important for the future of the region.\n\nI know there's a narrative that, if let alone, Russia will go into the Baltics, will ravage Europe. Russia could barely beat Ukraine, a small country. It's an anguish and horrible to watch what's happened, launched by Russia. We're three years on the anniversary. But the ability to talk and find a resolution, I think, can mitigate some of the fears of countries, which really have played a role in the debate to the exclusion of those who argue that Russia is not an expansionist power. I know that will lead many to shriek, but it can barely take on Ukraine. It can't pay the pensions of thousands of people in other countries.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, absolutely, Katrina, but how, then, would you imagine that Russia could play a role somehow in the reconstruction of Ukraine, given its circumstances?\n\nKATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL : Well, there is a term that we've all learned in the last weeks: \"oligarchs.\" I mean, you know, there's a lot of money in Russia that could be used. But the extractive foreign policy of Donald Trump is well suited for this moment, because, again, the minerals, which Mr. Zelensky has offered as part of a reconstruction effort. They've already had - Penny Pritzker was the reconstruction czar - Governor Pritzker's sister - and she brought in Blackstone, BlackRock, our oligarchs, to help fund the reconstruction. The World Bank estimates it's going to be at least a trillion. And we know what happens when countries walk away. We've walked away from Afghanistan. We walked away from other countries. So, I think there's a moral and political and security need to find resources for reconstruction.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you comment on the prisoner exchange, the teacher, Fogel, American teacher, after three-and-a-half years in prison in Russia, being returned in exchange for Alexander Vinnik, a cryptocurrency guy who was convicted? He's going back to Russia. And then you've got Belarus involved with three prisoners released, one of them American, one of them working for an American media outlet, and also the sort of passing references to Saudi Arabia being involved with that, not to mention it being the place where Trump will meet with Putin for the first part of the negotiation with - over the ending of the war in Ukraine, though European countries are saying they wouldn't negotiate unless Ukraine was involved from the beginning.\n\nKATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL : So, the first question, Amy, this is classic Cold War tit for tat. It's like the film, Bridge of Spies . I mean, exchange of prisoners has been a longtime scenario. We've seen it. And, you know, what also happens, seriously, is obviously the repression of journalists, the arrest of journalists, the foreign agent. All of this - war is not good for progressive, dissenting people. I mean, it used to be said you went on - you became a dissident when you went on pension, but I think the dissenting community of Russia has been suppressed, not simply by the war, but by Putin's politics.\n\nSaudi Arabia - I gasped when I heard that they might meet in Saudi Arabia, the home of the oligarchical vision. I suspect they'll do Moscow-Washington in the end. But, you know, it reminds of how this war could have been averted. It could have been ended in March, April 2022, when there were substantive discussions in Istanbul. And there has been denial, but there's also been acknowledgment that Victoria Nuland, who was in the State Department - the State Department - and Boris Johnson, who's Boris Johnson, came in and upended it, sabotaged the possibility back then. So they should take that to their grave.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Katrina vanden Heuvel, we thank you so much for being with us, publisher of The Nation magazine.\n\nKATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL : Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Next up, \"Elon Musk's Business Empire Scores Benefits Under Trump Shake-Up.\" We'll speak with three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter Eric Lipton about the billions Musk has to gain as he fires thousands and slashes the federal budget. Back in 30 seconds.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

The Russian Ministry of Defense says Ukraine used the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS , in the strike on Russia's Bryansk region. This comes after President Biden gave Ukraine the green light to begin striking inside Russia and as Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. The revised nuclear doctrine states that any attack on Russia by a nation backed by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on Russia. It also allows for Russia's use of nuclear weapons in response to aggression against allies, including Belarus. On Monday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also signaled Britain will supply long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles to Ukraine for attacks on Russian soil.\n\nSeparately, a Russian missile attack on Ukraine's Black Sea port city of Odesa Monday killed 10 people and wounded 44 others. Four children were among the wounded in the attack, which struck a residential neighborhood."

On Monday, Putin accused the U.S. and its allies of \"waging war\" against Russia using Ukrainians and accused Ukraine's army of committing war crimes. The governor of Russia's Kursk region said the offensive had so far killed 12 civilians while displacing more than 120,000 others. Some evacuees said they barely escaped with their lives.\n\nAnna Erokhina : \"There was shelling. How do you call them? Shells. Shells were falling quite close, three meters from the house. And we were standing in the hallway like this, and we were appealing to God, 'Please don't let them hit the house. We have children sleeping here.'\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the offensive is aimed at forcing Russia to negotiate for peace. He added, \"Russia brought war to others, and now it is coming home.\" Zelensky's comments came after a meeting with a bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators in Kyiv. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called Ukraine's surprise offensive \"bold, brilliant and beautiful,\" while Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal urged President Biden to lift all restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S.-made weapons.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal : \"We want to convey to the administration a message that it should provide more flexibility and authority to Ukraine in using the weapons that have been provided to strike deeper behind the lines that exist right now. There are limits and issues of permission. We hope to cut through them.\""

The violence came just hours after Russia said President Vladimir Putin had agreed to pause attacks on energy targets temporarily, during a two-hour phone call with President Trump.

For more on these developments, we host a discussion between economist Jeffrey Sachs and foreign policy analyst Matt Duss.\n\n\"This is a war that never should have happened,\" says Sachs, who faults \"U.S. provocations\" like the expansion of NATO for laying the groundwork for Russia's invasion in 2022. In holding these talks directly with Russia, \"the Trump administration, for the first time, is telling the truth about the fundamental causes of this war,\" adds Sachs.\n\nDuss says that while the U.S. has played a major role in the conflict, \"Vladimir Putin is the one who chose to invade Ukraine.\" He also emphasizes that Ukrainians themselves have agency and have been key players in events since the end of the Cold War, including their current defense against Russia. \"It's not just a story of unending U.S. villainy.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We begin today's show with the high-level talks between Russian and U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia, where they're meeting to discuss a possible end to the war in Ukraine and ways to improve ties between Washington and Moscow. The talks include U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and might pave the way for a possible meeting between President Trump and Russian [President] Vladimir Putin. Today's talks come less than a week after Trump held a 90-minute call with Putin.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who will be in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday on a separate state visit, was not invited to attend the U.S.-Russian talks. Zelensky spoke to reporters Monday.\n\nPRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY : [translated] Ukraine will not take part in the talks in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine did not know anything about them. Ukraine regards any negotiations on Ukraine without Ukraine as ones that have no result, and we cannot recognize any agreements about us made without us, and will not recognize such agreements.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Zelensky also rejected a demand by the Trump administration for Ukraine to give the United States ownership of half of Ukraine's rare earth minerals as compensation for past and future aid to Ukraine. He called for stronger American security guarantees as part of any minerals deal.\n\nMeanwhile, at an emergency European summit on Ukraine held in Paris Monday, European leaders were divided on proposals for European troops to be deployed inside Ukraine in the event of a peace deal. While German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was highly inappropriate to be discussing sending troops before a peace deal is reached, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer offered to send British troops to Ukraine.\n\nPRIME MINISTER KEIR STARMER : At stake is not just the future of Ukraine. It is an existential question for Europe as a whole, and therefore vital for Britain's national interest. ... Europe must play its role, and I'm prepared to consider committing British forces on the ground, alongside others, if there is a lasting peace agreement.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Commenting on the meeting, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was concerned about what she called \"Russia's imperial dreams.\"\n\nPRIME MINISTER METTE FREDERIKSEN : I am very concerned about making a fast ceasefire, because it can actually give Putin and Russia a better possibility to go back to Russia and to reramp and to mobilize again, attacking Ukraine or another country in Europe.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more on all of this, we're joined by two guests.\n\nFrom Washington, D.C., Matt Duss is with us, executive vice-president at the Center for International Policy, former foreign policy adviser for Senator Bernie Sanders. His latest piece for The Guardian , \"Democrats have become the part of war. Americans are tired of it.\" Matt Duss's recent Foreign Policy piece is \"It's Time for Ukraine to Make the Best Peace It Can.\"\n\nAnd in Brussels, we're joined by Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, president of the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network. He's served as adviser to three U.N. secretaries-general, is now a sustainable development solutions advocate under Secretary-General António Guterres. His piece for Common Dreams is headlined \"The War in Ukraine Was Provoked - and Why That Matters to Achieve Peace.\"\n\nLet's begin with Professor Sachs in Brussels. You're going to be involved with an event in Brussels tomorrow, \"The Geopolitics of Peace.\" Can you talk about what's happening right now in Saudi Arabia? You have the representatives of President Trump and President Putin who have just been involved with four hours of negotiations. You have Zelensky meeting with the Turkish president and now headed to Saudi Arabia for different meetings. And he said \"nothing about us without us.\" But can you talk about what's happening now in Saudi Arabia and the possibility of peace?\n\nJEFFREY SACHS : Good morning, Amy. Good morning, Matt.\n\nWhat's happening in Saudi Arabia is potentially very good news. It could mean the end of a war in which perhaps a million Ukrainians have died or been wounded gravely up until now. This is a war that never should have happened. It came about because of several provocative U.S. actions over 30 years, notably the expansion of NATO eastward against commitments made back in 1990, the U.S. participation in a violent coup in Ukraine in February 2014, the U.S.-Ukraine agreement to discard a U.N. Security Council-backed Minsk II agreement and the failure of the Biden administration to negotiate with President Putin in December 2021 and January 2022. I was personally involved in watching closely all of those events over the past 30 years. This war never should have happened.\n\nIt could have been averted at many times. It could have ended in negotiation in March 2022, saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians. I urged it. The Ukrainians walked away from the table because the British and the Americans told them to. This is so tragic. And everyone will understand this as the historians make all of this very clear. Again, I flew to Ankara in the spring of 2022 to understand exactly how these negotiations had broken down. And the United States and Britain were behind it, because, as Keir Starmer said in the clip that you played, this is about Europe's security. They're using Ukraine. This is the bottom line.\n\nSo, what's happening, in short, in Saudi Arabia is the most positive news for Ukrainians that there has been in years. President Trump understands - and, unfortunately, previous presidents did not - that the U.S. provocations need to stop, so this war stops, so the deaths stop. That is the bottom line.\n\nI think it's important for everybody to understand also that on October 5th, 2022, Zelensky ruled out any negotiations. He said it's illegal. This was a declaration of the Ukrainian government. So, the government of Ukraine, sadly, really unwisely - I tried many, many times to explain to them - they ruled out negotiations. They ruled them out until today. This is tragic for them. Now they say, \"We want a seat at the table.\" They said, \"We don't want any table,\" all along. And Zelensky rules by martial law, by decree, when the opinion surveys show that a majority of Ukrainians want peace right now even at the cost of territorial concessions.\n\nSo, my bottom line, Amy, is that while the Trump administration does some pretty weird things, like demanding mineral rights - this is absurd, this is completely bizarre - at the same time, the Trump administration, for the first time, is telling the truth about the fundamental causes of this war and how it can end. And that is the best news possible for Ukraine, first and foremost, and for the United States, for Russia and for the world, that peace could come to Ukraine very, very shortly. So, this, I think, is the bottom line.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, I'd like to bring in Matt Duss into the conversation. Matt, your reaction to the events and the Trump administration's complete reversal of the previous administration's policy, and this whole issue of whether there could have been peace earlier on but that the Biden administration and the British scuttled the developing peace plan back two years ago?\n\nMATT DUSS : Well, I mean, first off, and again, great to be with you and great to be here with Professor Sachs.\n\nI mean, I think, you know, the story that Professor Sachs just told, there are elements of truth to it, but there are also - it's a great deal in there that's misleading and, frankly, completely one-sided, absolving Vladimir Putin of any responsibility. Vladimir Putin is the one who chose to invade Ukraine, let's remember. It's important to understand the history, important to understand that the role that NATO expansion has played as being seen as a threat to Russia, that is real. That, however, does not explain Vladimir Putin's decision to illegally invade, annex and occupy parts of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin himself has told us multiple times what his vision for Ukraine is, and that's to retake Ukraine and make it once again part of the larger Russian imperium. So, again, important to understand the historical context, but I would really warn against seeing, you know, Vladimir Putin as some kind of innocent victim of American machinations here, which is the story that Professor Sachs seems to be trying to tell.\n\nAnd lastly, it really denies the Ukrainians any agency, any responsibility for their own independence, for their own democracy. The Ukrainians are not simply being treated as instruments of American power here. The Ukrainians have made decisions on their own. Some of them have been wise, some of them very admirable, some of them less so. I think we can discuss that, as well. But they have played a major role here, and I think that is what's concerning about these talks going on in Saudi Arabia, is that they are not - they are not there, and they are not included. And they have said, President Zelensky has said, that they will not be bound by any decisions made without their participation, which I think we can all agree is quite a legitimate position.\n\nNow, having said that, you know, this is not the first time you've had a U.S. administration engaging with the government of Vladimir Putin. Of course, President Biden met with Putin in June 2021. They had a summit, trying to address some issues of tension in the U.S.-Russia relationship. And I think this also goes to the point that President Biden did not seek a conflict with Russia. There were efforts made to avert the invasion. There was very intensive diplomacy between the U.S. and Russia, also between the U.S.'s allies - Germany, France, U.K. - and Russia leading up to the February 2022 invasion. And I think it's worth taking that into account. Now, should more have been done? Perhaps. We can't know. But I think Vladimir Putin has told us repeatedly about his very expansive goals and what he really hopes to achieve in Ukraine, and it's not just about NATO . I mean, this should not be news to anyone here.\n\nAgain, getting back to the talks in Saudi Arabia, if there is a workable peace agreement to be had, that's good. But I do think even the fact that these talks are happening between the United States and Russia, that is a victory for Putin. We have to understand that. Putin's vision for Russia's role and for the eventual dispensation for Ukraine is that this is something to be worked out between Russia and the United States, between these two great powers. He sees Russia as a rising force. Again, he's trying to kind of reestablish Russia as a great empire, a great force in global affairs. And his vision of how global affairs should work is that the great powers make decisions, and the lesser powers just have to deal with it. Their concerns are of very little concern. And unfortunately, I think that is something we've seen from the Trump administration, too, whether it's Ukraine, whether it's Gaza. It's that the powerful make decisions, and the weak just deal with it. I don't think that's just. And more importantly, I don't think that's going to lead to a sustainable peace. So, listen, if they do - if they do come out of these talks with a workable and sustainable and durable peace agreement for Ukraine, one that protects Ukraine's democracy, one that protects Ukraine's sovereignty, we should all support that. But without the participation of Ukraine, I'm very, very skeptical that we're going to get anything like that.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Jeff Sachs, what about that? It is the Ukrainians who are actually fighting against Russia, and yet the Trump administration seems to feel that it can negotiate without Ukrainians present. And in addition to that, I wanted to ask you another issue. There's been a lot of emphasis on these rare earth minerals that Trump raised, but there has been, according to many reports, massive buying of Ukrainian land by American agribusiness companies. Can you tell us anything about that, the validity of these claims?\n\nJEFFREY SACHS : Sure. The American role in this has been quite sordid for a very, very long time. The goal, starting back in 1994, was to expand NATO and surround Russia in the Black Sea region. President Clinton signed off on that in 1994. Zbig Brzezinski wrote about it in The Grand Chessboard in 1997, explaining it, and explaining in a chapter that is completely wrong when you look back at it, said Russia will not be able to resist any of this. In 2002, the U.S. destabilized the relationship by unilaterally abandoning the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In 2008, the United States invited Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO , basically over strong objections by the Europeans, but the Europeans went along in the NATO Bucharest summit in 2008, over Russia's brightest red lines. This was all known, understood provocations. All of the diplomats knew it. European leaders knew it. I spoke with them at the time. Everybody understood this.\n\nIn February 2014, the United States participated actively in a violent coup to overthrow Viktor Yanukovych, the president of Ukraine, who favored neutrality. This is very important to understand. The coup took place on February 22nd, 2014. Again, I saw some of this with my own eyes. It was ugly, the U.S. involvement in this coup. U.S. forces paid for this coup to an important extent. They stirred up this coup. This is all well understood now.\n\nIn 2015, the war could have ended with the Minsk II agreements, but the United States and Ukraine, despite the U.N. Security Council backing, said, \"No, you don't have to do that.\" That was not a territorial claim on the Donbas by Russia. It was a claim for autonomy that the U.N. Security Council unanimously supported, and the U.S. and the governments in Ukraine, at the U.S. behest, to an important extent, completely dissed.\n\nAnd then, it's true that Biden and Putin met in 2021, but in December 2021, President Putin put on the table a draft U.S.-Russia security agreement. It was a completely negotiable document. I spent quite a bit of time speaking with the White House about that document. There should have been negotiations. The U.S. rejected negotiation over the central point, which was non- NATO enlargement to Ukraine. Biden knew what he was doing. It was a terrible mistake, terrible mistake of the Democrats, let me say, and of President Biden and his team.\n\nThen, in March 2022, just days after the start of Russia's invasion - but, by the way, the war had been going on for years, but this escalation in - starting February 22nd, 2022. Just days after that, they went to the negotiating table. And they came very close to an agreement, until the U.S. and Britain stopped it. BoJo, Boris Johnson, one of the most irresponsible politicians in our modern time, explained it explicitly later. He said this is a war about preserving Western hegemony. Yes, this was a proxy war against Russia. This was the plan all along. And the U.S. and U.K. talked - or, told Zelensky, basically, \"Leave.\"\n\nNow, again, as I said earlier, I went to Ankara to discuss this in detail with the diplomats. I know the details of what happened. Ukraine left the negotiations that could have ended this in March 2022 with few deaths. And instead, there have been nearly a million deaths since then. This has been, unfortunately, a game of the United States for 30 years that Zbig Brzezinski spelled out in 1997. The U.S. thought they had the upper hand at every time. It was the economic sanctions or the weapons that were going to bring Russia to its knees. It was incredibly naive. I said so for many, many years. I said Ukraine -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Sachs?\n\nJEFFREY SACHS : I said Ukraine will become the Afghanistan of Europe. And so it has. Now, today, in Saudi Arabia, maybe Ukraine can be saved from what the U.S. deep state set along the path of the last 25 years.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Sachs?\n\nJEFFREY SACHS : And this is the biggest hope of today.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Sachs, Matt Duss said he agreed with a lot of what you said. And I was wondering if you agree with him in condemning Russia's invasion in 2022.\n\nJEFFREY SACHS : Of course I condemn Russia's invasion. And of course I condemn the reasons for the provocation. I condemn the destabilization of the nuclear framework, which was the most important element of all in this. The United States walked out of the ABM Treaty and the Intermediate Nuclear Force Treaty unilaterally and would not negotiate with the Russians over this. The United States overthrew a government in Ukraine. The United States refused to negotiate with the Russians over basic security issues. This is a tragedy.\n\nBut the core of the tragedy is U.S. unipolarity, assumed by the neocons as early as 1992, put put in place by Clinton starting in 1994, and it's been a consistent U.S. policy up until today, basically. And Trump is, actually, amazingly, it seems, trying to change it, which is unbelievable for us. I voted for Biden, of course. I was also an adviser to Bernie Sanders. I just want to be clear. This is a shock to me that it's coming from this side of the American politics. The Dems became warmongers, period.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Matt Duss, that certainly also reverberates with your title about the Democrats -\n\nMATT DUSS : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - becoming the party of war. The latest news out of Riyadh, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says officials at U.S.-Russia talks agreed to restore embassy staffing, create a high-level team to negotiate peace in Ukraine, peace, and promote economic cooperation. Your thoughts on this and where this history goes from there?\n\nMATT DUSS : Yeah, I mean, I read that readout. I think it's interesting. I would also note that, in that, one of those points is not just economic cooperation but, quote, \"investment opportunities.\" So, again, it really does seem like the Trump administration is not just trying to make peace, but trying to talk about potentially dividing the spoils with Russia. And that is very concerning, because I don't think that's going to lead to a sustainable and durable peace agreement. But again, in basic terms, it's good and fine that the United States and Russia are talking. We need to talk to our adversaries more generally. I think that's always true. But the details will matter. And again, Ukraine's buy-in is absolutely necessary for this. This is not an agreement that can be made over their heads.\n\nAnd I do want to step back and just respond to a couple things that Professor Sachs said in the kind of history that he laid out. It is very interesting to me that the Ukrainians themselves play little, if any, role in the history that Professor Sachs just lays out. This idea that 2014 was just a U.S.-backed coup is false. Yanukovych was overthrown after one of the largest demonstrations in Ukraine's history, known as the Euromaidan. It was not the case that Yanukovych simply wanted to make Ukraine neutral. He wanted to draw Ukraine closer to Russia in a way that an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians rejected. So, we need to understand the history in all its complexity here. The Ukrainian people played a major role in that event. They played a major role in the decision to resist, quite admirably and courageously, the Russian invasion of their own country.\n\nNow, going back to the negotiations in March of 2022, I think to treat the talks that took place in Turkey as if they would have simply ended the war, again, is not accurate. Now, there were interesting possibilities in those talks. There is little evidence that Putin himself was completely bought in. I'm very skeptical that, having launched a major invasion a month before, he would have been willing simply to end that invasion.\n\nBut again, this story that Professor Sachs is telling of the United States as the major manipulator and the key problem, and everyone else is simply reacting to what the United States does, I think, does not really reckon with reality. I'm certainly a critic of U.S. foreign policy. I'm a strong critic of the Biden administration's foreign policy. But I do think if we want to have a real and honest discussion about where U.S. foreign policy has failed and where it needs to go, we need to reckon with the actual complex history of these events, and it's not just a story of unending U.S. villainy.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Matt, just briefly, because we're running out of time for this segment, the Trump administration has also been pushing for increased military expenditures by the NATO countries, from 2% - now he wants 5% of their GDP in terms of military spending. What's your response? Because, obviously, the United States, as the main producer of weapons in the world, would benefit from such increased military spending by the various countries of Europe.\n\nMATT DUSS : Right. I mean, this is a point that Trump has made repeatedly, and not just Trump. And, I mean, if we remember, Barack Obama was also someone who was pushing NATO member countries to meet their commitments. By raising that commitment is something very interesting from Trump, if he expects that they'll be buying these weapons from the United States.\n\nBut I think one potentially interesting positive consequence of Trump's approach here is that it - you know, if it really does force the Europeans to finally, at long last, start taking more serious steps to see to their own security. I mean, some of the comments that were played earlier from Keir Starmer, I'm not so sure about the idea of U.K. troops patrolling Ukraine. But just the fact that you see European governments now stepping up and looking much with a bit more urgency about their own responsibilities in their own neighborhood, I do think that could have potential positive consequences for the United States, given the way that, you know, the U.S. security architecture in Europe is something that helps buttress our own military-industrial complex and diminishes and, I think, really corrupts our own democracy. So, anything that weakens the military-industrial complex, I would say, is ultimately good.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Matt Duss, we want to thank you for being with us, Center for International Policy, former foreign policy adviser to Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont. And economist Jeffrey Sachs is speaking to us from Brussels at the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. We'll link to all of your articles, both Matt and Jeffrey.\n\nWhen we come back, we speak with the Palestinian co-director Basel Adra about his Oscar-nominated documentary No Other Land and about Israel's mass expulsion of Palestinians from his community in the West Bank, what the film is about. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Witkoff told Carlson that Trump \"was clearly touched\" by the portrait, which he described as \"beautiful.\"\n\nWitkoff met Putin after talks with Russian officials about trying to end the war in Ukraine. Ceasefire talks continued Monday in Saudi Arabia, where U.S. officials met their Russian counterparts, a day after meeting with Ukrainian negotiators.\n\nDuring his interview with Carlson, Witkoff described Putin's gift as \"gracious\" and recalled how Putin told him he had prayed for Trump last year when he heard the then-candidate for the U.S. presidency had been shot at a rally in Pennsylvania. \"He was praying for his friend,\" Witkoff said, recounting Putin's comments.\n\nIn 2018, Putin gave then-President Trump a soccer ball that the Secret Service had checked for listening devices before Trump gave it to his son - a precaution that hearkened back to a Soviet-era gift to a U.S. diplomat that turned out to be bugged.\n\nIn 1945, a carving of the Great Seal of the United States was given as a gift from Soviet school children to then-U.S. Ambassador Averell Harriman. It hung in his office for six years allowing the Soviet Union to eavesdrop on his conversations until the State Department discovered that it contained a covert listening device.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Putin Seems To Reject 30-Day U.S. Ceasefire Plan Following Call With Trump\n\nBreaking News Reporter, HuffPost\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin appeared to turn down a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in the war in Ukraine following a call Tuesday with U.S. President Donald Trump .\n\nThe Kremlin, though, said it has agreed to stop targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure for 30 days.\n\nRussia's statement appeared to echo a readout of the call shared by the White House that stated the two \"leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace.\"\n\n\"These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East,\" the White House added.\n\nThe targeted ceasefire referenced in the readout falls short of the truce proposal pushed by the U.S. last week, which Kyiv has already agreed to.\n\nPutin previously said he backed the proposal in principle but suggested he expected more concessions from Kyiv.\n\nTrump, though, had previously appeared optimistic that he would get Putin to go along with the U.S. plan.\n\n\"I think he's going to agree, I really do,\" Trump told \"Full Measure\" in an interview broadcast Sunday. \"I think I know him pretty well, and I think he's going to agree.\"\n\nIt's unclear how Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will respond to the limited ceasefire touted by the U.S. and Russia on Tuesday as the White House did not spell out the role Kyiv would play in the negotiations.\n\nWhile the White House said both Trump and Putin \"agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace,\" Russia made clear that it wants the U.S. to stop sending aid to Ukraine and sharing intelligence with Kyiv as a prerequisite for ending the war. Trump temporarily cut support for Ukraine following his tense meeting with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office but restored it after Ukraine backed his original ceasefire proposal.\n\n\"It was emphasized that the key condition for preventing the escalation of the conflict and working towards its resolution by political and diplomatic means should be a complete cessation of foreign military assistance and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv,\" the Kremlin said, according to Reuters .\n\nMeanwhile, Trump seems keen on mending the U.S.-Russia bilateral relationship.\n\n\"The blood and treasure that both Ukraine and Russia have been spending in this war would be better spent on the needs of their people,\" the White House readout said.\n\nThe statement appears to gloss over the fact that the three-year conflict was prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Trump has previously blamed Kyiv for the war, largely echoing the Kremlin's talking points.\n\nThis is a developing story.

      "text": "Donald Trump Says He Will Talk To Russia's Vladimir Putin On Tuesday\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump said he would speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday as he pushes to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. leader disclosed the upcoming conversation to reporters while flying from Florida to Washington on Air Force One on Sunday evening.\n\n\"We will see if we have something to announce maybe by Tuesday. I will be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday,\" Trump said. \"A lot of work's been done over the weekend. We want to see if we can bring that war to an end.\"\n\nAny such conversation could be a pivot point in the conflict and an opportunity for Trump to continue reorienting American foreign policy.\n\nEuropean allies are wary of Trump's affinity for Putin and his hardline stance toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who faced sharp criticism when he visited the Oval Office a little more than two weeks ago.\n\nAlthough Russia failed in its initial goal to topple Ukraine with its invasion three years ago, it still controls large swaths of the country.\n\nTrump said land and power plants are part of the conversation around bringing the war to a close.\n\n\"We will be talking about land. We will be talking about power plants,\" he said.\n\nTrump described it as \"dividing up certain assets.\"\n\nTrump special envoy Steve Witkoff recently visited Moscow to advance negotiations, and he said earlier Sunday that a call between Trump and Putin could come soon.\n\nDuring his conversation with reporters on Air Force One, Trump said he was pushing forward with his plans for tariffs on April 2 despite recent disruption in the stock market and nervousness about the economic impact.\n\n\"April 2 is a liberating day for our country,\" he said. \"We're getting back some of the wealth that very, very foolish presidents gave away because they had no clue what they were doing.\"\n\nTrump has occasionally changed course on some tariff plans, such as with Mexico, but he said he had no intention to do so when it comes to reciprocal tariffs.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Putin Says He's Open To 30 Day Ceasefire With Ukraine, But Issues Remain\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that he agrees in principle with a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but he emphasized that the terms are yet to be worked out and added that any truce should pave the way to lasting peace .\n\n\"The idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,\" Putin told a news conference in Moscow. \"But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to talk about it with our American colleagues and partners and, perhaps, have a call with President Trump and discuss it with him.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump said there have been \"good signals\" coming out of Russia and offered guarded optimism about Putin's statement. He reiterated that he's ready to speak with Putin and underscored that it was time to end the war.\n\nPutin \"put out a very promising statement, but it wasn't complete,\" Trump said Thursday at a start of a meeting at the White House with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte . \"Now we're going to see whether or not Russia's there. And if they're not, it'll be a very disappointing moment for the world.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Putin is \"essentially preparing to reject\" the ceasefire.\n\nPutin \"is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians,\" Zelenskyy said in his nightly address to the nation. \"That is why, in Moscow, they are surrounding the idea of a ceasefire with such preconditions that nothing will come of it - or at least, it will be delayed as long as possible.\"\n\nThe Russian president, he added, \"often acts this way. He doesn't say 'no' outright but ensures that everything drags on and that normal solutions become impossible.\"\n\nPutin, who launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago, noted the need to control possible breaches of the truce and signaled that Russia would seek guarantees that Ukraine would not use the break in hostilities to rearm and continue mobilization.\n\n\"We agree with the proposals to halt the fighting, but we proceed from the assumption that the ceasefire should lead to lasting peace and remove the root causes of the crisis,\" Putin said.\n\nThe Russian leader made the remarks just hours after the arrival of Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff , in Moscow for talks on the ceasefire , which Ukraine has accepted. A Kremlin adviser said Putin planned to meet with Witkoff later Thursday.\n\nThe diplomatic effort coincided with a Russian claim that its troops have driven the Ukrainian army out of a key town in Russia's Kursk border region , where Moscow has been trying for seven months to dislodge Ukrainian troops from their foothold.\n\nPutin said it appeared that the U.S. persuaded Ukraine to accept a ceasefire and that Ukraine is interested because of the battlefield situation, particularly in Kursk.\n\nReferring to the Ukrainian troops in Kursk, he questioned what will happen to them if the ceasefire takes hold: \"Will all those who are there come out without a fight? Or will the Ukrainian leadership order them to lay down arms and surrender?\"\n\nPutin thanked Trump \"for paying so much attention to the settlement in Ukraine.\"\n\nHe also thanked the leaders of China, India, Brazil and South Africa for their \"noble mission to end the fighting,\" a statement that suggested those countries could be involved in a ceasefire deal. Russia has said it will not accept peacekeepers from any NATO members to monitor a prospective truce.\n\nPutin's seemingly friendly tone toward the White House reflected the astonishing shift in U.S. relations with Russia and Ukraine since Trump returned to office in January.\n\nUnder the administration of former President Joe Biden , the United States was Ukraine's staunchest and most powerful ally and a force for isolating the Kremlin. But Trump's election threw that policy into reverse.\n\nTrump briefly cut off critical military aid and intelligence sharing in an apparent effort to push Kyiv to enter talks to end the war, and Zelenskyy had a testy meeting at the White House on Feb. 28 in which Trump questioned whether Ukraine wanted to halt the war.\n\nThe Trump administration has also repeatedly embraced Kremlin positions on the conflict, including indicating that Ukraine's hopes of joining NATO are unlikely to be realized and that it probably will not get back the land that Russia's army occupies, which amounts to nearly 20% of the country.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry's claim that it recaptured the town of Sudzha, a Ukrainian operations hub in Kursk, came hours after Putin visited his commanders in the Kursk region. The claim could not be independently verified. Ukrainian officials made no immediate comment.\n\nAs Trump seeks a diplomatic end to the war, he has made veiled threats to hit Russia with new sanctions if it does not engage with peace efforts.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC Thursday that Trump is \"willing to apply maximum pressure on both sides,\" including sanctions that reach the highest scale on Russia.\n\nThe U.S. still has about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding for future arms shipments to Ukraine, but the Trump administration has shown no interest so far in using that authority to send additional weapons as it awaits the outcome of peace overtures.\n\nBy signaling its openness to a ceasefire at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war, Ukraine has presented the Kremlin with a dilemma - whether to accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington.\n\nThe Ukrainian army's foothold inside Russia has been under intense pressure for months from the renewed effort by Russian forces, backed by North Korean troops . Ukraine's daring incursion last August led to the first occupation of Russian soil by foreign troops since World War II and embarrassed the Kremlin.\n\nUkraine launched the raid in a bid to counter the unceasingly grim news from the front line, as well as to draw Russian troops away from the battlefield inside Ukraine and to gain a bargaining chip in any peace talks. But the incursion did not significantly change the dynamic of the war.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, assessed late Wednesday that Russian forces were in control of Sudzha, a town close to the border that previously was home to about 5,000 people.\n\nUkraine's top military commander, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Russian aircraft conducted so many strikes on Kursk that Sudzha had been almost completely destroyed. He did not comment on whether Ukraine still controlled the settlement but said his country was \"maneuvering (troops) to more advantageous lines.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Zelenskyy And Putin Have Agreed To A Limited Ceasefire, But Implementation Is Work In Progress\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle to a limited ceasefire after President Donald Trump spoke with the countries' leaders this week, though it remains to be seen when it might take effect and what possible targets would be off limits to attack.\n\nThe tentative deal to partially rein in the grinding war came after Russian President Vladimir Putin rebuffed Trump's push for a full 30-day ceasefire. The difficulty in getting the combatants to agree not to target one another's energy infrastructure highlights the challenges Trump will face in trying to fulfill his campaign pledge to quickly end to the war.\n\nAfter a roughly hourlong call with Trump on Wednesday that both leaders said went well, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that \"technical\" talks in Saudi Arabia this weekend would seek to resolve what types of infrastructure would be protected under the agreement.\n\nBut it was immediately clear that the three parties had different views about what the pact entailed, with the White House saying \"energy and infrastructure\" would be covered, the Kremlin saying the agreement referred more narrowly to \"energy infrastructure,\" and Zelenskyy saying he'd also like railways and ports to be protected.\n\n\"One of the first steps toward fully ending the war could be ending strikes on energy and other civilian infrastructure,\" Zelenskyy said on social media following his call with Trump, which came a day after the U.S. president held similar talks with Putin. \"I supported this step, and Ukraine confirmed that we are ready to implement it.\"\n\nDuring their call, Trump suggested that Zelenskyy should consider giving the U.S. ownership of Ukraine's power plants to ensure their long-term security, according to a White House statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz.\n\nTrump told Zelenskyy that the U.S could be \"very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise,\" the statement said.\n\nTrump suggested \"American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure,\" according to White House officials. The idea was floated even as the Trump administration looks to finalize an agreement to gain access to Ukraine's critical minerals as partial repayment for U.S. support for Ukraine during the war.\n\nZelenskyy, though, said the conversation focused on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - which is the largest of its kind in Europe and has been under Russian control since early in the war. He said Trump posed the idea of \"an understanding\" in which \"the United States can recover\" the plant.\n\nThe call, which Zelenskyy described as \"fruitful,\" came just weeks after a disastrous Oval Office meeting between the two leaders that led to Trump temporarily pausing intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine.\n\nDuring the call, Zelenskyy requested additional Patriot defense missile systems. Rubio and Waltz said Trump \"agreed to work with him to find what was available, particularly in Europe.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Putin told Trump that he would agree not to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure but refused to back a full 30-day ceasefire that Trump proposed.\n\nAccording to the Kremlin, Putin made clear to Trump that there must be a cessation of foreign military aid and intelligence sharing as part of any deal. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday underscored that U.S. \"intelligence sharing in terms of defense for Ukraine\" would continue.\n\nPrior to his call with Trump, Zelenskyy said Putin's limited ceasefire pledge was \"very much at odds with reality\" after Russia launched an overnight barrage of drone strikes across Ukraine, including some that struck Ukrainian energy facilities.\n\nRussia responded by saying it had halted its targeting of Ukraine's energy facilities and accused Kyiv of attacking Russian equipment near one of its pipelines.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we see that for now there is no reciprocity on the part of the Kyiv regime,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nThe White House described Tuesday's call between Trump and Putin as the first step in a \"movement to peace.\" But there was no indication that Putin is ready to back away from his conditions for a prospective peace deal, which are fiercely opposed by Kyiv.\n\nZelenskyy even while agreeing to work on the limited ceasefire said Putin is not seriously pursuing peace talks, and wants to prolong the war until he is in a stronger position.\n\nThe White House also confirmed that technical experts from the U.S., Ukraine and Russia would gather in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to discuss implementing the partial ceasefire.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the U.S. would meet together or separately with the Ukrainian and Russian officials. Waltz spoke with his Russian counterpart, Yuri Ushakov, on Wednesday to discuss the coming talks.\n\nShortly after the call between Trump and Putin on Tuesday, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv, followed by explosions as residents took shelter.\n\nDespite efforts to repel the attack, several strikes hit civilian infrastructure, including two hospitals, a railway and more than 20 houses, Zelenskyy said. Russian drones were reported over Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said its military had launched seven drones at power facilities related to the military-industrial complex in Ukraine's southern Mykolaiv region, but that it shot them down after receiving Putin's order to not hit energy infrastructure.\n\nMoscow accused Ukraine of targeting its energy facility in the Krasnodar region bordering the Crimean Peninsula , which Russia annexed in 2014, several hours after the Putin and Trump talks. The ministry said three drones targeted oil transfer equipment that feeds the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, causing a fire and leading one oil tank to lose pressure.\n\n\"It is absolutely clear that we are talking about yet another provocation deliberately concocted by the Kyiv regime, aimed at derailing the peace initiatives of the U.S. president,\" the Russian Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussia said its air defenses intercepted 57 Ukrainian drones over the Azov Sea and several Russian regions - the border provinces of Kursk and Bryansk and the nearby regions of Oryol and Tula.\n\nZelenskyy said that \"words of a ceasefire\" weren't enough.\n\n\"If the Russians don't hit our facilities, we definitely won't hit theirs,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nMeanwhile, the two combatants said Wednesday that they had each swapped 175 prisoners in one of the largest exchanges of the war .\n\nZelenskyy rejected Putin's key condition that Western allies stop providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine. He said doing so would endanger lives if citizens were blind to incoming air raids and lead to the continuation of the war.\n\n\"I don't think anybody should make any concessions in terms of helping Ukraine, but rather, assistance to Ukraine should be increased,\" Zelenskyy said. \"This will be a signal that Ukraine is ready for any surprises from the Russians.\"\n\nZelenskyy said one of the most difficult issues in future negotiations would be the issue of territorial concessions.\n\n\"For us, the red line is the recognition of the Ukrainian temporarily occupied territories as Russian,\" he said. \"We will not go for it.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "U.S. Envoy Is Taking Putin's Comments On Ukraine Ceasefire Proposal To Trump, Kremlin Official Says\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin met with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss details of the American proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Ukraine , asking him to convey Moscow's thoughts to Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday.\n\nPutin asked Witkoff late Thursday to give additional messages to U.S. President Donald Trump , Peskov told reporters, after the Russian leader said at a news conference that he supported a truce in principle but set out a host of details that need to be clarified before it is agreed.\n\nTrump said the U.S. held \"very good and productive\" discussions with Putin the day before. In a post on his Truth Social site Friday morning, Trump said \"that there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end,\" adding that Ukrainian troops are surrounded by the Russian military.\n\nUkraine, under severe military pressure on parts of the front line three years after Russia's full-scale invasion, has already endorsed the truce proposal. Russia's army has gained battlefield momentum , and analysts say Putin likely will be reluctant to rush into a ceasefire while he feels he has an advantage. The Russian army, backed by North Korean troops, are now close to completely driving Ukrainian forces from their foothold in Russia's Kursk border region in what would be a major setback for Kyiv.\n\nUkraine's General Staff, however, denied Friday that its forces in Kursk are encircled by Moscow's troops and said that any reports to that effect were \"fabricated by the Russians for political manipulation and to exert pressure on Ukraine and its partners.\"\n\nA possible phone call between Putin and Trump to settle outstanding ceasefire issues could be arranged after Witkoff delivers the messages in Washington, Peskov said. \"There is an understanding on both sides that such a call is needed,\" Peskov said.\n\n\"There are certainly some grounds for cautious optimism,\" Peskov said of the ceasefire proposal. \"A lot still needs to be done, but the president has shown solidarity with President Trump's position.\"\n\nU.S. officials have said Washington was set to discuss technical issues related to a possible ceasefire next week. Given the range of issues on the table, and the sharp differences between what Moscow and Kyiv want, it could potentially take weeks or months for the guns to fall silent.\n\nTrump vowed during his election campaign to settle the war in 24 hours, but in January he changed that timeframe, voicing hope that peace could be negotiated in six months.\n\nPutin's apparently amicable tone toward the White House reflects the remarkable shift in U.S. relations with Russia and Ukraine since Trump returned to office in January. Former President Joe Biden had sought to isolate Putin.\n\nTrump has threatened both Russia and Ukraine with punitive measures if they don't engage with his peace efforts.\n\nTrump briefly cut off critical military aid and intelligence sharing in an apparent effort to push Kyiv to enter talks on ending the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a tense meeting at the White House on Feb. 28 in which Trump questioned whether Ukraine wanted to halt the war.\n\nTrump has raised the possibility of tightening sanctions on Russia, though his administration has also repeatedly embraced Kremlin positions on the conflict, including indicating that Ukraine's hopes of joining NATO are unlikely to be realized and that it probably will not get back the land that Russia's army occupies, which amounts to nearly 20% of the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian air defenses downed four Ukrainian drones attacking the Russian capital early Friday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said.

But the slow progress of the war is feeding a series of other crises, leaving Vladimir Putin's inner circle increasingly isolated.\n\nUkraine security forces at the site of a recent Russian missile attack in Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on July 19, 2022. (Metin Aktas / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAs the Russian attack on Ukraine drags into its fifth month, the war risks losing international public attention, replaced - in Europe at least - by rising food and gas prices, spiraling inflation, and another summer of record-breaking temperatures. Like wars from Afghanistan to Yemen, the longer it lasts the more it becomes normalized and accepted. For the people of Ukraine, however, the invasion remains an inescapable reality, with Russian troops pushing further into the country's east and civilian casualties mounting.\n\nThe news from Russia, by contrast, has grown noticeably quieter since the beginning of the invasion. Initial reports of antiwar protests, jingoistic pro-government rallies and shuttered McDonald's franchises have long since disappeared from the headlines. Support for the war might be muted, but few signs of public opposition have emerged in recent months, either. Have Russians resigned themselves to their fate? Loren Balhorn spoke with Boris Kagarlitsky, a Moscow-based sociologist and host of the popular Russian YouTube talk show Rabkor , to learn more about the impact of the war and how strong Vladimir Putin's grip on power really is.\n\nAt the start of the invasion of Ukraine, there were lots of reports of antiwar protests across Russia. Things seem to have grown quiet since then, with more and more media outlets claiming that most Russians back Putin. You live in Moscow - what's the mood like?\n\nInitially there were quite a lot of protests, but they were crushed in a very brutal way. At least on the surface, the movement was physically suppressed. People are going to jail almost daily - Alexei Gorinov, for example, was just sentenced to seven years in prison for making an antiwar statement during a session of the Krasnoselsky municipal council in Moscow.\n\nThis is a way to make people afraid, and to some extent it works. No less than four million people have left the country since the so-called \"special operation\" began. Ukraine reported that about seven to eight million people left the country, but about half of them have already returned. In that sense, the number of people who emigrated from Russia is approximately the same as the number of people who fled Ukraine. Given that nobody is being bombed here, it gives you an idea of the public's attitude.\n\nSo, you don't think the majority supports the war?\n\nThat's the most interesting sociological and political problem: Russian people are neither for the war nor against it. They do not react to the war.\n\nOf course, there are opinion polls published by pro-Kremlin media which are enthusiastically quoted by Western and some pro-Ukrainian sources, trying to prove that all Russians support Putin and are fascists. But that has nothing to do with reality. As a sociologist, I can confirm that since the war, the number of people who agree to respond to opinion polls has collapsed to a level that is totally unrepresentative. Before the war it was below 30 percent, which is already very low. Now, it's considered a big success when 10 percent agree to respond. Usually it's 5 to 7 percent.\n\nOf those 5 percent, about 65 to 70 percent support the war. There are two interpretations of this data. One, mostly shared by the liberal opposition, is that people are simply afraid to answer. I think that's not exactly the case. Among those 95 percent who refuse to respond, there could be a considerable number who are against the war but don't dare say so. My suspicion, however - which of course I cannot prove - is that most people don't have any opinion at all.\n\nNo opinion at all?\n\nThis might shock you, but until very recently, most Russians didn't know there was a war in Ukraine. On TV they use the term \"special operation,\" which suggests special forces engaging in some kind of limited action somewhere. It was not associated with real hostilities, with tanks and artillery and so on, and they didn't report Ukrainian civilian casualties.\n\nThat brings me to my second point: most people don't watch political programs on TV, nor do they watch oppositional media on the Internet. They are not interested in any kind of politics whatsoever. The whole spectrum of political opinion - including both loyalists and the opposition, whether leftist or fascist, liberal or conservative -  represents maybe 15 to 20 percent of the population, probably less than 10 percent. The rest are totally apolitical.\n\nOn the one hand, that's a great advantage for the regime, but it's also its biggest problem. Nobody moves against the government, but nobody moves in favor of it, either. That's why the COVID vaccination campaign failed, and why Putin can't announce a general mobilization. Volodymyr Zelensky announced the other day that he wants to mobilize a million people. Russia can't mobilize two hundred thousand because everybody runs away.\n\nSeveral independent media outlets have been shut down since the war began, and now the state prosecutor is moving to ban the Journalists' and Media Workers' Union. Is there any public sphere left in Russia where debate is even possible?\n\nIt's not shut down completely. They're trying their best, but they simply fail. The good thing about this country is that everything fails, no matter what. That's why we joke that fascism could never work in Russia - because nothing works here.\n\nOur YouTube channel, Rabkor , has about ninety thousand subscribers and broadcasts almost daily. But [another left-wing YouTube channel] Vestnik Buri, for example, has about two hundred thousand subscribers - not to mention the liberal media projects. Telegram channels are also very popular, that's where I get a lot of my information and where debates happen.\n\nSome of the people making videos emigrated, and yes, there are problems for those of us still on the ground. I'm labeled as a \"foreign agent,\" for example, so when I speak in public, I have to recite some stupid mantra about being a foreign agent or pay a fine. But people still laugh at the authorities, which is another good thing about Russia. They jail people, they arrest them and make them pay fines, but people still laugh at them.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the government does with Igor Strelkov, one of the key figures in 2014 in Donetsk and a very aggressive Russian imperialist and militarist. He shares the goals of the \"special operation,\" but has become the government's most vocal critic, which is why his comments are often reproduced in the Ukrainian media. If he gets arrested, it will generate a lot of anger precisely among the segment of society that supports the war.\n\nYou were arrested under [Leonid] Brezhnev for publishing samizdat (clandestine dissident materials), and then under Putin for attending an illegal demonstration. Would you say repression today is worse than it was in the Soviet Union?\n\nIt's difficult to compare, because some aspects are worse, and others better. It's definitely worse in the sense that people get arrested for minor offenses that would have gone unnoticed under Brezhnev. The USSR was about stability. They didn't like anyone undermining that. On the other hand, being too harsh would have also been counterproductive, so repression was routine and not very severe.\n\nThere are more political prisoners now than under Brezhnev. Also, now people have to pay fines, which was not the Soviet practice. A fine is a very capitalist way of punishing dissent. But one thing that's definitely better now is that we have the Internet, which gives us a thousand times more capacity than we had with samizdat .\n\nIf most Russians aren't taking a position on the war, what kind of concerns do they have? Surely, they're worried about the impact of economic sanctions?\n\nThe economic situation is deteriorating and we will begin feeling that seriously by late August or September. It's a gradual process. One company closes, people have to look for new jobs, then another closes, and so on. Certain goods are disappearing, but not everything.\n\nLike I said, most Russians are apolitical. They care about their jobs, their families, their closest friends, and maybe their houses and pets. Russians are not very religious, either, even though the church plays an important role as a political institution. What's important is having your family life intact, then you can tolerate the rest.\n\nThe problem is, it's not going to continue like that indefinitely. The war is going to affect your family, your work, and even your pets. And once it begins affecting people's private lives, things can change immediately. I think resistance could start mounting very fast once the government does something that affects the lives of families. That's why they haven't openly declared war.\n\nThere's a lot of debate about whether sanctions are an effective tool to slow down the Russian war machine and create problems for Putin at home. It sounds like you're saying they work.\n\nWell, there's sanctions and there's sanctions. Some of them are playing into Putin's hands, like initiatives to \"cancel\" Russian culture and so on, because isolation is exactly the regime's ideology, and increasing that can only favor them.\n\nWhat about economic sanctions, like a gas embargo?\n\nThe most effective tool so far has been the withdrawal of foreign companies from Russia, because that leads to other problems, especially embargoes on specific supplies like spare parts.\n\nThe Russian car industry is on hold, for example. It's just not producing anymore, because it's so dependent on German, Japanese, and South Korean parts. The military-industrial complex is also suffering because they're not getting enough spare parts. The same is true in aviation: many domestic companies are already bankrupt and now being cannibalized by the larger carriers like Aeroflot and S7.\n\nHow long do you think the Russian economy can hold out?\n\nIt can continue for another two or maybe three months, depending on the particular industry. The important thing, however, is that the guys who really own everything start taking losses. Nobody cares about industries or people, everybody cares about profits.\n\nSome sections of the bourgeoisie are increasingly unhappy with what's going on and are really interested in some sort of peace settlement. The problem is they don't have much of a political say, because the decisions are made by a very narrow team around Putin. Not even every oligarch has access to him.\n\nI call this the \"irrational centralization of power.\" It has been going on for a long time, and is produced partly by state inefficiency. The local bureaucracy is so inefficient and corrupt that to make anything happen, the center has to pool ever more powers. The center does not trust local bureaucrats for the very reason that they undermine them systematically. It's a self-perpetuating process that has become totally irrational and goes far beyond anything we saw during the Soviet period.\n\nIf, as you say, the bourgeoisie is growing dissatisfied with the war, does that open up the possibility of fissures within the Russian elite or the state itself?\n\nPutin is the only one who makes decisions, even though he's extremely isolated these days. Surrounding Putin is a small group who are also extremely isolated, even within the elite. It doesn't seem like the military is happy. There are probably divisions within the military, we don't know, but there are signs of big divisions.\n\nWhat remains behind Putin is mainly the police force, and a group of the most privileged oligarchs. It's a very small group within the capitalist class, and that's why I don't think they're going to survive for very long, because it contradicts the long-term logic of capitalist society. You need a broader base, at least within the ruling class, to rule the country.\n\nThat explains the paralysis in government these last four months. This very narrow group, which doesn't even represent the elite anymore, has been unable to establish a consensus around any initiative and take a decision.\n\nWhat's their plan? Is the goal an eventual settlement and reintegration with the West from a position of increased strength, or are we seeing the beginning of a long-term pivot toward Asia?\n\nThat's exactly the problem: there is no plan. They know they made a terrible mistake and that it may be fatal, and that's about it. The fact that there was a mistake is unacceptable for Putin and his team. The government never recognizes a failure publicly or even informally, but without recognizing there was a mistake you can't move forward. No strategy can be developed.\n\nWestern analyses assume we are dealing with rational people making rational choices, or at least with people making choices. But there is no choice, nobody's making choices! Even if there are proposals, no proposal works because none is accepted by enough people within the elite to make it real.\n\nIf there is no plan, what pushed Putin to cross the Rubicon and invade Ukraine, after eight years of stalemate in the Donbass?\n\nThat's another common, but understandable mistake in Western analysis: thinking that the war is rooted in geopolitics. I think that international politics played a very secondary role, if any, in the decision. It was mostly preconditioned by the domestic situation, which explains why it happened so suddenly and failed so miserably. It was not prepared, there was no diplomacy behind it, because it was not about foreign policy, it was about domestic policies.\n\nDuring the so-called \"Great Recession\" from 2008 to 2010, Russia's economy contracted faster than any other developed economy. Russia was totally dependent on oil and gas. When the global economy contracted, demand for oil and gas also collapsed, and that led to Russia's economic collapse.\n\nHowever, by 2011 it had among the fastest recoveries. Once the Federal Reserve started its quantitative easing program, high levels of speculation on the oil market showered money on Russian companies and the Russian elite, leading to a classical crisis of overaccumulation. They had a lot of money, but they had nowhere to invest it. That would only be possible if you changed the structure of the Russian economy, which also means changing the structure of society, which is not something you're going to do when you have such a totally conservative government and elite.\n\nThis fueled domestic contradictions, because everybody saw that the gap between rich and poor was growing very fast, even compared to the previous period. It led also to contradictions within the elite about how this money was to be divided between different groups. The result was big infrastructure projects, such as the Crimean Bridge, the most expensive bridge in history.\n\nIn this situation, military expansion is another way to use the extra money. You build a lot of military hardware, which you then have to use somehow, so you go into Syria. Basically, you just burn money to fuel your economy. This expansionism then came together with the third aspect, namely that Putin is seriously ill.\n\nPhysically ill?\n\nHe has cancer, and some other diseases. These are rumors, of course, but everybody on the street knows about them. Even if he weren't ill, he's not going to live forever - he's already been in power for over twenty years. And when you're coming to a point where you must decide who the next ruler is going to be, you have to ask: How are you going to manage the transition?\n\nPutin repeatedly promised to launch the transition process but never did, because once he nominates a successor, he's not in control anymore. The initial plan to change the constitution in 2020, which was approved by Putin himself, was about organizing the transition in such a way that Putin would become some kind of top ayatollah, like in Iran. Then suddenly, on the very same day the Duma was planning to vote for the amendment, [pro-Putin Duma member] Valentina Tereshkova suddenly called for the prolongation of Putin's term, and of course everybody changed their mind within twenty minutes and voted for something else.\n\nThey destroyed the institutions designed to manage the transition, so now they have a transition without any rules and managed by Putin himself. For that you need extraordinary powers. How do you get extraordinary powers? War.\n\nThat's how they got to the point where they needed a war, but they didn't want the kind of war that's happening now. The idea was to have a short fight, proclaim victory, and then manage the transition the way they wanted. After the process is finished, maybe the next president handles reconciliation with the West.\n\nThey were 100 percent sure that everything in Ukraine would collapse within twenty-four hours. Maybe the plan could have worked in 2014, but it didn't work in 2022. They failed.\n\nWith the elite in such a crisis, how divided is the Russian left over the war? From afar it looks like the Communist Party and most of the trade unions actually support it.\n\nThe independent trade union movement in Russia is extremely weak. The official unions are just part of the state, they have nothing to do with the labor movement.\n\nAs far as the Communist Party of the Russian Federation is concerned, there are basically three tendencies. First, there is the leadership. They're totally integrated into the system and do whatever they're told to do. Then you have the rank and file, which mostly opposes the war - people like Andrey Danilov. And as always there is some kind of center, politicians who are silent, waiting to see who wins.\n\nThe other social democratic party, A Just Russia, is even worse. They're making incredibly jingoistic, almost fascist statements, but quite a few people have left the party, and the rank and file has practically disappeared. I know a few other members who are very critical, but who prefer to stay silent. Beyond that, of course, there is the independent left, which is mostly active on YouTube and Telegram.\n\nDo any of the smaller, independent groups have any real basis in society?\n\nI think they do. They may seem marginal, but any kind of real political activity in Russia is marginal right now. A recomposition is underway, and in that sense, being vocal is essential to establish real roots in society. I think we're doing rather well given the current situation.\n\nLooking into the future, what happens next? Do you see any openings for an antiwar or progressive movement in Russian society?\n\nI think the army is running out of steam. The deliveries of Western equipment are changing the military situation very seriously. It is very much like the Crimean War, when the British and French had superior weapons. If you speak to people close to the Russian military establishment, they're extremely worried and sometimes even panicking.\n\nI think if there are more defeats in Ukraine, then, well, something will happen. I don't know what, but some dramatic events are going to take place. I'm not saying they're going to launch a coup, because that's very much outside the Russian military tradition, but they can intervene in one way or another.\n\nIf they try to launch a general mobilization, or they expand the draft to new categories, then we'll get a rebellion. We don't know what the exact reaction will be, but it will be extremely negative.\n\nJust yesterday I was speaking to Grigory Yudin, another leftist sociologist in Moscow who just returned from abroad, and he said, \"Look, if you go around Moscow, what do you see? Huge fences everywhere. No other European country has so many fences.\" People behind the fence don't care about what is on the other side, they're just fenced into their little world.\n\nThe government is quite happy with the current society. But if they are forced to pull down all these fences, something will emerge that will change the game completely. It's a society of small groups isolated from each other, but at some point they're going to meet each other whether they like it or not. And that's the moment of opportunity for the Left, and for everybody who wants social change. People will have to learn how to communicate, how to organize, and how to identify their collective interests. That's exactly the moment that's approaching, and that's our chance.\n\nBoris Kagarlitsky is a professor of sociology at the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences and an editor at Rabkor .

We spoke to Russian socialists about why they're refusing to give in.\n\nRussian police officers detain a woman during an unsanctioned protest rally against the military invasion in Ukraine on March 6, 2022 in Moscow.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn Wednesday of last week, the pensioner activist Yelena Osipova, daughter to a Leningrad besieged by Nazi Germany, was dragged away by police as she joined antiwar protests. Hers was the most emblematic of over thirteen thousand arrests (according to OVD-Info 's tally) of Russians who have bravely denounced Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine.\n\nThe repression of the initial rallies following the February 24 invasion saw thousands handed prison sentences of a few days. But measures on Friday bringing Russia to the brink of martial law have set a far higher price for speaking out. A crackdown on liberal media like Dozhd and Novaya Gazeta , as well as foreign outlets, is now coupled with jail sentences of up to fifteen years for \"fake news\" critical of the war effort.\n\nDespite the announcements, Sunday saw fresh demonstrations - with over four thousand arrests yesterday alone. Actions are also planned for International Women's Day on March 8 - in 1917 famously the occasion of antiwar protests by the women of Petrograd. Ahead of this weekend's rallies, I asked Russian socialists about the makeup of the protests, popular attitudes toward the war, and the prospects of dissent spreading despite the harsh repression.\n\nRight from the start of the war, V. - a socialist involved in protests in Moscow - tells me, the mood on the protests was \"tense.\" The biggest demonstration in the capital was on February 24, the day of the invasion, while in subsequent days \"police arrested everyone on the streets who looked 'suspicious' so the crowds wouldn't even get a chance to assemble.\" She notes the effect of previous waves of repression in thinning out previous generations of oppositionists, like those involved in marches demanding the release of jailed dissident Alexei Navalny. This has had the effect that younger Russians are playing a bigger role in today's movement:\n\nThe main difference is how young the crowd is. Almost everyone is under thirty-five, it's mostly young adults and even minors (who are also getting arrested and brutalized by police). There are almost no older intelligentsia types, who represented a significant part of opposition protests in the previous years. There are many women, more than usual, I would say.\n\nThe Putin government has launched a major crackdown on activist networks and their media. So, how aware is the general population that street protests are even taking place? V. tells me that in Moscow:\n\nAlmost everyone knows - it's impossible not to notice the increase of heavy policing, brutal arrests, and occasional jamming of stations if you visit the city center. But I came under the impression that \"ordinary\" people mostly see the protests as useless at bringing you anything except for heavy beating by police and quick arrest with a prospect to spend a night (or ten, or fifteen, or, hell, maybe even fifteen years ) in prison.\n\nShe characterizes the initial popular reaction to the invasion in terms of surprise and incomprehension:\n\nIn the first day or two, people outside of the activist community barely discussed the war. Official Russian media were hardly saying anything about it, too. Some people were shocked (as I was), some didn't understand what was going on or didn't (yet) care. It seemed that even official media were taken by surprise by Putin's decision, and didn't expect it.\n\nThe harsh punishment of those who do protest is surely designed to reinforce passive resignation among the general population. But it seems that pro-Putin media are also now making a more coherent effort to mobilize a confected \"public opinion.\" V. tells me:\n\nThe media received their instructions and started beating the drums of war (though they call it a \"special operation\" to \"de-Nazify Ukraine\" from Banderites at fault for \"genocide\" in the Donbas, and a measure against NATO expansion (we had no choice, etc.). Some people accepted that line. When I was at the market, I witnessed a father telling his daughter (who was around eight years old), \"You know when someone keeps insulting you, at some point you just have to punch them.\" Maybe this is how some people read it. But now, there is hardly anything people can talk about except for the war. At work, in the metro - everyone is anxious and glued to their phones.\n\nThis element of surprise was also mentioned by M., a member of the Russian Socialist Movement in Yekaterinburg, the country's fourth largest city. She told me:\n\nOn the first day, when Putin had just declared war, my boyfriend from Donbas was sleeping sweetly next to me, I was very scared to wake him up with the words: \"The war has begun.\" Then I felt that I could not help but go outside now. Other people in the city felt the same: \"It's time,\" and we went out without a single center of coordination, it was a common impulse. It all started with single pickets under the statue of Lenin, and then people simply did not leave from there and remained standing, gradually completely filling the square. The police simply did not know what to do with us, they did not expect it. And we had the advantage - until they received a single order.\n\nIn this city in the Urals, on the first day of the war, the police imagined that Anatoly Svechnikov - local executive of Memorial, a recently closed-down NGO that investigates state repression and human rights abuses - must be behind the protest.\n\nThe policeman approached him and, apparently thinking that Anatoly was in charge here and could give orders, tried to argue: \"Well, you can ask the protesters to behave calmly.\" But the problem is that we no longer have main figures - all the strong oppositionists are persecuted by the state.\n\nM. agrees with V. that the protesters are mainly young:\n\nThe square was full of very young people, I have never seen so many people in their twenties at a protest. We shouted \"no to war\" and \"Putin resign\" until a crowd of helmeted police officers broke us into small groups. We then went on a procession through the city. Wherever we appeared, sooner or later police cars arrived and then the silent procession immediately began to aggressively shout: \"No to war\" or \"Shame\" in their direction and immediately leave. And the cops stayed where they were because they couldn't keep following us without orders.\n\nThat day, the procession was finally broken when a crowd of policemen in helmets and full uniforms herded us down a huge slippery staircase. We ran two hundred to three hundred meters in a straight line, and they were behind us with incredible speed. We dispersed and did not gather again.\n\nBut repression has already had its effect on protest numbers:\n\nOn, March 1, lawyer Aleksey Bushmakov said that the protesters completely filled all the special detention centers of the city and some of the detainees had to be taken to the neighboring city of Sysert. Every day fewer people came out, there were more and more policemen on the street...\n\nM. insists that this crackdown isn't the end of the antiwar movement. Yet, the need for the protests to constantly mutate, rather than rely on existing activist networks, has also made it necessary to rely on horizontal forms of organization that can operate without a single leadership. This has also heightened reliance on distributing simple antiwar messages via messaging apps, simply to break through the veil of depoliticization:\n\nFeminist Anti-War Resistance has done a brilliant thing. If the non-opposition part of society and I are in different bubbles, we need to reduce this distance. They wrote a mailing list for WhatsApp, with a call: \"If you don't send this letter to 7 friends, happiness and a peaceful life will not shine for you in the coming years !!!!\" So, in that style, in which our older relatives usually spread conspiracy theories to each other at the speed of light, we spread a letter with the truth about the war. Some say they've already received the letter from their own relatives, which means it's working.\n\nSuch a focus on decentralized, pop-up actions is also a natural by-product of the lack of real opposition parties and the Communist Party (KPRF)'s subordinate role within the dominant power structure. Its leadership generally sticks close to Putin's line; the KPRF tabled the parliamentary motion for the recognition of the self-styled Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics, which provided the initial pretext to send tanks across the border. This past Friday, forty of its fifty-seven MPs voted for the \"fifteen years law\" imposing lengthy jail sentences for \"fake news\"; none voted against, though eight abstained despite being present in parliament .\n\nThe reasons for these abstentions remain unclear - and are, in any case, hardly inspiring signs of rebellion. Yet, as the only thing approximating a mass party, the KPRF does in some limited measure reflect - and channel - pressures in wider society. Its role as one of few tolerated repositories for dissent also partly explains its high vote in September's election, in which it was attributed 19 percent in official results. This is also a curiously composite force: the sometimes weak central control over local organizations has allowed even social democrats and Trotskyists to stand as KPRF candidates, and parts of its base are involved in anything from strikes to anti-vaxx protests. V. tells me that is reflected in differing stances toward the war:\n\nMy source in the KPRF says the membership is split 75 percent for the war versus 25 percent against. As for the social base, after the last couple of years that saw people who are not happy with the regime increasingly voting for KPRF (mostly for pragmatic reasons), I think it would be safe to say that there is a great number of people who are against the war.\n\nThe KPRF is constantly under pressure from the Kremlin to defend the official line. But another member of the Russian Socialist Movement, O., tells me that some figures in the KPRF have openly denounced the war, including Mikhail Matveev, Oleg Smolin, and Vyacheslav Markhaev - three KPRF MPs who had earlier backed the initial motion to recognize the Donbas separatist republics:\n\nThe Kremlin has put the Communist Party into a very difficult - or, to be more exact, very simple - situation: either to resist Putin's rule or to disappear from political life forever. ... Matveev, Smolin, and one of the brightest young leaders of the Communist Party, Yevgeny Stupin, openly opposed the war. Stupin, together with the Russian Socialist Movement, organized a meeting of the Russian Left, where an antiwar resolution was adopted and an antiwar coalition of Russian independent, democratic leftists was organized.\n\nSome local-level legislators, in some cases nonparty figures elected on KPRF lists, have taken similar stances, as has the committee of the KPRF's Moscow youth organization. While justifying the initial vote in recognition of the Donbas republics, it denounced the \"fratricidal war,\" driven by \"Vladimir Putin's unhealthy geopolitical ambitions\" and providing only a \"source of income for the ruling elites.\" Conversely, KPRF leader Gennady Zyuganov has meekly submitted to the Putin government's war to \"decommunize\" Ukraine. O. points out the likely dismal effects of this alignment, and not just for the KPRF itself:\n\nMany left-wingers in Russia have never stopped saying that the death of the Communist Party will allow the \"real\" left-wing movement to flourish. We must definitively admit that this is not the case. If the KPRF cowardly renounced its positions today, it could bury the leftist movement and the leftist legacy as a whole under its own rubble. Not forever, of course, but for a while. Therefore, the members of the KPRF must try by all means to change the situation in the party, initiate internal discussions, convince comrades that the situation is critical: freedom or death.\n\nSome statements by KPRF dissidents have noted that such an antiwar stance was in fact at the origin of Europe's Communist Parties. As yet, there is no specific news that the dissidents within the KPRF and its parliamentary group have been expelled from its ranks. That said, the looming threat of martial law (despite current denials), and Kremlin pressure to eradicate all expressions of dissent, appear likely to force the situation to a head.\n\nFor now, it would be over-hasty to predict that ordinary Russians will play a decisive role in ending this war. Anecdotal evidence of soldiers surprised by the stiff Ukrainian resistance, or of Belarusian officers warning that their troops would revolt if called into combat, are probably the main reason to hope that pressure from below could make the war hard to continue. What can be said is that those calling for an end to the bloodshed offer Russian society a way out of the darkness - a small beacon of light, shining toward a Russia different from this one.\n\nDavid Broder is Jacobin 's Europe editor and a historian of French and Italian communism.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But his rise didn't owe to the \"brainless masses\" - it's the result of the social Darwinism that gripped Russia in its shock transition to capitalism.\n\nA billboard poster featuring President Vladimir Putin stands beyond a public tram stop in Moscow, Russia. (Andrey Rudakov / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWho is to blame for the war on Ukraine? Russia, obviously. But which Russia? Many Western and domestic liberal critics of Vladimir Putin's regime agree that support for the war comes overwhelmingly from \"vatniki\" or \"vata,\" who might be described as Russia's modern-day lumpenproletariat.\n\nThe original vatniki were the ubiquitous padded jackets worn by laborers, prisoners, and students all over the Soviet Union (\"vatnik\" comes from \"vata,\" or cotton wool). In recent years the term has become shorthand for a particular kind of person: over-fifty, often rural, almost certainly retired or a \"byudgetnik\" (employed by the state, whether as a teacher, nurse, or low-level official), and nostalgic for the stability and order of the Soviet system.\n\nCaricatured by the liberal intelligentsia as propaganda-addled zombies, the vatniki have become the key scapegoats for the government's imperial adventure in Ukraine. News articles on foreign sites like Radio Liberty or domestic liberal outlets such as Meduza are often accompanied by comments disparaging working-class Russians.\n\n\"I notice a trend,\" writes one Radio Liberty commenter under a recent vox pop relating to attitudes among Muscovites toward the so-called \"special military operation.\" \"The poorer a person, the less intellectually developed they are and consequently more susceptible to propaganda, more angry at the world. Putin's politics is aimed at the eradication of the middle class, those most educated, thinking and least susceptible to propaganda.\"\n\nEstablished voices tend to use more coded class language: for example, the exiled sociologist Igor Eidman refers to Putin supporters as the \"aggressively brainless\" who \"inhabit not reality but rather a cartoonish fever dream constructed by Russian television propaganda.\"\n\nSuch opinions have become commonplace, particularly in the wake of the Ukraine war. Yet it whitewashes and elides the essential role played by the middle and upper-middle classes in bringing about and sustaining Putinism.\n\n\"The Russian intelligentsia traditionally blames the lower classes for their alleged naiveté and tendency to be influenced by propaganda,\" says Natalia Kalfics-Mamonova, an expert on grassroots politics in the former Soviet Union at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs. \"However, the true picture is much more nuanced than that.\"\n\nShe notes that in an authoritarian context, it is probably impossible to know the extent of popular support for the war. According to her, even among regime functionaries and members of the security services, \"financial reasons often trump ideology and Soviet nostalgia\" when it comes to people's willingness to tolerate the war and other excesses. However grotesque it has become, Putinism remains at heart a neoliberal phenomenon.\n\nThat is a point made in a recent essay by prominent sociologist and Putin critic Grigory Yudin. The social order Putin built in Russia, he writes in the opposition outlet Meduza , is a \"radical version of modern neoliberal capitalism, in which greed rules, the ultimate aspiration is individual comfort, and cynicism, irony and nihilism provide a cosseting feeling of easy superiority.\" Yudin's contention contradicts a central mainstream shibboleth about Putin's Russia - that, whatever its problems or merits, Russia's current system has fundamentally broken with the post-Soviet Russia built in the 1990s under Boris Yeltsin.\n\nDepending on who you ask, those years were either a time of imperfect but blossoming democracy or chaos, humiliation, and degradation. Yet as Tony Wood, a member of the New Left Review editorial board, argued in his 2018 book, Russia Without Putin , \"The system that prevailed in the 2000s was not a perversion of Yeltsinism but its maturation.\" It remains underpinned by a commitment to insider capitalism at home and postimperial denial abroad, with rampant inequality whose effects are papered over by commodity booms and the tattered remnants of the Soviet welfare state. The poet and activist Kirill Medvedev concurs. \"For all Putin's rhetoric of Soviet nostalgia, he is a man of the '90s, the heir to [Russian president Boris] Yeltsin,\" he told me.\n\nAnd just as the 1990s oligarchs were deeply entangled with the state, so the \"siloviki\" (securocrats) who have replaced them as the arbiters of political power under Putin are embedded in the capitalist system. For all their superficial differences, both groups turned the apparatus of the state into an instrument for individual enrichment. As business and mafia groups were gradually brought under the control of the security services, the state absorbed and internalized their profit-driven ideology and modi operandi.\n\nMany of Russia's most vociferously anti-Putin voices supported the neoliberal underpinnings of his regime even after its repressive and exploitative nature became apparent. Natasha Sindeyeva, owner of the opposition broadcaster TV Rain (Dozhd), relocated the station to Latvia after it was shut down following the Ukraine invasion. But, as she admits in the recent documentary F@ck this Job , she was an enthusiastic supporter of former prime minister Dmitry Medvedev during his four-year term as placeholder president from 2008-12. Other recent political émigrés, such as Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin's former special envoy to international organizations and former prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov, were so-called systemic liberals - reform-minded officials integrated into Putin's power system - who helped underpin many of Putin's early economic reforms.\n\nIndeed, the vilification of the lowly vatniki obscures the fact that, in his first decade in power, Putin relied heavily on support from the aspirational middle classes. This was after all the original core audience for Dozhd: educated white-collar urbanites who coveted Western lifestyles and consumer goods but remained largely apolitical until the first of the mass middle-class protests against the government in 2011. It was only when the economy stopped being able to deliver rising living standards and Putin turned decisively toward a politics of socially conservative populism at home and Soviet irredentism abroad - marked by the 2014 invasion of Crimea - that he was finally abandoned by this social group.\n\nAccording to Medvedev, \"The idea that the well-off are anti-war and the poor and uneducated are pro-war is not borne out by reality.\" He believes that support for the war among poorer and working-class people is actually lower than among the middle classes. \"Those with very little seek stability because they are afraid to lose what little they have,\" says Medvedev. \"Any shock can be fatal, and war jeopardizes stability.\"\n\nIndeed, it was the vatniki who provided some of the greatest challenges to Putinism, especially in its early, most openly neoliberal incarnation. In 2005, the government was forced to ditch planned social reforms, including scrapping free transport for seniors, after pensioner protests brought the country to a standstill. A decade later, truckers revolted over a corrupt motorway toll rollout.\n\nSocial elitism has been an integral part of Russian liberalism since its inception. The pioneering nineteenth-century liberal philosopher Pyotr Chaadayev, among the first to claim that Russia lagged hopelessly behind Western civilization and could only be redeemed through a clean break with its past, was convinced that only a miniscule elite - the intelligentsia - was capable of awakening and stewarding the mute, slumbering masses. \"A tiny minority thinks; the rest merely feel,\" Chaadayev wrote in his Philosophical Letters .\n\nChaadayev's conception of the masses - irrational, unsophisticated, and easily swayed - survived both the heated Westernizer-Slavophile debates of the 1800s and the Soviet system, which purportedly glorified the common man even as it withheld real political agency from the working class. The shock therapy of the 1990s, which brought untold wealth to a clutch of oligarchs and the pauperization of much of the country, turbocharged that age-old notion into a kind of outright social Darwinism.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has further legitimized the rhetoric of class hatred, often deployed by Ukrainians online against the occupiers. Since 2014, invading Russian troops have been frequently characterized as poor, backward, and violent; a 2015 survey of anti-Russian hate speech in the Ukrainian media by the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine found that \"vatnik\" was the most frequently used term of abuse.\n\nIn many ways, the discourse around vatniki resembles Hillary Clinton's notion of the \"deplorables.\" Then, American working-class voters were blamed by many in the liberal establishment for Donald Trump's victory despite his being backed by billionaires and CEOs; indeed the income of the average Trump voter was higher than that for Clinton. Today, their Russian counterparts are being scapegoated for a war being waged by a man whose regime remains sustained by oligarchs. In fact, the war in Ukraine has been weaponized against the poor, and not just in Russia. As the US cultural commentator Angie Speaks noted in a rare piece of dissent in Newsweek shortly after the outbreak of the war, the US working class is now \"being asked to suffer to punish Putin\" through rising petrol and food prices resulting from sanctions on Russia.\n\nAs the war drags on, bringing with it increasing social and economic costs, it is difficult to avoid pointing fingers. Yet \"it's important not to keep throwing around the blame between Putin, or different kinds of Russian people, or the West,\" says Medvedev. \"There is enough blame for everyone. What's important is to focus on the future and find ways of collective resistance.\"\n\nVadim Nikitin writes about post-Soviet politics and researches financial crime in the former USSR.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But Ukrainian resistance turned it into yet another imperial quagmire - showing that the great powers aren't as able to reshape the modern world as they think.\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin and Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu attend a wreath-laying ceremony in Alexander Garden in Moscow, Russia on February 23, 2023. (Pavel Bednyakov / Sputnik / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has turned into a quagmire, defying initial expectations. Although Russian forces appear set to launch a new offensive this spring, they will face a Ukrainian army - bolstered by aid from the United States and Europe - that has already scored several key successes in the fight to roll back the invaders. Barring a breakthrough on the frontlines, Vladimir Putin's invasion looks like it will join the post-1945 world's long litany of failed wars of conquest.\n\nYet Russian military setbacks contrast with the situation on the diplomatic front, where Putin's invasion has shed light on the growing isolation of Ukraine's NATO partners. Key nations in the Global South refuse to follow the Western bloc into a confrontation with Moscow, whether through economic sanctions, military aid to Kyiv, or by supporting UN resolutions condemning the invasion.\n\nThe war thus looks like an example of what Bertrand Badie, one of the foremost French experts on global politics, calls the \"powerlessness of power.\" Emeritus professor of international relations at Sciences Po, Badie has pinpointed the growing inability of military means to achieve political ends, as social forces emerge as the dominant factor in international relations. This argument contradicts the common interpretation of the Russia-Ukraine war as heralding a revival of power politics. But the critique is an important one, as the Left struggles to cope with the hard challenges posed by rising geopolitical conflict.\n\nAhead of the first anniversary of the invasion, Badie sat down with Jacobin 's Harrison Stetler to discuss what the war reveals about the state of global politics.\n\nYou have studied global politics for nearly half a century, analyzing things as varied as state formation and the role of memory in international relations. A year into Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, have any of your certainties been shaken?\n\nUndermined, certainly not - I might even say \"reinforced,\" perhaps at the expense of coming off as stubborn. I think that 2022 didn't deliver much in the way of anything new. Rather, it revealed a lot about the underlying forces that have been at work for years and even decades, which we haven't wanted to get to grips with. I have always considered, for example, that there have been three major ruptures since 1945, which have unfortunately been underestimated.\n\nThe first rupture was decolonization, which the old colonial powers have downplayed because it marked their first great defeat. But with decolonization, we discovered an absolutely remarkable international phenomenon, which was that the \"weak\" could beat the \"strong\" and that power was not always effective. This realization should have led us to consider that international politics was about more than the crude balance of power. If raw power was all that mattered, then decolonization would not have taken place, or the Soviets would have won in Afghanistan, or the Americans in Afghanistan, and Vietnam, and Iraq, or France in the Sahel .\n\nSomething is going on that we've been reluctant to take on board. Decolonization saw the victory of the \"weak\" over the \"strong\" and revealed that societies could be more decisive than states - in other words, that the social could now prevail over the political. We are seeing this again today to a certain degree, in Ukrainian society's capacity to resist the much-vaunted Russian army.\n\nThe second rupture is depolarization, which is not only the end of the \"bipolar\" Cold War world but also the discovery of another grammar of international relations, the consequences of which have not been fully drawn. The fault lies first with Bill Clinton's two catastrophic terms in office. NATO was consolidated after the Warsaw Pact disappeared. I don't know if NATO should have been dissolved. In any case, it should have been rethought in an extremely profound way so as to allow the Western powers to do what all the other states in the world have allowed themselves to do since then, i.e. to engage in a fluid international situation.\n\nAfter 1989, NATO transformed itself into one of the crutches of what you call the \"oligarchical club.\"\n\nYes, it turned into a closed club, losing many remarkable opportunities to diversify its relations, notably with countries in the Global South. A lot of time was lost by not moving forward in this domain, where Putin's Russia, we have to admit, has been much more adaptive thanks to forums like the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Russia too has known how to establish itself in a particularly cynical and brutal way in Africa, where we now see Russian flags flying. The great misfortune of Europe, and I would say of the Western world in general, including the United States, is not having understood that it was no longer alone in the world and that there were new powers that now mattered.\n\nThe third rupture is globalization, which has completely changed the rules of the game. It has made us move from the sovereigntist stage [of international politics] to a stage of interdependence.\n\nYou're going a little bit against what is the most common interpretation of this war: that overnight we suddenly found ourselves in a \"new world,\" or better yet, back in a new old world, with war once again \"back in Europe.\" In your telling, what we've seen since February 24, 2022 has been more of an acceleration of processes or forces already at work.\n\nExactly. Once again, how is it that we do not see that since 1945, the Western powers have not won a single war? This is a terribly brutal fact when it comes to the conception that we have of ourselves, and even that others have of us. We continue to speak of Western hegemony while the West has been beaten in wars over and over again - with decolonization, in Vietnam, and in Iraq and the Middle East in general.\n\nThere is certainly a parallel to be drawn with the incapacity of the Russian military to achieve the Kremlin's objectives in Ukraine. But military setbacks aside, isn't there too much being made about the supposed \"decline\" or \"weakening\" of the Western powers? I'm reminded of a column published by the New York Times in January 2020 that pointed out that despite a decade dominated by fears of national decline, the United States was the only major economy, with China, that saw its share of global output increase between 2010 and 2020.\n\nHow do you explain this situation, where the classical tools of power seem to be more and more devalued, even if the privileges of power are still consolidated around this oligarchic bloc?\n\nI don't talk about the \"weakening\" of the West, which is doing very well in several areas. I prefer to call this phenomenon the \"powerlessness of power.\" There is certainly no \"Western decline\" either: I strongly disagree with this formulation. Rather, there's a decline of \"power\" as such, a phenomenon that the USSR knew and that Putin's Russia is now facing as well. And as soon as China ventures away from its strong points, it gets into trouble. We are in a world where power is devalued.\n\nThe devaluation of power should not be confused with economic and commercial performance, either. It is perhaps precisely because globalization has favored trade that it has also favored a blunting of power. In our liberal and Western frameworks, we tend to mix the two, but they have strictly no relation. The basis of globalization is interdependence. And this interdependence favors trade and, from a certain point of view, profits as well.\n\nBut on the other hand, it clearly undermines sovereignty. So, I don't see any contradiction between the fact that while there is commercial or financial prosperity, state power recedes. Earlier I said that the social forces have a leg up on political ones, and I include economic exchange in the \"social.\" One of the main victims of globalization is Thomas Hobbes.\n\nBut does the \"powerlessness of power\" really apply to the Russia-Ukraine conflict? Ukrainian society has been able to keep at bay what was considered to be a vastly superior Russian army. But the scales of the war have also been tipped by transfers from sophisticated Western arsenals, which is one of the arguments advanced by those in Europe and the United States calling for more military aid to Kyiv.\n\nWe need to be lucid about the fact that on February 24, 2022, Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on the premise of taking Kyiv in a few days or even in a few hours! And that was a total failure. This failure is attributable, of course, to arms deliveries from the West, but I believe that it is mainly attributable to social resilience, which is a factor that analysts of international relations have been reluctant to consider even if decolonization should have already alerted them to it. We French ought to know a thing or two about the power of social resistance - we saw the French army beaten by Algerian partisans, eight years after being beaten by the Vietnamese.\n\nNow, what is very interesting in the Russia-Ukraine conflict is that Putin believed that he would restore Russian power through an old-fashioned war. What we have seen is just the opposite. Old-fashioned wars do not work anymore. There's one major thing that we're struggling to understand: since 1945, wars of conquest no longer work. What successful wars of conquest have there been? The West Bank by Israel? Yes, but this conquest has never really been finished off. The Palestinian resistance remains intact fifty-five years after the initial conquest by the Israeli military.\n\nThe first Russian blitzkrieg was defeated. But could Moscow also have been banking on a permanent decoupling from an international system still institutionally dominated by the United States and Europe? Or even on moving toward a fortress-Russia model for national power?\n\nI don't think so. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has revealed precisely the depth of interdependence between Russia and the rest of the world up to 2022. If there is a global energy crisis today, it is because of this interdependence. If there is a food crisis in the Global South, it is because of this interdependence. And if the Russian economy is facing increasing difficulties, it is proof that the survival of Russian society depends on its capacity to be linked to the world economy, which it had managed to achieve thanks to its energy resources. If I had to characterize the current situation, I would say there's a crisis of interdependence between Russia and the rest of the world, rather than a crisis of an affirmation of Russia's independence from the rest of the world.\n\nThe best proof is on the diplomatic front: as Russia moves away from the West, it is spectacularly deepening its relations with everyone else. How else can we make sense of the remarkable closeness between Russia and Saudi Arabia, or between Russia and Israel, between Russia and the United Arab Emirates and India, or between Russia and the other BRICS? We can see that Putin's main concern is to compensate for the rift with the West by mending his relations with all the other countries of the world.\n\nLet's turn to the Global South. That term has gotten a lot of attention over the last year to make sense of the considerable number of states that have refused to back UN General Assembly resolutions condemning Russia. But this term covers a huge diversity of interests and power centers - can we really say that there is a common (let alone alternative) project uniting these countries?\n\nYes, precisely. That's the heart of the matter. A common denominator that unites the Global South - from the main emerging powers to the least-developed countries - is the feeling of exclusion from world governance, and these countries' inability to bring their real weight to bear on globalization as it is developing today. It is less about economics, where they have had enormous success. But in any case, on the institutional level, it can be seen through the inability of certain states to obtain a seat as a permanent member on the UN Security Council, or the closing-off of the G7 while the G20, which was intended to gradually replace the G7, gets increasingly marginalized.\n\nThe votes on the UN General Assembly resolutions, with about fifty states either abstaining or not participating, translates as a rejection of permanent passivity and these countries' refusal to pay the price of a Russia-Ukraine conflict that is not of their making. This has taken on an increasingly anti-Western bent because Putin has sought to make inroads in the Global South, which the West has continued to ignore. The paradox is that Putin has been clever to try to draw dividends from his defeat by seeking to portray himself to the Global South as also being a victim of Western hegemony.\n\nHow do you view what's going on within the Western bloc? Talk of negotiation seems to have fully receded in the short term, but much of the divisions seem to be papered over as the discussion now centers on the extent of military support that ought to be sent to Ukraine.\n\nIn fact, it is much more tragic than that. There is not a clearly thought-out Western strategy for the Ukrainian crisis. In a war, one defines political objectives and puts the necessary means - notably military ones - toward attaining those objectives. The type of conflict we are facing today does not allow for clear objectives. For example, Emmanuel Macron says that there can be no military victory, but that Russia must be defeated without being crushed. This is a perfect contradiction.\n\nIf there can be no military victory, Russia cannot be defeated. Would this mean its total withdrawal from the Ukrainian territory as it existed before 2014? Is it the cessation of hostilities? Is it the liberation of the Donbas ? No one knows or cares to say. This is tragic because when an actor in a conflict does not know the assigned goal, they become completely paralyzed and cannot define the type of weaponry needed because they cannot identify the actual objectives.\n\nFortunately, the other side is in the same situation. Putin no longer has clear objectives. He knows that he cannot conquer Kyiv. He knows that he will not overpower the Western bloc. But what is he looking for? To consolidate what he has taken? To keep Crimea at all costs? We don't know. This war is so bewildering because we've lost sight of what objectives are really being sought.\n\nIn this context, we need to change our thinking. We need systemic pressure from the whole world to stop this conflict. Look at all the wars since 1945. They have not ended in defeat or victory for anyone, but simply in abandonment thanks to the realization that the costs were too great to continue.\n\nA great deal depends on China. Since last weekend's Munich Security Conference, the United States has sought to drum up attention around the possibility that China could soon deepen its partnership with Russia, and even go so far as to send military aid. What do you make of the Chinese position and talk of a further rapprochement between Beijing and Moscow?\n\nWe need to be vigilant, but doubly cautious. First, because in conflicts of this nature, rhetoric is important and it is often dissuasive. Denouncing a supposedly imminent collusion between Russia and China is one of the best-known diplomatic tactics to prevent one from taking place.\n\nSecond, we have to be careful with the choice of words. The word \"alliance\" is often used to describe the relationship between China and Russia, but it's not appropriate. Just look at the history of China: this multi-millennial empire has never technically been allied with anyone. What has long characterized China is its self-perception as a central power, which does not need to be embedded in a network of alliances. China, today more than ever, is playing the card of its own autonomy. But at the same time, it's playing the card of systemic stability. In contrast to Russia, China has an enormous interest in the stability of the international system.\n\nWhat is true, however, is that China does not see it as a bad thing that Russia and the West are weakening each other. But how much do the Chinese want to weaken us? If we are weakened too much, they lose markets. And for different reasons, China does not want this confrontation to lead to a collapse of the Russian empire, because this would be catastrophic for China and could leave it to face the Western bloc alone. It is true that Beijing is helping Moscow and that China's leaders are savoring playing that role. That being said, I still don't see - even if I could be wrong - what interest China would have in transforming this pragmatic connivance into a real alliance that would place it in an antagonistic position with the West.

There are already some 2 million refugees, as bombs and missiles rain down on cities around Ukraine. Early setbacks for the invading forces have often fed the idea that Vladimir Putin's actions have backfired. Yet Ukrainians face the prospect of a long and drawn-out war, with no end in sight even despite their stiff military resistance.\n\nVolodymyr Artiukh is a Ukrainian anthropologist specializing in labor and migration in the post-Soviet space. Jana Tsoneva asked him about Putin's imperial agenda, the last eight years of war, and what hopes exist of a viable peace process.\n\nHow is the war related to the post-2014 outbreak of civil war?\n\nBriefly, the Maidan protests of 2013-14, Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea, and support of the uprising in Donbas led to a change in the geo-economic and geopolitical orientation of Ukraine. Ukraine signed an association agreement with the European Union, changed its cultural and political orientation in favor of Euro-Atlantic structures, and abandoned the idea of integration with the Russian project of an economic and political union. Russia reacted to this by consolidating an anti-Western narrative.\n\nThe Crimea annexation, which was largely bloodless, led to a boost in Putin's domestic popularity. Then, he hoped to capitalize on the uprising in Donbas, which was an uprising against the change of government in Kiev. This uprising was construed as self-defense of the \"Russian world\" against Western-supported Ukrainian nationalists. Ukraine was increasingly represented as a failed state with an illegitimate Western-controlled government that terrorizes Russian speakers. All these ideological elements are present now as Putin's justification of the invasion: denazification, demilitarization, decommunization .\n\nDid the new government in Kiev do something to them to trigger this uprising in the East?\n\nThis was a revolt that started essentially in a similar way to the Maidan - as a grassroots mobilization, with barricades and takeover of local governments in several eastern cities. Initially it was a purely negative phenomenon - against something rather than for something. But soon, guys with a particular mix of the Russian-imperialist ideology and Soviet nostalgia - hoping for a union with Russia and inspired by the annexation of Crimea - took over this local uprising.\n\nTheir idea was to spread the uprising to the rest of south-eastern Ukraine, which they called Novorossiya, referring to the time of the Russian Empire. Russia eventually integrated these semi-independent warlords into the Russian security apparatus. This led to an attempt of the Kiev government to take back Donbas in summer 2014 with the so-called anti-terrorist operation.\n\nIt was a war waged against the rebels, who were already quite pro-Russian and fought for an independence from Ukraine and for integration with Russia. Eventually Russian troops entered there on several occasions in 2014 and 2015. These incursions led to very significant defeats of the Ukrainian army with significant loss of life and equipment, which forced the Ukrainian government to sign the Minsk agreements.\n\nEventually, the spread of the uprising to Ukraine more widely faltered - but it was still mobilized by Russia to redirect the Ukrainian government as a whole, to use the self-proclaimed \" people's republics \" as a leverage against Kiev's pro-Western orientation. The Minsk agreements were essentially a diplomatic expression of the Russian military superiority; Russian military victory was translated into this diplomatic document. These agreements basically complemented the fighting rather than stopping it.\n\nDid the Ukrainian government honor these agreements?\n\nNeither side honored them - the divergence of interpretations emerged almost instantly. The agreements were not meant, in hindsight, to stop the war but to contain the military action, to dampen the contradictory interests of Ukrainian and Russian elites, to contain the military action so that the parties could regroup and prepare for the next round of fighting.\n\nSo, the ceasefire, which was only one part of the agreements, ebbed and flowed. At times, there was almost a full-fledged war; at times almost a real ceasefire, for example for almost half a year since summer 2020. The rhythm of the military action accompanied political negotiations. Ultimately these agreements were just a diplomatic break on the war, not its negation.\n\nVolodymyr Ishchenko writes that only 20 percent of Ukrainians approved of joining NATO in 2007, doubling to 40 percent after the Crimea annexation, but still not the majority. So, what precipitated the geopolitical shift around 2013 and Maidan?\n\nIt's true that prior to the Maidan of 2013, Ukrainian society was quite polarized; there was no majority in favor of either Russian or EU integration, much less in favor of NATO. The cause of the Maidan uprising was internal rather than geopolitical; it started as a popular uprising against an extremely corrupt and authoritarian regime, but eventually these contradictions of Ukrainian society were capitalized on by the oligarchs, also for electoral ends.\n\nSo, the Maidan uprising was quickly hijacked by one of these fractions to streamline the popular discontent into this pro-EU pro-NATO straitjacket. A whole stratum of self-organized volunteers, paramilitary groups, NGOs, political adventurers, and intellectuals emerged after Maidan, who combined nationalism, neofascism, economic liberalism, and \"Occidentalism\" - a loose idea of the Western civilization. This was amplified by Western soft power and a network of NGOs - the familiar story.\n\nSo, the more the conflict progressed along these lines - with Russia also playing its role in amplifying this conflict with its own imperialist ideology - people's perception was increasingly put in these very narrow confines: either the West or Russia.\n\nNevertheless, there was still a silent majority in whose common sense these questions were rather superficial. For them, these were not the major concerns, but they didn't have another way of speaking of their problems publicly. This majority elected Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019. He promised to end the war, to not press the issues of identity and language. He appealed to the good sense of the majority while glossing over these divisive issues.\n\nBut he also constitutionalized the new geopolitical orientation of Ukraine.\n\nYes, a year into his tenure as a president, he changed direction. Initially he was accused of being pro-Russian, accused of preparing to capitulate to Russia. But as essentially every president of Ukraine does, he tried to concentrate as much power as he could. He had to defeat his nationalist enemies, attract their constituency, and became this Napoleonic figure that balanced the Right and Left, pro-Russians and pro-Europeans, and at one of the turns he got stuck in the pro-Western nationalist corner. And at this point, everything collapsed.\n\nAnd now the war has only radicalized this position?\n\nYes, the war changed everything.\n\nWe discussed the Russian involvement in the run-up to the war - so what was NATO's role?\n\nLook, there are Russia-NATO relations that stretch back to 1991 and back to the Soviet-NATO confrontation. This is one level. But I would insist on separating this from a second layer which is Ukraine-Russia-NATO. You can't reduce the one thing to the other.\n\nUkrainian NATO membership wasn't really on the table, right?\n\nYes. And in the recent diplomatic talks, before the war, Joe Biden was willing to entertain the possibility for a moratorium on Ukrainian NATO membership. He stressed that NATO would not be involved in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Among other powerful Western powers, such as France and Germany, nobody seriously considered Ukraine joining.\n\nDid Russia use NATO's expansion as a fig leaf then?\n\nDefinitely. Take, for example, the ultimatum which Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov issued back in December about rolling back NATO's border to the pre-1997 period. The call to decide literally the next day meant that no one could see this as a good faith negotiation. I think the idea of going to war in Ukraine, one way or another, was already there and they needed the war itself as a negotiating mechanism. They wanted to use war as a way of getting information from the West, like, what is the highest level of escalation that the West can afford? How far can we - Russia - go? What can we do in our backyard, and how far can they go in response?\n\nWhy would they want to know that?\n\nBecause that's not the end of the matter. Because they think ahead. If you listen to Russia's officials and read their ideological manifestos, if you read people who interpret Russian foreign policy decision makers in the Kremlin - they see these apocalyptic events coming. They see the world changing to the core. They see that we live in the new world and Russia needs to find its place otherwise it will be eaten by these predators, by China or the US. They're reasoning along the lines of \"we need to act now, it's now or never, there is time and it will either be glorious or we perish.\" They also hope that they will join China in a sort of alliance. And they already need to mark their territory. The logic is: \"There's seven bad years ahead, but then we'll have our hundred years of empire.\" This is the frame of mind, if you read closely what the Russians are saying.\n\nLeft-leaning media emphasize NATO's role - but your reading makes me think that the talk about NATO was some kind of fake excuse for Russia.\n\nIt was not. Let's put it this way, in the long-term perspective of the last three decades. For Putin and for his very tight-knit elite group, it was real: NATO pushing right up to the border was a defeat for them. Most of NATO's expansion happened on Putin's watch, except for the first round. The rest of it happened on his watch. Of course, he talks about Russia's interest in geopolitical terms. But he also sees it as his personal defeat, a matter of his legitimacy, not only in the eyes of average Russians, but in the eyes of the elite.\n\nBut didn't Russia want at some point to join?\n\nPutin said something like this, but it wasn't serious. The broader problem, if we leave aside his perception of threats, was that the West did not manage to inscribe Russia in a more comprehensive security agreement and all of the bilateral and multilateral agreements. So, for Putin, partly it was this defeat that needs to be corrected now.\n\nLike when he speaks of 1991 as a \"catastrophe.\"\n\nYes, and this long-term perspective had a caricatural representation in Lavrov's ultimatum, seeking to solve the whole problem in a matter of two months. What he said was that NATO was going to Ukraine and was about to station weapons there: a hysterical spectacle, a performance of all these grievances. But this diplomatic spectacle was not meant to resolve this thirty-year-old problem.\n\nSo, the war in Ukraine is not a direct consequence of NATO expansion. It's Russia's proactive step to change, to break this structure of power relations in which Russia existed. It was not reactive in the sense of an immediate threat, it was a predator's attack at the moment when, according to the Kremlin, the enemy was at its weakest. The diplomatic spectacle was a distraction.\n\nLet's talk about the liberal take on the situation that Putin wants to recreate the old \"Soviet empire\" in its former borderlands.\n\nLet's just abandon this ridiculous idea that Putin wants to restore the Soviet Union. Listen to Putin himself - he spent half his speech castigating Lenin.\n\nAnd promised the \"decommunization\" of Ukraine.\n\nYes, exactly. For him, decommunization means destroying this \" affirmative action empire \" that was the USSR. Putin wants to destroy the economic and national units that the USSR created throughout its history. He wants to essentially rebuild the Russian empire with one imperial center. Not necessarily within the boundaries of the old, but with a similar power structure of one imperial center resting on an oppressive apparatus without any hegemonic ideology that mobilizes people from below.\n\nHegemonic leadership implies concession to the partners in the hegemonic power bloc, as the Soviet Union did, making some concessions to the nationalities. Putin is not interested in hegemony. He's interested in building this \"vertical power\" that begins and ends with the Kremlin. This is a very different thing to the Soviet Union. You need only look at how Putin talks to his Security Council, like to schoolchildren who failed their homework assignment. Compared to that, the Communist Party was a shining example of direct democracy.\n\nWhen the invasion happened on February 24, you wrote that you had seen it coming. How did you do so?\n\nThe process that led to the war was already visible in the first war scare of April 2021, when the first Putin-Biden meeting happened after Russia piled up troops on the border with Ukraine. Back then, everyone expected a war to happen at that point.\n\nBut instead, Putin and Biden started talks on strategic stability and Putin made some claims regarding Ukraine, especially about the Minsk agreements. Nominally the troops were withdrawn from the borders after this meeting, but everyone knew that a substantial number remained. However, immediately after that Putin talked about the red lines, the asymmetric response if the lines are crossed; then he wrote his Ukraine article , which was essentially an ultimatum directed at Zelensky. This article was the draft of his war declaration speech that we saw in two parts over February 22 and February 24. It was probably recorded in one go.\n\nSo, after the Putin-Biden meeting in 2021, the military infrastructure and substantial numbers of weapons remained at the border. There was a surge in September and October with a large-scale military exercise, the Zapad (\"West\") exercise, when the number of troops exceeded those that are now active in Ukraine, and these exercises were explicitly about taking over Ukraine. They did it as an exercise. Simultaneously, the breakaway regions of Donbas were all but integrated into Russia. More than half a million inhabitants gained Russian citizenship. The leaders of these republics got membership of the Russian ruling party.\n\nOnly wishful thinkers assumed that Putin would still want to go ahead with the Minsk process. By that time it was clear that even if Putin went along with Minsk, it would mean a war by other means, because the process implies that Ukraine reintegrates these territories, but they were de facto already integrated into Russia. They had their own military and so on, but being constitutionally integrated into Ukraine, they would have a free hand in the rest of the territory where they would clash with Ukrainian nationalists. In Ukraine, an internal revolt would have happened against such an implementation of the Minsk agreements, anyway. So, the Minsk process was another name for dismembering Ukraine and war in slow motion.\n\nUkraine has been treating them like foreign lands: it doesn't pay pensions, social payments, all these financial and fiscal ties have been cut. I mean, can they ever go, or do they even want to go back? There's also the issue of the language.\n\nI don't think it was feasible, even before the war. Ukraine's elites were already resigned to the fact that these were not their territories and the elite in these breakaway republics never thought that they would join Ukraine. When Putin recognized their independence, there was briefly a sigh of relief among Ukraine's elites. They didn't know the war was coming. Until the last moment, they didn't believe that there would be war. But they were relieved that they had finally gotten rid of these troubled regions.\n\nThe West reacted to the war with sanctions which the media called unprecedented. Do you think the sanctions are going to stop Putin or will there be a world war?\n\nThe sanctions will not stop the war. Only tanks and guns can stop tanks and guns.\n\nWell, these tanks and guns need fuel and ammo and only money can buy them. How are they going to finance the war if it drags on?\n\nI'm talking about a long-term perspective. If the sanctions remain for years, probably we will see this effect. And even that is not given because we don't know how China will react, but in the short term, there is no way the sanctions will impact the course of the war.\n\nHow about the antiwar movement in Russia? Is there any hope that Russians themselves will take down the regime and put an end to the war?\n\nNo. The majority of the population in one way or another support the war. That's clear now.\n\nReally? The Levada Center registered only 40 percent support for the war.\n\nThe latest polls show a much higher percentage.\n\nAren't they government-controlled?\n\nYes, there are issues with polls in Russia because the rate of nonresponses is very high. So, we probably aren't accounting for a huge share of the population who for one reason or another refuse to respond. But let's say that there is an indication that opponents of the war are a minority. Moreover, there is no political structure behind them, because the structure was destroyed in recent years. Add to that the immense increase in the repressive apparatus in Russia and the institutionalization of censorship. The antiwar movement is necessary, of course, it is a good thing, we need to support and increase cooperation with those Russian scholars and activists and we need to fight xenophobia against them. But this is for the future.\n\nWhat needs to be done in the short term, now that people are under fire and running away?\n\nTry to help the refugees and relieve the evolving humanitarian disaster in Ukraine. Western governments should not only think about supplying weapons and so on, but of canceling Ukraine's foreign debt, providing economic assistance, and how to help to achieve ceasefires to get people out from under the bombs. They need to think about what's going to happen with Ukraine's economy very soon and how it's going to impact the world food market.\n\nThese are the things that we can do and Western governments can do. They can, of course, influence the military action there. They are doing this, but now it ultimately depends on Ukrainians' willingness to fight, which is now quite considerable. Even the Russian-speaking Ukrainians are rallying around the flag.\n\nDo you see the West sending armies at some point?\n\nThis will not happen. They are sending guns and anti-tank weapons, and there is talk of sending warplanes - I don't know whether that will materialize or not. This won't change the strategic picture. It helps to drag on and postpone Russia's victory. It's better to fight with an anti-tank missile than with your bare hands.\n\nBut if it drags on, what are the Ukrainians to do?\n\nThere will be a slow takeover of Ukraine by Russia, city by city, with immense destruction and with immense suffering.\n\nLike Chechnya.\n\nYes, but it can't be ruled out that, at some point, Russia will sink all its resources in Ukraine. Actually, Russia already seems to be running out of resources and will need to mobilize its economy and then more recruits, reservists and so on, and that will likely significantly change the picture inside Russia. Probably it will have a negative impact, much more negative than the sanctions, but it remains to be seen. I remain pessimistic in regards to the outcome of this war. I still don't think that Ukraine's army can prevail. As to whether Putin can achieve his goals of regime change: definitely not. There is no way he can sustain a stable pro-Russian regime.\n\nBecause there would be another Maidan followed by another invasion?\n\nYes, and you see this already - in Russian-speaking cities, mind you - with peaceful protests in the cities captured by the Russians. There is an army. There are attacks on the streets, yet people take to the protests unarmed. If this is happening now, it's definitely going to happen to any regime Putin may install.\n\nIs there a way out for Putin?\n\nI don't think he knows himself. It's this situation when you jump into the fight and then you see - that's what they did. They miscalculated gravely. They thought that the Ukrainian army would fold and that the people would come with flowers to cheer, but this didn't happen.\n\nThe West also risks losing face. I didn't see any appetite for war in the West last year, neither from the US - which explicitly said we don't need trouble in Europe, we need to focus on China - nor from the EU. That's also part of the reason why Putin did it because he saw that the West was not ready to deal with a war. You remember Emmanuel Macron making a fool of himself proclaiming that, oh, I brought peace and the week after Putin invaded. So, the West can't do anything, to be honest. The war, unfortunately, has to be fought out between the Ukrainian and Russian army. The balance of power on the battlefield will decide pretty much everything else. And there is no good news. It's just death and death and death.\n\nOne final question concerning knowledge production in war. You have criticized US-centric paradigms trying to explain the conflict. I agree with you that when they talk about the war, Americans have a tendency to talk mostly about themselves. What kind of frameworks do we need to begin to understand this war?\n\nI think we need to take a break analyzing the US hegemony, because we know pretty much everything about it already, and very little about how Russia came to be like this beyond this cliché caricature that American scholars paint of Putin and Russia.\n\nSome parts of the Left also needs to abandon the idea that Russia is somehow a continuation of the Soviet Union, or that it is the underdog in the imperialist fight that needs to be supported. We need to pay closer attention to what Russian scholars have done. We need to think more deeply about how the Kremlin guys picture themselves, what they imagine is happening around them and what may motivate them beyond what the West imagines is rational. Clearly their goals and the way they work is different than we imagine. We need to pay attention to the internal dynamics in the Ukraine-Russia relations. This is not something we know a lot about beyond the simplistic Western portrayal of the good democratic Ukraine versus the terrible authoritarian Russia or the evil Nazi Ukraine versus the eternally mistreated Russia.\n\nWe need much closer cooperation with the Left in Ukraine, Russia, and the West, which has not been happening beyond occasional meetings. Because the Left is a bearer of some knowledge, limited knowledge, but some unusual and probably insightful knowledge about the situation. A lot of people on the Left in Russia and Ukraine will need concrete material help, and they need understanding, because the fog of war destroys rational and critical thinking, and you need to be patient with people who make mistakes and will make mistakes. It's impossible not to make a mistake when bombs are falling and your friends are dying.\n\nVolodymyr Artiukh, PhD, is a Ukrainian anthropologist specializing in labor and migration in the post-Soviet space.\n\nJana Tsoneva is an assistant professor of sociology at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

His mythical vision of history draws on the darkest tsarist imperialism.\n\nVladimir Putin's address on February 21 was a prelude to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. (ALEXEY NIKOLSKY/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nVladimir Putin's speech on February 21 will go down in history for the most ominous of reasons. In announcing recognition of the self-styled Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples' Republics, his address moreover provided a prelude to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine that followed on Thursday. In the speech, Putin served up all manner of nationalistic, Great Russian resentment. Here we will focus on just one important aspect: his historical digression on the emergence of Ukraine - and the possible consequences this digression could have.\n\nAccording to Putin, Ukraine was \"for us\" (he claimed to speak for the Russian people), \"not just a neighboring country\" but \"an integral part of our own history, culture, and spiritual space. These are our friends, our relatives; not only colleagues, friends, and former work colleagues, but also our relatives and close family members.\" Modern Ukraine, however, was created entirely by Bolshevik, Communist Russia \"after the October putsch,\" as Putin called the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 . At the time of its greatest weakness, Putin said, Vladimir Lenin \"met all the demands, all the wishes of the nationalists inside the country.\"\n\nBut, he insisted, \"in terms of the historical destiny of Russia and its peoples, the Leninist principles of state-building were not only a mistake, but far worse than a mistake.\" Putin was here referring to the right to self-determination the Bolsheviks proclaimed for the nations of the Russian Empire, up to and including the right to secede. With the collapse of the USSR , Putin said, Ukrainian governments began \"to build their statehood on the denial of everything that unites us, they tried to distort the consciousness and historical memory of millions of people, entire generations living in Ukraine.\" But he further alleged that Ukraine has essentially no stable tradition of genuine statehood. Moreover, since 2014, he said, Ukraine has been under the political and economic protectorate of the West and has been \"reduced to the level of a colony with a puppet regime.\" He consistently maintained that Ukraine was a traditionless entity that had been arbitrarily separated from Russia. But the reality was and is different.\n\nIt is true that for centuries Ukraine belonged to various states: to the Kingdom of Poland-Lithuania, to the Russian Empire, partly to the Habsburg monarchy, to the Soviet Union, and, until 1939, in its western half, also to the Republic of Poland. In 1945, with the addition of the previously Czechoslovak Carpatho-Ukraine, the country belonged for the first time entirely to the Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, already in March 1917, a Ukrainian republic was established with the historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky as president. The Rada (parliament) demanded its autonomy within a federal Russia. In the wake of the October Revolution, the Rada then declared Ukraine a people's republic, and in the elections the non-Bolshevik parties received a majority. Two Bolshevik uprisings before the end of 1917 and the beginning of 1918 ended with the capture of Kiev, but troops of the People's Republic, supported by the German and Austrian armies, recaptured the city in March 1918. Meanwhile, the People's Republic had concluded the so-called \"Bread Peace\" of Brest with the Central Powers on February 9, which assured Ukrainian grain supplies to Germany and Austria-Hungary. Bolshevik Russia had to accept the results of this separate peace - the loss of Ukraine - in the subsequent Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty.\n\nIn April 1918, the Central Powers dissolved the Rada and installed General Pavlo Skoropadsky as head of state. The latter was ousted in December and the non-Bolshevik People's Republic was restored. The Bolsheviks did not come to terms with this: after the collapse of the Central Powers, they launched a military offensive and captured Kiev in January 1919 and all of eastern Ukraine by early 1920. The war was marked by anti-Jewish massacres - the largest wave of exterminations before Auschwitz - in which anti-Bolshevik forces were by far the main culprits (Bolshevik pogromists were shot at the orders of People's Commissar Leon Trotsky). Western Ukraine also declared itself a people's republic, in 1918, in order to join the eastern republic. However, it was occupied by Poland until the partition of the Polish state between Germany and the USSR in September 1939.\n\nThe short period of statehood should not obscure the fact that a modern Ukrainian national consciousness striving for independence already existed in the nineteenth century - a fact Putin omitted entirely. Ukrainian, devalued by some Russians as a peasant dialect, became a literary language through writers such as Ivan Kotlyarevsky and later Taras Shevchenko. This process was advanced by historians such as Mykola Kostomarov and Volodymyr Antonovich, but especially by the latter's student Hrushevsky. In many works, the latter examined the independent culture of the Ukrainian people, whose achievements, despite strong points of contact, were not automatically part of Russian culture. Although Hrushevsky was considered a \"bourgeois\" historian in the Soviet Union (he died in Kiev in 1934), he was still able to continue his research. Their results appeared in publications by historians in Soviet Ukraine as well as by Ukrainian emigrants in the West.\n\nHistorians Omeljan Pritsak and Ivan Rudnytsky created world-renowned research institutions on Ukrainian history and culture at Harvard and the University of Alberta, in Edmonton, Canada. Since 1991, these institutions have been working in cooperation with Ukrainian colleagues to dismantle the remnants of the Stalinist historical image. Restoring this same image (but without its pseudo-communist whitewashing) is one of the goals of Vladimir Putin and his supporters.\n\n\"Do you want de-communization?\" asked Putin, citing the demolition of Lenin monuments in Ukraine. \"Well, we are very happy with it. But we must not, as they say, stop halfway. We are ready to show you what real de-communization means for Ukraine.\" Lenin's internationalism and Putin's Great Russian chauvinism are, indeed, incompatible.\n\nAll this should show socialists in particular that the man ruling the Kremlin is their bitter enemy. This is true regardless of all the cardinal errors of the West. The Putin government bears full responsibility for the current war, taking up the imperial desires of tsarist Russia, which Joseph Stalin resumed after the break with the Bolshevik internationalism of 1917.\n\nPutin presents himself as the patron saint of all Russian minorities who he alleges are threatened by \"genocide.\" This historical lie may have further consequences, for Russian minorities also live in the Baltic States. Will their NATO membership deter Russia from invading - even in the case that a (reelected) Donald Trump sends signals that give Putin a free hand? As improbable as this sounds, what is currently unfolding sounded just as unlikely only weeks ago.\n\nAll the more important is a broad international peace movement to hobble Russia's current war and oppose future military buildup. Anyone in Russia who dares to protest against the war deserves the greatest possible support - however small the possibilities may be at present.\n\nMario Kessler is senior fellow at the Leibniz Center for Contemporary History in Potsdam, Germany.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

State repression has closed off the avenues of mass politics, forcing dissidents into mainly symbolic protests.\n\nPeople signing support for the presidential candidate Boris Nadezhdin at his campaign headquarters in St Petersburg, Russia, January 25, 2024.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIf Russia has a long tradition of antiwar protest, such opposition has struggled to raise its head during the current offensive against Ukraine. Brief street actions at the start of the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, could not develop into a wider movement - with long prison sentences inflicted on many critics of the war.\n\nBut if Russians have not protested in large numbers, this seems less like a gauge of the popularity of the invasion than a sign of a politically demobilized society. True, Vladimir Putin's Russia still has its periodic electoral rituals, and the state often cracks down hard on (supposed) oppositionists. But the dissent that does exist is sporadic, generally the work of small minorities, and often more symbolic than a material threat to the authorities.\n\nMaria Chiara Franceschelli is coauthor of a recent book on repression and opposition in Putin's Russia. In an interview, she told Jacobin 's David Broder about the lack of mass politics in contemporary Russian society, the reasons why the state represses even seemingly innocuous forms of dissent, and the role of the war in reshaping the terrain of protest.\n\nYou start your book by telling us that it would be a trap to see the lack of traditional forms of mobilization as a synonym for political passivity or indifference. Why aren't they the same thing?\n\nWe were determined to challenge a certain misconception, which imagines that the lack of a strong mobilization able to overthrow a regime is automatic proof that the population and civil society agrees with the government. This is commonly believed also because media often rely on opinion polls - hardly a reliable source of information in this context.\n\nPeople often expect to see a revolution that overthrows an authoritarian government, although historically, that's quite rare. But there are more underground strategies of collective action that have diverse effects. That's what we wanted to investigate and bring to light.\n\nWhen speaking about Vladimir Putin's Russia, it should be separated from the [Boris] Yeltsin era, but also from the late Soviet Union. What we see now - including the absence of revolutionary mobilization - results from a specific historical process whereby the space for civil-society action has been gradually eroded. Indeed, this is the work of an authoritarian regime that has been working toward this goal for the past twenty-four years. The trend has been a constant, even though there were periods when civil society enjoyed more freedom, and other times of heightened repression.\n\nIn the book, we tell stories that are mostly unheard-of. We wanted to pay tribute to people who are taking huge risks to fight against something that is much bigger than them. They still choose to devote their life, their efforts, to this cause. It helps us understand that there are dissident stances in Russian civil society even if they can't influence the decision-making process or the regime itself.\n\nAfter February 24, 2022, Jacobin ran several articles about antiwar protests in Russia, even knowing that they were not a mass movement. Some opinion polls encouraged doubts about popular enthusiasm for the war. As you say, they're not ever so reliable as indicators of opinion. But if people can't mount spectacular mobilizations, then how can they express critical attitudes?\n\nAfter harsh police repression during the first weeks after the full-scale invasion, protests shifted from mass street demonstrations to more dispersed and individual action. From a social-movement theory perspective, what we see is the increase of so-called \"performative\" activism and the politics of small deeds. For instance, graffiti, notes left around the city, or private political conversations in one's individual sphere. Many Telegram channels were created to provide alternative sources of information about the war, to fight state propaganda.\n\nThis happens when dissent doesn't find a space to thrive in the public sphere and cannot be channeled into organized mass mobilization due to the lack of the necessary infrastructure. Still, we have also seen another kind of opposition: cases of violence like Molotov cocktails thrown at army recruitment stations.\n\nThe re-signification of public rituals was also an important way to express dissent. For example, ahead of the [March 2024] presidential elections, hundreds of thousands of people signed in support of Boris Nadezhdin's candidacy. The immediate stop to the \"special military operation\" in Ukraine was the first point in his program.\n\nSupporting his candidacy was an extremely risky and tiring process. People had to stand in line for hours, with temperatures dropping as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius. They were often filmed, and their data was registered and collected by the state authorities - like a list of people who officially don't support Putin's presidency. All of this, in a country where electoral fraud is the norm.\n\nNadezhdin's candidacy was eventually rejected by the Central Electoral Committee despite meeting all the requirements. Clearly, people did not support Nadezhdin's run for president because they were actually convinced that such a turn in domestic politics was possible. Rather, because it was an opportunity to express dissent publicly, without incurring immediate and violent state repression.\n\nSuch protests hardly lead to policy change, let alone the removal of the government. But they are useful to keep dissent alive, and to send a message to all like-minded people.\n\nTo eventually create a post-Putinist Russia, they have to come together to rebuild a different political system. This means reinstating the rule of law, and creating horizontal means of participation and deliberation, while allowing civil society to play an active role in the state's political life. The question of horizontal involvement hasn't always been a factor in Russian opposition discourse, which has been both very oriented toward liberalism and individual freedom, and the figure of a leader. That has to change, in order to create an alternative system. Many of our interviewees for the book had this outlook: although we cannot create a mass movement, we are still laying the basis for that future Russia. It may or may not come, but if it does, it will have to be based on different principles.\n\nYou cite Albert Hirschman's famous discussion of the choice between \"exit, voice, and loyalty.\" In this case, there seems to be a tension between a certain critical idea of society as atomized and passive, and the sense in which the dissent is a refusal to take part in a mobilized society. Is there an \"exit\" by the dissenting minority in Russia? Or do things like joining local Communist Party branches and residents' groups at least provide a way to have a \"voice\" in society even if it does not produce huge political upheavals?\n\nThat's an open dilemma in the sense that if you don't like something, the first thing you want to do is to not take part. Leaving the country is not only seen as a way to preserve one's own safety, but also the only real way not to contribute to the system anymore. My taxes won't fund the war, my work won't fund the military infrastructure. This is a slippery slope: it's also something that people tell themselves to feel better. Most people I spoke to weren't so comfortable with a choice whose direct result is to aggravate the problem: Who will stay to rebuild Russian society?\n\n[The year] 2022 really marked a watershed. Before the full-scale invasion, it was still possible to engage in collective action, albeit with strict limitations and pervasive repression. The Communist Party also partially covered the role of an opposition party, not in the national parliament, but in local politics. It was behind some of the most mass protest waves in Russia in the last decade: against the pension reform, or the Shiyes protests over a landfill site in Arkhangelsk. Alexei Navalny's organization also contributed a lot to the politicization of local issues. But now I think the situation is different, and that window of opportunity closed down. The Communist Party formally supports the war, and this also involves a reorganization of its cadre, also at the local level. And we know what happened with Navalny.\n\nAfter the launch of the full-scale invasion, Russia saw a huge polarization that was cooking, we might say, even before that, but not so deeply. Many dissidents stayed in Russia, for example taking part in some media projects that try to convey information about what's going on in Ukraine. But a lot of people have been arrested and there is no space for civil-society self-organization.\n\nBefore the full-scale invasion, there'd been a huge difference between those same institutions on a central level, especially parties, and on a local level. That was an arena available for organizing collective action and civil-society initiatives, even if not combating the central government. They don't have that space anymore. The choices that people made had to be more radical. And that's why a lot of people left after February 24, 2022.\n\nClearly, there's a distinction between political dissent and the expression of an undercurrent of grievances in society. Beyond the fact that dissidents have less space, do you think that such parties are losing their role as a means (even functional to the existing power structure) of transmitting the pressures and moods in society? It is often said that the Communist Party was a vehicle for anti-vaccination protests, or problems like people not receiving their wages and pensions and thus seeking \"redress\" if not political conflict. Has that changed?\n\nThe Russian economy is hanging on this war. This is also the most worrying element of what we're seeing: the regime needs the ongoing war in order to survive. This has greatly repressed space for any other kind of party or organizational structure outside of that effort.\n\nThere was already little space for expressing collective grievances, to engage in any kind of debate with the government. But the war puts things on a different footing because it is the overarching problem to which most other problems are related. People may want to raise issues like unemployment, or the relatives who disappeared - men that were sent to the front and then nobody knows anything about them anymore. But if a problem is related to the war like that, it's not easy to channel it into public discourse, especially through parties like the Communist Party or Yabloko.\n\nThere has been the example of the movement of soldiers' wives and mothers. The oldest such organization was corrupted a long time ago and has never served as any kind of oppositional force. So, other similar independent initiatives sprouted - only to be labeled as \"foreign agents.\" This is a telling shift. In the past, the soldiers' wives and mothers were the only activists that were never openly repressed and beaten by the police. This still hasn't happened in this case, although I think it will happen soon if these women decide to continue with the demonstrations - because in that case, they'll be treated no longer as wives and mothers, but as foreign agents.\n\nIt's a contradiction. These people embody what Putin wants his nation to be: a nation of soldiers, wives, and mothers. This means rigid societal roles, not only gender roles, but also how every single citizen contributes to the building of the \"great Russian nation.\" Now they are repressing the epitome of that. If you start repressing even stances like theirs, you cannot deal with any minimal space for civil-society action.\n\nThe Russian authorities crack down hard even on groups that seemingly represent almost no threat. It could be said that this repression is \"spectacular\" in intent: designed to send a message. But many accounts speak of \"regime paranoia,\" for instance being frightened by the Bolotnaya election fraud protests starting in 2011 or the 2020 protests in Belarus. Is this a real fear - or is the repression more about giving direction and internal coherence to the state machine itself?\n\nI don't like the psychologization of the regime - the idea that Putin is \"mad\" or \"paranoid.\" The important thing is not the psychological-pathological attributes but the function that the repression of dissent plays in this new Russia. And I say \"new\" because - again - it's consistent with the path that Russia has taken since the rise of Putin, but the intensity has reached a whole new level.\n\nFor example, there was a huge crackdown on the queer community over the last year. Why? It would be reasonable to think that many people belonging to the queer community oppose the Putin regime. But it's not like you have queer people marching on Red Square threatening to overthrow it. So, why has the Kremlin focused so much on them and harshened its offensive against them? Mainly because of the symbolic role that the repression of queer stances plays in the reframing of the Russian nation.\n\nThere is no space whatsoever for anything inconsistent with the Kremlin's narrative. If the country is at war, all efforts must be channeled into that. It needs a more rigid definition of the role of all citizens and their contribution to the nation. Hence, the so-called \"international LGBT organization\" (which does not actually exist) gets labeled as an \"extremist organization\" under foreign influence.\n\nWe can also consider these dynamics from another perspective, i.e., that of Putin's philosophical legitimization of the war. There is an effort to recreate a messianic background not only for the invasion of Ukraine, but for Putin's view of foreign policy in general. There is an active effort to build a national identity for what is a multinational and multiethnic state. So, you need another narrative that becomes ever more exclusive and rigid. The repression of dissent plays a huge role in this. It's not only about antiwar activism, it's about anything that simply drifts away from Putin's monolithic idea of a great Russia.\n\nI'm interested in your book's comments on the Orthodox Church. How far is it a deep-rooted force in society, able to mobilize masses of people based on religious conviction? Or is the Putinite use of the Church more like a kind of identity politics - a familiar ideological reference point to draw on, despite the lack of a mass of \"believers\"?\n\nThere's an excellent book called The Moralist International by Dmitry Uzlaner and Kristina Stoeckl - I wrote the preface to the recent Italian translation - which addressed exactly this topic. The Orthodox Church is a huge contradiction. Compare it to the Catholic Church in my country, Italy. There are countless organizations and institutions in Italy bound to the Church, especially offering forms of welfare support. The Russian Orthodox Church is nothing like that. It is not very organizationally rooted in Russia's social fabric, nor does it have a strong philosophical tradition. The Catholic Church in Italy has always played a huge role in defining moral codes, like telling people how they should behave and act in relation to each other, and act in society not only as Christians but also as citizens. The Orthodox Church has no tradition of social ethics, even in pre-Soviet times.\n\nThis creates a contradiction whereby the Orthodox Church is virtually absent from Russian society - partly because of the Soviet legacy, but not only that. It represents a powerful political ally of the Kremlin, not so much in relation to domestic policy as in terms of foreign affairs. The Orthodox Church is now one of the most important actors in the international neoconservative front, promoting initiatives and funding far-right organizations.\n\nDomestically, it is used by the Russian regime as a source of legitimization from above: like God being on your side and justifying whatever mass killing you are doing. But it does so as a political actor rather than as a moral force really rooted in society.\n\nYour book cites cases of protest and defiance, and a certain undercurrent of dissent that endures despite everything. How much do you think recent moments of protest are part of Russians' collective self-understanding of their political situation? Western media often cast Navalny as the leader of a long history of protests that are now crushed. But how \"sticky\" is this cultural memory: Is this the \"heroic narrative\" of a dissenting minority, or does it have broader, public recognition?\n\nOn a structural level, Navalny played a huge role in the politicization of Russian society because he contributed to the spread of civic activism. Research has shown that many people involved in the 2011-13 Bolotnaya protests remained in politics afterward and started engaging also on a local level, where activism and collective action had been mostly apolitical until then. Those who took part in the protests have kept vivid memories of that moment and tried to recreate that atmosphere and unity in their local circles.\n\nIn the social-science jargon, we would say that Bolotnaya was an \"eventful protest.\" That is, it left a mark in the social and organizational structure of pre-COVID Russia due to its contingent effect rather than its theoretical claims. The power of Bolotnaya was in the collective experience, in the \"being there\" and in the sense of unity that such a huge mass protest sparked. The event itself had a transformative effect on civil society. In this sense, it left a mark in the collective history. However, due to the pandemic, and then the peak in repression after the full-scale invasion, much of its legacy was wiped away.\n\nIn a way, Navalny's own political trajectory was a double-edged sword: on the one hand, he was a heroic figure who united people from many different backgrounds and political orientations in the fight against the Putin regime. He was a political transformist: a nationalist who somehow drifted to a more liberal approach. On the other hand, he retained a strongly leader-centric approach, presenting himself as an alternative to Putin, but without calling for a more horizontal and participatory way of engaging in politics. He was a leader against another leader.\n\nThis grassroots, participatory dimension wasn't there even though his anti-corruption organization managed to engage a huge number of people and was present practically everywhere - something other opposition organizations hadn't managed to achieve. But it was still very leader-centric. He himself recognized this limitation in his last letters from prison, where he reflected on the errors made by the liberal opposition since the 1990s.\n\nThis strongly echoes what some of our interviewees told us: it's not enough for Putin to go, what must die forever is Putinism. For there to be a post-Putin Russia, the leader-centric model must be abandoned. Instead, civil society must be rebuilt on the principles of horizontal participation.\n\nMaria Chiara Franceschelli is a PhD researcher in political science and sociology at Pisa's Scuola Normale Superiore.

On the contrary, he has built one of the most Darwinian and irresponsible capitalist systems on the planet. Only its imperial ambitions and the normalization of permanent theft bear any relation to the late Soviet state. Only the fear of the return of a totalitarian regime, which struck several generations in Russia, has delayed a left turn among the young. But the war has finally started it.\n\nAfter February 24, the protest against the Putin regime, amplified by antiwar sentiment, was embodied in a digital resistance movement. The global media has been largely silent about this fact, but military commissariats in Russia burn down every few days, freight trains with weapons or raw materials for military factories derail, and the walls of houses and fences are covered with huge pro-Ukrainian graffiti at night. Volunteers take care of Ukrainians forcibly displaced to Russia and help them flow to Europe. This resistance is horizontal and egalitarian, and it is mainly engaged in by twenty- to thirty-year-olds. What values drive them?\n\nIf you look at the decade leading up to the war, it becomes clear that Putin himself provoked the left turn among the youth. Businesses in Russia had fantastically low tax rates and a staggeringly inefficient system of control over entrepreneurs that fed on bribes, allowing employers to do whatever they wanted with their staff. That is why the view of the Russian economy as state capitalist is deeply erroneous. Yes, in recent years, state-owned enterprises have begun to absorb private companies, but before that, for twenty years, business developed in conditions close to the libertarian utopias of Ayn Rand novels.\n\nBased on growing oil and gas prices, this predatory freedom of business led to a consumer boom. The middle class quickly got used to buying cars on credit, to cafés and bars on every corner, and to fast delivery of goods at any time of the day. Because this came after the hungry 1990s, with its poverty and humiliation, Russians did not pay attention to such monstrous problems as the deterioration in the quality of medical care, the violation of human rights, and corruption, which even engulfed the judicial branch of power. The fact that the consumer boom was provided by the labor resources of illegal migrants from Central Asian countries colonized by the Russian Empire and the USSR has not been reflected on.\n\nThis tacit collusion between the Kremlin and citizens who have embraced capitalist values was attacked by their kids, who do not remember anything Soviet. These generations posed direct questions: Why should I make friends with the children of Federal Security Service generals and high-level bureaucrats in order to gain access to a career in politics or state service? Why should I have to be afraid that any policeman could torture or even kill me with impunity? Why is no one doing anything about the massive domestic violence against women ? Why are there no free elections and why is no one allowed into politics except for parties approved by the authorities? Why doesn't anyone care about the pollution of nature and the development of skyscraper cities for the sake of the profits of real estate tycoons? Why, above all, are adults so atomized and unable to unite in collective action?\n\nThe search for answers to these questions led youngsters to understand that the Putin regime is not just kleptocratic. Authoritarian capitalism is used as an agent of the depoliticization and the moral suppression of citizens. The main koan of this system sounds like this: Earn without rules for new villas and cars and travel around the world, but do not try to change anything in your country.\n\nYoung Russians were sick of such an ethical position, and the first military clash with Ukraine, in 2014, paradoxically helped them to generate a politics of reduced aggression, careful communication, care, and other forms of horizontal interaction. As Mark Lipovetsky, a professor at Columbia University in New York, put it, \"any protest movement in Russia today must be primarily an ethical movement, otherwise it will be corroded by the same force of cynicism that unites the Russian government with Russian society.\"\n\nEven some new entrepreneurs manifested new goals: instead of making huge profits, they wanted to solve social problems and create communities of people with similar values. Several activists embodied their ambitions in the creation of NGOs. Feminism has finally gone mainstream. Many students and university graduates supported Alexei Navalny, the only consensus leader of the opposition .\n\nWhen the invasion of Ukraine began, members of this new generation, without waiting for the end of the war, asked their parents the same questions that the German children of the war asked their fathers: Why were you silent amid the strengthening of fascism, busy acquiring more and more luxury?\n\nOf course, not all young people in Russia have become leftists - only an active part of them. For jaded teenagers from metropolitan areas, buying a bag of chips with delivery is considered entertainment, nicknamed \"chasing a slave.\" Migrants from the former Soviet republics work in delivery services, and Russians feel, in relation to them as residents of the metropolis, like the inhabitants of a colony.\n\nAfter February 24, the grassroots began to organize themselves using secure chats, mainly on Telegram and Signal. On the second day after the start of the war, the Feminist Anti-War Resistance (or FAS, with thirty-five thousand followers on Telegram) was founded, appealing to the widest range of apolitical Russians whose children and relatives could be sent to the war zone. FAS draws, prints, and sends out postcards that are very similar to ordinary greeting cards but with texts that open your eyes to what is happening in Ukraine. Their other action is the replacement of price tags in stores with copies bearing antiwar slogans. Another example of content that mimics media for apathetic ordinary people is the Zhenskaya Pravda (Women's Truth) newspaper, which is laid out as a traditional local newspaper. Every week, FAS activists hold new actions in dozens of Russian cities, despite facing fines and imprisonment.\n\nAnother active antiwar group is students. They campaign in the institutes against armed aggression and their supporters (as in the Students Against War chat on Telegram). The anonymous group Stop the Carriages distributes instructions on how to sabotage the railroad to derail freight trains on strategically important routes. City activists paint graffiti and post flyers on trees and bulletin boards, risking criminal charges for \"spreading fake news about the Special Military Operation.\" In addition, there are closed associations of programmers and ultraleft and anarchist groups, and volunteer lawyers helping those fired from their jobs for antiwar statements.\n\nCuriously, very few in the famous Russian intelligentsia are among the activists. Many heirs of Soviet dissidents have become bourgeois, wealthy, and, unwilling to risk their wealth, do not participate in antiwar activism. Moreover, left-wing values, feminism, and the cultures of consent and abolition seem to the intelligentsia to be a return to the communist values they hate. It is difficult for these bourgeois Russians to part with their social status and privilege to join an anti-hierarchical resistance movement.\n\nThe range of the views of this new left is wide - from anarcho-federalism to social liberalism - but at its heart is a clear demand for equality and a restart of the state with an economy focused on personal self-realization, the satisfaction of basic needs, and the protection of rights. As Russians come to accept responsibility for the terror inflicted on Ukraine, we can expect turbulence to last for decades. But one reason for optimism is the likely fact that any new Russia - or several Russias - will be leftist.\n\nNikolay V.

But since the invasion of Ukraine, the party's balancing act has become ever more precarious.\n\nGennady Zyuganov, the leader of Communist Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF) addresses the crowd on International Workers' Day in Moscow on May 1, 2022. (Photo by Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWith the death of the populist clown Vladimir Zhirinovsky this April, seventy-eight-year-old Gennady Zyuganov became Russia's longest-serving party leader - and also its oldest. Zyuganov has held a near unshakeable grip on the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF) since its foundation in 1993. The KPRF itself is a mainstay of post-Soviet Russian politics, indeed in a manner entirely unanticipated upon the collapse of state socialism; it has held first or second place in every Russian parliament (Duma) since 1995, and been runner-up in every presidential election since the first in 1996.\n\nIt is true that the party's zenith is long behind it. From 1995 to 1999, the KPRF (with allies) had a near parliamentary majority, could claim up to half of Russia's eighty-nine governors as its own (it now has just three), and briefly entered a left-wing government, which tried to impeach then president Boris Yeltsin. Most notably, Zyuganov pushed Yeltsin to a second round in the (significantly fraudulent) 1996 presidential elections, the only time the incumbent hasn't sealed victory in the first round. However, since 1999, the party has run an ever more distant second to Vladimir Putin and his United Russia \"Party of Power.\"\n\nNevertheless, the KPRF is far from irrelevant. In the last (September 2021) Duma elections, it took 18.9 percent of the vote and fifty-seven of four hundred fifty seats. Although United Russia maintained its \"supermajority\" (over three hundred seats, enough to make constitutional changes) and de facto the election changed little, the KPRF's \"real\" performance was perhaps as high as 30 percent, not so far behind the Party of Power.\n\nWhat, then, explains Zyuganov and the KPRF's apparent longevity and viability? Is there any possibility of the party representing a real challenge to the Kremlin?\n\nThe short answer to the latter question is no. The KPRF's stability is rooted in its ability to exploit fluctuating extraparliamentary protest trends in an ambiguous way that doesn't fundamentally threaten Kremlin power structures. Since its foundation, it has moved from an anti-system, \"irreconcilable\" opposition to an entirely \"systemic\" force, but nevertheless one that strives to maintain the image of extraparliamentary radicalism. It has been rightly dubbed a centaur - with one head facing the streets, the other the regime. This makes it a highly contradictory political force.\n\nThe KPRF is heir to the once-ruling Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), but comes via the short-lived Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (CP RSFSR), formed in 1990 as part of the search for national sovereignty that ultimately brought down the Soviet Union. CPSU conservatives formed a (previously lacking) party for the USSR's Russian republic in order to contest Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika (\"restructuring\"). However, the CP RSFSR was hamstrung by internal divisions and the general leakage of authority from party structures, and was suspended by then-banned Yeltsin immediately after the August 1991 anti-Gorbachev coup. The party tacitly supported this three-day takeover but - symptomatic of its declining influence - wasn't represented on the State Committee on the State of Emergency, comprised of eight leading Soviet officials who temporarily usurped power.\n\nThe KPRF was (re)founded in February 1993, after its leadership successfully contested the ban in the Constitutional Court. Its new chair was Zyuganov, formerly the CPSU's deputy ideology secretary, mostly known for cultivating Party links with pro-Soviet nationalists. The KPRF's overall profile has remained consistent from this date - an opponent of Westernization and liberalism, and a staunch defender of the Soviet heritage (the USSR is, it insists, to be \"voluntarily\" reconstructed). The current resonance of this \"anti-reform\" image is clear from Zyuganov's castigation of the late Gorbachev as the greatest \" traitor \" in Russia's thousand-year history. Zyuganov has successfully popularized several \"nationalist\" ideas, such as taking the USSR for an expression of Russian statehood, destroyed not through internal problems but by the machinations of pro-Western \"fifth columnists.\"\n\nBeneath this staunch image, however, the KPRF has several other aspects that have been decisive for its long-term survival. First is an orientation to incrementalism and institutionalism, reflecting its leaders' origins in the Soviet bureaucratic elite (nomenklatura): these are no Leninist revolutionaries. The KPRF stood out the October 1993 armed skirmishes between president and parliament, and, unlike many of its opposition rivals, participated in the December 1993 elections held under the new constitution, even as it decried the document's illegitimacy.\n\nSecond, beneath its \"anti-reform\" umbrella, the KPRF encompassed a wide range of ideological tendencies from would-be social democrats and Brezhnevite conservatives to outright Stalinists and \"national Bolsheviks,\" who justify Soviet power from a nationalist, not Marxist-Leninist, point of view. Even more notable was a cleavage around attitudes to the post-Soviet power system between a moderate leadership inclined toward compromise with the authorities, and more radical regional cadres that preferred \"irreconcilable\" extraparliamentary opposition and were deeply suspicious of their own leadership. However, most party trends have been profoundly socially conservative - the KPRF opposes LGBTQ rights and second-wave feminism.\n\nThird, Zyuganov established the dominance of the national Bolshevik trend, trying to rehabilitate communism and the KPRF by demonstrating that they were an authentic representation of Russia's nationalist traditions and not some foreign ideological implant. This led to the party's rapprochement with national capital and state institutions such as the Church, and Zyuganov's often-repeated claims such as \"Russia has had enough of revolutions\" and \" Jesus was the first communist .\" Such claims were made more controversial by his later assertions that the rebirth of the Church owed much to Stalin personally.\n\nThe orientation toward bourgeois state structures was particularly noxious for Marxists inside and outside the party, many of whom accused the KPRF leadership of parliamentary cretinism, reneging on class struggle and internationalism, failing to maximize links with trade unions and the working class, and ultimately becoming of the nationalist right rather than Leninist left.\n\nIndeed, activists from newer groupuscules such as the Russian Socialist Movement see the KPRF's ideology as a \"moderate version of . . . popular Stalinism\" fused with \" Orthodox imperial nationalism .\" However, aided by hierarchical democratic centralism and Zyuganov's bureaucratic intrigues, effective intraparty opposition has rarely materialized. Indeed, having lost the 1996 election, the KPRF seemed to be maneuvering itself into a stable position in elite structures as part of a formal \"two-party system,\" and hesitantly contemplated some social democratization.\n\nSuch efforts went by the wayside with Vladimir Putin's ascension to the presidency in 2000. With his illiberalism, Orthodox imperialism, and appeal across the political spectrum, Putin stole the KPRF's arguments and support. What's more (and this has become ever more evident), Putinism brought an \" imposed consensus \" in Vladimir Gelman's words - i.e., the forcible elimination or co-optation of all independent power centers.\n\nCompared with Yeltsin, who was a lackadaisical party builder, Putin invested in United Russia as his Party of Power and marginalized all challengers. By the late 2000s, the party system was directly managed by presidential administration \"overseers\" (currently led by Sergei Kiriyenko), who vetted the parties' candidates and conduct. In response, opposition forces had to respect informal \"rules of the game\" (such as vocally supporting Russian foreign policy, avoiding direct criticism of Putin and rejecting ties with the extraparliamentary opposition).\n\nThe KPRF's remaining \"anti-system\" impetus was effectively squashed in 2004, when the Kremlin engineered a major split that saw its membership slump from half a million to just 160,000. Indeed, the Kremlin often indicated its preference to replace the KPRF with a more modern left. However, it has pulled its punches, since a more dynamic left could pose greater challenges given the Russian electorate's broad pro-welfare and state-paternalist sympathies. Indicatively, it refused to register the 2004 splinter party and to fully marginalize the KPRF. Instead, the KPRF was able to reclaim a permanent second place in the party system.\n\nZyuganov's leadership has since helped stabilize both the KPRF and the Kremlin by operating within the \"rules of the game\" and expelling both rivals and excessively radical comrades. It is allowed greater discretion to criticize the regime than other parties, especially at local level. However, the limits remain strict, and are periodically tightened. In particular, the Kremlin uses a range of \"spoiler parties\" to the KPRF's right and left (e.g., the Communists of Russia, which sometimes runs doppelgänger candidates against it) to salami-slice its vote if necessary.\n\nMoreover, since Putin's arrival, the party has moved from Stalinoid (supportive of state socialism but reticent about directly supporting the vozhd [great leader]) to openly Stalinist positions praising the \" immortal \" leader (even promoting Russia's re-Stalinization), and has downplayed its proto-social democratic elements. This has helped it define itself against Putin. Despite being a product of the post-Stalinist security state and indebted to the cult of the Great Patriotic War, Putin is more \"white\" than \"red,\" i.e., more supportive of Orthodox imperialism than Soviet ideology. This re-Stalinization has helped the KPRF preserve core support but is repellent to many new constituencies, generally limiting its support to 10-15 percent of the national electorate.\n\nThe party's 2021 manifesto showed this. It emphasized left-wing populism and welfare promises - reversing Putin's 2018 pension reform, raising the minimum wage, increasing the availability of free education and health care - but otherwise repeated slogans from the 1990s, even decrying the privatizations of that bygone time. The focus on welfare and fair elections might appeal to protest voters, but the preponderance of old slogans and faces indicated obsolescence. Not for nothing has the KPRF been seen as Russia's most boring party.\n\nThe KPRF remains functionally divided between three main groups, albeit these divisions are generally less febrile than in the 1990s: the core of red patriots who nostalgically support the party and its Soviet symbols as a living fragment of the lost USSR; the bureaucratic pragmatists who comprise the central leadership cadres and maneuver within elite circles; and the radical oppositionists - a broad range of leftist positions such as the populist street protester Sergei Udaltsov , the Moscow democratic socialist Mikhail Lobanov ( unsuccessfully supported by both KPRF and Russian Socialist Movement in 2021), and Nikolai Bondarenko , a Saratov regional deputy assembly member and popular video blogger, all of whom support a more confrontational line than the leadership is capable of.\n\nIt is possible to observe a limited rejuvenation of the party electorate, despite its aging core vote. The KPRF's electorate has become more urban and educated since the early 2000s, especially given United Russia's capture of rural constituencies. The KPRF has attracted younger, more radical opposition-minded voters and members because of its status as the principal opposition force and its (relatively) radical rhetoric. However, the more openly oppositionist electorate has created further pressure on the party hierarchy to follow suit. However, more radical supporters regularly leave, disappointed with the party's hierarchical structure and conformism. A central party dynamic is periodic radicalization, especially before elections, followed by moderation.\n\nHowever, generational change at the leadership level has become increasingly vital. In the 2018 presidential elections, Zyuganov stood aside in favor of Pavel Grudinin , director of the \"Lenin State Farm.\" Although Grudinin's 11.8 percent score was the KPRF's worst presidential performance yet, he still came second, which Zyuganov's declining personal rating might not have ensured . The KPRF has a collective leadership, so it can survive leadership change more than most Russian parties. The probable successor is party deputy leader Yury Afonin, although he has a conservative reputation and may struggle to gain Zyuganov's national profile, which was forged in more pluralist times.\n\nThe recent election round repeated the radicalization-moderation dynamic. The KPRF radicalized again by abstaining against Putin's 2020 constitutional reforms and opposing mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations. Some regional leaders (principally Moscow city party boss Valery Rashkin , long a fierce critic of government corruption) expressed sympathies for opposition protests and for imprisoned leader Alexei Navalny . Officially, the party denigrates Navalny, but does not criticize his Smart Vote initiative (which helps voters to identify the candidates best placed to beat United Russia). The KPRF, as second-placed party in many districts, was the main beneficiary of Smart Vote. However, in 2022, Smart Vote refused to support candidates supporting the Russo-Ukrainian War, including the KPRF.\n\nThe party became embroiled in a brief conflict with the Kremlin over Grudinin. For reasons unknown and unknowable, Grudinin became persona non grata for the Kremlin. Perhaps his 2018 presidential performance, though underwhelming, made him a national politician with a platform for the next election in 2024. Consequently, his business was pressurized, he was deprived of his town council seat, and, in 2019, the Central Election Commission refused to transfer a vacant Duma seat to him.\n\nZyuganov's decision to place Grudinin third on the KPRF's 2021 candidate list was thus provocative for the Kremlin. Grudinin was swiftly barred by the Central Election Commission, officially for owning foreign property (an apparently unfounded claim). Zyuganov may have felt he must protest or else appear supine, and fulminated against Russia's \"fascistization.\"\n\nNevertheless, Grudinin's victimization enhanced the KPRF's opposition credentials and the party used him heavily in campaigning. In other respects, it bowed to the overseers' directives with a Kremlin-friendly election list, e.g., by removing prominent troublemakers such as Rashkin in Moscow and former Irkutsk governor Sergey Levchenko from the central to the regional list. After the election, the leadership briefly protested vote falsification, but acquiesced in the removal of Rashkin from the parliament and party leadership on another trumped-up charge (of illegal poaching).\n\nThe outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War offered a new quandary for the party. The KPRF does not dissent from the Kremlin consensus on foreign policy. Quite the reverse; since 2014, it has been one of the most assiduous supporters of the Russian proxy states in the Donbas, even being the instigator of the Duma law on their recognition in February 2022. Nevertheless, there were strong indications of disquiet with the war among some Duma deputies, regional leaders, and youth activists - it was one thing to \"protect\" the Donbas, quite another to bomb Kiev.\n\nHowever, true to form, the party soon reinforced its \"patriotic\" credentials by silencing or expelling the dissidents and vocalizing gung-ho support for the so-called \"special operation,\" even calling for full-scale mobilization in September 2022. The Communists sought to capitalize on patriotic sentiment by emphasizing their record of humanitarian support to the Donbas and state planning's utility in supporting the sanctioned economy. Nevertheless, the party struggled in an environment where Putin's support rebounded in a \"rally round the flag\" effect and the room for any substantive opposition was minimal. In September 2022 elections at the gubernatorial, regional, and local level, the party lost ground .\n\nThe KPRF's longevity is rooted in its ability to exploit growing protest trends, but curtailed by a deeply conformist leadership, structure, and ideology. The Kremlin also possesses the formal and informal levers it needs to limit the party's influence to a distant second place (or worse) in national elections.\n\nDramatic short-term changes to this reality appear unlikely. As has been evident for over two decades now, the KPRF needs a thorough leadership and image overhaul to emerge as a stronger left-wing challenger. However, its Moscow leadership is so integrated in Putin's managed party system that the leadership and Kremlin have common interests in opposing substantive change.\n\nNevertheless, the aftermath of the Russo-Ukrainian War will tell heavily on the party's fortunes. So long as the Kremlin retains control of the domestic political agenda, the KPRF will find the niche for opposition politics heavily constrained. Should the war's consequences eventually begin to undermine the post-Stalinist police-state mechanisms on which Putinism thrives, Zyuganovism, which is intrinsically dependent on Putinism, will also struggle for survival. Whether a more genuinely progressive and oppositional party can emerge from the KPRF's vestiges is doubtful, but remains to be seen.\n\nLuke March is personal chair of post-Soviet and comparative politics at the University of Edinburgh.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

From teachers and lawyers to artists, journalists, and the clergy, Russians have taken immense risks to speak out against the war.\n\nAndrey Rublev of Russia reacts to the umpire during a match at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on February 26, 2022, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Rublev wrote \"no war please\" on a camera after winning a semifinal at the tournament. (David Gray / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOne of the only heartening things in the ongoing, illegal, and increasingly dangerous Russian invasion of Ukraine is the level of dissent within Russia itself. It reminds us to reject the twisted logic - once advanced by Osama Bin Laden and now taken up by leading liberal hawks like former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul - that equates the people of a country with the crimes of their government. It also may prove critical to ensuring a diplomatic climb down for Moscow from its current hostilities, let alone nuclear disaster.\n\nSizable antiwar protests have been a fixture of Russian cities ever since the first day Vladimir Putin announced the invasion, when thousands of Russians gathered in more than fifty cities that evening in protest. Since then, more than five thousand protesters have been arrested as a result of antiwar actions. So far, the protests have been smaller than those organized against the arrest of opposition leader Alexei Navalny last January, which likely has more to do with the level of domestic repression put in place since then. Just today, a new coalition of socialist antiwar activists in Russia was announced , charging that \"the elders of the Kremlin are in the minority\" and that \"most Russians do not want a fratricidal war, even among those who still trust the Russian government.\"\n\nWe have other information that hints at the depths of Russian unhappiness and opposition to this war. A petition declaring the action \"senseless\" and a \"step to nowhere\" has seen the number of signatures from scientists and science journalists balloon from more than 100 to now over four thousand . Russian scientist Oleg Anisimov later apologized to a Ukrainian colleague at an online United Nations climate conference, telling her, \"I am ashamed - as a person, as a citizen of this country . . . that we could not create civil society institutions in our country that could influence the decisions made by the president and the government.\"\n\nKommersant reporter Elena Chernenko similarly circulated an antiwar petition that got a hundred signatures from fellow members of the press, losing her access to the Russian foreign ministry as a result. Political comedian Ivan Urgant, the host of a weekly late show on Russia's state-owned Channel One, posted \"no to the war\" on his Instagram account, leading his show to disappear from the network's schedule.\n\nRussian independent media has been particularly vocal, with Syndicate-100, a coalition of dozens of independent outlets, expressing its \"pain, anger, and shame\" at Putin's decision and the editor in chief of Novaya Gazeta declaring that \"only the antiwar movement of Russians can save life on this planet.\" Reporter Mikhail Zygar put together his own open letter urging \"all citizens of Russia to say no to this war.\" Meanwhile, Russia's Journalists' and Media Workers' Union, with more than 600 active members across forty regions, published an open letter of its own demanding an immediate withdrawal of Russian forces that received 162 signatures, and the union has continued criticizing the war since.\n\nA variety of other industry groups have followed suit. An antiwar petition organized by a Russian tech worker got more than a staggering ten thousand signatures from fellow IT workers. A separate open letter gathered the backing of more than two thousand of the country's actors, directors, and other creatives dismissing Putin's \"peacekeeping\" pretext for the war. Yelena Kovalskaya, the artistic director of Moscow's Vsevolod Meyerhold State Theater, resigned in disgust, saying she could not \"work for a murderer and receive salary from him.\" Calls to end the war have been signed onto by the country's economists , lawyers , teachers , psychiatrists , and Russians from many , many other fields , suggesting the breadth and depth of antiwar feeling in the country.\n\nProminent filmmakers and celebrities have been particularly outspoken, despite the risks to their careers. Rapper Oxxxymiron canceled six sold-out shows in Moscow and Saint Petersburg in protest, saying that \"I cannot entertain you when Russian missiles are falling on Ukraine.\" Newly minted world tennis number one Daniil Medvedev called for peace , joined by fellow tennis players Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Andrey Rublev, who wrote \"no war please\" on a camera after winning a semifinal at the recent Dubai tournament, a week after he had won the doubles championship at the Marseille Open playing alongside a Ukrainian athlete. Major names in football and ice hockey have done the same .\n\nEven institutions one might normally consider fairly establishment have spoken out. The Boris Yeltsin Presidential Center, which gets more than half its funding from the Russian government and which counts Putin as a donor, called the war \"an unthinkable disaster for both countries and their peoples\" and urged \"an immediate halt to hostilities.\" Just yesterday, 158 clergy from the Russian Orthodox Church, whose backing has been key to Putin's rule, signed onto a statement calling for \"reconciliation and an immediate ceasefire,\" warning that \"the Last Judgement awaits every person\" and urging that \"no nonviolent call for peace and an end to war should be forcibly suppressed.\" The signatories grew from twenty-six that were listed when the letter was published.\n\nThere is also significant antiwar feeling among elites and their families. Billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska have both called for peace, while Chelsea Football Club's oligarch owner Roman Abramovich is reportedly involved in negotiations between Moscow and Kiev. A number of other oligarchs have similarly sought to highlight their disapproval of the war, while family members of several Putin associates and elites - including predecessor Boris Yeltsin's daughter, defense minister Sergei Shoigu's son-in-law, longtime Putin friend Sergey Chemezov's son, and Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov's ex-wife and daughter - all made antiwar statements on social media.\n\nTo date, three Communist Party members of Parliament have spoken out against the war , despite having voted to recognize Ukraine's breakaway regions, which precipitated Putin's invasion. One, Vyacheslav Markhaev, claimed the recognition had masked \"plans to unleash a full-scale war with our closest neighbor\" and condemned both the West and Moscow for what he said was the same strategy of seizing new territory under cover of defending democracy. It's worth remembering, too, that before Putin invaded, retired colonel general Leonid Ivashov had warned against a war on Ukraine on behalf of a collection of retired Russian officers.\n\nNeedless to say, none of this gives us an exact measure of Russian public opinion on the war, which polling suggests is more complex than this roundup might indicate. But whatever the exact numbers, there is clearly some substantial level of opposition to Putin's war within Russia.\n\nIf Putin thought the invasion would boost his domestic popularity, or at least be allowed to go ahead unencumbered by a disgruntled populace, it appears he may have miscalculated. As Moscow ramps up its war effort and even flirts with nuclear deployment, ordinary Russians' unhappiness with the war could prove critical for forcing Russian de-escalation and an eventual ceasefire. Even authoritarians must be sensitive to public opinion, as Putin showed in January, when the Russian parliament scuttled plans for QR code vaccine passes in response to popular opposition.\n\nBut this should also be cause for caution from the West as it responds to the invasion. An indiscriminate, overly harsh response risks killing this fledgling opposition as it's done elsewhere in the past, making desperate Russians more dependent on Putin's government to survive and undermining the solidarity between much of the world and ordinary, war-averse Russians. Besides painting a nuke-wielding Putin into a corner, the current talk of collapsing the Russian economy through unprecedented sanctions could prove a gift to Putin, inflaming ordinary people's resentment of the Western countries laying siege to their country and giving Putin a chance to rally the population against a foreign enemy.\n\nIndependent media outlet Meduza , a vital source of independent, Putin-critical media coverage within Russia, is already warning that \"international sanctions against the central bank and other Russian credit institutions create serious risks for our crowdfunding.\" Western voices calling for companies like YouTube to end service in Russia should likewise consider the possible outcomes of depriving Russians of access to news and information outside the increasingly state - controlled media sphere .\n\nRussian antiwar sentiment may be pivotal for both securing peace and stability in Europe and driving a turn away from militarism. It would be a shame if the rush to ill-thought-out, punitive policy undermined and killed it.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

      "text": "Trump is talking tougher toward Putin but has yet to ratchet up assistance to Ukraine\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nWASHINGTON - The bromance between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin has noticeably fizzled in the new term, though Trump has yet to reveal the extent to which he'll pressure Russia to end its grinding war with Ukraine.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has dropped talk of Putin's strategic \" genius \" and \"savvy.\" In a conspicuous rhetorical shift, Trump has instead been warning that the Russian president he once called \" very smart \" is leading his country to ruin by prolonging the war.\n\n\"He [Putin] should make a deal,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on his first day back in the White House. \"I think he's destroying Russia by not making a deal. I think Russia is going to be in big trouble.\"\n\nThe rationale behind the frostier tone is simple enough. Trump promised during the campaign to end the fighting within 24 hours of taking office, if not sooner. That deadline has passed, meaning the clock is ticking on Trump's vow to stop a costly, destructive war that began nearly three years ago when Russia invaded its democratic neighbor.\n\nTrump needs both Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to come to the table and negotiate a peace deal, which for Russia means abandoning any hope of swallowing up Ukraine in its entirety.\n\nUkraine is prepared to bargain, Trump told the World Economic Forum three days after his inauguration. And Russia?\n\n\"Well, you're going to have to ask Russia,\" he said.\n\n\"Having listened to Trump talk about Putin for almost a decade now, this is the most critical stuff he's ever said,\" Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration, said in an interview.\n\nThe Russian embassy did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nWords alone won't compel Putin to give up the quest to subdue Ukraine, national security experts said. For that to happen, Trump will need to demonstrate to Putin that it's fruitless to continue fighting, they said.\n\nThat will take some doing. Putin remains uninterested in peace talks as long as Russian troops continue to gain ground in Ukraine's east, albeit at a slow pace, and while Ukrainian forces hold seized territory in the Kursk region inside Russia, according to John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and other former officials.\n\n\"He [Putin] doesn't want to negotiate now, because his troops are moving forward,\" Herbst said. \"He wants to put more Ukrainian territory in his pocket when negotiations begin.\"\n\nSergii Leshchenko, an adviser to Zelenskyy's chief of staff, told NBC News in an interview that \"Ukraine is open for negotiation, but it should be a negotiation. Not an ultimatum by Russia. In this case, Ukraine demonstrated a will to negotiate. Russia does not.\"\n\nIt's unclear how far Trump will go in confronting Russia over Ukraine and whether he would be ready to ratchet up military assistance - including long-range missiles - to Kyiv.\n\nTrump has at his disposal a variety of tools that might make Putin more inclined to stop fighting. The question is, will he use them?\n\nThe Trump administration briefly delayed the shipment of weapons to Ukraine last week but it was unclear exactly why, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. The shipments have since resumed.\n\nDepriving Ukraine of weapons would be a severe blow to Kyiv's war effort against its much larger neighbor.\n\nAsked about the pause, the White House's National Security Council pointed to Trump's comments about Ukraine during an Oval Office appearance on Monday.\n\nThere, Trump told reporters that he would be open to linking financial assistance to something the U.S. wants in return: Ukraine's rare earth minerals.\n\n\"We're putting in hundreds of billions of dollars,\" Trump said. \"They [the Ukrainians] have great rare earth. And I want security of the rare earth, and they're willing to do it.\"\n\nBrian Hughes, a spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council, said in a statement: \"As President Trump shared yesterday, the United States needs to recoup any money it spends or has spent on Ukraine aid. The discussions over the weekend centered around how best to ensure that repayment, and a timetable has yet to be established.\"\n\nTrump's advisers and Cabinet members are split over how much pressure to bring to bear, with national security adviser Mike Waltz and Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg wanting to use American leverage to prod Putin to stand down, according to former U.S. and Ukrainian officials and a source close to the Kyiv government.\n\nOthers favor cutting back the billions of dollars in assistance the U.S. gave to Ukraine in the Biden administration as a way of forcing a swift end to the conflict. Critics of that approach say it would effectively disarm Ukraine and thus amount to a capitulation to Russia.\n\nBefore becoming vice president, then-Sen. JD Vance was a fierce skeptic of the money the Biden administration gave Ukraine.\n\n\"Why are spending $130 billion on Ukraine when we can't even pay our own bills at home?\" Vance said in one speech. He also called Ukraine's government \"the most corrupt\" in Europe and possibly the world.\n\nKellogg told NBC News in a statement, \"The president's national security team is in sync.\"\n\n\"The president will use, as necessary, all levers of American strength to enable a conclusion to the carnage of the past three years,\" Kellogg added.\n\nA spokesperson for Vance declined comment Tuesday on his position on U.S. aid to Ukraine.\n\nTrump has laid out a few ideas for assisting Ukraine while the war continues.\n\nIn a social media post two days after his swearing-in, he warned that he would slap Russia with tariffs, sanctions and taxes on the sale of Russian goods to the U.S. and other countries if Putin didn't negotiate an end to the war.\n\nA problem with that approach is that U.S. trade with Russia has fallen sharply, making tariffs less of a cudgel. Last year, the U.S. imported about $2.9 billion worth of goods from Russia, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. By contrast, in 2021, before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the figure was nearly $30 billion.\n\n\"It's a total red herring,\" a former Biden administration national security official said of Trump's tariff threat.\n\n\"We've totally disconnected the U.S. economy from the Russian economy,\" the former official added, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely. \"So, our ability to hurt Russia with tariffs is marginal.\"\n\nAnother option would be for Trump to use Russia's own frozen assets, as opposed to U.S. tax dollars, to continue replenishing Ukraine supplies and weaponry.\n\nWilliam Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said that the $300 billion in Russian reserves sitting in European and U.S. banks \"would go a long way to provide weapons and financial support to Ukraine.\"\n\n\"What Trump could do is pressure the Europeans to seize those reserves and put them into an account for the Ukrainians and allow the Ukrainians to use that money to buy weapons from the U.S. and continue to operate their government,\" Taylor said in an interview.\n\n\"President Trump knows that the Russian economy is fragile and vulnerable to further sanctions. And thus, he knows that he has leverage on Putin,\" he added.\n\nA fear among Ukraine's supporters was that Trump would abandon the country upon returning to office. The warmth he had shown Putin over the years suggested he might bring about a settlement favorable to Russia, they worried.\n\nDuring a debate between Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris last year, Trump did not say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war.\n\nBut now that he's in office, some who'd questioned Trump could be a fair broker have been heartened to see that, at least, his team isn't selling out Ukraine.\n\n\"I think he [Trump] has started to realize how hard resolving this issue is and that Russia is not going to be constructive unless we apply more pressure,\" a U.S. official involved in Ukraine and Russia policy said in an interview, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely.\n\n\"One reason Trump's rhetoric has evolved is the switch from campaign to governing mode. The obstacle to peace is not Ukraine. I think that's sort of dawning on him, and it's also dawning on him how bad it would be politically, if nothing else, and strategically, if this f----- up.\"\n\nPeter Nicholas is senior White House reporter for NBC News digital.\n\nDan De Luce is a reporter for the NBC News Investigative Unit.\n\nKatherine Doyle is a White House reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

All he had to do was say yes or no. The Republican did neither.\n\n\"I can't tell you,\" Trump replied . \"I can't tell you. It's just inappropriate.\"\n\nThere is, of course, nothing \"inappropriate\" about the president disclosing conversations with foreign leaders. Last week, for example, just a few days before his second inaugural, Trump published an item to his social media platform that read in part, \"I just spoke to Chairman Xi Jinping of China. The call was a very good one for both China and the U.S.A.\"\n\nHe has made plenty of similar comments recently. As we recently discussed , since winning a second term, Trump touted his interactions with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, French President Emmanuel Macron, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, among others.\n\nIndeed, Trump didn't express the slightest reservations about promoting these discussions. By all appearances, he was proud of them, using the chats as proof of his importance.\n\nAnd yet, while Trump has been eager to let the public know about these chats with foreign leaders, Trump apparently believes he has to remain silent when it comes to Putin.\n\nIf his refusal to talk about this sounds at all familiar, it's because he's adopted this posture before. In fact, as regular readers might recall , it was in early May 2016, as political observers just started to consider questions about Trump and his relationship with the Russian leader, when the then-candidate was asked whether he'd spoken to Putin. \"I don't want to say,\" the Republican replied.\n\nA day later, Trump sat down with Fox News' Bret Baier, who followed up on the question. \"Yeah, I have no comment on that,\" the future president replied . \"No comment.\"\n\nThe Fox host, apparently surprised, said one of the things people liked about Trump was his willingness \"to answer any question.\" The candidate didn't seem to care. \"Yeah, but I don't want to comment,\" he added.\n\nIt was an early indication that Trump's relationship with his benefactor in Moscow was, to understate matters, problematic . After all, the Republican hardly ever said \"No comment\" in response to any question on any subject. He loved, and continues to love, commenting - even when he has no idea what he's talking about. But asked about whether he'd had direct interactions with Putin, the then-candidate suddenly had nothing to say .\n\nMatters did not improve in the years that followed. In fact, The Washington Post reported in 2019 that Trump and the Russian leader had a series of undisclosed chats during the Republican's first term in the White House. (The reporting was not independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News.)\n\nMore recently, Bob Woodward's latest book, citing a senior Trump aide, alleged that Trump and Putin had direct conversations \" as many as seven times \" after he left office following his 2020 defeat. (The account is credited to a single anonymous aide and provides no further details. Neither NBC News nor MSNBC independently confirmed the reporting.) The Kremlin denied the accuracy of the claim, as did Trump initially, though in October - just a few weeks before Election Day 2024 - the Republican boasted that it'd be \"a smart thing\" if he had secret communications with the Russian autocrat.\n\nNow, as his second term begins, Trump is once again reluctant to say whether he has spoken to Putin or not. For those concerned about the president's relationship with his friend in Moscow, this isn't going to help.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage .\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

The American president took the opportunity to do what he often does: express sympathy for Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"We had to go through the Russian hoax together,\" the Republican said , referring to himself and the Russian leader. Trump added that the Russia scandal \"had nothing to do with Russia\" - days later, I still don't know what that meant - and that the underlying controversy was \"a phony story that was made up.\"\n\nRoughly 24 hours later, as part of his Oval Office debacle with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump managed to say something new about the scandal. The Washington Post reported :\n\n\"Let me tell you: Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,\" Trump said. \"He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia. You ever hear of that deal? That was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam. ... And he had to go through that.\"\n\nAt this point, I could write several paragraphs explaining that the Russia scandal was not \"phony,\" no matter how many times Republicans claim otherwise. I could also go into detail, highlighting the overwhelming evidence from the investigations launched by special counsel Robert Mueller's team and the GOP-led Senate Intelligence Committee, both of which documented the extent to which Trump and his team welcomed, received, and benefited from Russian assistance in the 2016 campaign.\n\nI could similarly remind readers that Team Trump obstructed the investigation into this assistance - by some measures, 10 times . I could note that Trump and his operation repeatedly lied about their interactions with Russia during the 2016 race. I could even reiterate the fact that a Senate Intelligence Committee's report - written in part by the panel's then-Republican majority - at one point literally described a \"direct tie between senior Trump Campaign officials and the Russian intelligence services.\"\n\nBut I'm going to assume readers already know this. Let's instead note what was new about the American president's unscripted remarks from Friday.\n\nAs a Washington Post analysis noted about the Republican's claim, \"It was an extraordinary comment. Trump has gone further than the evidence suggests in claiming his own exoneration in the Russia investigation. But here he was suggesting Putin also had been wronged in the process.\"\n\nThere is voluminous and unchallenged evidence that the Russian leader launched an intelligence operation targeting the American political system for the express purpose of influencing the outcome of a presidential election. Even if one were inclined to put aside questions of cooperation and \"collusion\" - no one should put these questions aside, of course, but just for the sake of conversation - Putin's intelligence operation itself represented an extraordinary attack on the United States.\n\nYears later, Trump would have Americans believe that Putin was the victim of the attack that he perpetrated. That isn't just wrong, it's insane.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

The book, citing a source close to Trump, also claims that the former president and the Russian leader have had direct conversations \" as many as seven times \" since he left the White House.\n\nThe GOP candidate denied the allegations , but not in a detailed way. A statement from a Trump spokesperson simply said that the claims in the book are not true, before lobbing a series of odd and personal attacks at the author. For its part, the Kremlin said Trump sent covid tests but denied Woodward's reporting on the phone calls. (Of course, the Kremlin is notorious for spreading disinformation, so it's hard to give much weight to its statements on the matter.)\n\nThat was last week. This week, Trump's line was noticeably different. NBC News reported :\n\nAt an event at the Economic Club of Chicago with Bloomberg News, Trump said he wouldn't comment on whether or not he called Putin multiple times after he left office. \"Well, I don't comment on that, but I will tell you that if I did, it's a smart thing,\" he said. \"If I'm friendly with people. If I can have a relationship with people, that's a good thing, not a bad thing in terms of a country.\"\n\nTo be sure, that wasn't an explicit confirmation, but given the comments, the qualifiers and the tone in which he made the comments, it's hardly a stretch to think the allegations raised in Woodward's book are credible.\n\nAnd that, of course, raises a series of related questions. If Trump and Putin have engaged in a series of secret chats - conversations the Republican now believes would be \"smart\" - how many interactions have the two had? Did Trump offer briefings to U.S. intelligence agencies and the State Department after the conversations?\n\nDid the two talk about U.S. policy toward Ukraine? Did Trump make any promises or extend any guarantees to his benefactor in Moscow? Did the former president say or do anything during the discussions that directly or indirectly undermined his own country's foreign policy agenda?\n\nDid Trump violate the Logan Act , which prohibits private citizens from communicating with foreign leaders \"with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States\"?\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, participated in a wide-ranging live radio town hall syndicated radio host Charlamagne Tha God, and the discussion turned to the allegations raised in Woodward's book.\n\nAs NBC News reported , the Democratic nominee said Trump is someone who \"admire[s] dictators\" and, during the height of the pandemic, sent \"covid tests that nobody could get to the president of Russia for his personal use, when Black people were dying every day by the hundreds.\"\n\n\"The number of people who lost their grandparents and parents, remember what that was like?\" she continued. \"People were scrambling for the resources and needed tests, and Donald Trump secretly sent covid tests to the president of Russia.\"\n\nThis controversy is far from over.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Council, a largely formal role that can be used to shape the bloc's policy agenda.\n\nOrbán has said he wants to use the presidency to advocate for an end to the fighting in Ukraine.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed to a Russian state TV reporter on Friday that Ukraine will be among the topics on the agenda when the two leaders meet.\n\nE.U. officials have come down hard on Orbán for his visit - something only one other European leader has done since the start of the invasion.\n\nAustrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer visited Moscow in April 2022, weeks after the invasion, and said he raised the issue of war crimes allegedly committed in Ukraine by Russian forces.\n\nThe E.U.'s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell , said Orbán's visit to Moscow \"takes place, exclusively, in the framework of the bilateral relations between Hungary and Russia\".\n\nHe added: \"Prime Minister Orbán's  has not received any mandate from the E.U. Council to visit Moscow. The E.U. position on Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine is reflected in many European Council conclusions.\n\n\"That position excludes official contacts between the E.U. and President Putin.

Friedman\n\nOpinion Columnist\n\nEver since President Trump returned to office and began trying to make good on his boast about ending the Ukraine war in days, thanks to his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, I've had this gnawing concern that something was lost in translation in the bromance between Vlad and Don.\n\nWhen the interpreter tells Trump that Putin says he's ready to do anything for \"peace\" in Ukraine, I'm pretty sure what Putin really said was he's ready to do anything for a \"piece\" of Ukraine.\n\nYou know those homophones - they can really get you in a lot of trouble if you're not listening carefully. Or if you're only hearing what you want to hear.\n\nThe Times reported that in his two-and-a-half-hour phone call with Trump on Tuesday, Putin agreed to halt strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, according to the Kremlin, but Putin made clear that he would not agree to the general 30-day cease-fire that the United States and Ukraine had agreed upon and proposed to Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin also said that Putin's \"key condition\" for ending the conflict was a \"complete cessation\" of foreign military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv - in other words, stripping Ukraine naked of any ability to resist a full Russian takeover of Ukraine. More proof, if anyone needed it, that Putin is not, as Trump foolishly believed, looking for peace with Ukraine; he's looking to own Ukraine.\n\nAll that said, you will pardon me, but I do not trust a single word that Trump and Putin say about their private conversations on Ukraine - including the words \" and\" and \"the ,\" as the writer Mary McCarthy famously said about the veracity of her rival Lillian Hellman.

      "text": "First Person An Astonishingly Frank Self-Portrait by Russia's President Vladimir Putin With NATALIYA GEVORKYAN, NATALYA TIMAKOVA, ANDREI KOLESNIKOV PublicAffairs\n\nRead the Review\n\nThe Son\n\nPutin talks about his parents, touching on his\nfather's World War II sabotage missions, the\nSiege of Leningrad, and life in a communal\nflat after the war. It isn't easy-no hot water,\nno bathroom, a stinking toilet, and constant\nbickering. Putin spends much of his time\nchasing rats with a stick in the stairwell.\n\nI know more about my father's family than about my mother's. My father's father was born in St. Petersburg and worked as a cook. They were a very ordinary family. A cook, after all, is a cook. But apparently my grandfather cooked rather\n                                well, because after World War I he was offered a job in The Hills district on the outskirts of Moscow, where Lenin and the whole Ulyanov family lived. When Lenin died, my grandfather was transferred to one of Stalin's\n                                dachas. He worked there a long time.\n\nHe wasn't a victim of the purges?\n\nNo, for some reason they let him be. Few people who spent much time around Stalin came through unscathed, but my grandfather was one of them. He outlived Stalin, by the way, and in his later, retirement years\n                                he was a cook at the Moscow City Party Committee sanitorium in Ilinskoye.\n\nDid your parents talk much about your grandfather?\n\nI have a clear recollection of Ilinskoye myself, because I used to come for visits. My grandfather kept pretty quiet about his past life. My parents didn't talk much about the past, either. People generally\n                                didn't, back then. But when relatives would come to visit, there would be long chats around the table, and I would catch some snatches, some fragments of the conversation. But my parents never told me anything about\n                                themselves. Especially my father. He was a silent man.\n\nI know my father was born in St. Petersburg in 1911. After World War I broke out, life was hard in the city. People were starving. The whole family moved to my grandmother's home in the village of Pominovo,\n                                in the Tver region. Her house is still standing today, by the way; members of the family still spend their vacations there. It was in Pominovo that my father met my mother. They were both 17 years old when they got married.\n\nWhy? Did they have a reason to?\n\nNo, apparently not. Do you need a reason to get married? The main reason was love. And my father was headed for the army soon. Maybe they each wanted some sort of guarantee.... I don't know.\n\nVera Dmitrievna Gurevich (Vladimir Putin's schoolteacher from grades 4 through 8 in School No. 193):\n\nVolodya's parents had a very difficult life. Can you imagine how courageous his mother must have been to give birth at age 41? Volodya's father once said to me, \"One of our sons would have\n                                been your age.\" I assumed they must have lost another child during the war, but didn't feel comfortable asking about it.\n\nIn 1932, Putin's parents came to Peter [St. Petersburg]. They lived in the suburbs, in Peterhof. His mother went to work in a factory and his father was almost immediately drafted into the army, where\n                                he served on a submarine fleet. Within a year after he returned, they had two sons. One died a few months after birth.\n\nApparently, when the war broke out, your father went immediately to the front. He was a submariner who had just completed his term of service ...\n\nYes, he went to the front as a volunteer.\n\nAnd your mama?\n\nMama categorically refused to go anywhere. She stayed at home in Peterhof. When it became extremely hard to go on there, her brother in Peter took her in. He was a naval officer serving at the fleet's\n                                headquarters in Smolny. He came for her and the baby and got them out under gunfire and bombs.\n\nAnd what about your grandfather, the cook? Didn't he do\nanything to help them?\n\nNo. Back then, people generally didn't ask for favors. I think that under the circumstances it would have been impossible, anyway. My grandfather had a lot of children, and all of his sons were at the\n                                front.\n\nSo your mother and brother were taken from Peterhof, which\nwas under blockade, to Leningrad, which was also blockaded?\n\nWhere else could they go? Mama said that some sort of shelters were being set up in Leningrad, in an effort to save the children's lives. It was in one of those children's homes that my second brother\n                                came down with diphtheria and died.\n\nHow did she survive?\n\nMy uncle helped her. He would feed her out of his own rations. There was a time when he was transferred somewhere for a while, and she was on the verge of starvation. This is no exaggeration. Once my mother\n                                fainted from hunger. People thought she had died, and they laid her out with the corpses. Luckily Mama woke up in time and started moaning. By some miracle, she lived. She made it through the entire blockade of Leningrad.\n                                They didn't get her out until the danger was past.\n\nAnd where was your father?\n\nMy father was in the battlefield the whole time. He had been assigned to a demolitions battalion of the NKVD. These battalions were engaged in sabotage behind German lines. My father took part in one such\n                                operation. There were 28 people in his group. They were dropped into Kingisepp. They took a good look around, set up a position in the forest, and even managed to blow up a munitions depot before they ran out of food. They\n                                came across some local residents, Estonians, who brought them food but later gave them up to the Germans.\n\nThey had almost no chance of surviving. The Germans had them surrounded on all sides, and only a few people, including my father, managed to break out. Then the chase was on. The remnants of the unit headed\n                                off toward the front line. They lost a few more people along the road and decided to split up. My father jumped into a swamp over his head and breathed through a hollow reed until the dogs had passed by. That's how\n                                he survived. Only 4 of the 28 men in his unit made it back home.\n\nThen he found your mother? They were reunited?\n\nNo, he didn't get a chance to look for her. They sent him right back into combat. He wound up in another tight spot, the so-called Neva Nickel. This was a small, circular area. If you stand with your\n                                back to Lake Ladoga, it's on the left bank of the Neva River. The German troops had seized everything except for this small plot of land. And our guys held that spot through the entire blockade, calculating that it\n                                would play a role in the final breakthrough. The Germans kept trying to capture it. A fantastic number of bombs were dropped on every square meter of that bit of turf-even by the standards of that war. It was a monstrous\n                                massacre. But to be sure, the Neva Nickel played an important role in the end.\n\nDon't you think that we paid too high a price for that little\npiece of land?\n\nI think that there are always a lot of mistakes made in war. That's inevitable. But when you are fighting, if you keep thinking that everybody around you is always making mistakes, you'll never\n                                win. You have to take a pragmatic attitude. And you have to keep thinking of victory. And they were thinking of victory then.\n\nMy father was severely wounded in the \"Nickel.\" Once he and another soldier were ordered to capture a prisoner who might talk during interrogation. They crawled up to a foxhole and were just settling\n                                in to wait, when suddenly a German came out. The German was surprised, and so were they. The German recovered first, took a grenade out of his pocket, threw it at my father and the other soldier, and calmly went on his\n                                way. Life is such a simple little thing, really.\n\nHow do you know all this? You said your parents didn't like\nto talk about themselves.\n\nThis is a story that my father told me. The German was probably convinced that he had killed the Russians. But my father survived, although his legs were shot through with shrapnel. Our soldiers dragged him\n                                out of there several hours later.\n\nAcross the front line?\n\nYou guessed it. The nearest hospital was in the city, and in order to get there, they had to drag him all the way across the Neva.\n\nEveryone knew that this would be suicide, because every centimeter of that territory was being shot up. No commander would have issued such an order, of course. And nobody was volunteering. My father had\n                                already lost so much blood that it was clear he was going to die soon if they left him there.\n\nCoincidentally, a soldier who happened to be an old neighbor from back home came across him. Without a word, he sized up the situation, hauled my father up onto his back, and carried him across the frozen\n                                Neva to the other side. They made an ideal target, and yet they survived. This neighbor dragged my father to the hospital, said goodbye, and went back to the front line. The fellow told my father that they wouldn't\n                                see each other again. Evidently he didn't believe he would survive in the \"Nickel\" and thought that my father didn't have much of a chance either.\n\nWas he wrong?\n\nThank God, he was. My father managed to survive. He spent several months in the hospital. My mother found him there. She came to see him every day.\n\nMama herself was half dead. My father saw the shape she was in and began to give her his own food, hiding it from the nurses. To be sure, they caught on pretty quickly and put a stop to it. The doctors noticed\n                                that he was fainting from hunger. When they figured out why, they gave him a stern lecture and wouldn't let Mama in to see him for awhile. The upshot was that they both survived. Only my father's injuries left\n                                him with a lifelong limp.\n\nAnd the neighbor?\n\nThe neighbor survived, too! After the blockade, he moved to another city. He and my father once met by chance in Leningrad twenty years later. Can you imagine?\n\nVera Dmitrievna Gurevich:\n\nVolodya's mother was a very nice person-kind, selfless, the soul of goodness. She was not a very educated woman. I don't know if she finished even five grades of school. She worked hard her\n                                whole life. She was a janitor, took deliveries in a bakery at night, and washed test tubes in a laboratory. I think she even worked as a guard at a store at one time.\n\nVolodya's papa worked as a toolmaker in a factory. He was much liked and appreciated as a ready and willing worker. For a long time, incidentally, he didn't collect disability, although one of his\n                                legs was really crippled. He was the one who usually cooked at home. He used to make a wonderful aspic. We remember that Putin aspic to this day. Nobody could make aspic like he did.\n\nAfter the war my father was demobilized and went to work as a skilled laborer at the Yegorov Train Car Factory. There is a little plaque in each metro car that says, \"This is car number such-and-such,\n                                manufactured at the Yegorov Train Car Factory.\"\n\nThe factory gave Papa a room in a communal apartment in a typical St. Petersburg building on Baskov Lane, in the center of town. It had an inner airshaft for a courtyard, and my parents lived on the fifth\n                                floor. There was no elevator.\n\nBefore the war, my parents had half of a house in Peterhof. They were very proud of their standard of living then. So this was a step down.\n\nVera Dmitrievna Gurevich:\n\nThey had a horrid apartment. It was communal, without any conveniences. There was no hot water, no bathtub. The toilet was horrendous. It ran smack up against a stair landing. And it was so cold-just\n                                awful-and the stairway had a freezing metal handrail. The stairs weren't safe either-there were gaps everywhere.\n\nThere, on that stair landing, I got a quick and lasting lesson in the meaning of the word cornered . There were hordes of rats in the front entryway. My friends and I used to chase them around with\n                                sticks. Once I spotted a huge rat and pursued it down the hall until I drove it into a corner. It had nowhere to run. Suddenly it lashed around and threw itself at me. I was surprised and frightened. Now the rat was chasing\n                                me. It jumped across the landing and down the stairs. Luckily, I was a little faster and I managed to slam the door shut in its nose.\n\nVera Dmitrievna Gurevich:\n\nThere was practically no kitchen. It was just a square, dark hallway without windows. A gas burner stood on one side and a sink on the other. There was no room to move around.\n\nBehind this so-called kitchen lived the neighbors, a family of three. And other neighbors, a middle-aged couple, were next door. The apartment was communal. And the Putins were squeezed into one room. By\n                                the standards of those days it was decent, though, because it measured about 20 meters square.\n\nA Jewish family-an elderly couple and their daughter, Hava-lived in our communal apartment. Hava was a grown woman, but as the adults used to say, her life hadn't turned out well. She had\n                                never married, and she still lived with her parents.\n\nHer father was a tailor, and although he seemed quite elderly, he would stitch on his sewing machine for whole days at a time. They were religious Jews. They did not work on the Sabbath, and the old man would\n                                recite the Talmud, droning away. Once, I couldn't hold back any longer and asked what he was chanting. He explained about the Talmud, and I immediately lost interest.\n\nAs is usually the case in a communal apartment, people clashed now and then. I always wanted to defend my parents, and speak up on their behalf. I should explain here that I got along very well with the elderly\n                                couple, and often played on their side of the apartment. Well, one day, when they were having words with my parents, I jumped in. My parents were furious. Their reaction came as a complete shock to me; it was incomprehensible.\n                                I was sticking up for them, and they shot back with, \"Mind your own business!\" Why? I just couldn't understand it. Later, I realized that my parents considered my good rapport with the old couple, and the\n                                couple's affection for me, much more important than those petty kitchen spats. After that incident, I never got involved in the kitchen quarrels again. As soon as they started fighting, I simply went back into our\n                                room, or over to the old folks' room. It didn't matter to me which.\n\nThere were other pensioners living in our apartment as well, although they weren't there long. They played a role in my baptism. Baba Anya was a religious person, and she used to go to church. When I\n                                was born, she and my mother had me baptized. They kept it a secret from my father, who was a party member and secretary of the party organization in his factory shop.\n\nMany years later, in 1993, when I worked on the Leningrad City Council, I went to Israel as part of an official delegation. Mama gave me my baptismal cross to get it blessed at the Lord's Tomb. I did\n                                as she said and then put the cross around my neck. I have never taken it off since.\n\n(C) 2000 Nataliya Gevorkyan, Natalya Timakova, and Andrei Kolesnikov All rights reserved.

      "text": "Trump's Affinity for Putin Grows More Consequential Than Ever\n\nRussia-Ukraine War\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nNews Analysis\n\nPresident Trump's admiration for President Vladimir Putin of Russia has been endlessly dissected, but the American leader's policy shifts since taking office again could have profound effects.\n\nBy Mark Mazzetti\n\nMark Mazzetti, who reported from Washington, has written about Donald J. Trump and Russia since 2016.\n\nIn early 2017, American intelligence agencies delivered an unequivocal judgment about why President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had ordered a sprawling effort to sabotage the recent American presidential election.\n\nMr. Putin wanted to cripple the faith Americans have in their own elections, they found, and to undermine a United States-led \"liberal world order\" that the Russians see as a threat to their security. As a way to achieve this goal, the assessment found, Russia worked to help Donald J. Trump win the election.\n\nEight years later, Mr. Trump sat in the Oval Office for a blustery meeting with President Voldymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and rendered, once again, his own judgment on that period. There was no Russian sabotage, just a \"phony witch hunt\" of which both he and Mr. Putin were victims.\n\n\"Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,\" he said.\n\nThe statement was a tell. The president sees common cause with Mr. Putin, a merging of interests forged through battles against those he believes are his and Mr. Putin's mutual adversaries - including Democratic lawmakers, European leaders and a spectral \"deep state\" inside the U.S. government.\n\nThe relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin has for years been scrutinized by American government inquiries, assessments by foreign intelligence services and news media investigations. Taken together, they have unearthed evidence to support an array of theories addressing Mr. Trump's affinity for a Russian strongman who has spent a career trying to undermine American interests.\n\nAs yet, there is no single, tidy explanation. But based solely on Mr. Trump's public actions during his first six weeks back in office, the simple fact is that he has made few decisions on national security or foreign policy that have not been cheered by the Kremlin, making his stance toward Mr. Putin more consequential than ever.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Trump Thinks Putin Is His Friend. The Russians Just Issued a Humiliating Statement to the Contrary.\n\nJust one week has passed since Donald Trump's electoral triumph, and already Russian President Vladimir Putin-one of the strongman leaders Trump admires most-is messing with his head.\n\nFirst, Putin waited two days before congratulating Trump on his victory . One can imagine Trump receiving phone calls from kowtowing leaders the world over-Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, the Palestinian Authority's Mahmoud Abbas, the chief of NATO, the European heads of state-all the while wondering about the man whom he's admired publicly and privately for the past eight years: When is Vladimir going to call?\n\nThen, in response to Trump's claim that during their phone call, he asked-in some accounts, warned -Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine, a Kremlin spokesman denied that the two had spoken on the phone at all. (Putin issued his belated congratulations at a news conference.)\n\nI don't know who's telling the truth, a practice for which neither man has a sterling reputation. But either way, in the next few weeks, when Putin orders 50,000 fresh recruits (including 10,000 imported North Korean soldiers) to go on the next rampage-ousting Ukrainian soldiers from the thin slice of Russian territory they hold, then retaking soil across the border in Donbas province-he can tell a complaining Trump that he doesn't recall any such conversation. If Trump thinks Putin actually will refrain from stepping up attacks on Ukraine as a friendly favor ... well, maybe our once-and-future president will learn a lesson about the limits of personal relations in the face of perceived national interests early in his second term.\n\nThe final twist of this saga came on Monday, when Nikolai Patrushev , an aide to Putin who was previously director of Russia's Federal Security Service, made the following comment in an interview with the Moscow newspaper Kommersant:\n\nThe election campaign is over. To achieve success in the election, Donald Trump relied on certain forces to which he has corresponding obligations. As a responsible person, he will be obliged to fulfill them.\n\nThis is a mind-blowing bit of psychological warfare! The Russians are basically telling Trump: We put you in office. Now it's time for you to pay us back.\n\nDid this make Trump wonder: WTF?\n\nIt is well established that toward the end of this year's presidential election campaign, Russians created and disseminated phony videos designed to swing voters away from Vice President Kamala Harris. One such video purported to show illegal Haitian immigrants voting. (The FBI, the director of national intelligence, and the top cybersecurity agency issued a rare joint statement about that claim, warning that these videos were false and Russian in origin.) Russians also phoned in bomb scares to polling stations in Black neighborhoods that tend to favor Democratic candidates.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence-nor has anyone claimed-that Trump or his campaign staffers colluded in, or knew anything about, these videos or the bomb threats. If Trump did have some involvement, or if Russia possesses some other form of kompromat (compromising material) on Trump, Patrushev's message constitutes an extraordinarily bodacious threat of blackmail, delivered in public, against an American president-elect.\n\nIf Trump did not have any involvement in this escapade, Patrushev's gambit shows-some would say, confirms -that Russia's main goal, in all these misinformation ventures, is to sow chaos, breed mistrust, and weaken the sinews of democracy in Western countries, especially in the U.S., regardless of who is the president.\n\nWhat Trump does about this campaign-whether he is fully aware of its extent and depth-is as yet unknown. His foreign policy, which he has clearly expressed many times, is angled toward a realignment with Putin's Russia. At a first-term news conference in Helsinki , he said he believed Putin rather than his own intelligence agencies on the question of whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election. More broadly, Trump abhors multinational alliances , especially NATO. He considers U.S. military aid to Ukraine to be a waste of money; he doesn't much like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, decrying him as a \" salesman ,\" and he no doubt remains bitter over the role that their \" beautiful phone call \" played in his first impeachment trial. (This was the call where Trump tried to hold up delivery of U.S. anti-tank missiles until Zelensky agreed to dig up dirt on Hunter Biden.)\n\nThe entire MAGA wing of the Republican Party-which is to say, the Republican Party-endorses Trump's desire to renew good relations with Russia, all the better to go after America's real adversary, Xi Jinping's China. The first few of Trump's Cabinet nominees-Rep. Mike Waltz as national security adviser, Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of state, and Rep. Elise Stefanik-all share this perspective. Soon after his victory, Trump made a point of tweeting that former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, both of whom had lobbied for a senior position, would have no place in his administration. Haley had committed the unforgivable sin of running against Trump in the primaries, but beyond that, both she and Pompeo supported-and still do support-boosting military aid to Ukraine. So, they were out.\n\nOne can only wonder what Trump will do-whether he'll change his position, whether he's capable of changing his stance-when he realizes, if he realizes, that Putin is not his friend. Trump certainly should not act as if he is.\n\nUpdate, Nov. 14, 2024: This piece has been updated to more accurately reflect Patrushev's governmental position.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why Vladimir Putin's Latest Threat to the Rest of the World Is So Not Scary\n\nVladimir Putin released a new 31-page military doctrine on Monday, claiming his right to intervene, for \"humanitarian\" reasons, in any country where the rights of Russian-speaking people are in danger-and, more broadly, to \"protect, safeguard and advance the traditions and ideals of the Russian world.\"\n\nOrdinarily, such a declaration would be seen as a threat to all the countries that were once republics of the Soviet Union. Putin preceded, and initially justified, his invasion of Ukraine by falsely claiming that ethnic Russians in the eastern part of the country were victims of \"genocide.\"\n\nHowever, under the present circumstances, the new doctrine-while not to be dismissed lightly-shouldn't be taken very seriously either.\n\nPutin's ability to invade other former republics-such as Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, or even the tiny Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania-is a doubtful proposition. (The Baltic states are NATO members, making such a possible attack particularly ill-advised.) He is drawing on three-quarters of his army to invade Ukraine, his neighbor to the west, which he thought he could conquer in a matter of days-only to be bogged down, six months later, in a stalemate at best. Ukraine, aided by Western-supplied heavy arms, is now regaining lost territory in the east and the south, around Kharkiv and Kherson respectively, where the Russians recently enjoyed a solid advantage.\n\nRussia is no longer able to build or repair tanks , owing to a ban on exports from Western countries that once supplied crucial components. It is buying millions of rockets and shells from North Korea -hardly a bastion of reliable, high-tech military products-another sign that Russia can't make even rudimentary weapons, and that China, though an ally in some senses, is still putting strict limits on how much it's willing to help Moscow's war effort directly.\n\nNot that Russia is losing the war. Even the closest chroniclers of the battles are hesitant to declare which side is ahead . The fighting has a long way to go. And while Ukraine has the momentum at the moment, thanks in large part to long-range, accurate artillery supplied by the U.S., Russia still maintains an edge in firepower as well as a geographic advantage: Ukraine-which is reliant on the support of its Western allies-will not strike targets inside Russia, for fear of sparking escalation (possibly nuclear escalation), while Russia strikes targets indiscriminately inside Ukraine.\n\nAs has been the case for a few months now, the fight is to a large extent a fight for time. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hopes that the flood of Western arms-Secretary of State Antony Blinken just promised another $2 billion worth -turns the tide. Putin is hoping that his troops can hang on until the winter, when his shutdown of energy exports to European countries-lowering the supply and raising the prices of heating fuel-will prod their populations and politicians to stop supporting Ukraine and to push for a halt to the fighting.\n\nThe European Union, anticipating this possibility, has taken extraordinary steps to preempt it, scouring the globe for alternative energy supplies and pushing for conservation. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday, in Brussels, that while Russia's pipeline provided 40 percent of the EU's imported gas at the start of the war, it provides just 9 percent today.\n\nGermany, which once relied on Russia for more than half of its gas imports, today depends on it for less than 10 percent. Italy's dependence has dropped from 40 percent to 23 percent. Several EU countries, notably France and Germany, have signed agreements to provide one another with energy supplies in case of extreme shortages.\n\nStill, even 10 percent-or, in Italy's case, nearly a quarter-of a country's energy imports is a lot; it's unknown whether the exchange agreements will hold up in practice; if the winter is especially cold, pressures to end support for the war will rise. Still, as of now, only Hungary-a stalwart supporter of Putin's Russia-has renewed its contract with Gazprom, Russia's gas monopoly, in exchange for staying out of the war. Ukraine's other allies are, for the moment, holding firm-much firmer than anyone would have expected a half-year ago.\n\nThen again, Russia's economy, while hurting, isn't on the verge of collapse. It has found willing customers elsewhere for its oil and gas, especially in China and India. And people in much of the world-in those countries as well as much of Africa and Latin America-either want to take no side in what they see as a superpower conflict, or they outright support Russia's claims to Ukrainian territory.\n\nIt is also an inescapable fact that Russia possesses a large nuclear arsenal, which is the main-if not the only-reason why Biden and other Western leaders are not going all out in their support for Ukraine. None of them believe that this fight is worth risking World War III.\n\nStill, except for that one fact, Russia can no longer be taken seriously as a superpower-politically, economically, or militarily. Talk of expansive plans to protect \"the Russian world\" in far-flung territories is mere theater for a domestic audience that's held captive under Putin's propaganda machine and prone to believe his fantasies of a return to the greatness of empire.\n\nThen again, fantasies aren't entirely harmless. The question is whether Putin believes his own rhetoric-and whether he might, in a moment of desperation, act on it. In this sense, and in this sense only, his new doctrine should prompt some worry.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "It Sure Seems as if Vladimir Putin Is Recalculating the U.S. Elections\n\nThere's one American who must be angry about the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and 23 other Westerners from prisons in Russia and elsewhere. That angry American is Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has bragged, as he has when speaking of many problems, that only he could solve the problem. Back in May, he wrote on his Truth Social platform that Gershkovich\n\nwill be released almost immediately after the Election, but definitely before I assume Office. He will be HOME, SAFE, AND WITH HIS FAMILY. Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, would do that for me, but not for anyone else, and WE WILL BE PAYING NOTHING!\n\nFew social media posts, even from Trump's hand, have aged so poorly.\n\nWe don't yet know the full details of the deal, in which Russia freed 16 prisoners, including four Americans (all falsely accused), in exchange for the release of eight Russian prisoners (who really did commit crimes). Nor do we know why Putin, President Joe Biden, and the leaders of five other countries were able to strike the deal now. But a few inferences can be drawn.\n\nFirst, and most obviously, it seems that we don't need Trump as a savior to wrest the nation's foreign policy from the bungling clutches of Team Biden. It turns out that sometimes Biden & Co. know what they're doing.\n\nSecond, today's prisoner exchange refutes Trump's most basic premise-and deepest misunderstanding-of international politics: that \"the art of the deal\" (as he titled one of his books) is based on personal relationships. Trump figured that Putin would release Gershkovich as a personal favor to him. \" I like Putin, he likes me ,\" the narcissist once said after a meeting in which the wily man in the Kremlin and former KGB agent pushed all the right buttons.\n\nBut it turns out that most world leaders make decisions based on their interests . And for reasons that haven't yet been revealed, Putin decided that it was in his interest to make the deal now.\n\nThird, on a broader level, it seems that countries that are implacable foes on some issues-as, for instance, the U.S. and Russia are on the fate of Ukraine-can sometimes negotiate agreements on other issues. At a news conference Thursday, when he announced the deal, Biden was asked whether the trade might open other avenues of discussion between Washington and Moscow. Biden replied, \"As my sister used to say, 'From your lips to God's ear' \"-though Biden stressed that Putin would have to be the one who changed his behavior. Asked if he planned to call Putin, he replied, \"I don't need to talk to Putin.\" Biden also stressed that the trades could not have occurred without the cooperation of allies-notably Germany, which freed Vadim Krasikov, an FSB agent who murdered a Chechen dissident in a Berlin park, as part of the massive prisoner trade.\n\nFinally, there might be one more inference to draw from the trade, though for the moment this is hypothetical. It may be that Putin has recalculated the odds of this November's American presidential election. It could be that Trump was, to some degree, right-that Putin (assuming he wanted to make a deal at some point) was waiting until Trump won so that the two men could resume their beautiful friendship. If that's the case, this doesn't falsify my point about leaders and interests; Putin could have calculated that it was in his interest to wait for Trump's return to power because Trump-who has said he wants to restore good relations with Russia-would view the release as a favor and treat Moscow accordingly.\n\nHowever, like most world leaders, Putin has no doubt been reading the polls, and he may have concluded that Trump is not going to win, that Vice President Kamala Harris has a better chance of taking office, and that Harris is no less suspicious of Putin's Russia than Biden is-that, like Biden, she views Russia as a threat to the world order and sees Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as an important ally very much worth defending.\n\nTherefore, Putin might have reasoned, it's better to take a deal now so it looks as if he's acting without an eye to our election. This is particularly true if he's interested in resuming negotiations or striking deals on other, more geopolitical issues-though there's no evidence at the moment that he is.\n\nEither way, this is a major blow to Trump. It turns out that his return to the White House was not a precondition for wrangling Gershkovich and others-including Paul Whelan, who was arrested in 2018-out of their Russian hellholes. It also turns out his view of the world is seriously flawed. Like Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman , he thinks it's all about the friendships. It's true that friendships can help set up a meeting, but they don't make the deal. A deal depends on the goods to be had-it depends on what's put on the table and whether the other side wants it. Trump never had a plan for what to put on the table. He thought that because some other leaders laughed at his jokes, swooned at his golf game, and called him \"sir,\" he was the shiny jewel on the table; he was the reason others wanted to make a deal.\n\nWilly Loman was washed up as a salesman by the end of the play . Maybe Donald Trump will be washed up by the end of this election season. And unlike Arthur Miller's play, that won't be a tragedy.\n\nThis post has been updated since it was originally published to reflect developing news events.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Now I'm scowling. Things have become very serious.\n\nTrump's obeisance to Vladimir Putin's views has raised suspicions on many occasions over the past decade, but his outright kowtowing remarks at a news conference Tuesday were enough to set off sirens.\n\nIn less than a minute's time, Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war, claimed Ukraine could have made a deal to stop the war soon after it began, and accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of being an illegitimate leader who didn't deserve a seat at the table in Riyadh, where U.S. and Russian diplomats asserted the exclusive rights to negotiate a peace.\n\nNot only were all these statements false, they parroted Kremlin propaganda, which Trump likely heard from Putin himself.\n\nHere's what Trump said :\n\nI think I have the power to end this war. And I think [the negotiations are] going very well. But today I hear [Zelensky say], \"Oh well, we weren't invited.\" Well, you've been there for three years. You should have ended [the war] in three years. You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.\n\nAnd a little later , when a Fox News reporter asked about reports that Russia wanted to force Ukraine into making a deal:\n\nWe have a situation where we haven't had elections in Ukraine-where we have martial law, essentially martial law in Ukraine, where the leader in Ukraine, I mean, I hate to say it, but he's down at 4 percent approval rating.\n\n(This is a lie: Zelensky's approval rating stands at 57 percent -much higher than Trump's 47 percent .) The president continued:\n\nYeah, I would say that-you know, they want a seat at the table. You could say the people have to, wouldn't the people of Ukraine have to say, like, \"It's been a long time since we've had an election.\" That's not a Russia thing. That's something coming from me and coming from many other countries.\n\nActually, it is entirely \"a Russia thing ,\" and it's total nonsense.\n\nFirst, to state the obvious, it's preposterous for Trump to claim- not for the first time, by the way -that Ukraine \"should've never started\" the war, when in fact, Russia started it almost exactly three years ago with a massive three-front invasion.\n\nBut the claim isn't merely preposterous; it's also a sign of Trump's utter gullibility to Putin's charms. When Putin launched his \"special military operation\" on Feb. 22, 2022, he claimed that he did so to stop the Kyiv government's \" genocide \" of Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region.\n\nThis, of course, was nonsense-belied by Putin himself when he expanded the assault in a drive to capture the capital (unsuccessful, it turned out) and then proclaimed his real goal, which was to overthrow Kyiv's \" neo-Nazi regime \" (an odd term for an elected Jewish president), wipe out Ukraine itself (which Putin dismisses as a fictitious country ), and restore the old Russian empire . Trump acknowledges none of this.\n\nSecond, it's true that there were negotiations early on in the war, but the deal that Moscow offered-permanent occupation of the land Russian troops had grabbed (a large swath of the country, as this was before Ukraine's counteroffensive), a denial of Ukraine's ambitions to join NATO or the European Union, and the withdrawal of NATO troops from front-line nations in Europe itself-amounted to not only a surrender by Ukraine but a reversal of Moscow's Cold War loss.\n\nThird, it's true Ukraine hasn't held elections since 2019, when Zelensky won the presidency with 73 percent of the vote ( that's a landslide), but this is because the country's constitution forbids elections during a time of martial law, and martial law was imposed because of Russia's invasion.\n\nThe facts are these. First, Trump hates Zelensky, and has hated him ever since the leaked tape of their phone call-the one where Trump threatened to withhold delivery of Javelin anti-tank missiles until Zelensky dug up dirt on Hunter Biden- sparked his first impeachment . Second, Trump admires Putin , has sided with him over the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies , and wants to restore good relations between Washington and Moscow. And he is desperate (way too visibly desperate for someone who authored a book called The Art of the Deal ) to end the war at any cost, and doesn't care if this cost is the subjugation of the Ukrainian people.\n\nOn Tuesday, Michael McFaul , former U.S. ambassador to Russia, posted on X (based on conversations he'd had with officials attending the Munich Security Conference):\n\nTrump's team allegedly has offered Putin (1) Ukrainian territory, (2) no NATO membership for Ukraine, (3) no US soldiers in Ukraine, (4) the withdrawal of US soldiers from Europe, including from frontline states, and (5) sanctions relief. Putin's return offer-nothing.\n\nPeter Baker reported the same offer in the New York Times.\n\nThis is essentially the same \"deal\" that Putin offered back near the start of the war-an offer of surrender that Zelensky and his Western allies wisely dismissed out of hand.\n\nThere's more. London's Daily Telegraph , a generally pro-Trump newspaper, reported earlier this week-based on memos leaked from Kyiv-that Trump has proposed that Ukraine grant the United States 50 percent of revenue and new resource licenses on minerals, oil, gas, ports, and infrastructure. This would effectively grant the U.S. \"near-total economic control over Ukraine's resources.\" This \"deal\"-which Trump's proposal says would amount to $500 billion (almost certainly an exaggerated sum)-would not be in exchange for continued military aid to Ukraine but would rather be \"payback\" for the billions the U.S. has provided already.\n\nThis is the sort of infliction usually imposed by victors on the losers of a war-not on some intermediary's ally. If Zelensky turns it down (and who wouldn't?), Trump would likely feel more justified still in pushing him and his people under Putin's armored caravan.\n\nHere is a question for the day: Where are the Republicans who know that Trump's claims are nonsense and that his position at these \"peace talks\" is likely to have dire consequences? They would be disastrous not only for Ukraine but also for Europe (Putin may take the cave-in as a green light to threaten a wider land grab), Taiwan (China's Xi Jinping, who has been watching Ukraine closely, could take Trump's indifference over its fate as a signal that he could put the ultimate squeeze on the island republic that he has long regarded Beijing's property), and the rest of the world (whose leaders and citizens will conclude that it's not a good idea to take the United States at its word-on anything).\n\nWhere is Senate Majority Leader John Thune , who-just one year ago-assured Zelensky of continued U.S. support and who led a successful effort to pass a bill containing another $60 billion in military aid, over the opposition and pressure of Trump, who at the time was the all-but-certain GOP nominee in the then-upcoming election?* Why isn't Thune, why isn't Sen. Lindsey Graham (among the party's most outspoken Ukraine advocates), why aren't any of the Republicans who voted for that bill, who have joined delegations to Kyiv, who have posed for cameras while shaking hands with Zelensky-why aren't any of them speaking up?\n\nFinally, this just in: Trump's latest harangue against Zelensky (and, of course, Joe Biden) in a social media post Wednesday morning. Those who aren't yet ashamed of their silence should read this:\n\nThink of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn't be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and \"TRUMP,\" will never be able to settle. The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe, and Europe's money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back. Why didn't Sleepy Joe Biden demand Equalization, in that this War is far more important to Europe than it is to us - We have a big, beautiful Ocean as separation. On top of this, Zelenskyy admits that half of the money we sent him is \"MISSING.\" He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden \"like a fiddle.\" A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only \"TRUMP,\" and the Trump Administration, can do. Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring Peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the \"gravy train\" going. I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died - And so it continues.....\n\nThis is beyond shameful. Where are the grown-ups?\n\nCorrection, Feb. 19, 2025: This piece originally misstated Thune's role in the Senate.

      "text": "When Will Russians Realize the Disaster in Ukraine Is Putin's Fault?\n\nThe Ukrainian army's counteroffensive in the northeast of the country has been a wild success, pushing into Russian-held territory much deeper and faster than anyone had expected. In just the past few days, the army has recaptured more than 1,000 square miles , including Izium , which had been a key Russian supply hub, and nearly the entire northeastern province of Kharkiv , which runs right up to the Russia-Ukraine border (though Ukrainian troops haven't advanced quite that far).\n\nThis turnaround was so potent and swift that Moscow's propaganda machine had no time to send out the new script, leaving Russian TV pundits and bloggers -some of them, anyway-to ponder the depth of the setback on their own, howling over the retreat and even inveighing against officers and officials who had claimed from the start of the war that Ukrainians wouldn't fight back, that Russian forces wouldn't bomb cities, and that victory would be quick and certain.\n\nNo one has dared criticize President Vladimir Putin for these perfidies; he remains untouchable to anyone who doesn't want to wind up in prison. But now it is fair to question (not as a blithe fantasy, as had previously been the case) how long it will be before some in Russia begin to muse, first at the dinner table, and then out in public, that the man in the Kremlin-who, after all, exercises absolute rule over everything else in Russian politics-might be responsible for this disastrous war as well.\n\nThen again, it's premature for an outsider to race to these lines too quickly. First, the war is far from over. Ukraine has the momentum, but it's worth noting that the tides have shifted back and forth a few times in the seven months since Putin launched his invasion. In the beginning, Ukraine mounted a surprising resistance, turning Russia's tanks away from Kyiv. But Russian forces seemed unstoppable in the south, and as recently as mid-June , they seemed to be breaking through a long-slogged stalemate in the east, slowly but steadily pushing Ukrainian defenses out of the Donbas region.\n\nNow things have shifted in Ukraine's favor. The swing is dramatic, but not necessarily definitive. For one thing, the fog of this war is particularly thick; there is so much that independent analysts and journalists can't yet see. For another, though the Russians are hard-pressed when it comes to weapons, troops, and supplies, they aren't about to run out; in terms of sheer firepower, they still have an edge over Ukraine, and they have a geographic advantage as well; while Russians attack the interior of Ukraine with impunity, Ukrainians can't fight back on the other side of the Russian border lest they risk losing the support of American and European allies fearful of provoking a wider war.\n\nStill, it's worth reemphasizing that the shift in Ukraine's favor is dramatic-highly dramatic, even if not yet definitive. There are a few reasons for this. First is the flood of weapons coming from the West-notably the highly accurate long-range rockets , which have struck more than 400 Russian targets , including weapons depots (which have sometimes set off secondary explosions) and logistics terminals. In addition, according to a close observer on the battlefield, a fair number of Soviet-built T-72 tanks-provided to Ukraine by Poland-were vital for punching through Russian defenses. And all along in the fight, such mundane supplies as rifles, bullets, night-vision goggles, and radios have played a key role.\n\nThe second influence is the assistance from U.S. intelligence and special operations. My guess is that when the histories of this war are written years from now, these factors will loom even larger than they do now. It has been widely reported that since the beginning of the conflict, U.S. agencies have been providing Ukrainian commanders with near-real-time intel on everything about the Russian offensive-where the troops are, where they're going, and what officers are saying to their underlings. On Saturday, as the scale of the Ukrainian success was emerging, the New York Times reported that the country's leadership had also relied on U.S. intelligence in planning and conducting the current counteroffensive. It has also been reported that U.S. special forces have trained certain Ukrainian units in deception ops and other tools of the trade. To the extent that Ukrainian units have fought in a highly coordinated fashion and Russian units have fallen apart in battle, these enablers have likely been almost as key as the more high-profile weapons systems.\n\nThe third reason is the even less quantifiable factor of \"morale.\" Ukrainian troops know why they're fighting, and it's for the cause that makes soldiers everywhere fight with special  ferocity-the defense of their country, their homes, and their families. By contrast, many (and perhaps most) Russian soldiers don't know why they're fighting. Many of the Russians who retreated from Kharkiv this past weekend, and from the area around Kyiv in the early days of the war, simply threw down their weapons or abandoned their tanks and ran. Within Russia, Putin has spun a tightly woven depiction of Ukraine as a myth, the \"Kyiv regime\" as run by Nazis, and NATO as hellbent on exploiting the war as an excuse to invade all of Russia. It is hard to tell how many soldiers, commanders, and ordinary citizens believe any of this. (Polls surely exaggerate; those who doubt the propaganda won't say so to a stranger who calls on the phone and asks what they think.) This past weekend's debates about the war on TV talk shows that previously tolerated no dissent suggest that the monolith may be cracking.\n\nWhere is the war going? The answer depends entirely on the calculations and impulses of Putin. Not since the time of the czars has one man ruled Russia with such impunity. (Even Josef Stalin had to report-albeit perfunctorily-to a Politburo, which a decade after his death ousted his successor, Nikita Khrushchev, for getting out of control.) Putin has an entourage of oligarchs, but they depend on him, not the other way around. (Recently, one who criticized Putin directly was forced to sell off his assets at a huge discount . Others have been less fortunate, with a number of executives dying under mysterious circumstances, including one who \" fell \" out of a hospital window this month.)\n\nThe elites still have access to their luxury goods, and as long as that is the case, they are unlikely to bite the hand that feeds them. If conditions worsen and a few of them do rile themselves into a rebellious spirit, they will likely pause before forming a conspiracy for fear that one of their would-be comrades would turn them in. There could also be a revolt in the streets, but such events are rare in Russian history-there's 1905, 1917, 1991, and not much else. Still, when revolts have taken place in Russia, they've erupted suddenly. Who knows when the next one will happen, or for what reason? One thing is for sure: It's nothing to count on.\n\nWhat will Putin do if things keep going badly for his army? There has been talk of recruiting or drafting around 130,000 more troops, but it would take about a year to mobilize, train, and equip them for battle, and that might be too late. Many in the West fear that he might lash out in desperation with chemical or nuclear weapons. He has already, several times, bombed civilian targets for want of anything else to do; this past weekend, as his troops retreated from Kharkiv, his commanders launched shells at electrical power plants, causing blackouts in the towns retaken by Ukrainians.\n\nWill Putin keep doubling down? He has enough armaments to do that, even if not very effectively. Or will he seek a diplomatic way out? Two facts throw doubt on the latter. First, if he appears weak, he could lose control of his power levers at home. Second, as Ukraine makes more advances on the battlefield, President Volodymyr Zelensky will feel less inclined to make compromises. In the wake of the weekend's triumphs, Kyiv spokespeople are defining victory as the restoration of Ukraine's borders of 2014-meaning the reclamation of Russian-annexed Crimea and all of the Donbas areas that were taken by Russian-backed rebels that year. This is an outcome that Putin-or even some hypothetical successor-would be very unlikely to accept.\n\nIt may be, as Anne Applebaum writes in the Atlantic, \"time to prepare for a Ukrainian victory.\" (Actually, the magazine's headline goes beyond her article's argument. \"This is not a prediction; it's a warning,\" she writes.) It's at least as sound to prepare for a very long war.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why People Are Comparing Boris Yeltsin to Vladimir Putin 30 Years Later and Why They're Wrong\n\nThirty years ago this month, Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered tanks to shell the parliament-a wedding cake-style building in downtown Moscow called the White House-and then to arrest its leaders, who had been rebelling against his government. Some look back on the incident as (in one historian's words ) a \"turning point in Russia's failure to develop democracy\"-drawing a straight line between Yeltsin's suppression of the legislature in 1993 and Vladimir Putin's full-bore dictatorship today.\n\nI disagree, and I do so not just as a sometimes-historian but as a journalist who was there from 1992 to 1995, closely watching and chronicling the drama-soaked events of the time as the Boston Globe's Moscow bureau chief.\n\nIt may be possible to draw a ragged line between the reigns of Yeltsin and Putin, the first two (very different) leaders of post-Communist Russia. But the roots of Putinism go much deeper-and Yeltsin's shelling of the White House was, far from a pivot toward terror, a necessary move of counterterror: a response to a clear and present danger that threatened to erase his nascent reforms and plunge Russia back to its darkest days of Soviet rule.\n\nThe notion that the parliament's rebels, led by Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, were simply democrats protesting Yeltsin's growing presidential powers and radical economic policies, is absurd. They were a rabble of Communists-many left over from the USSR's legislative body, the Supreme Soviet, which was still the parliament's name-and outright fascists, trying to mount a coup. Some of them were explicitly angling to reprise the putsch mounted two years earlier against the reform Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nI well remember strolling through the parliament's corridors on Saturday, Oct. 2, two days before the shelling, nervously eyeing the hunkered-down rebels-many of them drunk, stomping around in black boots, cradling heavy rifles or submachine guns, which they'd retrieved from the armory in the basement. Some were members of parliament. Some were volunteer militiamen recruited from the ranks of Cossacks (whips laced through their belt loops) or neo-Nazis.\n\nA few weeks earlier, the Supreme Soviet's speaker, Ruslan Khasbulatov, had called a session to vote on Yeltsin's impeachment. A minority of legislators showed up for the vote, not enough for a quorum, so Khasbulatov formally expelled the no-shows and declared a quorum met. The remaining members approved a resolution to impeach Yeltsin and swore in Rutskoi as president. Rutskoi appointed a defense minister and other putative cabinet members (one of whom had been a leader of the putsch against Gorbachev), all of them now in the White House. Yet, at least for the moment, they had no levers; the rank and file in the ministries, bureaucracies, and armed forces ignored their orders and continued to swear obeisance to Yeltsin.\n\nStill, some of Yeltsin's men were nervous-for good reason. On Sunday, Oct. 3, militias recruited by Rutskoi and Khasbulatov, some of whom were active-duty soldiers, raided the mayor's office (next door to the White House) and mounted an attack on Ostankino, the main broadcast center, located a mile north. Poorly guarded at first, defensive positions at Ostankino were soon reinforced by the Russian government's anti-riot troops; an intense shootout lasted late into the night, when the rebels were finally pushed back. More than 60 people died and more than 100 were injured. (One of the seriously injured, Otto Pohl, was an American freelance photographer who often worked with me.) Meanwhile, Yeltsin's officials deployed armored vehicles to the defense ministry and the Kremlin. Fears of a coup were intense-and valid.\n\nThe National Security Archive, a private research group in Washington, released last week a cache of documents , some recently declassified, related to the anniversary of this crisis. One document, an interview with Yeltsin's defense minister, Pavel Grachev , is particularly illuminating. He recalls meeting with Yeltsin and others at 3 a.m., just a few hours after the gunfight at Ostankino. The loyalty of the military was up for grabs (Rutskoi was an Afghan war hero). Had the rebel troops taken over Ostankino's airwaves and appealed to troops to come join them, many might have done so. Yeltsin insisted that Gravchev had to order a tank attack on the White House at daybreak and arrest the rebel leaders. If he hadn't done so, Grachev said in the interview (conducted several years after the events), civil war would have erupted.\n\nAs the tanks rolled toward the White House early Monday morning, rebel snipers were positioned on the roof. Gunfire was exchanged on Moscow's streets for the next few hours. Some bullets flew above my head-and the heads of dozens of Muscovites who had gathered a few hundred yards away to watch the melee, the likes of which hadn't been since the 1917 revolution. Finally, Grachev put two senior officers into a tank and ordered them to fire inert rounds into the window of an office where he was sure the rebel leaders were sitting. They hit the target precisely. Troops then stormed the building, exchanging fire as they went. Before long, all the rebel leaders came out with their hands up. They were thrown in prison.\n\nThe new documents released by the National Security Archive include the transcript of a phone call to Yeltsin from President Bill Clinton, congratulating the Russian president for his \"superb handling\" of the crisis. The archive's historians who compiled the documents criticize Clinton and other U.S. officials for supporting Yeltsin unequivocally. They imply that this support encouraged Yeltsin's further tack toward authoritarian rule. As long as Yeltsin followed his plan to adopt Western capitalist ways, the historians write, he could get away with anything.\n\nThis is misleading. No less unassailable a figure as Yelena Bonner, a leader of Russia's democratic movement and the widow of Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet era's most prominent dissident-physicist, defended Yeltsin's action as \"appropriate\" and said he should have \"suppressed\" the \"fascist gang\" in parliament much sooner.\n\nThat said, the Yeltsin-Rutskoi faceoff was hardly a contest of pure good guys vs. bad guys. Context is important. Not quite two years had passed since the Soviet Union had dissolved and Yeltsin had risen to the Kremlin's helm as president of the new Russian Federation. The economy was in shambles, the army was a wreck, and Yeltsin was meeting resistance from the parliament-still called the Supreme Soviet-on his political and economic reform measures.\n\nIn April, Yeltsin called a referendum on his rule and won overwhelming support. Citing the vote as a mandate, he announced that he would soon put forth a new constitution, strengthening the powers of the president; dissolve the parliament; and hold new elections in December. He ignored the existing constitution when it suited his agenda and bypassed the parliament. The parliament's leaders pushed back, opposing many of the reforms-especially those adopting free-market capitalism-and calling for new presidential elections. The Orthodox Church tried to intervene as a mediator between the two bodies, but neither side was willing to negotiate. Hence came the impeachment resolution and a heightened militancy among Rutskoi's faction, which saw itself as losing both political power and popular favor.\n\nThe problem wasn't entirely the persistence of Soviet-style thinking in the parliament. It also lay in the failure, by Yeltsin-and, before him, Gorbachev-to erect or facilitate democratic institutions in the months before then.\n\nWhen I first came to Moscow in June 1992, I asked a Russian democratic activist I knew where I should travel-which cities in Russia had begun to form democratic institutions: elected councils, political parties, trade unions, civil society groups. He nodded and thought ... and then thought some more. It was clear: There were no such cities. Yeltsin talked a good game about democracy; I think he really did want to join the Western world. But he had no idea what this entailed. He viewed all reform as top-down, and the smart young aides he'd recruited to help him had no idea what this entailed either.\n\nHis free-market economists, led by Yegor Gaidar, were particularly unprepared. They grasped the inefficiencies of large state-run industries, where the value of inputs (the resource going into a machine) exceeded the value of outputs (the product being produced). They realized price controls had to be lifted to loosen the party's stranglehold and end the era of chronic shortages. But they didn't seem to grasp how dependent the country was on the system. In the long term, the reforms created a new class of merchants and consumers; they improved the quality of life for many, especially in the large cities. But in the short run, they were disastrous. Close down the inefficient factory, and you impoverish the entire town built around it (the social services, food shops, schools, everything). Lift price controls, and inflation soars, wiping out the (skimpy) savings of the average citizen.\n\nGaidar and his staff had read American economics textbooks, but they hadn't studied America's real economy. I once asked a young aide to Gaidar whether he knew that, in the real United States, many farmers were paid not to grow crops, in order to keep prices high; that property owners were granted low-interest, 30-year mortgages to make their land affordable; that the government kept unemployed people afloat until they found new jobs. The aide didn't know any of this.\n\nHere is where the line can be drawn between Yeltsin and Putin: It's not that Yeltsin's shelling of the parliament marked a \"turning point in Russia's failure to adopt democracy\"-it's that Russia never came to adopt democracy in the first place.\n\nYeltsin made huge strides toward democracy in two areas: First, his economic reforms did spur the start of a consumer economy and a middle class. However, they didn't spark the manufacturing of consumer goods inside Russia; factories remained, for the most part, state-owned or moribund or both.\n\nSecond, and more vital, he really did allow the creation of a free press. In the three years I was in Moscow, more than a dozen newspapers and magazines, as well as a couple of radio and television networks, ran completely uncensored operations, trained or hired highly talented journalists (who seemed to have been born for this moment), and published carefully reported investigative articles as well as intelligent opinion columns. One TV show, Kukly (meaning \"puppets\")-featuring grotesque puppets of leading Russian political figures, including Yeltsin-was more savagely satirical than anything on American airwaves at the time.\n\nHowever, all of these free news media organizations were owned by very wealthy individuals (\"oligarchs,\" they were misleadingly tagged), some of whom were financed by certain private banks. Once Putin replaced Yeltsin, and decided not to tolerate criticism or good humor or independent reporting, these media outlets were shut down, their sources of revenue cut off, their owners in some cases arrested or deported. There were no courts or other institutions to let them be sustained on their own.\n\nPutin did not kill off all of the independent media right away; he let some of the smaller outlets, such as Echo of Moscow radio, survive, if just for appearance's sake. But after his invasion of Ukraine, when he shut down all voices of criticism, arrested all protesters, moved to control the message totally and to stiffen one-man rule to a degree not seen in Russia since the time of the tsars, he had little problem doing so.\n\nThis wasn't because Yeltsin paved the way with his assault against the parliament on Oct. 4, 1993. The way had been paved by decades, even centuries, of Russian history.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Ukraine Crisis Is Not  Going Well for Putin\n\nSo far, the Ukrainian crisis is going very badly for Vladimir Putin.\n\nYes, the Russian president has arrayed roughly 100,000 troops on Ukraine's border-enough to mount a major invasion, if that's what he wants to do. But threatening Ukraine is only a means to Putin's main strategic goals, which are a) to carve out a \"sphere of influence\" that as much as possible re-creates the old Russian (or Soviet) empire, b) to deepen the politico-economic fissures within the European Union, and c) to drive a wedge between the United States and its NATO allies.\n\nAnd yet his military gambit has accomplished the opposite. The overt threat to Ukraine has rallied the European nations around a common menace, revitalized NATO's original mission to deter and contain Russian expansion, and thus bonded the European allies to the United States (the prime guarantor of their security) more tightly than at any time since the end of the Cold War.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nPutin had reason to believe things would go otherwise. He saw President Joe Biden touting the Quad -the shiny new alliance of the U.S., Japan, India, and Australia, which would unify the Asian and Pacific allies and fend off a rising China-and may have figured that NATO had receded in importance. He also watched Biden bug out of Afghanistan, and while he may have sympathized with the move (his beloved Soviet Union was among those entombed in that graveyard of empires), he no doubt noticed the withdrawal's rushed incompetence and the concern, if not panic, that it roused among U.S. allies. Meanwhile, the U.K. was out on its post-Brexit own; Angela Merkel had retired as Germany's chancellor, leaving NATO's largest, richest country in momentary flux; and French President Emmanuel Macron was seeking to take her place as the continent's leader with a vision of Europe's \"strategic autonomy\" from Washington.\n\nWho knows whether all this was passing through Putin's mind, but objectively it must have seemed a good time to make a move-especially since the pesky Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky , was drifting ever further to the West, renewing his request for NATO membership, and U.S. officials were indulging him, saying they'd invite him in the club someday. Meanwhile, the U.S. was supplying Ukraine's soldiers with weapons and sending American soldiers as trainers, along with corps of special forces and CIA agents, who were up to who knows what mischief.\n\nFrom Putin's viewpoint, the combination of threat and opportunity could only have seemed alluring. In 2014, he'd annexed Crimea and mounted armed incursions into eastern Ukraine-prompting some consequences (economic sanctions, expulsion from the G-8, and other inconveniences) but nothing dreadful. Why should this time be any different?\n\nSo, starting in November (perhaps earlier), he moved dozens of tank battalions, rockets, infantry fighting vehicles, and tens of thousands of the troops to go with them toward the border of Ukraine. We do not know whether he planned to invade or merely use the threat of an invasion to force concessions on his demands-for NATO to stop expanding its membership eastward and for the American military to roll back its presence in areas once held by the Soviet Union.\n\nHe may have figured that, even if Biden raised a fuss, the Europeans would be split. Some, including Germany, would be fearful of alienating Moscow, lest oil and gas supplies be cut off just as the winter temperatures were plunging. Certainly they wouldn't risk hardship for the sake of Ukraine, which few Europeans wanted as a fellow NATO member and which most understood was of special importance to Russia.\n\nIn other words, Putin may well have expected resistance to fold before it mounted-compelling Zelensky to succumb to Moscow's pressure without having to fire a shot.\n\nBut it didn't turn out that way. Putin's moves were too blunt, and his denials of any unusual activity were too blatant. Then came another surprising twist: Biden and his diplomats, who had made missteps in other realms, suddenly turned super competent. Biden was comfortable with trans-Atlantic matters; NATO had been the centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy during his decades on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and as vice president. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had been at his side, as top staffer, for many of those years. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman had eked out results at the toughest negotiating tables. Their efforts held together the 30-state NATO alliance in opposing Moscow's moves and threatening firm action in response to any further invasion of Ukraine's territory.\n\nWhatever Putin winds up doing, his plan of driving the NATO allies apart and reducing the U.S. presence near Russia's borders failed. In fact, Washington has put 8,500 more troops on high alert for deployment to Poland and Estonia, to shore up the eastern flanks of NATO. Poland and Britain have announced a \"trilateral security pact\" with Ukraine, and, though no one knows quite what it means, the two countries are in the meantime redoubling their recent arms shipments to Kyiv. Sweden and Finland , Russia's thoroughly Western neighbors, which have stayed militarily neutral for all these decades, are now mulling the prospect of joining NATO.\n\nSo what will Putin do now? The troops and tanks poised on the border are reportedly capable of overrunning the Ukrainian army, which, though much improved in recent years, would still be profoundly outmatched. But the Russian army has never been very good at maintaining supply lines. That would be a problem if they have to occupy a stretch of Ukrainian land, especially in cities. And they would be met not only by regular troops but civilian resistance fighters , who-officials have warned-will be aided by U.S. and NATO arms, logistics, and intelligence.\n\nIn Putin's 22 years as either president or prime minister, his military moves have been cautious and limited. His annexation of Crimea was bloodless; not a shot was fired. (Most Crimeans viewed themselves as Russian anyway.) His incursion into eastern Ukraine was mainly to assist ethnic Russian separatists; Kremlin officials continue to deny that Russian soldiers ever crossed the border, though an estimated 500 of them have died in the eight-year-old war. (More than 14,000 Ukrainians have died.) His invasion of Georgia took less than a week. The one time he sent ground forces to Syria, they were routed in an armed confrontation with U.S. troops; since then, he has assisted Bashar al-Assad's regime almost entirely with air power.*\n\nIf he did invade Ukraine, it would be not only the largest battle in Europe-but also by far the most complex military operation Russia has undertaken anywhere-since World War II. And the Russian boys returning home in body bags would have died not for the homeland, as they did fighting Nazis, but while trying to conquer a neighboring country.\n\nFinally, if the U.S. does impose the severe sanctions that Biden has considered-including barring major banks and individual oligarchs from transactions in dollars, as well as banning the import of U.S. parts (which would gut Russia's high-tech industries)-the masses and elites may start growling at Putin's \"harebrained schemes\" (the epithet that the Kremlin's commissars pronounced when they ousted Nikita Khrushchev for instigating the Cuban missile crisis, which ended in defeat and roused the U.S. to mount a crash buildup in nuclear arms).\n\nThen again, if Russian tanks roll across the border, NATO's much-touted unity may fall apart. If Putin responds to sanctions by cutting off oil and natural gas to Europe, Germany-which is particularly dependent on Russia for energy supplies-may fold. (It has already blocked Estonia from reselling German arms to Ukraine and barred British planes carrying arms for Ukraine from flying across German airspace.) Many Russian oligarchs spend a lot of money on real estate in London ; if they can no longer pay mortgages or property taxes, British businesses and Boris Johnson-or whoever succeeds him as prime minister-may lose patience as well.\n\nBiden probably knows that broad expressions of unanimity tend to waver when blood starts to flow and money dries up, which is why he and the other Western leaders would prefer a diplomatic settlement as soon as possible. Nobody knows what Putin prefers. If he's looking for an exit ramp off this highway to catastrophe, the question is how to get him to take it while giving him a way to save face. Simply backing him into a corner would probably push him to double down.\n\nAt his press conference on Tuesday with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Putin-who, until then, hadn't spoken a word in public about the Ukraine crisis since December-hinted at a possible way out. Mainly, he put on a pessimistic pose, complaining that Washington has ignored his main demand, a permanent ban on Ukraine's entrance into NATO. (Orban assisted him by taking Putin's side in the conflict-the first, utterly predictable NATO member to jump off the alliance bandwagon.*)\n\nHowever, Putin also made two remarks that might- might -shine a thin ray of hope on the gloomy landscape. First, he said that he had not yet responded to the letter Biden wrote last week in reply to Putin's demands. In other words, diplomacy has not hit a dead end.\n\nSecond, he referred to (without mentioning their names) a few East-West agreements signed over the years-the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, the 1990 Charter of Paris, and the 1999 Istanbul Declaration-which U.S. officials have also referred to. The Americans have noted that these accords allow all countries to choose their own defense alliances, meaning that Russia has no right to dictate whether Ukraine can be a member of NATO. Putin noted that these same accords also say that no country can increase its security while threatening the security of others. Putin considers the further expansion of NATO, to include Ukraine, as a threat to Russian security.\n\nOne can imagine Biden acknowledging Putin's point and calling for negotiations to begin on shaping 21 st century European security in a way that protects the interests of all parties-including Russia. As a first step, Biden could propose that Russia withdraw at least some of those troops and tanks from the Ukrainian border. In return, the U.S. might suspend military activities in Ukraine and, for the moment, elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Naval exercises in the Black Sea could also be halted while the talks go on. International inspectors could monitor all these movements and suspensions. Russians could inspect missile defense sites in Eastern Europe, to verify that they cannot be used to support offensive missiles, as Russians say they believe.\n\nThe point-the most that can be done for the moment-would be to de-escalate the tensions, make all military activities more transparent, and reduce the chance of miscalculations that could lead to war. And, at some juncture, Biden needs to find some way to assure Putin-sometime after thousands of tank turrets are no longer aimed at Ukrainian heads-that Ukraine is not going to join NATO anytime soon. It's not going to happen for the foreseeable future; it shouldn't be a cause of war.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin is going to Beijing for the Olympics. He won't draw attention from the grand spectacle put on by Chinese President Xi Jinping-who, as of late, has geopolitically speaking become his new best friend-by invading Ukraine. So for the next two weeks, war is very unlikely. Biden and NATO should use the opportunity to keep up the show of unity but turn down the heat-quietly prod Putin's intentions by offering a path to a diplomatic solution. This venture may be playing out poorly for Putin so far, but if it escalates, it could become a disaster for everyone.\n\nCorrection, Feb. 2, 2022: This article originally misidentified Bashar al-Assad as Bashir Assad and Viktor Orban as Viktor Korban.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What Putin Was Really Saying in Helsinki\n\nWhile most of the commentary about Monday's bizarre press conference in Helsinki rightly focuses on President Trump's smirking, obsequious performance, it's worth looking closely at Vladimir Putin's remarks as well.\n\nPutin did not seem nearly as eager to please as his counterpart. While Trump declined to specifically criticize Russia for anything­ -election interference, the annexation of Crimea, support for Assad, assassinations on foreign soil-Putin included in his opening remarks some pointed criticism of Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal. \"Thanks to the Iranian nuclear deal, Iran became most controlled country in the world, it submitted to the control of IAEA,\" Putin said, according to the live translation, adding that the deal \"effectively ensures the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear program and strengthens the non-proliferation regime.\" He also suggested the U.S. should do more to put pressure on the Ukrainian government to comply with the Minsk agreement-referring to the internationally brokered deal to halt fighting in Ukraine's Donbass region. Trump, notably, did not mention Russian financial and military support for separatists in the region or accuse Russia of violating the agreement, as his own U.N. ambassador did just a few weeks ago. In fact, Trump did not mention Ukraine at all in his remarks.\n\nPutin also used the platform to take aim at some of his longtime boogeymen in the West. In suggesting that U.S. and Russian law enforcement and intelligence officers should work together to investigate election interference-a ludicrous notion that Trump called an \"interesting idea\"-Putin also proposed that they look into the activities of Bill Browder, the U.S.-British financier and former Russia-based investor who has campaigned for harsh sanctions against Russian officials since the death of his lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison in 2009. A Russian court charged Browder with tax evasion (he dismissed the charges as baseless and politically motivated) and found him guilty in absentia, making him the subject of several Interpol notices (which Western governments have mostly ignored ).\n\nIn arguing that there is a distinction between the Russian state and the Russian companies or individuals who may have interfered in the U.S. election, Putin engaged in some whataboutism by trotting out trusty old George Soros . Soros' wealth and power, Putin said, \"doesn't make him-his position, his posture, the posture of the United States. No, it does not. It's the same case.\"\n\nThe Russian president also put out some interesting signals Monday about the future of the conflict in Syria. It's worth noting that while Trump was traveling around Europe generating headlines in the lead-up to this summit, Putin had a quieter, but just as busy and perhaps more productive, week. The Russian president met in Moscow with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .* (In fairness to Putin, he's a rare world leader on good terms with both those men.) He also met with French President Emmanuel Macron, in town for the World Cup final, for talks on Iran and Syria policy.\n\nAhead of the Helsinki summit, there had been speculation that Putin and Trump could announce a deal that would see the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and an end to the effort to unseat President Bashar al-Assad in exchange for Russian guarantees to limit the Iranian presence near the Syrian border with Israel. It would also encourage U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces to partner with the regime. State Department and Pentagon officials, as well as National Security Adviser John Bolton, are skeptical of the deal, according to reporting by the Washington Post's Josh Rogin.\n\nSuch a deal would be regarded as extremely favorable to both Russia and Iran, and Putin likely knows that getting Israeli buy-in is key to winning Trump's support for it. Netanyahu seemed amenable after their recent meeting, saying he had no objection to Assad remaining in power, as long as Iranian forces and their proxies were \"tens of kilometers\" from the Israeli border.\n\nTrump and Putin did not announce any new deals Monday, but it's notable that Putin mentioned the \"peaceful relationship between Syria and Israel and also to provide security of the state of Israel\" in his opening remarks. Trump started talking about Israel, unprompted, in response to a question about U.S.-Russian military cooperation in Syria. Clearly, the topic came up.\n\nPutin's most telling answer of the press conference may have come in response to a question from a U.S. reporter about why Americans should trust Russia's denials of interference in the election. \"As to who is to be believed, who is not to be believed, you can trust no one,\" Putin said. \"Where did you get this idea that President Trump trusts me or I trust him? He defends the interests of the United States of America. I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nA defining feature of Putinism is the extent to which Russian officials are often upfront and open about their use of disinformation for political purposes. \"Trust no one\" is as good a mission statement as any.\n\nCorrection, July 16, 2018: This post originally misspelled Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's last name.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Hello, Dictators\n\nThis is part of Hello, Trumpworld , Slate's reluctant guide to the people who will be calling the shots now-at least for as long as they last in Washington.\n\nDonald Trump's return to the White House is making the world's biggest tyrants happy-a fact that Trump not only acknowledges but crows about with pride.\n\nTrump boasts that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin \"get along,\" as if that alone augured well for the world. (Getting along is a worthy goal in itself for allies and neutrals, but, when it comes to adversaries, understanding is a more productive aim.) He has said the same about Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, adding about Kim, \"I like him, and he likes me.\" He also touts his friendship with Viktor Orbán , calling him \"one of the most respected men\"-oblivious or indifferent to the fact that Hungary's president is in fact the most despised leader in the European Union, an open Putin ally, and the most active obstacle to EU and NATO unity. As for Orbán's \"strongman\" style of leadership, Trump agrees: \"He's a tough person, smart.\"\n\nThe president's assumption here is that, because these leaders are strong, because he likes them and they like him, and because they get along, they can do deals together. He can get them to do things by dint of their friendship-things that other presidents cannot.\n\nThis is Trump's delusion. First, they are not really friends; he thinks they're showing him respect, when in fact they're only pushing his buttons, having learned from his previous four years in the White House that he'll treat them well, or at least won't treat them harshly, if they pretend to show him respect. ( \"I like people who like me,\" Trump once said, in effect showing foreign leaders the way to his appeasement.)\n\nSecond, he doesn't understand that most leaders act in accordance with their interests, which are often quite different from-in some cases, antithetical to-U.S. interests. He doesn't quite grasp this essential fact of international politics because he doesn't quite grasp what U.S. interests are -except where they coincide with his own business interests.\n\nThe fact is, in his first term, Trump's overtures to dictators yielded no benefits to the United States. At a joint news conference with Putin in Helsinki, Trump said he trusted the Russian president's assurances more than his own intelligence analysts when it came to the question of whether the Kremlin tried to influence the U.S. elections-yet, despite that and other instances of kowtowing, he got nothing from Putin, either at the Finland summit or throughout his four years in office. Trump now says that Putin wouldn't have invaded Ukraine if he'd been president-but Putin did fight a war in Ukraine, starting in 2014 and continuing all through Trump's first term, with no hesitation. (That war was confined to eastern Ukraine's Donbas region, but it wasn't a mere border skirmish; more than 14,000 people were killed in the fighting, before the full invasion that began in February 2022.)\n\nIn any case, Putin has already rejected, as \"nothing of interest,\" the outlines of a plan that Trump put forth to end the war in Ukraine. Trump, who said he would make the war stop even before he took the oath of office, is finding that these things are harder to settle than they seem. Will he take revenge on Putin for betraying him? Since Trump seems genuinely reluctant to keep supplying Ukraine with billions of dollars' worth of weapons, it's unclear how. Putin doesn't seem fearful.\n\nIn the same way, Trump held two summits with Kim in his first term-beaming about their friendship before, during, and after, even boasting at one rally that the two \"fell in love\" after an exchange of \"love letters \"-yet, again, came away with nothing. This was because Kim had no interest in revealing the size and location of his nuclear arsenal, much less pledging to dismantle it. At one point in their meetings, Trump showed Kim a slideshow on how he could turn the North Korean coastline into lucrative beach-resort property -as if Kim had the slightest interest in such a scheme.\n\nAt least Trump has no illusion that Xi might accede to fairer trade practices on the basis of some camaraderie. But he does seem to believe that punishing tariffs-or the threat thereof-would force Xi to cave in. Trump doesn't seem to realize that Xi has readied his own set of responses , mainly involving the rupturing of U.S. and Western supply chains, many of which still involve China. Xi calculates that, given the Chinese Communist Party's control over his country's economy (and his own personal control of the CCP), he can hold out longer than Trump in this sort of asymmetric trade war.\n\nOrbán is one authoritarian leader who may be sincere in his desire for warm relations with the new American president. He faces challenges from within the EU. The European leaders know they have to please Trump, at least to some extent, dependent as they are on the U.S. for security (through NATO, which is U.S.-led) and economic stability (through the dollar and the international financial system). So, to appease the American president, Orbán may believe he could pressure the Europeans to ease up on any penalties they might inflict on Hungary. The only problem is that Hungary has very little to offer the United States in exchange, except for deeper association with Europe's least democratic regime.\n\nIt is a mystery to many why Trump behaves so deferentially to tyrants. Some believe that Putin must have a hold on him-money, blackmail, something. Whether or not this is true, Trump would very likely treat Putin the way he's treated him all these years because, at bottom, Trump respects people with ultimate power. More than that, he envies them.\n\nIn a Fox News interview in 2018, Trump said of North Korea's Kim, just after the two had their first summit, \"He's the head of a country, and I mean he's the strong head. ... He speaks and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same.\"\n\nSimilarly, just this past October, right before the election, in an interview with Joe Rogan , Trump called China's Xi \"a brilliant guy. He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. I mean, he's a brilliant guy, whether you like it or not\"-the suggestion being that controlling so many people with an iron fist is an impressive thing, which only a brilliant guy could pull off.\n\nAs many have recognized, though Trump has a keen sense of populist politics, he has no deep attachment to democratic institutions. He doesn't recognize, though he soon may, that this simpatico relationship with tyrannical leaders earns him no favors in return.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Trump says 30-day ceasefire 'would have been tough' after high-stakes call with Putin\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expresses \"skepticism\" after the call.\n\nPresident Donald Trump held a high-stakes call with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday as the United States seeks a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nA White House readout of the call said Putin supports Trump's idea for a mutual pause on energy infrastructure attacks -- but did not include a commitment to the 30-day truce accepted by Ukraine last week despite Trump's optimism in recent days that Moscow would go along.\n\n\"Both leaders agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace,\" the White House said of the Trump-Putin call. \"They also stressed the need for improved bilateral relations between the United States and Russia. The blood and treasure that both Ukraine and Russia have been spending in this war would be better spent on the needs of their people.\"\n\nHours after the call, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff touted the progress the White House believes it has made in negotiations with Russia and said talks are set to begin Sunday in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe negotiations, which will take place in Jeddah, will be led by U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Witkoff said in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity.\n\nWitkoff said he held more than seven hours of meetings with Putin in the days leading up to Trump's call with the Russian leader on Tuesday, which included discussions around halting attacks on energy infrastructure and efforts to do the same in the Black Sea, which Witkoff suggested has potentially laid the groundwork for a full ceasefire.\n\n\"I think the devil is in the details,\" Witkoff said. \"We've got a team going to Saudi Arabia led by our national security advisor and our secretary of state. And I think we've got to figure out those details. The point is that up until recently we really didn't have consensus around these aspects: The energy and infrastructure ceasefire and the Black Sea moratorium on firing. Today we got to that place, and I think it's a relatively short distance to a full cease-fire from there.\"\n\nAfter the call, Trump conceded the 30-day ceasefire sought by Ukraine \"would have been tough\" in a released clip of a pre-taped interview on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle,\" which aired in full Tuesday night.\n\n\"Right now, you have a lot of guns pointing at each other. And the ceasefire, without going a little bit further, would have been tough,\" Trump said. \"I think we had a great call. ... Talked about a lot of things and toward getting it to peace. And we talked about other things also.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a news conference following Tuesday's developments, said he had \"skepticism\" but that \"if there is a partial ceasefire, this is a positive result.\"\n\nThe White House statement on the call said: \"This conflict should never have started and should have been ended long ago with sincere and good faith peace efforts. The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.\"\n\nTrump, in his own social media post later Tuesday, called the hourslong conversation \"very good and productive.\"\n\n\"We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump and Putin also spoke about the Middle East more broadly, including Iran, the White House said.\n\n\"The two leaders agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside,\" the readout stated. \"This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.\"\n\nAccording to Russian state media, the Kremlin said Putin \"supported\" Trump's idea of a 30-day halt on attacking energy infrastructure in Russia and Ukraine.\n\nBut in terms of Trump's proposal for a broader monthlong truce, the Kremlin readout said that \"the Russian side has identified a number of significant issues related to ensuring effective control over a possible ceasefire along the entire line of contact, the need to stop forced mobilization in Ukraine and the rearmament of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe Kremlin also said Putin believed a condition for ending the war should include a \"complete cessation\" of foreign military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv.\n\nThe Trump administration took drastic steps in stopping military aid and pausing some intelligence sharing with Ukraine after the Oval Office clash between Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Those two tools were resumed after Ukraine agreed to the 30-day ceasefire last Tuesday.\n\nUkraine has said it would need to approve any agreement.\n\nZelenskyy was asked by ABC News Chief International Correspondent James Longman during his news conference on Tuesday if he'd commit to an energy ceasefire and what he thought about Trump and Putin's relationship.\n\n\"It's hard to tell. It's hard to give an answer to the question in terms of the relationship between Trump and Putin,\" Zelenskyy responded. \"I count on having a conversation with President Trump. We will understand the details. We have always supported the ceasefire position and not to use any weapons against the energy infrastructure, and also we have supported the position of not to attack the naval corridors.\"\n\n\"These were our proposals and we will support any proposals that would lead to stable and fair peace,\" he added. \"But for that we would need to understand what we are talking about, what are the details and hopefully we will learn all those details so that the partners would be telling to us. Because there's two parties in this war, Russia and Ukraine, so without Ukraine I think many negotiations without Ukraine would not result in any help.\"\n\nABC News' Ellie Kaufman, Tanya Stuaklova, Michelle Stoddart and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Trump-Putin call poses choice of sanctions or 'escalation,' analysts say\n\nThe president has threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia.\n\nLONDON -- Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are expected to speak on Tuesday as the White House continues its campaign for a ceasefire and eventual peace deal to end Russia's devastating war on Ukraine.\n\n\"It's a bad situation in Russia, and it's a bad situation in Ukraine,\" Trump said on Monday. \"What's happening in Ukraine is not good, but we're going to see if we can work a peace agreement, a ceasefire and peace, and I think we'll be able to do it.\"\n\nSince Trump's return to the White House in January, his new administration has sought to bring an end to Russia's war by berating and pressuring Kyiv . Trump has repeatedly said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zeleneskyy \"does not have the cards\" to come out on top of the negotiations.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has been offered normalization and hinting at territorial gains and sanctions relief.\n\nThus far, the carrot has been for Russia and the stick for Ukraine.\n\nThere remains only a slight indication of what concessions Trump is seeking from Russia. \"When we talk about leverage, it suggests that he wants to use this leverage to get some concessions from Russia,\" Oleg Ignatov, the International Crisis Group think tank's senior Russia analysts, told ABC News.\n\n\"But is he really interested in serious concessions from Russia or not?\"\n\nThe president has hinted at ramping up pressure on the Kremlin if it fails to commit to peace talks. \"There are things you could do that wouldn't be pleasant in a financial sense,\" he said last week.\n\n\"I can do things financially that would be very bad for Russia,\" Trump added. \"I don't want to do that because I want to get peace.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED.\"\n\nThe implementation of tariffs -- a cornerstone of Trumpian foreign and economic policy -- would be only a symbolic measure, given that Russian exports to the U.S. have fallen to their lowest level since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn a possible preview of things to come, the White House has already expanded the unprecedented sanctions campaign kicked off by former President Joe Biden in 2022.\n\nThis month, the administration said Russians were among 43 nationalities being considered for travel bans. It also allowed to lapse a sanctions exemption allowing Russian banks to use U.S. payment systems for energy transactions.\n\nTrump may seek to further tighten the screws on Russia's economy, in which inflation is rising and dollars are increasingly difficult and expensive to access.\n\n\"What the U.S. can do is put even more pressure on the Russian financing sector, increasing the sanctions against banks that that basically also have a stake in the oil and gas sector in order to compromise the financial sustainability of the Russian Federation and make it basically unsustainable for Russia to continue the war,\" Federico Borsari of the Center for European Policy Analysis think tank told ABC News.\n\nThe U.S. may also seek further action to identify and penalize vessels in Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet,\" by which Moscow has been able to continue exporting its fossil fuels and avoid sanctions, Borsari added.\n\nStill, Russia has shown an ability to adapt to and skirt sanctions, even if the measures have undermined the national economy. The impact of new sanctions may not be immediate enough to force Putin to the negotiating table, Ignatov said.\n\nSeeking to further curtail Russia's energy exports or expanding secondary sanctions -- meaning measures against those still doing business with sanctioned entities -- may also bring the U.S. into conflict with key Russian customers like China and India.\n\n\"There is no magic bullet in terms of sanctions,\" Ignatov said.\n\nTrump has praised Putin's supposed readiness for peace, instead framing Ukraine and Zelenskyy as the main impediments to a deal. Still, Moscow has shown no sign of downgrading its war goals, which still include the annexation of swaths of its neighbor, the \"demilitarization\" of Ukraine and its permanent exclusion from NATO.\n\nPutin was non-committal to last week's U.S.-Ukraine proposal of a 30-day ceasefire. Moscow is \"for\" the pause, the president said, but framed any pause as a military benefit for Kyiv and said several difficult conditions would need to be fulfilled before the Kremlin would give its full support.\n\nRussia \"needs\" a pause in the fighting to reform its own shattered military, Pavel Luzin -- a Russian political analyst at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy -- told ABC News. \"But at the same time, Russia does not have desirable conditions on the battlefield.\"\n\n\"What Russia has been trying to do since the fall of 2022 is defeat a big group of Ukrainian forces as a pre-condition for negotiations about a break,\" he added. \"Russia wanted to demoralize the Ukrainian leadership and society. After two-and-a-half years, Russia was not successful.\"\n\nIgnatov said Moscow's recent engagement with the Trump administration does suggest an appetite for some kind of deal.\n\n\"I think both Russia and the U.S. are looking at this negotiation seriously,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean that both sides are thinking about any good deal for Ukraine, but I think that both sides want to finish this conflict.\"\n\nThe Russians, he added, \"want to avoid a direct confrontation with Trump, because they really value this process of normalization. I think what they tried to do is to decouple Ukraine from the normalization of the other issues. Even if they don't succeed on Ukraine, they want to continue to work on other issues.\"\n\nStill, Moscow is \"not ready to sacrifice their interests\" in Ukraine, Ignatov continued. \"They are not ready to make very big concessions -- serious concessions, to leave territories or something like this.\"\n\nTrump's radical pivot away from Ukraine in the opening months of his second term left Kyiv and its other foreign partners reeling. Though the pause to U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing was brief, it rattled leaders and commanders in Kyiv.\n\n\"We consider this turbulence to be part of negotiations, which I think was quite often used by Trump in his past when he was in business,\" Yehor Cherniev -- a member of the Ukrainian Parliament and the chairman of his country's delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly -- told ABC News. \"So, we understand.\"\n\nTrump's inherent unpredictability has given Ukrainians hope that his interactions with Putin may not necessarily play in Russia's favor.\n\n\"Trump should say directly: 'Vladimir, if you don't agree unconditionally to my proposal then I'll have to make a deal with a new leader of Russia instead of you,'\" Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee, told ABC News. \"If he tried it with Zelenskyy, then why not with Putin?\"\n\nA threat to expand American military aid to Ukraine could give such coercion bite, analysts and Ukrainian lawmakers who spoke with ABC News said.\n\nLifting restrictions on U.S. weapon use inside Russia, requesting more military aid funding from Congress, replenishing supplies of long-range ATACMS missiles and delivering new long-range strike weapons like the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile could all underscore the U.S. demand for Russia to negotiate.\n\nBut such steps would run counter to Trump's repeated statements that the war must end as soon as possible -- with or without American involvement.\n\n\"I'm not sure if he has any desire to escalate the war, because he's the 'peace president,'\" Ignatov said, noting that any request for more funding from Congress could also touch off unwelcome domestic political disputes.\n\n\"He's said that if we are not able to succeed, the U.S. will be out of the war,\" Ignatov added. \"So, it means that he is not going to escalate.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen if Trump's ambition for a deal will be enough to overcome the decades-long complexity of Russia's aggression against its \"brotherly nation,\" as Putin was still describing Ukraine months into the 2022 full-scale invasion.\n\n\"The Russians have quite clearly showed already that they are not ready,\" Cherniev said. \"Now there are not so many options for Trump's administration.\"\n\n\"Trump wants to be a peacemaker,\" he added. \"If he just leaves these negotiations, that will mean that Putin wins. And I doubt that Trump will allow Putin to win.\"\n\nTrump's turn against Ukraine begun to erode the trust built up by decades of American backing. But for now, at least, some hope remains.\n\nThe president \"might\" ultimately side with Moscow, Merezhko said. \"But that goes against American values -- Americans and public opinion in the U.S. have always been on the side of the underdogs.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II,\" he added.\n\nTrump seemed to be referring to the sticking point in Russia's Kursk region, something Putin has discussed as an issue in the talks. He also appeared to echo remarks Putin made in response to the U.S.-Ukraine ceasefire proposal on Thursday that Ukrainian troops are encircled in Kursk -- a scenario Ukraine strongly denied.\n\nPutin responded to Trump's remarks on Friday, saying the soldiers need to surrender to be spared.\n\n\"[In] the event of a ceasefire and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and a worthy treatment in accordance with the norms of international law and the laws of the Russian Federation,\" he said.\n\nUkraine pushed back Friday against the claims that its troops are surrounded in the Kursk region, where Putin this week ordered forces to \"destroy\" all Ukrainian formations remaining in the contested border region.\n\n\"The reports about the supposed 'encirclement' of Ukrainian units in the Kursk region are false and are being fabricated by the Russians for political purposes and to put pressure on Ukraine and its partners,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said in a statement on Friday.\n\n\"The threat of encirclement of our units is absent,\" it added.\n\nThe statement comes a day after Putin referred to an \"encirclement\" in the Kursk region while remarking on the U.S.-Ukraine ceasefire proposal.\n\n\"We are for it. But there is a nuance,\" Putin said of a 30-day ceasefire during a press briefing. \"First, what are we going to do with the encirclement in the Kursk region?\"\n\nHe said the situation in Kursk is \"completely under our control, and the group that invaded our territory is in isolation,\" and that it would be \"very good for the Ukrainian side to reach a truce for at least 30 days.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy countered Friday that Putin is \"lying\" about the conflict and is blocking any diplomatic efforts to end the war.\n\n\"Putin is lying about the real situation on the battlefield, he is lying about the casualties, he is lying about the true state of his economy, which has been damaged by his foolish imperial ambitions, and he is doing everything possible to ensure that diplomacy fails,\" he said.\n\n\"Putin cannot exit this war because that would leave him with nothing,\" he continued. \"That is why he is now doing everything he can to sabotage diplomacy by setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions right from the start even before a ceasefire.\"\n\nThe claim that Ukrainian forces are surrounded was also shot down by defense analyst Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment who focuses on the Russian and Ukrainian militaries, who called it \"simply untrue.\"\n\nGeorge Barros, the Russian team lead for the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War, also reacted on X to Trump's remarks, saying, \"Available evidence from the battlefield does not indicate any Russian encirclements of Ukrainian forces at scale, and certainly not by the thousands.\"\n\nUkrainian forces pushed into Kursk last August in a surprise offensive, seizing the town of Sudzha and surrounding villages.

This week, Ukraine and the U.S. agreed to a potential 30-day ceasefire , with American representatives also putting the proposal to a non-committal Kremlin.\n\nRussian officials have indicated that they will not engage in peace negotiations while any of Kursk remains under Ukrainian control. Kyiv had hoped to use its occupation of the territory as leverage in talks, though its footprint there is now rapidly shrinking.\n\nOn Wednesday, Putin said he will give \"special thought in the future to creating a security zone along the state border\" to prevent repeat Ukrainian incursions. Prisoners taken on Russian territory would be treated \"as terrorists,\" Putin said, adding that \"foreign mercenaries\" are not protected under the Geneva Conventions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is expected in Moscow this week as the administration pushes for a ceasefire and broader peace deal. The ball is now \"truly in their court,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said of Russia following the U.S.-Ukrainian agreement to a 30-day ceasefire proposal.\n\nThe Kremlin was non-committal. Officials were \"scrutinizing\" the publicly released statements, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. Russia, he added, \"doesn't want to get ahead of itself\" on the potential ceasefire.\n\nOn Thursday, Peskov confirmed that American negotiators are traveling to Moscow. \"Contacts are planned,\" Peskov told a press briefing, adding of the potential outcomes, \"We will not prejudge, we will tell you later.\" Peskov did not say whether Witkoff would meet with Putin.\n\nTrump's push for peace -- which has been twinned with fierce public criticism of Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- has been welcomed by America's allies, though leaders have been perturbed by the president's apparent alignment with Russia's false narratives about the conflict.\n\nRubio will meet with G7 foreign ministers in Quebec, Canada, on Thursday. His presence at the meeting will also be overshadowed by Trump's spiralling trade war with America's northern neighbor, plus the president's repeated suggestion that Canada be absorbed by the U.S. and become its 51st state.\n\nThe G7 event \"is not a meeting about how we're going to take over Canada,\" Rubio said Wednesday, as quoted by the Associated Press.\n\nCanadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly, though, said that \"in every single meeting, I will raise the issue of tariffs to coordinate a response with the Europeans and to put pressure on the Americans.\"\n\n\"The only constant in this unjustifiable trade war seems to be President Trump's talk of annexing our country through economic coercion,\" Joly said. \"Yesterday, he called our border a fictional line and repeated his disrespectful 51st state rhetoric.\"\n\nABC News' Tanya Stukalova, Patrick Reevell and Will Gretsky contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Putin 'prolonging' Ukraine war, Zelenskyy says after Trump peace appeal\n\nThe Kremlin has been non-committal on the 30-day ceasefire proposed by the U.S.\n\nLONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of \"prolonging the war\" and \"ignoring\" U.S.-led efforts to agree to a ceasefire, as a first step toward ending Moscow's three-year-old invasion of its neighbor.\n\nRecent weeks have seen Kyiv and Moscow frame each other as the main impediment to peace, maneuvering to win backing from President Donald Trump as the White House presses for an end to the conflict.\n\nZelenskyy on Saturday reported a massing of Russian troops along the border with Ukraine's eastern Sumy region. \"This indicates an intention to attack,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We are aware of this, and will counter it. I would like all partners to understand exactly what Putin is planning, what he is preparing for and what he will be ignoring.\"\n\n\"The buildup of Russian forces indicates that Moscow intends to keep ignoring diplomacy,\" the Ukrainian leader wrote on social media. \"It is clear that Russia is prolonging the war. We are ready to provide our partners with all the real information on the situation at the front, in the Kursk region and along our border.\"\n\nFierce fighting and long-range strikes continued despite the U.S. peace push. Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 90 attack drones into the country on Saturday night. Forty-seven were shot down with 33 lost in flight, the air force said. \"The Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odessa regions were affected by the Russian attack,\" it added.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said its forces shot down 31 Ukrainian drones over four Russian regions.\n\nLast week, Ukrainian and U.S. negotiators agreed to a 30-day ceasefire. Moscow was non-committal, Putin saying he was \"for\" the agreement but setting out additional conditions for its implementation.\n\nIn Russia's western Kursk region -- where Ukrainian forces seized ground in a surprise August 2024 offensive -- Moscow is seeking to cut off and destroy Kyiv's troops. Russian officials have said no peace deal is possible until Kursk is recaptured.\n\nThe fighting in the border region prompted Trump to warn of \"a horrible massacre,\" adding he had asked Putin to spare the lives of the Ukrainian soldiers still fighting there.\n\nZelenskyy, his officials and commanders denied the suggestion that Ukrainian troops were cut off.\n\n\"Our troops continue to hold back Russian and North Korean groupings in the Kursk region,\" Zelenskyy wrote on social media on Saturday. \"There is no encirclement of our troops.\"\n\nTrump last week touted \"very good and productive\" discussions between the U.S. and Russia, for which Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff traveled to Moscow and met with Putin. There is, Trump said, a \"very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio spoke by phone with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Saturday, according to a State Department readout. The two officials \"discussed next steps to follow up on recent meetings in Saudi Arabia and agreed to continue working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia,\" the statement said.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Russia is willing to downgrade its long-held maximalist war goals. Trump has threatened to impose new sanctions and tariffs on Moscow if the Kremlin does not show a willingness to pursue a peace deal.\n\nYuri Ushakov, a senior foreign policy aide to Putin, said in an interview with state television aired on Sunday that Moscow views the proposed 30-day ceasefire an \"an attempt to give a break to Ukrainian troops who are now enduring difficult times.\"\n\n\"Russian troops are on the offensive on all fronts,\" Ushakov said in comments that appear to have been recorded on Thursday when Witkoff was in Moscow. \"And in this situation, we can view it as a sort of attempt to give time to Ukrainian troops time to rearm and regroup.\"\n\nUkraine, meanwhile, appears to have somewhat repaired ties with the White House after a month of tensions culminated in a brief U.S. freeze on military aid and intelligence sharing.\n\nStill, Zelenskyy has repeatedly stressed the need for lasting Western security guarantees backed by the U.S. -- a commitment the Trump administration has so far dodged.\n\n\"Peace will be more reliable with the presence of European contingents on the ground, supported by the American side,\" Zelenskyy wrote on social media on Saturday.\n\nThe Kremlin has dismissed the proposal, a stance Zelenskyy suggested should be ignored.\n\n\"It is also a very bad signal to listen to the opinion of the Russians regarding the contingent,\" the president wrote. \"The contingent should be stationed on Ukrainian soil. This is a guarantee of security for Ukraine and for Europe.\"\n\n\"If Putin wants to introduce some foreign contingent into the territory of Russia, that is his business,\" he added. \"But it is not his business to decide something about the security of Ukraine and Europe.\"\n\nABC News' Patrick Reevell contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Trump envoy Witkoff sparks outcry after backing Kremlin talking points on Ukraine\n\n\"I don't regard Putin as a bad guy,\" Steve Witkoff told Tucker Carlson.\n\nSteve Witkoff, President Donald Trump's special envoy and lead negotiator tasked with ending the war in Ukraine, has attracted criticism in Europe and Ukraine after an interview where he appeared to back a number of well-known Kremlin talking points on the conflict.\n\nThe comments, in which Witkoff seemed to accept the results of sham referenda Russia has previously held in Ukraine to justify its seizure of land there -- including Crimea, will likely feed fears among European allies that the Trump administration is leaning too far toward the Kremlin's vision.\n\nIn the interview for \"The Tucker Carlson Show,\" posted online on Friday, Witkoff talked about his efforts to negotiate with President Vladimir Putin, speaking warmly of the Russian leader. Witkoff said he believed the heart of the conflict was Russia's desire to control four regions of Ukraine it partially occupied and has claimed annexed since 2022: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.\n\nTalking about Putin's claims to the regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, Witkoff suggested Russia had a right to them because they were majority Russian-speaking and repeated a false Kremlin claim that fair referenda there showed residents wanted to be absorbed by Russia.\n\n\"They are Russian-speaking, and there have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule,\" Witkoff told Carlson.\n\nHowever, Witkoff did not acknowledge that the supposed referenda held in those territories -- whether in 2014 in the case of Crimea or 2022 in the other regions -- were widely dismissed by Western powers, human rights organizations and international bodies as fraudulent and illegitimate.\n\nRussia conducted referenda in the areas it occupied in Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in the fall of 2022, several months after seizing them with its full-scale invasion launched in February that year. Putin used the referenda to justify Russia's subsequent annexation of the regions. Russia also held a similar referendum in Crimea in 2014 following its occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula.\n\nThe referenda were staged after Russia's invasion had already forced hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to flee, and while Russian security forces were abducting and torturing anyone expressing opposition to its takeover. In some areas, Russian soldiers were filmed accompanying vote collectors as they went from house to house.\n\nNo legitimate independent international observers monitored the referenda and they were widely dismissed as shams, including by the United States. The United Nations General Assembly rejected the referenda as illegal and violating the U.N. Charter.\n\nIn September 2022, then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. \"does not, and will never, recognize any of the Kremlin's claims to sovereignty over parts of Ukraine that it's seized by force and now purports to incorporate into Russia.\"\n\nWitkoff made the remarks on the Russian referenda a day before a new round of talks between the U.S. and Russia in Saudi Arabia aimed at trying to make progress toward ending the war. His portrayal of the referenda as legitimate triggered some fierce criticism in Europe.\n\n\"Witkoff's repeating of Kremlin lies about 'russian-speakers' [sic] wanting to 'join Russia' is truly chilling,\" Lithuania's former foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, wrote on X. \"Hearing Americans talk like this should be an electric shock for Europe, not a wakeup call.\"\n\nSome Ukrainian members of parliament also condemned Witkoff's comments.\n\nOleksandr Merezhko, head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that the statements were \"shocking.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what this is about -- ignorance, naivety, unprofessionalism?\" said Merezhko, who suggested Witkoff should be removed from his negotiating role. \"Because we are talking about a representative of the president, who should professionally understand this issue and know some basic things. And he doesn't know this. He is relaying Russian propaganda.\"\n\nIn the interview with Carlson, Witkoff appeared to struggle to remember the names of the Ukrainian regions. \"Donbas, Crimea. You know the names,\" he told the conservative media personality, who prompted him to say \"Lugansk\" -- the Russian transliteration for Luhansk. \"Lugansk, and there's two others,\" Witkoff replied.\n\nAlthough Putin declared he had annexed the four regions, his troops still do not fully control most of the area. Much of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, including their regional capitals, remain unoccupied.\n\nA wealthy real estate developer, Witkoff has emerged as the lead negotiator for Trump's effort to end the war, twice now traveling to Moscow, where he has said he spent several hours talking with Putin.\n\nIn his interview on Carlson, Witkoff was effusive in his praise for Putin, calling him a \"very smart guy\" and noting Putin told him he had prayed for Trump after the assassination attempt against him during last year's presidential campaign. Witkoff added that Putin had given him a portrait of Trump which he says the Russian leader had commissioned from a famous Russian artist.\n\n\"This is the kind of connection that we've been able to reestablish through a simple word called communication, which many people would say I shouldn't have had because Putin is a bad guy. I don't regard Putin as a bad guy,\" Witkoff said.\n\nWitkoff also told Carlson he believed Russia \"does not need to absorb Ukraine,\" saying, \"They've gotten what they want. So why do they need more?\" He also said he \"100%\" believes Russia does not want to invade Europe, saying he took Putin \"at his word\" on that.\n\nWitkoff also repeated an unsupported claim made by Putin that Russian forces have surrounded a significant number of Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk region. Although Ukraine was forced to retreat from Kursk earlier this month, no evidence has emerged to suggest many Ukrainian soldiers are encircled, and both independent researchers and Ukrainian officials have said it is false.\n\n\"Witkoff uncritically amplified a number of Russian demands, claims and justifications,\" the Washington D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) wrote.\n\nWitkoff's comments could feed deep unease in Europe that the Trump administration, which is moving fast to restore relations with Russia, is more aligned with the Kremlin than NATO allies over the war in Ukraine. European officials and observers have also warned the administration, in its hurry to reach a deal, is vulnerable to manipulation by Putin.\n\nThe White House has argued its reengagement with Russia brings peace closer, but critics point out that the Kremlin has, so far, yet to make any significant concessions. Trump has claimed he isn't \"aligned\" with Putin. \"I'm not aligned with Putin. I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the United States of America, and for the good of the world,\" Trump said last month.\n\nVice President JD Vance on Monday defended Witkoff, writing on X he was doing an \"incredible job.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Putin just called Trump's bluff on Ukraine, with the Russian art of the 'no' deal\n\nFollow:\n\nA \"no\" is not a \"yes\" when it is a \"maybe,\" a \"probably not,\" or an \"only if.\"\n\nThis is the painfully predictable lesson the Trump administration's first real foray into wartime diplomacy with the Kremlin has dealt. They've been hopelessly bluffed.\n\nThey asked for a 30-day, frontline-wide ceasefire, without conditions. On Tuesday, they got  - after a theatrical week-long wait and hundreds more lives lost - a relatively small prisoner swap, hockey matches, more talks, and - per the Kremlin readout - a month-long mutual pause on attacks against \"energy infrastructure.\"\n\nThis last phrase is where an easily avoidable technical minefield begins. Per US President Donald Trump's post and that of his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, the agreement concerned \"energy and infrastructure.\" These are two entirely different sets of ideas.\n\nRussia says it will not attack Ukraine's electricity grids and gas supplies, as it has mercilessly over the past years, to the extent that Ukraine's winters have always been a dicey dance with icy families and reserve power sources. The White House, confusingly - in a disagreement, typo or translation nuance - has extended this truce to potentially every part of Ukraine that is considered infrastructure: bridges, perhaps key roads, or ports, or railways. It has created conditions that are almost impossible for Russia's relentless pace of air assaults - which resumed, as they do every night, on Tuesday night - to adhere to.\n\nArguably, with summer close and the urgent need for Ukrainians to have heating reduced, Moscow ceasing energy infrastructure attacks is less of a concession. For Kyiv, however, the demand they stop hitting Russia's energy infrastructure removes one of the most potent forms of attack Ukraine has. For months they have used long-range drones and missiles to strike Russia's oil refineries and pipelines, causing serious damage to the Kremlin's main fundraising tool: the export of its hydrocarbons, principally to China and India. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared amenable to the idea of a pause Tuesday, but said he still needed to know the \"details.\"\n\nIt is important to emphasize that Trump's long-heralded call with Russian President Vladimir Putin yielded almost nothing bar the predictable fact that the Kremlin head feels he can outmaneuver his counterpart effortlessly. The swap of 175 prisoners and return of 23 seriously wounded Ukrainians is a minor arrangement, and smacks of something already in the works, given the frequency of similar past swaps and the fact it is due to happen as quickly as Wednesday.\n\nOutside of this and the pause in attacks (whichever ones they agreed), Russia used this week-long delay and phone call to emphasize it wants all foreign aid and intelligence sharing halted as part of a deal and a series of \"working groups\" on Ukraine and Russia-US relations established. \"Working groups\" is a Russian diplomatic euphemism for fervid disinterest. Putin evidenced as much by apparently executing a pause in energy attacks immediately, but leaving all the stuff he didn't want to do to another set of meetings at an undefined time. Putin seems set on returning to the idea that all aid to Ukraine be stopped, something which Trump has already done once, for about a week. It will return to their conversation again.\n\nRelated live-story Putin agrees to pause attacks on some Ukraine targets after Trump call\n\nSome of these technical traps were laid by the basic nature of the initial Jeddah statement by the US and Ukraine. It was admirable but wildly simplistic to demand an immediate month-long stop to all hostilities in a three-year savage war. The proposal did not take into account how long such a step would take to enact with soldiers often cut off from their command, and made no mention of who would monitor adherence to it.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested \"satellites\" could provide all the surveillance needed. That is almost certainly true, but as an idea it assumes Moscow would be happy with the United States poring over its front-line positions in great detail and being the arbiter of who violated what. A cynic might say the Jeddah proposal was geared to pander to Trump's simplistic, yet desirable, demand for immediate peace, but also allow Moscow's customary and pedantic search for loopholes to get ensnared on its lack of technicalities. And Putin immediately sought to dangle the deal's feet into these plentiful weeds.\n\nUltimately, the Kremlin did not seek to discuss \"nuances\" - the finer points, for example, of whether the OSCE or the UN would police the front line - but instead offered as few concessions as it could without providing Trump with a flat \"no.\"\n\nBut a flat \"no\" is what Trump has received. It is packaged as a \"partial ceasefire,\" but that is simply the first phase of Russia renewing its decade-long deceptive diplomacy. They have agreed to a pause in attacks that - largely from now on - will damage Moscow's bank balance. Indeed, the initial and amateur confusion over what was agreed has opened a chasm in any future peace deal wide enough for Putin to drive another full-scale invasion through. Did both sides not set staffers aside after the call to prepare an identical readout of what was agreed?\n\nThe vaudeville theater of the past month should provide little comfort that the war is suddenly headed toward peace. Yes, the Trump administration has talked peace in a way that nobody has done so far in this war. But they have also managed to confirm, in short shrift, that Moscow looks for cracks of weakness and mercilessly drives a tank through them.\n\nRelated article Trump's dream of peace in Ukraine now must meet Russian reality\n\nTrump felt he could either persuade, coax, or outsmart Putin. He has yet to do any of that. He has palpably lost in their first direct diplomatic face-off. For millions of Ukrainians his next choice defines their lives. Does he lose interest, apply pressure, or again provide concessions? It is a dizzying prospect.\n\nHis adversary is focused not on improved relations with Russia's decades-long adversary, the United States, or with its current president, Donald Trump, but instead on victory in its most existential conflict since the Nazis.\n\nThese are not two similar perspectives to the deal. The art of one is more applied than the other.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

At the time, Putin demanded that Ukraine never be allowed into NATO, and that the bloc roll back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe - which the US and its allies dismissed as non-starters, condemning the invasion as a blatant land grab.\n\nPutin also suggested that Ukraine halt mobilization and any training of its troops, and that other nations stop supplying weapons to Kyiv during the ceasefire - at a time when \"Russian troops are advancing on almost all areas of combat contact.\"\n\nThough the US idea is \"great and correct,\" many things still need to be discussed, he said, adding that \"maybe\" he would call US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe news conference came as American special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow to brief Kremlin officials on the peace plan. Ukrainian officials had accepted the US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire covering the entire front line after holding talks with US counterparts in Saudi Arabia earlier this week.\n\nWitkoff met with Putin in Moscow late Thursday night, two Trump administration officials told CNN. The meeting lasted several hours and stretched into early Friday morning, the officials said. Witkoff left Russia shortly after the meeting wrapped.\n\nThe officials provided no detail on the substance of the meeting. However, Trump national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News' Sean Hannity that \"We do have some cautious optimism.\" The interview took place after the meeting between Witkoff and Putin ended.\n\nPutin sent \"additional signals\" to Trump through Witkoff, the Kremlin said on Friday. \"Additional information was provided to the Russian side. Putin also passed information and additional signals to President Trump through Witkoff,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a conference call.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin's Thursday comments quickly drew condemnation from Kyiv, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accusing the Russian leader of dragging out the negotiations rather than rejecting the deal completely.\n\n\"Putin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians,\" he said, criticizing Putin's response as \"very manipulative.\"\n\nLater on Thursday, Trump called Putin's response \"promising\" but not complete.\n\n\"I'd love to meet with them or talk to him, but we have to get it over with fast. You know, every day, people are being killed,\" he said in the Oval Office, adding that it will be a \"very disappointing moment for the world\" if Russia does not agree to the ceasefire.\n\nHe also said the US has been discussing with Ukraine what land would be kept and lost in any final deal. \"So, a lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed,\" he said.\n\nPutin raised a host of questions echoed by other Russian officials, some of whom took a stronger stance against the proposed ceasefire.\n\nThe concerns Putin raised included what would happen in Russia's western Kursk region, where Ukraine occupies some territory; how the ceasefire would be verified; and how Kyiv would use the 30-day truce.\n\n\"What will we do with this area in the Kursk region - if we stop military actions for 30 days, does this mean that everyone who is there will leave without a fight? Should we release them from there after they have committed a lot of crimes against civilians?\" Putin said, though he'd also said earlier that Kursk was back under Russian control and Ukrainian troops were \"completely isolated.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Kremlin aide Yuriy Ushakov said Moscow doesn't want a temporary ceasefire, claiming it would give a break to the Ukrainian army. Ushakov said he explained Russia's stance to US National Security Adviser Michael Waltz in a Wednesday phone call.\n\n\"(I) outlined our position that this is nothing more than a temporary respite for the Ukrainian military and nothing more,\" Ushakov said in an interview with Russian state media, pouring cold water on the proposal before Thursday's talks began.\n\nRelated live-story Trump to meet NATO chief at White House as US works to secure Ukraine ceasefire deal\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quick to clarify that Ushakov's remarks should not be seen as a Russian rejection of the US proposal, and that Moscow was awaiting further information before making a decision.\n\nUshakov also claimed that \"the Americans and we think that there can be no talk about NATO in the context of the Ukrainian settlement and in the context of Ukraine's future.\"\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova went further, saying on Thursday there must not be \"any\" foreign military presence in Ukraine.\n\n\"For us, it is absolutely unacceptable to deploy units of the armed forces of other states in Ukraine under any flag, whether it be a foreign contingent, military bases, or some peacekeeping operations,\" Zakharova said, adding that Russia would respond with \"with all available means.\"\n\nWhen US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was asked Wednesday about the possibility of European troops acting as peacekeepers, the top US diplomat responded: \"There's different ways to construct a deterrent on the ground.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian military said Thursday it had recaptured Sudzha , the largest town that Ukraine once occupied in Kursk, threatening Kyiv's sole territorial bargaining chip amid pressure to negotiate an end to the war, in what would represent a symbolic victory for the Kremlin.\n\nThis story has been updated.

      "text": "Trump's foreign envoy touts Kremlin talking points, in interview that will alarm Europe\n\nFollow:\n\nUS President Donald Trump's foreign envoy praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, struggled to recall the names of four occupied Ukrainian regions, and echoed a swath of Kremlin talking points in a remarkable podcast interview that will alarm officials in Kyiv and the West.\n\nIn a long interview with podcast host Tucker Carlson, Witkoff - who revealed Russia's President Putin had commissioned a portrait of Trump and sent it to him - said the administration was making progress \"that no one thought was possible\" with Russia, but that issues of four captured territories still need ironing out and posed the biggest obstacle to resolving the conflict.\n\nThe four mainland regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson - were illegally annexed during Russia's full-scale invasion and Kyiv vehemently opposes giving them up, but Witkoff on several occasions implied that Russia had a right to capture the land.\n\nThe Kremlin has since staged referenda on joining Russia in those regions, which were widely dismissed as a sham by the international community, but which Witkoff claimed was evidence of their desire to split from Ukraine.\n\n\"They're Russian-speaking,\" Witkoff said of the four eastern regions. \"There have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule.\"\n\nRelated article For Vladimir Putin, Russia's position in the world is personal. Here's what he really wants\n\nCNN has previously reported that voting in the regions has been carried out at gunpoint, with one resident saying the results were a foregone conclusion.\n\n\"I think the largest issue in that conflict are these so-called four regions: Donbas, Crimea. You know the names,\" Witkoff said, seemingly unable to recall the territories. Carlson prompted him by saying \"Lugansk,\" the Russian transliteration for Luhansk, to which Witkoff replied: \"Lugansk, and there's two others.\"\n\nWitkoff said the \"constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede... with regard to territory\" had become \"the elephant in the room\" during negotiations. Talks are set to resume Monday in Saudi Arabia, with US officials set to meet officials from both Russia and Ukraine.\n\n\"The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. The question is: Will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?\" Witkoff asked. \"Can (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky survive politically if he acknowledges this? This is the central issue in the conflict.\"\n\nZelensky stressed last weekend that Ukraine's position \"is that we do not recognize the occupied Ukrainian territories as Russian.\"\n\nThe US raised the issue during talks with Ukrainian delegates in the Saudi city of Jeddah, Zelensky said, adding that he hopes the question can be resolved during later peace talks, rather than discussions over an initial ceasefire. \"It is dragging out the process for a long, long time,\" he said.\n\nWitkoff said he was impressed by how \"gracious\" the Russian leader has been during the pair's discussions, praising him as \"smart\" and \"straightforward.\"\n\nHe dismissed longstanding concerns across Europe that Putin would seek to invade further territory if given the opportunity. \"This sort of notion of we've all got to be like Winston Churchill, the Russians are gonna march across Europe. I think that's preposterous,\" he said. \"We have something called NATO that we did not have in World War II.\"\n\nAsked by Carlson whether he felt the Russians want to \"march across Europe,\" Witkoff replied: \"100% not.\"\n\nEuropean capitals have repeatedly stressed that Putin would not intend to stop his territorial ambitions at Ukraine, and those fears prompted Sweden and Finland to join NATO after Moscow's full-scale invasion.\n\nBefore meeting Putin in Moscow, Witkoff said someone in the Trump administration warned him to \"watch it, because he's an ex-KGB guy,\" referring to Putin's former career in the Soviet Union's security agency.\n\nWitkoff said he downplayed the person's fears, saying Putin's background in the agency was a measure of his intelligence. \"In the old days, the only people who went into the KGB were the smartest people in the nation... He's a super smart guy,\" he recalled saying.\n\nRelated article US looks to make headway on Trump's ceasefire hopes as Russia talks open in Saudi Arabia\n\n\"I don't regard Putin as a bad guy,\" Witkoff said, saying it was \"gracious\" of the Russian leader to receive him in Moscow for talks earlier this month.\n\nThat meeting \"got personal,\" he said, recalling how Putin \"had commissioned a beautiful portrait of President Trump from the leading Russian artist,\" which Witkoff took home to the president.\n\nWitkoff said also that, following the assassination attempt against Trump in September, Putin said that he \"went to his local church and met with his priest and prayed\" for Trump, \"not because he... could become the president of the United States, but because he had a friendship with him.\"\n\nTrump was \"clearly touched\" by Putin's story and the portrait, Witkoff said.\n\nWitkoff implied that resolving the war in Ukraine could lead to cooperation on a broader range of issues, and that the two sides were thinking about \"integrating their energy policies in the Arctic,\" sharing sea lanes, collaborating on artificial intelligence and sending liquefied natural gas \"into Europe together.\"\n\n\"Who doesn't want to have a world where Russia and the United States are doing, collaboratively, good things together?\" he asked.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "For Vladimir Putin, Russia's position in the world is personal. Here's what he really wants\n\nFollow:\n\nUS President Donald Trump said he thinks Vladimir Putin wants peace. Ukraine and its European allies don't believe he does, while the Russian leader himself said he wants peace but then refused to sign up to it when presented with the option.\n\nWhat Putin really wants, though, is much, much bigger.\n\nThe Russian president has made no secret of the fact that he believes Ukraine should not exist as an independent state and he has repeatedly said he wants NATO to shrink back to its Cold War-era size.\n\nBut more than anything, he wants to see a new global order - and he wants Russia to play the starring role in it.\n\nRelated article Ukraine port city 'on fire' after 'massive' Russian attack as Trump projects optimism ahead of peace talks\n\nPutin and several of his most trusted allies emerged from the remnants of the KGB, the Soviet-era intelligence agency. They have never forgotten the humiliation of the fall of the Soviet Union and are not happy with the way the world has turned out since then.\n\nPutin rose to power during the chaos of the 1990s, when the Russian economy collapsed and had to be rescued by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - another humiliation for the former superpower.\n\nBut from 2000, when Putin became president, steadily rising oil prices made Russia and many Russians richer than ever before. And Russia had a voice. It was invited into the G7 group of the world's largest economies - renamed the G8 after it joined.\n\nBut this was not enough for the Russian leader, Kristine Berzina, a managing director at the German Marshal Fund of United States, told CNN.\n\n\"Putin was happy to throw all that away on behalf of his citizens because of higher geopolitical aims,\" Berzina said. Russia was expelled from the G8, sanctioned by the West and ostracized on the global stage because of its aggression against Ukraine.\n\nBerzina said it was never good enough for Russia to be \"the eighth in the G7.\"\n\n\"That doesn't work within Russia's understanding of its own exceptionalism. It is the largest country in the world, the richest in (natural) resources, so how can it simply be one of the players?\" she said.\n\nTo understand what Putin wants from the current talks with the US, it's key to remember that the two sides are talking because the United States made a policy U-turn under Trump - not because of a fundamental change in Russian thinking.\n\nTrump wants the war in Ukraine to end as soon as possible, even if it means further territorial losses for Ukraine.\n\nThis means Putin has little to lose from talking.\n\nTrump has claimed that \"Russia holds all the cards\" in the war with Ukraine, but the battlefield has been mostly stalled for the past two years.\n\nWhile Russia is making some incremental gains, it is definitely not winning - though this could change if the US was to stop supplying arms and intelligence to Ukraine.\n\n\"Putin went into Ukraine thinking that it will be an easy, quick operation. Three years on, he controls 20% of Ukraine, but at terrible, terrible cost. I mean, essentially the Russians are losing. The thing though is that the Ukrainians are losing faster,\" leading Russia analyst Mark Galeotti told CNN.\n\nFor Putin and the people around him, Trump's push for a ceasefire simply presents an opportunity to secure quick wins while keeping an eye on the long-term goals, he said.\n\n\"Putin is an opportunist. He likes creating dynamic, chaotic situations, which throw up a whole variety of opportunities. And then he can then just pick which opportunity appeals to him, and he can change his mind,\" Galeotti said.\n\nPutin and his aides have made it very clear that their long-term goals have not changed. Even as they talk about wanting peace, Russian officials have continued to insist that the \"root causes\" of the conflict in Ukraine must be \"eliminated.\"\n\nIn the Kremlin's view, these \"root causes\" amount to Ukraine's sovereignty and its democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as NATO's expansion to the east in the past 30 years.\n\nRelated article How to decode a head-spinning few days of Ukraine war diplomacy\n\nPutin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 to force a regime change in Kyiv, planning to install a pro-Moscow government. His goal was to turn Ukraine into a vassal state like Belarus and prevent it from joining the European Union and NATO in the future.\n\nHe has not achieved that goal by using military force, but that doesn't mean he has abandoned it.\n\nInstead, he might try to achieve it by other means.\n\n\"The easiest way for Russia to attain what it wants in a different country is not through military means, but through interference and electoral process,\" Berzina said, adding that it is possible - even likely - that this is what Moscow would try to do after a ceasefire was in place.\n\nThis is likely why Russia keeps questioning Zelensky's legitimacy and pushing for an election - and why Kremlin was delighted when Trump adopted this narrative and called the Ukrainian leader \"a dictator without elections.\" Ukraine's martial law - imposed because of Russia's aggression - prohibits elections from taking place while the conflict is ongoing.\n\nTrump and his vice president, JD Vance, have rejected the idea that Ukraine could join NATO any time soon and Putin has asked for a US commitment that this will not happen to be part of any ceasefire agreement.\n\nBut Berzina said that Ukraine's European allies are not buying Putin's promises that he would stop fighting if Ukraine became - as he called it - neutral.\n\n\"No matter what Trump and Putin think they can arrange this week or this year, many people in Europe now find Putin fundamentally untrustworthy,\" she said.\n\n\"Could there be a desire for Russia to try its hand again militarily? Sure. And that is why the Europeans are very clear-eyed on the potential for future military engagement.\"\n\nAndrei Soldatov, a Russian investigative journalist and security expert who lives in exile in London, said Putin and his aides believe they can \"try to get something out of Trump right now.\"\n\n\"They think they can win some tactical battles but that he would not give them what they really want, which is a complete rearrangement of security arrangements in Europe,\" he said.\n\nRelated article Zelensky agrees to pause attacks on energy in call with Trump, but questions remain about what Trump and Putin hammered out\n\n\"For the Kremlin, it's not a war with Ukraine, it's a war with the West, and a lot of people in Moscow don't really believe that they can get any kind of lasting agreement with the US,\" Soldatov told CNN.\n\nRussia's wariness of the US goes far back.\n\n\"It's very personal to them because they were all young KGB officers back then, and they lost their social standing, they lost a place in Russian society, they lost the country as they describe it now, and it was extremely humiliating,\" Soldatov said.\n\n\"They really believe that the West has been after the complete destruction and subjugation of Russia for centuries. It's not just propaganda, they really, really believe in this.\" But Putin has also framed his plan for Ukraine within his own - inaccurate - interpretation of history, which goes well beyond the fall of the Soviet Union. Putin has often argued that Ukraine is not a real country because Ukraine and Ukrainians are part of a larger \"historical Russia\"\n\nExperts say this is, of course, nonsense.\n\n\"What he's talking about is the fact that Russia and Ukraine and Belarus share a political ancestor called Rus ... but it's very much not the same thing as any modern country. It was an early to late medieval political entity and to say that Ukraine doesn't have a right to exist because of this shared ancestor - no country looks the same as in the 10th century,\" said Monica White, an associate professor in Russian and Slavonic Studies at the University of Nottingham.\n\nPutin has also often turned to Russia's religious identity in support of his plan. The leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, is one of the loudest supporters of the war.\n\n\"After the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia lost its connection with the ancestral Orthodox lands and I think part of Putin's project is to try to bring back that thread connecting 10th century Rus with this pure orthodox continuity,\" White said. \"What he's doing is actually not so different from some of the early Romanov Tzars who kept trying to get back the Orthodox lands that were under either Ottoman or Catholic rule, and they eventually did.\"\n\nPutin's overwhelming desire is to return Russia to the global stage with a bang, she suggests - by creating a wedge between Europe and the US and teaming up with the West's other adversaries.\n\n\"Russia wants to be at all the important tables - so whatever comes next, maybe it doesn't have to mean territorial conquest in Europe, but I think it does have to be in a starring role in the more powerful bloc, if it sees that to include China or Iran or others, a bloc that is defined by its willingness to disrupt and destabilize,\" White added.\n\nPutin clearly believes that Russia - the largest country in the world by area - should be involved in running the world. He might have a like-minded man in the White House. Trump has made it clear that he believes the biggest and most powerful countries should get what they want - whether it's Greenland, the Panama Canal, or a chunk of Ukraine.\n\n\"I think that the fundamental point is that, as far as Trump is concerned, Ukraine is a bought and paid for vassal state and has to understand its place and accept that, essentially, America will work out some kind of a deal with Russia and then bring it back to Ukraine,\" Galeotti said.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

I think he will find a solution,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin's congenial tone is in marked contrast with the Kremlin's threats against the outgoing Biden administration, which Putin accused of \"escalating\" the war in Ukraine by allowing Kyiv to fire ATACMS at military targets in Russia.\n\nRelated article Russia's overnight attack on Ukraine a response to strikes with US-made missiles, Putin says\n\nTrump has pledged to end the war in Ukraine \"within 24 hours,\" without saying how. During the election campaign, he repeatedly refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war.\n\nPutin's comments come after Trump on Wednesday nominated Gen. Keith Kellogg to be special envoy to the warring countries. \"Together, we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!\" Trump wrote on social media, announcing his pick.\n\nSpeaking from the sidelines of a security summit in the Kazakh capital Astana, Putin said Trump had overcome a \"serious test\" to return to the White House, referring to the two assassination attempts against him during the election campaign.\n\nTrump was wounded in the first attempt in Pennsylvania in July. In a separate incident in September, a man was charged with attempted assassination after camping out at one of Trump's Florida golf courses while armed with a rifle.\n\nPutin said \"absolutely uncivilized means of struggle were used against Trump\" more than once, adding that he fears the president-elect is not currently safe.\n\nHe also criticized the \"humiliating, unfounded judicial procedures\" to which Trump was \"subjected\" during the campaign. In June, a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his hush money criminal trial, making him the first former US president to be convicted of a felony.\n\nDiscussing the war in Ukraine, Putin also threatened more launches of Russia's new medium-range ballistic missile which was used to attack Ukraine's Dnipro region last week. The new missile, called Oreshnik, fires multiple warheads at once, and is capable of delivering a nuclear payload.\n\n\"We will use the means at our disposal,\" he warned. \"We do not exclude the use of Oreshnik against the (Ukrainian) military, against military industrial facilities, or against decision-making centers, including in Kyiv, bearing in mind that the Kyiv authorities today continue to attempt to strike our vital facilities.\"\n\nAsked to clarify if the \"decision-making centers\" the Kremlin warned it might hit are military or political, Putin replied: \"You know, in Soviet times there was a joke about weather forecasts? Here's the forecast: today, during the day, anything is possible.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

      "text": "After Putin call, Trump says negotiations to end Ukraine war will start 'immediately'\n\nFollow:\n\nPresident Donald Trump said negotiations to end the Ukraine war will start \"immediately\" after holding a \"lengthy and highly productive\" telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe call, which is the first known conversation between the presidents since Trump assumed office last month, came as as Trump makes clear to his advisers he wants to bring the Ukraine conflict to a swift end.\n\nTrump administration officials said they hoped a prisoner \"exchange\" on Tuesday could portend renewed efforts to end the war, which is about to enter its fourth year.\n\nNow, as the two leaders resume communication after a long period of silence between the White House and Kremlin, the contours of Trump's settlement plan are coming into clearer focus.\n\nIn a readout of the conversation posted on Truth Social, Trump said, \"We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.\"\n\n\"We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other's Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now,\" Trump wrote.\n\nBoth Washington and Moscow, in their descriptions of the call, suggested the men assumed a conciliatory tone.\n\n\"President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, 'COMMON SENSE.' We both believe very strongly in it,\" Trump wrote, suggesting the former KGB agent on the other end of the line had chosen his words carefully to appeal to the US leader.\n\nThe Kremlin said Trump and Putin spoke for nearly 90 minutes.\n\nTrump had been signaling for weeks his desire to speak with Putin as he works to resolve the Ukraine conflict.\n\nAs American officials travel in Europe this week, they have begun taking clearer positions on how the conclusion of the Ukraine war might look. Speaking to a conference in Brussels, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Kyiv joining NATO is unrealistic and that the US will no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security as the Trump administration shifts its attention to securing US borders and deterring war with China.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has spoken of striking a deal with Ukraine's Zelensky for American access to the country's valuable rare earth minerals as payment for continued American assistance.\n\nTrump spoke with Zelensky midday, shortly after getting off the phone with Putin.\n\nHis predecessor, President Joe Biden, hadn't spoken to his Russian counterpart in nearly three years, believing there was little to be gained in speaking to a leader he'd deemed a war criminal.\n\nThe last US president to visit Russia was Barack Obama in 2013, when he attended a G20 summit. Putin last visited in the United States in 2015 to attend United Nations talks.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Trump indicated that he could soon meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia but cautioned that no formal decision has been made on the matter.\n\n\"We think we're going to probably meet in Saudi Arabia, the first meeting,\" Trump said, hours after the two spoke by phone.\n\nThe president indicated that Saudi Arabian leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would play a role in the discussions, saying, \"We know the crown prince, and I think it'd be a very good place to be.\"\n\nA date for that meeting, Trump said, \"hasn't been set,\" but he said it could be in the \"not too distant future.\"\n\nTrump added he has not yet committed to go to Ukraine.\n\nAsked whether Zelensky would be in attendance when he meets with Putin, Trump appeared to suggest he would not be present for the initial meeting: \"Probably we'll have a first meeting and then we'll see what we can do about the second meeting.\"\n\n\"I would think about going, I'd think about it, no problem,\" he said.\n\nSteve Witkoff, who will be among Trump's top negotiators on the conflict, pointed earlier Wednesday to the release of wrongfully detained American Marc Fogel as \"an indication of what the possibilities are\" for the future of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n\"I think that's maybe a sign about how that working relationship between President Trump and President Putin will be in the future, and what that may portend for the world at large, for conflict and so forth. I think they had a great friendship, and I think now it's going to continue, and it's a really good thing for the world,\" he said.\n\nWitkoff met privately with Putin while in Moscow on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.\n\nCNN's Kit Maher, Anna Chernova and Christian Edwards contributed to this report.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "After call with Trump, Putin agrees to pause attacks on Ukraine's energy and infrastructure targets\n\nFollow:\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on energy and infrastructure targets in Ukraine after a lengthy telephone call with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, the White House said, as Russia stopped short of signing off on a broader ceasefire to end the three-year-long conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said following the call, that Trump \"put forward a proposal for the parties to the conflict to mutually refrain from attacks on energy infrastructure facilities for 30 days,\" to which Putin \"responded positively\" and \"immediately gave the Russian military the corresponding order.\"\n\nThe two men's conversation, their second since Trump entered office, appeared unsuccessful in convincing Putin to sign off on the 30-day truce that Trump has endorsed and Ukraine has agreed to. Instead, the White House said a narrower pause on hitting energy targets would go into place, while technical teams begin sorting out other areas in negotiations.\n\n\"The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace,\" the White House wrote in its description of the call. It said the technical negotiations would begin \"immediately\" in the Middle East.\n\nA temporary moratorium on energy attacks, though short of a full ceasefire, would still amount to the first instance of Russia agreeing to halt certain strikes since it invaded Ukraine in 2022. Both Moscow and Kyiv could benefit from the pause. Ukraine's energy grid has been among the biggest targets of Putin's invasion, which has left the country to suffer periodic blackouts even in the freezing cold winters. That has prompted Ukraine to target Russian oil facilities using long-range drones.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said after the results of the call were announced that he would support a pause on striking energy targets. \"Both sides, Russian and Ukrainian, can cease attacking the energy sector. Our side is going to support this,\" he said at a news conference, adding that it was \"part of our proposal, about the sky and the sea.\"\n\nAs part of its demands for a broader ceasefire, Putin stressed the need for a halt of foreign military aid to Ukraine, the Kremlin said, though the White House made no mention of that in its statement. And neither the White House nor the Kremlin brought up land concessions in their official descriptions of Tuesday's conversation. Ahead of the call, Trump said US negotiators had discussed \"dividing up certain assets.\"\n\nThe high-stakes call, which lasted about two hours, came as the White House has insisted it was closing in on a temporary ceasefire deal to pause the war between Russia and Ukraine .\n\nThe call was a key test of whether Trump, who's largely echoed Putin's view of the war since their call last month , can achieve his campaign trail promise of bringing the war to an end - and whether his friendliness toward Russia has paid off.\n\n\"The two leaders agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside,\" the White House said in its statement. \"This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.\"\n\nPutin told Trump that a prisoner exchange would occur between Russia and Ukraine on Wednesday, according to the Kremlin.\n\nThe White House also said the men discussed the Middle East \"as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts\" as Russia offers to mediate a nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nTrump supported an idea proposed by Putin to organize US-Russia hockey matches in their respective countries, the Kremlin said.\n\nAhead of the call, sources familiar with the conversation said a key priority would be securing an agreement on concessions Russia is willing to make - including whether it's willing to withdraw forces from territory it seized in the past three years since invading Ukraine.\n\nTrump himself suggested as much while speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, saying that US negotiators have discussed \"dividing up certain assets.\"\n\n\"We'll be talking about land. A lot of land is a lot different than it was before the war, as you know. We'll be talking about land, we'll be talking about power plants, that's a big question,\" Trump said.\n\nRelated article Trump suggests Ukraine's largest nuclear plant is on the line in talks with Putin. What's next for Zaporizhzhia?\n\nNegotiations to end the war kicked off after Trump and Putin spoke by phone last month, marking a resumption of communication after a long period of silence between the White House and the Kremlin. Since then, the president hosted Zelensky for an Oval Office meeting that ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance shouting at him and asking the Ukrainians to leave, followed by the US temporarily pausing military assistance and intelligence sharing.\n\nWeeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations between top US officials - led by Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz - and top Ukrainian and Russian officials led to a breakthrough, with the announcement of a US-led ceasefire proposal. After Zelensky said last week that his country had accepted the 30-day proposal, the US made clear the onus was on Russia to agree, with Trump saying, \"Russia holds all the cards.\"\n\nEfforts to bring Russia closer to an agreement intensified with Witkoff's visit to Moscow on Thursday, where he met directly with Putin for several hours, CNN previously reported. Witkoff told CNN the meeting with Putin - his second known meeting with the Russian president this year - was \"positive\" and that the two sides had \"narrowed the differences between them.\"\n\nPutin believes \"philosophically in a truce,\" Witkoff argued, after the Russian leader laid out numerous reservations he had.\n\nWitkoff later flew to Florida to brief Trump on the discussions, and the president was so encouraged by Witkoff's readout, the sources said, that he directed his team to begin preparations for a phone call with Putin.\n\nOver the weekend, Rubio spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\n\"We are on the 10-yard line of peace,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday, adding that the US has \"never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment.\"\n\nA White House official reiterated that sentiment in a conversation with CNN, arguing that just a week ago they were \"hundreds of miles apart, now we're a couple hundred yards apart.\" The official described Tuesday's Trump-Putin phone call as the \"natural next step\" in negotiations.\n\nTrump and his team have repeatedly argued the fighting needs to stop before they can proceed to the far more complicated issues that need to be resolved in a longer-term peace deal, like drawing territorial lines and negotiating security support for Ukraine.\n\nBut Putin has publicly shared skepticism over the US proposal, with one of his top negotiators, Yuriy Ushakov, dismissing the idea as \"nothing more than a temporary respite for the Ukrainian military.\"\n\nAsked by CNN on Friday about Putin's reservations and whether he was playing for time, Rubio: \"We're not going to make our foreign policy decisions on the basis of what a leader says, simply says at a press conference.\"\n\n\"This is going to play out the way things of this nature and caliber have traditionally and normally play out,\" he added, \"and that is with the leaders of the countries involved speaking, not in front of the cameras, not in front of the media, but in these negotiations that happen.\"\n\nAhead of the call, senior US officials had repeatedly argued that any permanent off-ramp from the Russia-Ukraine war would include all sides making concessions, but they had also been reticent to publicly discuss details.\n\nAfter meeting with the Russians in Riyadh last month, Waltz said, \"The practical reality is that there is going to be some discussion of territory.\" Asked by CNN if it would be acceptable for Russia to retain territory it has annexed since 2022, Waltz said it was something \"to be discussed.\"\n\nRubio, ahead of a meeting with the Ukrainians last week, said they were in \"listening mode\" and \"not going to be sitting in a room drawing lines on a map,\" but wanted to \"get a general sense of what concessions are in the realm of the possible.\"\n\nIn an interview Sunday, Waltz was asked if \"Russia could be given the Donbas in addition to hanging onto Crimea\" - two Ukrainian regions it has occupied.\n\n\"Are we going to drive every Russian off of every inch of Ukrainian soil, including Crimea?\" he told ABC News. \"We can talk about what's right and wrong. And we also have to talk about the reality of the situation on the ground. And that's what we are doing through diplomacy, through shuttle diplomacy, through proximity talks,\" he said.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East,\" the White House said.\n\nThe Kremlin told the Russian state outlet Tass that Putin has agreed to halt strikes on energy infrastructure for 30 days. The Kremlin also said the key condition to prevent an escalation in its war in Ukraine would be the suspension of foreign military aid and foreign intelligence to the Ukrainian government.\n\nTrump said during a Fox News interview that aired Tuesday night that aid was not discussed during the call.\n\n\"We didn't talk about aid, actually. We didn't talk about aid at all. We talked about a lot of things, but aid was never discussed,\" Trump said.\n\nWhen asked by host Laura Ingraham whether Putin had asked for a termination of aid to Ukraine as part of the deal, Trump said: \"No, he didn't.\"\n\nZelenskyy said in a news conference Tuesday that his country would support a proposal aimed at ending the war and establishing lasting peace.\n\n\"We will support any proposals that lead to a sustainable, just peace. But for this we must understand what is at stake,\" he said, adding that efforts to \"negotiate without Ukraine, in my view, will not be productive.\"\n\nZelenskyy also urged Trump to initiate a conversation with him by phone to identify next steps.\n\n\"We will give support, but in order to support something we need to understand what specifically it is. If President Trump can find time - he is a busy man - if he has time he can phone at any time, we are ready to pick up. We are ready to discuss the next steps with him,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy has warned that he doesn't trust Putin to stick to a ceasefire because Russia hasn't abided by previous agreements with Ukraine.\n\nThe White House also signaled that the Trump administration wants to improve relations between the U.S. and Russia, saying in its statement: \"The two leaders agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside. This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.\"\n\nThe call between Trump and Putin began around 10 a.m. ET and lasted at least an hour and a half.\n\nA Kremlin aide later wrote in a post on X that it was \"a PERFECT call.\" He may have been referring to the infamous phone conversation Trump held with Zelenskyy in 2019 in which Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden and suggested that the U.S. would withhold aid if Zelenskyy didn't cooperate. Trump later said it was a \"perfect call,\" though the House, then controlled by Democrats, impeached the president for the first time later that year.\n\nTrump said late Monday that he looked forward to the call with Putin in a post on Truth Social , adding that \"many elements of a Final Agreement have been agreed to, but much remains.\"\n\nWhile the White House readout didn't include specific details of what a permanent ceasefire would entail, the call most likely involved a discussion of what Ukraine will have to give up to achieve a pause after three years of fighting since Putin ordered his troops to invade Russia's neighbor.\n\nTrump, who has been trying to win Putin's support for a 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine accepted last week, said late Sunday that discussions with Putin would involve \"dividing up certain assets\" that included land and power plants.\n\nThe president has intimated that the Zaporizhzhia power plant, Europe's biggest nuclear facility, as well as land - Ukraine controls part of the Russian region of Kursk, while Russia holds several regions of Ukraine - will be up for discussion.\n\nHe told reporters in Washington on Monday that Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region were \"in deep trouble,\" according to Reuters, adding that his administration's temporary suspension of military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv was an attempt to \"get Ukraine to do the right thing.\"\n\nPutin has repeatedly indicated that Russia wants to cement his country's land grabs during the war and stop Kyiv from ever joining NATO. Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told ABC News on Sunday that the prospect of a pathway into NATO for Ukraine was \"incredibly unlikely.\"\n\nZelenskyy has previously stated that he would be willing to resign in exchange for peace or NATO membership, which he sees as imperative for Ukrainian security.\n\nU.S. Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin in Moscow last week, on Sunday suggested that the ceasefire discussions would likely involve territorial concessions from Kyiv over Kursk - the western Russian region where Ukraine has a foothold and where Kremlin troops have recently moved closer to ejecting Kyiv's forces.\n\nReferring to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, Witkoff said the \"nuclear reactor that supplies quite a bit of electricity to the country of Ukraine\" has \"got to be dealt with.\"\n\nHe added that implementing a ceasefire would involve access to ports and a potential agreement over the Black Sea.\n\nDuring a Fox News interview Tuesday night, Witkoff said more talks would be held on Sunday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe apparent territorial ambitions of Putin have upended the security landscape in Eastern Europe, with Ukraine's neighbors upping their defense budgets and beginning to remilitarize in recent years.\n\nIn that vein, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said Tuesday that they were withdrawing from the Ottawa Treaty, an international agreement banning antipersonnel mines.\n\n\"The U.S. is negotiating with Russia about other people's territory, which is precisely the nightmare scenario that not just Ukraine, but other countries in the east of Europe had feared,\" Keir Giles, a fellow with the London-based think tank Chatham House, told NBC News before the call.\n\nGiles added that the impact was limited not just to Europe, but also to other U.S. allies \"watching this process with horror because they know ... that they could be next.\"\n\nAstha Rajvanshi is a reporter for NBC News Digital, based in London.

Putin did it \"not because ... he could become the president of the United States, but because he had a friendship with him, and he was praying for his friend.\"\n\nDuring the same visit, the Russian president presented a painting of Trump that he commissioned from a Russian artist as a gift to the American president, Witkoff said.\n\n\"I came home and delivered that message to our president, and delivered the painting, and he was clearly touched by it,\" Witkoff said. \"So this is the kind of connection that we've been able to re-establish through, by the way, a simple word called communication.\"\n\nWitkoff dismissed criticism of the Trump administration's outreach to Putin, saying the only way to resolve the war in Ukraine is to speak to all sides in the conflict. He also rejected portrayals of Putin as a nefarious actor who can't be trusted.\n\nWitkoff said some people might question if he should have met with the Russian president because they see Putin as \"a bad guy.\" But he said: \"I don't regard Putin as a bad guy.\"\n\nA real estate tycoon and friend of the president who has become a top diplomatic envoy for Trump, Wiktoff said he appreciated Putin being open to meeting with him and communicating in a \"straightforward\" way.\n\n\"I liked him. I thought he was straight up with me,\" he said, adding that \"it was gracious of him to accept me, to see me.\"\n\nPutin, a former KGB officer who has ruled Russia for the last 25 years, has been blamed for the killings of multiple Russian opposition leaders, most recently Alexei Navalny, who died in a Russian prison last year.\n\nMercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin died in a plane crash last year, just months after leading his Wagner Group forces in an aborted mutiny against Putin . His short-lived rebellion was sparked by disagreements about the war in Ukraine. No investigative findings were released after the fiery crash, which also killed nine other people.\n\nBoris Nemtsov, once considered the leader of Russia's opposition and one of Putin's fiercest critics, was shot dead in 2015, just a few feet away from the Kremlin.\n\nAnd in 2018 former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in the U.K. with a nerve agent believed to be the same Novichok poison later used on Navalny. Two Russians also allegedly poisoned former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, an outspoken critic of Putin's who had fled to the U.K.\n\nRenowned journalist Anna Politkovskaya was gunned down outside her Moscow apartment in 2006 after warning reporters in Russia about the risks of challenging the Kremlin's narrative.\n\nWitkoff said Putin pointed out in their meeting that he and former President Joe Biden did not speak for three years, which Witkoff called a mistake.\n\n\"How do you settle a conflict unless we establish trust and good feelings with one another?\" Witkoff said.\n\nTrump's envoy said an administration official had warned him beforehand that Putin was a former KGB officer. But Witkoff said that background merely meant that Putin was among the elite in the former Soviet Union, as he said the spy service recruited highly capable people.\n\n\"In the old days, the only people who went into the KGB were the smartest people in the nation,\" Witkoff said. \"That's who went into the KGB. He's a super smart guy.\"\n\nPutin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine violated international law, and Russian forces appear to have committed war crimes there, according to European, United Nations and Biden administration officials. But Witkoff suggested the media coverage of the war had been distorted and that the conflict could not be blamed entirely on one side.\n\n\"That is a complicated situation that war, and all the ingredients that led up to it,\" he said.\n\nThe special envoy said the key to resolving the war in Ukraine was Russia's claim to four eastern regions in Ukraine - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. He called the issue \"the elephant in the room.\"\n\nUkraine opposes ceding the territory, which remains part of Ukraine's internationally recognized borders.\n\nRussian troops occupy most of the regions and Moscow has held referendums on joining Russia, which Western countries and Ukraine have denounced as shams conducted under repression.\n\nBut Witkoff, who struggled to name all four of the regions in the interview, cited the Russian-organized votes as an indication that people in the area preferred Russian rule.\n\n\"They're Russian-speaking,\" he said. \"There have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule.\"\n\nWitkoff said it was unclear if Ukraine could accept ceding that territory to Russia and if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could survive politically if he acknowledged Russian control of the area.\n\n\"The Russians are de facto in control of these territories,\" Witkoff said. \"Will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?\"\n\nHe added that Russia did not want to absorb all of Ukraine and that it already has what it wants, by taking the four eastern regions and the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n\"The Russians also have what they want,\" he said. \"So why do they need more?\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Two other trucks hauled a pair of American Bradley Fighting Vehicles - tanklike workhorses used to carry troops into battle - apparently left by retreating Ukrainian forces.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Kommersant newspaper also ran a large picture of President Donald Trump, who said late Sunday that negotiators in Washington and Moscow have begun discussing the division of assets between Russia and Ukraine in an effort to end the fighting.\n\nTrump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he plans to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday and that they would discuss \"dividing up certain assets,\" including land and power plants.\n\n\"I think we have a lot of it already discussed by both sides - Ukraine and Russia,\" Trump said. \"We want to see if we can bring that war to an end.

Putin said they needed to meet crucial demands made by the Kremlin.\n\nThe Russian leader and his officials have repeatedly indicated that they want to cement his country's land grabs during the war and stop Kyiv from ever joining NATO.\n\nDeputy Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko reiterated those goals, telling the Russian outlet Izvestia that the Kremlin will seek \"iron-clad security guarantees\" to ensure Kyiv's exclusion from NATO in any peace deal and Ukraine's neutrality regarding the bloc.\n\nPressure has been mounting on Russia to cede to Trump's demands after Ukraine accepted the ceasefire proposal last week, though Grushko's comments Monday made no reference to it.\n\nGrushko also said that Russia would oppose any troops in Ukraine as part of post-conflict guarantees, including NATO troops, with Britain and France both saying in recent weeks that they are willing to send forces to monitor any ceasefire.\n\n\"If [those soldiers] appear there, it means that they are deployed in the conflict zone with all the consequences for these contingents as parties to the conflict,\" he added.\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told reporters in Brussels on Monday that the stipulations the Russians have given show that they \"don't really want peace, actually, because they are presenting as conditions all their ultimate goals that they want to achieve from the war,\" according to Reuters.\n\nA spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also told reporters that a \"significant number\" of European countries were willing to provide peacekeeping troops in Ukraine as part of a peace deal, according to Reuters.\n\nThe comments came after heavy fighting in Kursk over the weekend as Russian forces continued to slowly take territory in the region where Ukrainian forces have maintained a foothold for the past seven months.\n\nThe Ukrainian government sees Kursk as a valuable bargaining chip in any peace talks, but in recent weeks, it has been forced to retreat from parts of the region.\n\nNew images shown on Russian government channels over the weekend displayed an intensified military offensive by the country's forces, bolstered by support from North Korean troops and the Trump administration's suspension of military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv.\n\nEven as Trump has attempted to play peacemaker, saying Friday on Truth Social that he had asked the Kremlin not to attack Ukrainian troops in Kursk, Putin has urged his troops on, appearing in military fatigues during a visit to the region last week.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, accused Putin of prolonging the war and ignoring U.S.-led efforts to broker a ceasefire.\n\n\"The buildup of Russian forces indicates that Moscow intends to keep ignoring diplomacy,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on X on Saturday.\n\n\"We are ready to provide our partners with all the real information on the situation at the front, in the Kursk region and along our border,\" he added.\n\nKeir Simmons reported from Rylsk and Astha Rajvanshi from London.\n\nKeir Simmons is chief international correspondent for NBC News, based in Dubai.\n\nAstha Rajvanshi is a reporter for NBC News Digital, based in London.

And the result may be more war.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's announcement overnight that the U nited States would immediately halt military aid to Ukraine was welcomed by the Kremlin on Tuesday, and his decision appears to vindicate Putin's visceral dislike of Ukrain ian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy . Meanwhile, the White House's growing differences with NATO, the 32-member U.S.-led military alliance set up to counter the Soviet Union after World War II, and apparent rapprochement with Russia are fracturing the Western liberal order that for decades contained Putin's ambitions.\n\nThe fight is by no means over.\n\nHours after Trump's announcement on Ukraine, European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced plans to strengthen Europe's defense industry and increase military capabilities by freeing close to 800 billion euros ($841.4 billion).\n\n\"We're living in the most momentous and dangerous of times,\" she said in a statement. \"We are in an era of rearmament.\"\n\nPutin himself hasn't commented on the recent events exposing the deepening fissures between the U.S. and the liberal coalition it has led for decades. Others in the Kremlin have been guarded, if positive.\n\nThe West has \"begun to partially lose its unity,\" Putin spokesman Dimitry Peskov said Monday, calling the moment Zelenskyy was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance a \"fragmentation.\"\n\nRussia's TV network bosses, whose coverage mirror Kremlin talking points, agreed, and Friday's Oval Office spat and interviews with Trump administration officials have run constantly on Russian television.\n\nPeskov quickly reworked the Kremlin's long-standing anti-Zelenskyy talking points to fit the moment.\n\n\"Zelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills,\" Peskov said. And in blaming Ukraine's \"refusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\" he repeated another popular Russian propaganda point.\n\nZelenskyy was at the White House on Friday to sign a deal with Trump that would grant the U.S. access to rare earths and other critical minerals in Ukraine after the war with Russia ends.\n\nTrump has said the deal would serve as a security guarantee for Ukraine against a future Russian invasion, like the one that started the war in February 2022 . Zelenskyy pressed for more explicit guarantees, saying that Putin could not be trusted to live by any agreement he signs.\n\nThe deal remained unsigned after the extraordinary encounter.\n\nBut a deal with Russia is also moving slowly, despite warming ties with the U.S. under Trump, including a 90-minuted conversation between Putin and Trump and a meeting between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart , Sergei Lavrov , in Saudi Arabia. The latest U.S.-Russia talks in Istanbul were narrowly focused on re-establishing diplomatic relations, with Putin likely seeing an opportunity to gain more on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nAnd last week, the U.S. extended sanctions against Russia - an indication that the Trump administration wants a ceasefire before any economic normalization.\n\nIn 2014, after Putin occupied and annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula , the international community slapped sanctions on Russia. Russia followed this by invading in 2022, and subsequently occupying 20% of Ukraine, which has prompted further sanctions.\n\nA sign that the current turnaround in relations with the U.S. is about much more than Ukraine is the appointment last month of Kirill Dmitriev as Moscow's special envoy on international economic and investment cooperation. Dmitriev, whose role is to focus on removing sanctions and opening up trade with America, attended talks in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh in February.\n\nAfter the Trump-Zelensky spat, Dmitriev wrote one word on X : \"Historic.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Putin is closer than ever to his war aim of removing Zelenskyy from power.\n\nAn interview that Speaker Mike Johnson , R-La., did Sunday with NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" in which he suggested that Zelenskyy \"needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\" has been replayed on Russian media.\n\nAnd national security adviser Mike Waltz and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., also suggested that Zelenskyy might need to step down to secure a ceasefire.\n\nPolling in Ukraine, however, shows that the democratically elected Zelenskyy remains popular among his own people. He was also greeted warmly by European leaders, some of whom met him at a summit in London on Sunday.\n\nAfter the summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced billions in support for Ukraine, including a loan of 2.2 billion British pounds ($2.8 billion) to support the country, funded through the freezing of Russian assets.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday thanked British Foreign Secretary David Lammy for his country's role in encouraging Europe to provide for its own defense and push for peace in Ukraine, the State Department said.\n\nStarmer has said he is \"ready and willing\" to put British troops on the ground in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of an international effort to support a peace deal.\n\nEurope, under pressure to unify and deal with an emboldened Russia, is unlikely to quickly make up the difference after U.S. military aid stops flowing to Ukraine and without a U.S. so-called backstop or security and military guarantees to enforce any deal with the Kremlin. Europe is considering using 200 billion euros ($211 billion) in seized Russian assets to aid Ukraine.\n\nFor Russia's government, this most likely looks like an opportunity to widen the split in the Atlantic alliance, another key war aim.\n\nThe Kremlin posted a picture of the European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Germany's outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz.\n\n\"Here are leaders who are organizing opposition to Trump and Putin,\" read a caption underneath.\n\nIn an interview with the state-run Tass news agency on Sunday,  Lavrov said the U.S. \"openly says it wants to end the conflict in Ukraine, but Europe insists on keeping the party going in the form of war.\"\n\nPutin will be determined to capitalize on the warming of Russian relations with the U.S. while knowing his own negotiations with Washington are just beginning.\n\nRussian officials will also be wary of an unpredictable Trump administration determined to get its own way. Putin, meanwhile, is signaling he will not retreat on the battlefield .\n\nSo even as the U.S. pauses military support for Ukraine, the Kremlin remains focused on fighting, and Trump's promise of a quick ceasefire looks less likely than ever.\n\nKeir Simmons is chief international correspondent for NBC News, based in Dubai.\n\nNatasha Lebedeva is NBC's Senior Director for International Affairs, based in Washington.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Why the Kremlin's 'cautiously optimistic' response to Trump's Ukraine truce deal hides Putin's dilemma\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nThere were \"certainly reasons to be cautiously optimistic\" about the prospect of peace in Ukraine , the Kremlin said Friday, after President Donald Trump's envoy met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.\n\nThe comments by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov after Putin met with Trump administration envoy Steve Witkoff echoed those of the Russian president , who said Thursday that he in theory accepted the ceasefire proposed by the United States and Ukraine - but only on terms tantamount to a victory over Ukraine.\n\nIt was an emphatic \"yes, but.\"\n\n\"We agree with the proposals to stop the hostilities ,\" Putin said in a speech. But only if it leads \"to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of this crisis.\"\n\nThat term - \"root causes\" - is a reference to long-held Russian grievances about what it sees as NATO's eastward expansion. Western officials and analysts reject this, saying Putin wants to subjugate Ukraine , drawing it into Russia's sphere of influence and away from its European tilt.Despite flirting with the Trump administration, there is little evidence Putin has shifted from his core war goals: cementing his land grabs in Ukraine and stopping it from ever joining NATO. Even so, Trump on Thursday called Putin's remark \"a promising statement.\"\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump called his administration's discussions with Putin \"very good and productive,\" expressing optimism \"that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end.\"\n\nSwitching to all caps, Trump highlighted the stakes of the ceasefire, while positioning himself as a peacemaker by noting that thousands of Ukrainian troops are \"completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position.\"\n\n\"I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!!!\" he added.\n\nMany officials and experts across Ukraine and Europe are far less impressed.\n\nDuring his nightly address Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Putin's words \"manipulative.\"\n\n\"Putin often does this - he does not say 'no' directly, but he does it in such a way that practically everything only delays it and makes normal decisions impossible,\" he said, adding, \"Putin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians.\"\n\nIndeed, hours after Putin spoke, his military fired 27 drones at Ukraine overnight into Friday, Ukraine's Armed Forces said.\n\nSome were shot down, according to Ukraine's military, but one hit a civilian hospital in the western village of Zolochiv, setting fire to the building and injuring one staff member.\n\nIn the southern city of Kherson, NBC News found a scene of destruction after Russia's latest bombing, which occurs most nights.Rescue workers were clearing rubble and fixing power lines in a residential area where several homes were blown apart in what they said was a Russian glide bomb attack the day before.\n\nMykola Vorobjovskii, 69, said he was inside his house when it was destroyed.\n\n\"Putin is a liar,\" Vorobjovskii told NBC News, choking back tears as he stood next to the wreckage of his home. \"He calls black white and white black. He said he is liberating Ukraine. He liberated me from my house, job and car.\"\n\nSome Western experts believe the Russian leader is in a tight spot and that his evasive response was an attempt to balance two competing realities.\n\nFirst, the Kremlin has no reason to accept a truce unless it delivers him a favorable outcome; and second, he wants to achieve a settlement with the White House while it is led by a president amenable to Moscow, said Jonathan Eyal, a director at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London.\n\n\"It's not in Putin's interest to get a ceasefire now,\" Eyal said Friday. \"However, he cannot afford to annoy the American president, and expose and humiliate him with an outright rejection.\"The deal on offer to Putin is not going to improve, Eyal said, adding that the Russian president has \"got an amazing opportunity to return to the global stage and [escape] from his isolation - with the help of the United States,\" he added. So \"he's got to try to grab this deal without making too many concessions on Ukraine, and that's his dilemma.\"\n\nOfficials in Kyiv will be hoping to use Putin's \"evasive\" response to \"help convince their American colleagues that the Kremlin dictator is not genuinely interested in ending the war,\" wrote Mykola Bielieskov , a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, a Ukrainian think tank.\n\nWhile Putin may entertain a truce with terms favorable to Moscow, he will not accept an independent Ukrainian state on Russia's border, Bielieskov wrote for the Atlantic Council .\n\n\"This does not mean that current U.S.-led peace efforts are entirely futile, but it is vital to recognize that freezing the conflict along the current front lines will not be enough to end the war.\"\n\nAlexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who has been critical of the way Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has stripped jobs from federal workers, said today that she's not afraid of the possibility that he could fund a primary challenge against her.\n\n\"It may be that Elon Musk has decided he's going to take the next billion dollars that he makes off of Starlink and put it directly against Lisa Murkowski,\" she told reporters in Juneau. Murkowski, 67, is up for re-election in 2028.\n\n\"And you know what? That may happen. But I'm not giving up one minute, one opportunity to try to stand up for Alaskans,\" she added.\n\nMurkowski said many of her colleagues are \"not saying a word\" about their concerns about what's happening in the Trump administration \"because they're afraid they're going to be taken down.\"\n\n\"You know what? We cannot be cowed into not speaking up,\" she said.\n\nMurkowski also said she doesn't plan to \"tear down at every opportunity the president of the United States.\"\n\n\"That's not constructive to the people of Alaska. I'm going to have to have to figure out where I can work with them,\" she said.\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nMusk, whose role as de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency has sparked bipartisan criticism, said he is \"just implementing the will of the people.\"\n\n\"I've never done anything awful. I've only done productive things,\" Musk said in an interview tonight with Fox News' Sean Hannity.\n\nMusk argued that he and his DOGE team are sparking backlash because of their success \"in getting rid of corruption and waste.\"\n\n\"We've got this narrow window of opportunity with the House, Senate and a popular vote, and really, we're just implementing the will of the people,\" he said.\n\nAn NBC News poll published this week found that voters like the idea of DOGE but are not sold on Musk - or his team's early results.\n\nAsked whether creating DOGE was a good or a bad idea, 46% of respondents said it was good. Asked more broadly about their feelings toward Musk's initiative, 47% had negative views, and 51% said they view him in a negative light.\n\nMatt Dixon\n\nReporting from Tallahassee, Florida\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis' political operation is making calls urging state lobbyists not to support Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., whose 2026 bid for governor has already socked away more than $3 million - much of which has come from Trump's donors.\n\nThe calls, according to seven people familiar with the effort who requested anonymity to speak freely, are attempts to curb any potential contributions from mostly Tallahassee-based lobbyists to Donalds' campaign.\n\nDonalds, who represents a southwest Florida district, announced his Trump-backed bid for governor last month, but there remains the prospect that DeSantis' wife, Casey, also jumps in the race , which would set up a heavyweight GOP primary and continue the long-running political proxy war between Trump and DeSantis.\n\n\"They are becoming a lot more aggressive as this thing progresses,\" a veteran Republican lobbyist who received one of the calls said. \"There are no threats or anything direct like that, but come on. When you get a call from the governor, or anyone around them, in this sort of context, it's a message-sender.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nRebecca Kaplan\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nSen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., sidestepped a question today about whether he still has confidence in Schumer after last week's vote on the Republican funding bill.\n\n\"I'm not going to opine on the internal caucus politics as a freshman; I'm going to leave that to more experienced people,\" said Schiff, who's in his first year as a senator.\n\nStill, Schiff said, Democratic leadership in both chambers of Congress has to be unified.\n\n\"We're going to have to figure out a way where leadership in the House and leadership in the Senate is on the same page and we're clearly communicating a unified message about the harms this administration is doing,\" he said.\n\nAll but one House Democrat voted against the Republican funding bill last week, while 10 Democratic senators, including Schumer, voted to advance it in the Senate. Schumer voted against it on final passage.\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nA federal judge tonight temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating up to $20 billion in grants for climate initiatives in a case brought by the environmental group Climate United Fund.\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan of Washington, D.C., ruled that the administration for now cannot enforce a grant termination letter signed by acting Deputy EPA Administrator W.C. McIntosh that ordered the stoppage of all program expenditures.\n\n\"When the court asked EPA to proffer evidence justifying its decision given the terms of the agreement, its only response was to refer to the termination letter, which gave no legal justification for the termination,\" Chutkan wrote in her memorandum opinion.\n\nJo Yurcaba\n\nChloe Atkins\n\nA federal judge today temporarily blocked Trump's executive order banning transgender people from enlisting or serving in the military .\n\nU.S. District Judge Ana Reyes of Washington, D.C., ruled that the ban violates the equal protection clause because it discriminates based on transgender status and sex.\n\nReyes said the ban \"is soaked in animus.\"\n\n\"Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact,\" she wrote.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the former House speaker, said today that she still has confidence in Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., after his vote last week on the Republican funding bill while saying she wouldn't have done the same thing.\n\nReferring to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., Pelosi said at a news conference the same day Jeffries voiced support for Schumer: \"Hakeem said that he had confidence in Chuck Schumer, so we're to the next stage on this now.\"\n\n\"I myself don't give away anything for nothing. I think that's what happened the other day,\" she added. \"We could have, in my view, perhaps, gotten them to agree to a third way, which was a bipartisan [continuing resolution] for four weeks in which we could have had bipartisan legislation go forward.\"\n\nCorky Siemaszko\n\nMore than 60 years after President John F. Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas, the federal government began releasing what could be the final trove of documents delving into the assassination that shocked the nation and spawned countless conspiracy theories.\n\nThe Justice Department's National Security Division today started unveiling the long-awaited files a day after Trump announced that 80,000 pages related to the fatal Nov. 22, 1963, shooting were about to be released.\n\n\"You got a lot of reading,\" Trump said as he visited the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. \"I don't believe we're going to redact anything.\"\n\nTrump was cagey about what would be in the files. Historians contend that around 4,700 documents haven't yet been released.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nRyan Nobles\n\nMelanie Zanona Melanie Zanona is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News.\n\nHouse leaders have yet to appoint board members to an independent office designed to investigate ethics complaints against lawmakers and their staff members, leaving the entity powerless for the time being and sparking concerns among outside watchdogs.\n\nThe House rules package for the new Congress, which was approved in January along party lines, re-authorized the nonpartisan Office of Congressional Ethics and gave it a new name: the Office of Congressional Conduct.\n\nBut more than two months later, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who have the authority to fill the board seats, have yet to do so.\n\nWithout a board in place, professional staff members are not authorized to launch investigations. If the seats remain unfilled by Saturday, it will mark the longest the office has had a vacant board since it was formed in 2008.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nKyle Stewart\n\nRep. Mike Flood, R-Neb, is facing a confrontational crowd tonight at a town hall in his district.\n\n\"I believe that town halls are an important part of the process,\" Flood said as he opened up the event in Columbus. \"It's democracy. It's how we communicate with each other.\"\n\nThe event quickly turned more intense once the floor was opened up for questions. Flood, who is vice chair of the centrist-leaning Main Street Caucus, was met with loud boos when he said he supported spending cuts.\n\n\"For the first time in decades, we have a president that is cutting spending and he is looking to find efficiencies,\" Flood said. \"And I support that effort.\"\n\nHe said he knows that \"some of you in this room are angry\" and repeatedly asked the crowd to let him finish answering its questions.\n\n\"Tax the rich,\" many members of the audience started chanting at one point.\n\nFlood is one of the few Republicans holding in-person events this week while Congress is in recess.\n\nRyan J. Reilly\n\nEmployees of the U.S. African Development Foundation began receiving notifications today that they had been placed on administrative leave, according to a copy of a notification obtained by NBC News.\n\nThe letter from Pete Marocco, a top State Department official, referred to him as the acting chief executive officer and president of USADF. It informs recipients that they have been placed \"on excused absence (also known as administrative leave) with pay, effective immediately,\" and that they are prohibited \"from entering ADF premises, accessing ADF systems, or attempting to use your position or authority with ADF in any way without my prior permission or the prior permission of a supervisor in your chain of command.\"\n\nThe notifications come less than two weeks after members of DOGE accessed the USADF offices and as DOGE gained access this week to the U.S. Institute of Peace. Meanwhile, a federal judge ruled today in a separate case involving DOGE and Marocco that the dismantling of USAID \"likely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways.\"\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon denied a request for a temporary restraining order to prevent Marocco, DOGE and others from removing Ward Brehm as president of USADF. Leon wrote that he would \"closely scrutinize\" whether DOGE employees took steps to maintain USADF to \"the minimal presence and function required by law.\" Leon's motion for a preliminary injunction is due Friday, and a hearing is set for April 16.\n\nReuters\n\nThe two Democratic commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission said they were illegally fired by Trump today in another major test of the independence of regulatory agencies.\n\nA White House official confirmed the firing but did not have further comment.\n\n\"This is corruption plain and simple,\" former Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said of his firing in a statement on X.\n\nHis former colleague Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said in a statement: \"The President illegally fired me from my position as a Federal Trade Commissioner, violating the plain language of a statute and clear Supreme Court precedent.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTom Winter\n\nTwo investigators in the IRS' criminal division, including the agent who opened a criminal probe into Hunter Biden's taxes, have been promoted and hold new positions at the Treasury Department, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.\n\nThe two men -Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler - are now senior advisers to Bessent. They will later transfer back to the IRS in leadership roles.\n\nZiegler, who was the originating case agent investigating Biden's taxes, testified at a hearing in July 2023 that there had been \"gross mismanagement\" involving the probe. He has suggested federal prosecutors turned a blind eye to some of the allegations against the president's son.\n\nShapley, testifying at the same hearing, said the Justice Department had given Biden preferential treatment.\n\n\"We have been motivated by one singular mantra: do what's right, and do it the right way,\" Shapley and Ziegler said in a statement today. \"It has not been easy, but having a clear conscience is worth the effort.\"\n\nBessent said in a separate statement: \"These veteran civil servants join us to help further the agency's focus on collections, modernization, and customer service, so we can deliver a more effective and efficient IRS experience for hardworking American taxpayers.\"\n\nGrassley, who has often led congressional efforts to investigate the findings of Ziegler and Shapley, said, in part, that \"if we reinstate whistleblowers who have been retaliated against, it will send a clear signal that pointing out wrongdoing is an honorable thing to do. It will help change the culture of our bureaucracy.\"\n\nZiegler's investigation into Biden was used to produce a nine-count, 56-page indictment filed in federal court in California, which alleged Biden, former President Joe Biden's son, committed significant tax crimes over several years.\n\nBiden pleaded guilty to those charges in federal court in September, sparing what could have been an embarrassing trial shortly before the 2024 election.\n\nThe indictment said Biden \"engaged in a four-year scheme to not pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed federal taxes he owed for tax years 2016 through 2019, from in or about January 2017 through in or about October 15, 2020, and to evade the assessment of taxes for tax year 2018 when he filed false returns in or about February 2020.\"\n\nProsecutors also alleged that the returns Biden eventually filed were fraudulent and that they falsely claimed money he paid to an escort, a strip club and a pornographic website, as well as money he spent on a sex club membership fee and his daughter's college tuition and rent, as business expenses.\n\nBefore sentencing, Joe Biden pardoned his son.\n\nCourtney Kube\n\nGordon Lubold\n\nFor nearly 75 years, it has been a distinctly American responsibility to have a four-star U.S. general oversee all NATO military operations in Europe - a command that began with then-World War II hero and future president Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nBut the Trump administration, according to two defense officials familiar with the planning and a Pentagon briefing reviewed by NBC News, is considering changing that.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nZoë Richards\n\nCaroline Kenny\n\nTrump signed a memo this afternoon that directs Secretary of State Marco Rubio to remove language about \"Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility\" from materials promoting foreign service.\n\nThe memo says the federal government won't use characteristics like race, religion, sex or national origin as part of recruitment or hiring or efforts to retain foreign service employees.\n\nThe memo directs agencies to \"identify and take appropriate action regarding any Foreign Service Officer who knowingly and willfully engaged in illegal discrimination.\"\n\nTrump previously ordered an end to all DEI-related programs and activities in the federal government.\n\nAn appeals court last week said the Trump administration could temporarily enact that ban. A lower court had blocked it .\n\nCaroline Kenny\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nTrump signed an executive order on preparedness that aims to \"empower\" state and local communities when it comes to incidents like cyberattacks and weather events.\n\nThe order would create a national register to identify, describe and measure risks to guide spending and planning.\n\nThe White House said it would enable \"state and local governments to better understand, plan for, and address the needs of their citizens.\"\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nKyle Stewart\n\nLawrence Hurley\n\nTrump and his allies have been calling for the impeachment of U.S. District Judge James Boasberg after he blocked the deportation of migrants under the Alien Enemies Act. The push to get rid of Boasberg became more serious today when Trump himself weighed in and agreed.\n\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement afterward, rebuking Trump and his allies for going after judges who rule against the administration.\n\nIndeed, Congress impeaches not to retaliate against judges who have issued rulings they disagree with but instead to remove judges who have committed crimes or been alleged to have taken part in bribery or other behaviors that would preclude them from doing their duties on the bench.\n\nHere's a look at the history and process of impeaching judges.\n\nRead the full story here .\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nDoha Madani\n\nA federal judge ordered the government to reinstate U.S. Agency for International Development systems today, ruling that the accelerated shutdown of the agency led by Elon Musk \"likely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang ordered Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to reinstate access to email, payment, security notification and all other electronic systems for all current USAID employees and contractors. He also ordered it to provide written confirmation of compliance to the court within seven days.\n\n\"The court will require Defendants, within 14 days, to secure and submit a written agreement among all necessary parties that ensures that USAID will be able to reoccupy USAID headquarters at its original location, in the event of a final ruling in favor of Plaintiffs,\" the order said.\n\nHe also ordered DOGE and Musk not to take any action regarding USAID without the express authorization of a USAID official with legal authority to do so.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nSahil Kapur\n\nDanté Stewart\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nAfter days of clashes within the party over last week's government shutdown fight, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y., are trying to get back on the same page.\n\nDuring separate public appearances today, the two congressional Democratic leaders sought to return their focus to battling Trump and his agenda, particularly the potential Medicaid cuts his Republican allies in Congress are looking at in their party-line bill for taxes, immigration and other policy priorities.\n\nRead the full story here .\n\nAstha Rajvanshi\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nThe White House said today that Trump and Putin have agreed that the process to reach a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine would begin with an energy infrastructure ceasefire.\n\n\"This conflict should never have started and should have been ended long ago with sincere and good faith peace efforts,\" the White House said in a readout of the call between the two leaders.\n\nRead the full story here .\n\nPeter Alexander\n\nTara Prindiville\n\nSydney Carruth Sydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt today confirmed reporting that Elon Musk's satellite internet service Starlink is providing Wi-Fi around the White House campus , saying it was done to improve internet connectivity.\n\n\"Just like the Biden Administration did on numerous occasions, the White House is working to improve WiFi connectivity on the complex,\" Leavitt said in a statement this afternoon.\n\nThe Starlink service at the White House is the latest expansion in the federal government's reliance on the SpaceX-operated internet service provider. Musk, an unpaid Trump adviser who is overseeing the administration's efforts to sharply downsize the federal government, owns and operates the company.\n\nMusk has been criticized for continuing to oversee his portfolio of private companies - many of which, including Starlink , have federal government contracts - while working in the federal government himself.\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nVance will be the next Republican National Committee finance chair, the first time a sitting vice president has concurrently served in the role, the RNC announced today.\n\nVance said in a statement that to \"fully enact the MAGA mandate\" and Trump's vision, \"we must keep and grow our Republican majorities in 2026.\"\n\nTrump said in a statement that Vance would \"do a fantastic job,\" adding that \"he knows how to fight and win tough races.\"\n\nKyle Stewart\n\nSydney Carruth Sydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., voiced his support this morning for his Senate counterpart, Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as he faces mounting backlash within his party over his handling of the government funding fight last week.\n\nSchumer led a group of Democratic senators to vote in favor of a Republican-backed government funding bill Friday to avert a federal government shutdown. Schumer argued that advancing the bill, which opens the door for sweeping cuts to Medicaid and other entitlement programs, was less dangerous than allowing the government to shut down as the Trump administration aims to dismantle its workforce.\n\nJeffries, despite having publicly urged Schumer and Senate Democrats to block the GOP funding bill, told NBC News today that \"I do\" support Schumer's Senate leadership. The pair \"had a good conversation\" Sunday \"about the path forward, particularly as it relates to making sure we all speak with one voice in the effort to stop these Medicaid cuts from ever being enacted into law,\" he said.\n\nSchumer canceled several promotional events scheduled this week as part of his tour for his new book, \"Antisemitism in America: A Warning.\" His media team cited \"security concerns\" amid the backlash that followed Friday's vote.\n\nJeffries said today that his members remain united in their effort to fight back on potential Medicaid cuts.\n\n\"You know, as House Democrats, we stand by our decision to oppose the Republican spending bill, because the partisan Republican spending bill that was not negotiated with Democrats, it was written by Donald Trump and House Republicans, would hurt families, hurt veterans and hurt seniors,\" he said.\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nJacob Soboroff\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nThe Trump administration says it is moving to reinstate more than 24,000 probationary workers it fired as part of its efforts to slash the federal workforce, court documents filed yesterday show.\n\nOfficials at 18 departments and agencies submitted signed declarations detailing their teams' efforts to rehire the fired workers to comply with court orders. Last week two federal judges ordered the administration to temporarily reinstate thousands of probationary workers who were fired.\n\nBut many of the employees being reinstated won't be getting right back to work; instead, they'll be placed on administrative leave.\n\nRead the full story here .\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nThe Treasury Department announced today that two IRS employees who investigated Hunter Biden for tax evasion will become senior advisers at the department.\n\n\"I am pleased to welcome Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler to the Treasury Department, where they will help us drive much-needed cultural reform within the IRS,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.\n\nBessent said Shapley and Ziegler will help to \"further the agency's focus on collections, modernization, and customer service, so we can deliver a more effective and efficient IRS experience for hardworking American taxpayers.\"\n\nThe Treasury Department claimed Shapley and Ziegler faced retaliation after they spoke publicly about their investigation of Biden and alleging in congressional testimony that he had received preferential treatment from the Justice Department.\n\nDemocrats questioned whether a GOP-aligned organization was behind the testimony as part of an effort to target Biden, former President Joe Biden's son. An FBI agent who oversaw the agency's probe into Hunter Biden also rejected Shapley's allegation that there was any interference.\n\nHunter Biden pleaded guilty last year in the federal tax evasion case . Joe Biden eventually pardoned his son for those charges, as well as federal gun charges.\n\nYixuan Tan\n\nA Canadian actress says she experienced \"inhumane\" treatment after being detained by U.S. immigration officials while trying to cross the border from Mexico.\n\nJasmine Mooney, whose credits include \"American Pie Presents: The Book of Love,\" said she was trying to renew her work visa when she approached the U.S. border near San Diego on March 3, but was denied entry and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"I was put in a cell, and I had to sleep on a mat with no blanket, no pillow, with an aluminum foil wrapped over my body like a dead body for two and a half days,\" Mooney, who is also the co-founder of a health drink brand, told local San Diego news outlet KGTV .\n\nHer story echoes those of German nationals and others who have found themselves unexpectedly detained as the Trump administration ramps up border enforcement and tightens immigration policies.\n\nMooney said she and about 30 other people \"were up for 24 hours wrapped in chains\" as they were transferred to a private for-profit detention center in Arizona.\n\n\"I have never in my life seen anything so inhumane,\" Mooney said.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection declined to tell KGTV why Mooney had been detained, citing privacy restrictions, but said the agency treats all travelers with integrity, respect and professionalism.\n\nMooney, who is originally from Vancouver, returned to Canada over the weekend.\n\n\"No one deserves to go through that, what I witnessed,\" she said, according to Global News .\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nChloe Atkins\n\nDareh Gregorian\n\nThe Justice Department on Tuesday refused to answer a number of questions from a federal judge who had demanded more information on deportations that were carried out under a rarely used wartime act.\n\n\"The Government maintains that there is no justification to order the provision of additional information, and that doing so would be inappropriate,\" the Justice Department said in a court filing responding to U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's ruling that it provide him with more information.\n\nThe filing, however, did include a declaration from an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement answering some of the questions the judge had posed at a hearing Monday, at which he expressed frustration that the government had appeared to snub his order halting the deportations and its refusal to answer questions about its actions.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nPeter Alexander\n\nA White House official told NBC News the call between Trump and Putin is over. The call lasted over an hour and a half.\n\nLawrence Hurley\n\nWASHINGTON - Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement rebuking Trump and his allies for calling to impeach judges who have ruled against the administration.\n\n\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\" Roberts said in a statement.\n\nTrump allies have called for various judges to be impeached for blocking administration policies in the first months of his second term.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTara Prindiville\n\nAccording to White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, Trump's call with Putin is still ongoing as of 11:32 a.m. - meaning it has been going on for over an hour and a half so far.\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nTrump lashed out this morning at a federal judge who has ordered the administration to pause deportations under the rarely invoked Alien Enemies Act.\n\nYesterday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg questioned a government lawyer over the administration's response to a weekend court order where he demanded that planes carrying deportees under the Alien Enemies Act be turned around. Deportees ultimately arrived in El Salvador, raising questions about the timing of the flights.\n\n\"This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"WE DON'T WANT VICIOUS, VIOLENT, AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS, MANY OF THEM DERANGED MURDERERS, IN OUR COUNTRY.\"\n\nIt is unclear how the administration determined that the people deported are members of a Venezuelan gang. It is also unclear whether the deportees had any court hearings ahead of being deported.\n\nTrump did not explicitly name Boasberg in his post, but he appeared to be referring to the deportation case that the judge presides over.\n\nTrump's allies have pushed for the impeachment of judges , with Rep.

Modi and Trump have a personal relationship that goes back years, and are seen as having similar worldviews, especially as the U.S. looks to India as a counter to China.\n\nIn his first post on Truth Social , the Indian leader posted a picture of himself with Trump during the \"Howdy Modi\" rally in Houston during his 2019 visit to the U.S., saying he was \"delighted\" to join the platform.\n\nModi has been making an effort to appeal to Trump supporters lately, including by appearing on Lex Fridman's podcast, the link to which was shared by Trump yesterday.\n\nYamiche Alcindor\n\nCharles Spitzer-Stadtlander, a probationary employee with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) who was fired Feb. 14 as part of the cuts pushed by the Department of Government Efficiency, was reinstated today, according to an email shared exclusively with NBC News.\n\nSpitzer-Stadtlander was one of several employees who was working on a warning radar system for Hawaii to detect incoming missiles, through a program that was in part funded by the Defense Department. The program was part of the FAA's National Airspace System Defense Program and involves radars providing longer-range detection around the nation's borders.\n\nThe email states that the Transportation Department is \"rescinding\" Spitzer-Stadtlander's \"probationary/trial period termination\" and explains that the department is taking this action to be \"in compliance with the order issued March 13 by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.\" The email goes on to say he will be \"reinstated with pay and benefits\" to his previous position and will receive backpay for the period in which he was previously terminated.\n\nSpitzer-Stadtlander told NBC News he plans to return to his job.\n\n\"I'm returning to my job because I love serving the American people and working for national security. It's an honor of my lifetime,\" he said. \"I want to be able to do my job without chaos and uncertainty. Public service and national security are not places for politics or instability.\"\n\n\"Though I'm glad to be reinstated, it's important to remember that two courts found that the termination of probationary employees en masse and for a false reason of poor performance was unlawful,\" he added. \"What happened was incredibly hurtful and traumatic. But since I work for the American people and in service of the mission, that's all that matters and all that I'm keeping my focus on.\"\n\nSpitzer-Stadtlander declined to answer how his case will move forward as he has a pending appeal related to his initial termination.\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nThe Trump administration is asking a federal judge to reverse his decision to block the president's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants.\n\nThe move, which came in an overnight filing, is the latest development in the legal battle over whether the administration can deport alleged gang members using the authority of a rarely invoked act.\n\nThe administration argued in the filings that the \"court lacks jurisdiction\" over the claims of the Venezuelan plaintiffs, and that those suing the administration \"have not shown the requisite irreparable harm.\"\n\n\"The alleged harms to Plaintiffs are overwhelmingly outweighed by the President's interest in using his statutory and constitutional authority to address what he has identified as an invasion or predatory incursion by a group undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare,\" the filing said.\n\nThe judge had previously ordered any flights carrying deportees subject to Trump's proclamation to turn around, but it was later revealed that the planes had arrived in El Salvador, raising questions about the timing of the flights and custody handover.\n\nPatrick Smith\n\nMore than half of Americans want the U.S. to help Ukraine regain territory it has lost since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, even if that means prolonging the conflict, new research shows.\n\nAn opinion poll from Gallup released this morning found 53% of respondents support the U.S. aiding Ukraine's defense efforts, compared to 45% who want a quick end to the conflict even if that means conceding land to Russia.\n\nTrump has sharply turned U.S. away from former President Joe Biden's policy of pledging huge financial and military aid to Ukraine, claiming that he actively supports neither side and is working toward a peace deal. A national NBC News poll found yesterday that a majority of Americans, 61%, support Ukraine over Russia and that most believe Trump favors Russia.\n\n\"Looking ahead, this increase in public preference for stronger U.S. involvement may pressure the Trump administration to recalibrate its Ukraine policy, especially if Russia violates potential ceasefire agreements,\" Gallup said in its analysis of the figures.\n\nYesterday's Gallup poll also showed that a record number of people believe the U.S. isn't doing enough to help Ukraine in its war effort; 46% said assistance wasn't enough, a rise of 16 points since December, in a sign some voters are turning against Trump's self-described neutral stance.\n\nSupport for Ukrainian aid is highest among Democrats and independent voters, but the 56% of Republicans who feel the U.S. is doing too much to help Ukraine is a fall of 11 points in the last three months.\n\nGallup's research was carried out between March 3 and 11, after the chaotic and divisive meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump and Vice President JD Vance on Feb. 28.

It is unclear whether funding would then be further extended for the program, which is administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nThe women had appealed for urgent help to allow them to continue their studies abroad, saying that their return to Afghanistan, where the Taliban has severely curtailed women's rights, \"would mean the permanent loss of our education and exposure to severe risks, including oppression, insecurity, and a future without opportunities.\"\n\nDan De Luce\n\nYixuan Tan\n\nTulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, has retweeted a post by a far-right commentator who praised the dismantling of Voice of America and other U.S. government-funded news outlets.\n\nIan Miles Cheong, a contributor to the Russian state media outlet RT, claimed that Voice of America, Radio Free Asia and other outlets run by the U.S. Agency for Global Media \"produced and disseminated far-left propaganda, including media hostile to conservatives in Central European countries such as Poland, Slovakia and Hungary\" and perpetuated \"pro-war narratives against Russia.\"\n\nThe U.S. Agency for Global Media, an independent U.S. government agency, was one of seven entities Trump designated for elimination in an executive order last Friday, in a move critics said was a win for authoritarian regimes such as China, where state media cheered the decision to shut the outlets known for their reporting on issues such as human rights and religious freedom.\n\nSpeaking earlier today, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to comment on Chinese state media reports or U.S. domestic policy, but said \"it is not a secret that those U.S. media outlets make biased reporting on China.\"\n\nBridget Bowman\n\nThe issue of diversity, equity and inclusion programs is among the most tightly divided and polarizing questions in the United States, with wide gaps emerging along partisan and racial lines, according to the latest national NBC News poll .\n\nTrump has made dismantling DEI programs an early focus of his administration, and voters are split over the future of DEI programs in the workplace, with deep differences depending on their political party.\n\nHalf of registered voters (49%) in the NBC News poll say DEI programs should be eliminated \"because they create divisions and inefficiencies in the workplace by putting too much emphasis on race and other social factors over merit, skills and experience.\"\n\nAnd 48% say DEI programs in the workplace should continue \"because diverse perspectives reflect our country, create innovative ideas and solutions, encourage unity and make our workplaces fair and inclusive.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nElyse Perlmutter-Gumbiner\n\nGabe Gutierrez\n\nTrump is expected to speak today with Putin as the United States tries to mediate a diplomatic solution to end Russia's three-year war with Ukraine.\n\n\"We have tremendous things to report tomorrow, speaking with President Putin of Russia to save some soldiers who are in deep trouble.

I'm speaking to President Putin tomorrow morning,\" he said.\n\nHe later posted on Truth Social, \"Many elements of a Final Agreement have been agreed to, but much remain.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at yesterday's briefing that \"we've never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment.\"\n\nTrump said Sunday that he and Putin will discuss \"land\" and \"power plants, because that's a big question.\"\n\n\"But I think we have a lot of it already discussed, very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia.

They've been working on that,\" Trump said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Putin can't be trusted because Russia hasn't stuck to its previous agreements with Ukraine. That was the message he communicated to Trump in late February when h e clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance at the White House .

While Russia would support a pause in the fighting, \"there are issues that need to be discussed,\" he said, adding that he may need to \"have a phone call with Trump.\"\n\nIn an apparent response to his statements, President Donald Trump said Thursday that Putin put out \"a promising statement\" but that he would like to see Russia agree to a ceasefire.\n\nAt a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office, Trump said he hoped Russia would \"do the right thing,\" adding that \"serious discussions\" with Putin and others are underway.\n\nAsked whether he was willing to meet with Putin, Trump said, \"I'd love to meet with him and talk to him.\"\n\nTrump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow on Thursday and is expected to meet with Putin.\n\nPutin had expressed concern that the temporary ceasefire suggested by the United States and Ukraine would give Kyiv's forces an opportunity to regroup and questioned the mechanisms for preventing that during a potential ceasefire. Details like who would monitor and enforce the truce would also need to be considered, he said.\n\nPutin has long held maximalist demands for ending a war in which Russia believes it has the upper hand . He has previously said he wants Ukraine to withdraw from its regions partly occupied by Russia - essentially giving even more land to the Kremlin - promise never to join NATO and protect Russian culture and language inside the country.\n\nEarlier Thursday, he urged his soldiers to secure a quick and decisive victory on a visit to the front lines.\n\nPutin's statement was Moscow's first public reaction to the temporary 30-day ceasefire plan Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Ukrainian counterparts sketched out in Saudi Arabia this week . Trump has suggested he could hit Russia with sanctions if it rejected the proposal.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Putin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov called the outlined plan \"nothing else than a temporary respite for the Ukrainian military, nothing more.\"\n\nHe told Russian state media that the \"goal is still a long-term peaceful settlement ... [that] takes into account the legitimate interests of our country.\"\n\n\"Steps that imitate peaceful actions, it seems to me, are of no use to anyone,\" he added, saying that he conveyed that position to U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz in a phone call Wednesday.\n\nPutin, a former KGB agent, was dressed in military fatigues as he visited Kursk, the only region of Russia partly occupied by Ukrainian troops. Soon afterward, the Russian Defense Ministry said it had recaptured the town of Sudzha, the largest settlement previously occupied by Ukrainian forces.\n\n\"Our task in the near future, in the shortest possible time frame, is to decisively defeat the enemy entrenched in the Kursk region,\" Putin said. He also suggested creating \"a security zone\" on the border.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday at a media briefing that \"there is no doubt that the Kursk region will be liberated soon enough.\"\n\nRubio may discuss the war when he meets Thursday with the top diplomats at the Group of Seven, or G7, summit in Quebec City, a potentially awkward appointment, given that Trump has repeatedly said he wants to take over Canada.\n\nU.S. and Russian officials have been talking behind the scenes this week. Trump had dispatched Witkoff to Russia while threatening sanctions against the Kremlin.\n\n\"I can do things financially that would be very bad for Russia,\" Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office. \"I don't want to do that, because I want to get peace.\"\n\nDespite the threat, Trump has asked the Kremlin for few concessions while openly suggesting that Ukraine will have to agree to many of Putin's demands.\n\nEuropean leaders have welcomed the suggestion from talks in Saudi Arabia of an interim 30-day ceasefire . But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned in his nightly address Wednesday about Russia's history of breaking truces.\n\n\"The key is our partners' ability to ensure that Russia is ready not to deceive but to truly end the war,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian officials and residents say they want peace, but only alongside security guarantees that ensure the Kremlin does not attack again.\n\n\"I think 99% of Ukrainians wants the war to end in a fair way,\" Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv oblast, told NBC News on Wednesday. \"We want some guarantees that it will not come back in a couple of years.\"\n\nHere, in the southern city of Mykolaiv, some residents are deeply unimpressed by what they see as Trump's attempts to force Ukraine into an unfavorable and risky settlement.\n\nIt's like \"a young child's tricks,\" said Yuriy, 46, a construction worker pushing a baby in a stroller near the city's memorial for dead soldiers. \"My daughter is acting in her 1-month life better than Trump in his 70-plus years. She at least s---- in her diapers, and that guy s---- on the whole world.\"\n\nOne country taking no chances is Poland, the former Eastern Bloc nation that raised defense spending to 4.7% this year and is among Russia's most vocal critics.\n\nPresident Andrzej Duda told The Financial Times newspaper Thursday that he wanted the United States to redeploy U.S. nuclear weapons from Western Europe to inside his country.\n\n\"There should also be a shift of the NATO infrastructure east,\" he said. \"For me, this is obvious.\"\n\nNBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent\n\nAlexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Now, U.S. pressure might do the job.\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nLONDON - Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy . Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine's single most important backer, the United States.\n\nEither Zelenskyy \"needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson , R-La., told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance , and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \"up to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\"\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \"a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\" He told CNN that \"if it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy's either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\"\n\nMeanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn't sure if the U.S. \"can ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\" He said that Ukraine's leader \"either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\"\n\nCritics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow's yearslong bid to oust Ukraine's pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv's domestic political divisions during wartime.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \"unprecedented event\" that showed \"Zelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\" The exchange was part of Ukraine's \"refusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\" he said. \"Only a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\"\n\nStill, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week's clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.\n\n\"If they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\" Zelenskyy told British media. \"It's not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\"\n\nTrump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine's indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia . That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy  \"a dictator without elections.\"\n\nMore and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support  up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.\n\nOther polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy's domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.\n\nZelenskyy \"was elected in 2019 with the large margin,\" said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn't a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \"a bit populistic\" because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.\n\nOne man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's former top military commander - known as the Iron General - whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey - higher than his boss, the president.\n\nBut in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \"no.\"\n\nStill, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.\n\nOne soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \"The only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\"\n\nYevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy's Servant of the People party, said her leader has \"made it clear he's not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\" she added. \"Our defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy's leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\"\n\nTrump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy's approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \"lose in a landslide.\"\n\nThere doesn't appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy's political rivals.\n\nAlexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv.\n\nAlexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.\n\nVictor Sema is a freelance producer based in Kyiv\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Now, President Donald Trump has given Putin a big boost- and possibly re-entry onto the global stage - by offering him much of what he's been asking for in Ukraine .\n\nWhile Trump has made no secret that he planned a radical departure from Joe Biden's goal of an ostensible outright Ukrainian victory , his comments Wednesday - including that Russia \"fought for that land and they lost a lot of soldiers\" -  startled observers, and apparently governments, across Europe.\n\n\"Trump has given Ukraine to Putin,\" former Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves wrote on X . And Michael McFaul , a former U.S. ambassador to Russia who is attending this week's Munich Security Conference, asked why the Trump administration was \"giving Putin gifts - Ukrainian land and no NATO membership for Ukraine - before negotiations even begin.\"\n\nHe added: \"I've negotiated with the Russians. You never give up anything to them for free.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy put on a brave face in his response - as many observers say he has little choice but to do when it comes to Washington, Ukraine's biggest benefactor - saying that while Trump's phone call with Putin on Wednesday was \"not pleasant,\" he still trusted Trump's assertion that Moscow was not being given priority.\n\nStill, Zelenskyy insisted it needed to have a seat at the negotiating table.\n\n\"It's important that everything does not go according to Putin's plan, in which he wants to do everything to make his negotiations bilateral - between him and the United States of America,\" he said Thursday during a visit to Khmelnytskyi in western Ukraine. \"We, as a sovereign country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us.\"\n\nTrump's comments will be very badly received in Kyiv, according to Orysia Lutsevych, a director at Chatham House, a London think tank.\n\nThe remarks \"show the U.S.' weakness, as it caters to Putin's wishes without Russia having to compromise or concede anything,\" she told NBC News.\n\nWhile Russia has made slow gains on the battlefield in the last year, it still commands roughly the same 20% of Ukrainian land that it did 12 months ago. In addition, Ukrainian forces still hold a sliver of Russian territory.\n\nEuropean powers are also typically measured in their statements to the White House. But they expressed clear anxiety that Trump might be negotiating with Putin while leaving both them and Zelenskyy out of the conversation.\n\n\"Ukraine and Europe must be part of any negotiations,\" France, Germany, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement. It did not mention Trump by name, but its meaning was unambiguous. \"We are looking forward to discussing the way ahead together with our American allies.\"\n\nAsked about the criticisms of Trump's Ukraine strategy, Brian Hughes, a National Security Council spokesman, said in an emailed statement that Trump \"inherited a world on fire thanks to a generation of so-called experts from the foreign policy establishment.\"\n\nThe president was \"quickly reversing their terrible mistakes, and America is once again the dominant force for peace and stability,\" he said. He wrote that Trump's \"America First diplomacy is paying real dividends for Americans and for peace-loving people across the globe.\"\n\nThough American allies knew a stark new era was coming under Trump, the speed and frankness of his words and actions this week have stunned even seasoned observers of the conflict.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump had a call with Putin - before making a call to Zelenskyy - in which he appeared to offer up many of the Kremlin's demands with little in return.\n\n\"We had a great call,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. He said he was \"OK\" with Ukraine not getting NATO membership and that it was \"unlikely\" it would get back territory invaded by Russia.\n\n\"I think President Putin wants peace and President Zelenskyy wants peace, and I want peace,\" he said. \"I just want to see people stop getting killed.\"\n\nTrump also said he and Putin may meet in Saudi Arabia on an unspecified date.\n\nNevertheless, Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's counter-disinformation center, was adamant that his country \"will not be left out of the negotiations under any circumstances.\"\n\nHe told NBC News that \"Ukraine and the United States have a substantive dialogue\" and that it was \"important not to let Putin manipulate\" the process.\n\nOn Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that American troops would not be part of any peacekeeping mission sent to Ukraine, telling Europe that it would be expected to front up resources.\n\nBiden and other presidents had fudged the issue of Ukraine's NATO membership, knowing that would inflame the already hostile relations with Moscow. But Trump took it off the table outright.\n\n\"Maybe Ukraine will have to give up territory. Maybe Ukraine will not join NATO now. Maybe U.S. soldiers will not be part of a peacekeeping mission,\" McFaul wrote. \"But all of these concessions to Putin should be negotiated in return for Russian concessions that advance Ukraine and America.\"\n\nAlexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Read it now .\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in a phone call Tuesday on a temporary pause on attacks on energy and infrastructure in the Ukraine war.\n\nIf sealed, the initial pact would be followed by a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, and then a full ceasefire, according to readouts from Moscow and Washington. Negotiations are set to begin immediately in the Middle East, the White House said.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had told Russiaâs military to âimmediatelyâ cease targeting Ukraineâs energy infrastructure for 30 days. In the more than 90-minute-long phone call the two leaders apparently agreed that the war in Ukraine should be brought to an end with a durable peace âÂ but crucially, the Putin did not agree to the broader ceasefire Washington and Kyiv have pushed for.\n\nUkraineâs President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he supported the new energy and infrastructure ceasefire proposal, and said he hoped to speak with Trump shortly: âI think it will be right that we will have a conversation with President Trump and we will know in detail what the Russians offered the Americans or what the Americans offered the Russians .â\n\nAccording to the Russian readout of the call, Putin stressed a number of conditions for resolving the conflict, including âthe complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence to Kyivâ and the need to stop mobilization in Ukraine â those terms run counter to Kyivâs desire for an unconditional ceasefire, leaving the future of negotiations unclear. âThey are talking, but really the real takeaway is there is no ceasefire agreement,â one analyst told Reuters.\n\nWhile one Ukrainian analyst said Russiaâs demands were âimpossibleâ for Kyiv to meet, Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev described it as âa PERFECT call .â\n\nAfter the conversation, Ukrainian media reported that Russia had struck targets across Ukraine, with politicians and local outlets said led to power outages in one eastern city.\n\nIt is unclear whether the two leaders discussed where a ceasefire line would be drawn, but ahead of the talks, Trump had told reporters, â I think we will be talking about land .â\n\nâWeâll be talking about power plants,â he had said, likely a reference to Ukraineâs Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, which Russia occupied in 2022.\n\nTrump is also considering whether to recognize Crimea , which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, as Russian territory as part of any future peace deal, Semafor reported.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship"

      "text": "Trump weighs recognizing Crimea as Russian territory in bid to end war\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe Trump administration is considering recognizing Ukraineâs Crimea region as Russian territory as part of any future agreement to end Moscowâs war on Kyiv, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nAdministration officials have also discussed the possibility of having the US urge the United Nations to do the same, according to both people. Such a request would align the Trump administration with the position of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has long seen Crimea as his nationâs territory.\n\nThe administrationâs previously unreported openness to those options comes as Trump prepares for a Tuesday call with Putin, with a potential 30-day ceasefire deal on the table. Trump told reporters Sunday evening aboard Air Force One that negotiators had already discussed â dividing up certain assets .â\n\nTrump has not formally made any decisions, and the possible Crimea moves are two of a multitude of options being floated as his administration pushes for an end to the war.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. In a statement to Semafor after publication of this story, National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said that the administration has âmade no such commitments and we will not negotiate this deal through the media.â\n\nâJust two weeks ago, both Ukraine and Russia were miles apart on a ceasefire agreement, and we are now closer to a deal thanks to the leadership of President Trump. The goal remains the same: stop the killing and find a peaceful resolution to this conflict,â Hughes added.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTrump administration officials have talked openly about the need for Ukraine to make territorial concessions to Russia in order to bring the three-year war to an end, and the president himself has said in the past that heâs willing to consider Crimea to be part of Russia. But since Trump took office, his advisers havenât publicly divulged many specifics about what they might offer to Putin.\n\nUkrainians have âsuffered greatly and their people have suffered greatly, and itâs hard in the aftermath of something like that to even talk about concessions,â Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters last week. âBut thatâs the only way this is going to end to prevent more suffering.â\n\nA push by the US to formally recognize Crimea â which Russia invaded and illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014 â as Russian land would likely draw tremendous pushback from Europe as well as from Kyiv, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly resisted territorial concessions. The US, Ukraine, and much of the international community have recognized Crimea as Ukrainian, despite Russiaâs occupation of the peninsula.\n\nAt the same time, security experts have serious doubts about Ukrainian forcesâ ability to retake Crimea through military means. Even Zelenskyy acknowledged last year that the territory could only be restored to Ukraine through diplomacy, something Russia is unlikely to agree to.\n\nTrump first floated the prospect of recognizing Crimea as Russian territory years before Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While running for president in 2016 â and subsequently, during his first term â the president repeatedly said heâd âlook atâ whether the US would move to recognize it.\n\nâThe people of Crimea, from what Iâve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were,â Trump said during a 2018 interview with ABC Newsâ George Stephanopoulos. âAnd you have to look at that, also.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nUS President Donald Trump said he plans to discuss negotiations to end the Ukraine war with Russiaâs Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.\n\nThe president is hoping to secure Putinâs support for a 30-day ceasefire proposal already accepted by Kyiv, as speculation mounts that Moscow is playing for time in an effort to seize more territory.\n\nAsked about concessions, Trump said Ukrainian and Russian negotiators had mulled âdividing up certain assets,â including land and power plants.\n\nRussiaâs deputy foreign minister made no reference to the proposed truce in remarks Sunday, stressing instead that Russia will seek â ironclad guarantees â that Ukraine will not be granted NATO membership as part of any deal.\n\nThe weekend negotiations came as Ukrainian troops told of a âcatastrophicâ withdrawal from Russiaâs Kursk region after a lightning advance by Moscow, taking a major bargaining chip for Kyiv off the table even as the ceasefire talks gained momentum. Kyivâs forces, which seized almost 500 square miles of Russian territory in a bold offensive last summer, are clinging to a narrow strip along the border , with one soldier telling the BBC of â panic and collapse â along the frontline. Putin has said a 30-day truce would let Kyiv regroup, but now seems focused on drawing out talks with Washington while also escalating Moscowâs offensive, especially in Kursk, The New York Times wrote.\n\nRussiaâs economy has been crushed under Western sanctions, and Kremlin officialsâ questions over lifting penalties as part of a future peace deal indicate âwhat is the most painfulâ for them, Kyivâs top sanctions official told Politico, adding that sanctions relief could help â leverage â a better outcome for Kyiv. Some investors appear to be interpreting the US-led negotiations as a signal that sanctions could soon be lifted: Surging bets in Russian bonds and the rouble indicate â there is definitely some excitement, â a fixed-income analyst told the Financial Times.\n\nWhile Russiaâs Vladimir Putin has slightly softened his tone toward a temporary truce, European officials are worried that Moscowâs conditions for a deal do not indicate a genuine desire for peace. French President Emmanuel Macron called for more united European-US pressure on Russia Saturday to accept the proposed ceasefire deal, but US negotiators still seem more aligned to Moscow than Brussels, Reuters wrote: Trumpâs national security adviser on Sunday suggested a full retreat by Russian forces in Ukraine was perhaps unrealistic. Former NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday that lasting peace in Europe may depend on a European nuclear umbrella : âIt will send a pretty clear signal to Trumpâ¦ that the defense of Europe is serious.â\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

Starmer is set to present Trump with a plan to send 30,000 European troops to Ukraine, but is holding out for US air support, The Telegraph reported.

A public spat between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last Friday in the Oval Office raised doubts about continued U.S. financial support for Ukraine.\n\n\"The new (U.S.) administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,\" Peskov said in an interview aired Sunday on Russian state media. \"This largely coincides with our vision.\"\n\nPeskov conducted the interview on Wednesday, two days before a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump at the White House unraveled, with Trump accusing the Ukrainian leader of wanting to start World War Three .

Seth Moulton, D-Mass., blasted recent comments on Russia and Ukraine by special envoy Steve Witkoff as \"insane,\" accusing President Donald Trump's real estate mogul friend of \"negotiating for the other side.\"\n\nIn a Friday interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson , Witkoff bandied Russian talking points used to legitimize the invasion of Ukraine and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \"super smart guy\" who he takes \"at his word.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN's Kate Bolduan on Monday morning, Moulton, a former Marine, said it was \"insane that you have a U.S. negotiator taking the side of our enemy.\"\n\n\"He's literally negotiating for the other side, negotiating for the aggressor, negotiating for the violator of international law,\" Moulton said.\n\nWitkoff has taken a leading role in the Trump administration's ongoing talks with Russia and Ukraine to negotiate an end to the war, now in its fourth year. In the hour-plus interview with Carlson, he said he doesn't see Putin as \"a bad guy.\"\n\nComing two days before U.S. talks to end the war restarted in Saudi Arabia, Witkoff's comments pointed to a unprecedented shift in the U.S. stance towards Russia and its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWitkoff visited Putin earlier this month in a meeting that \"got personal,\" he told Carlson. Putin commissioned a portrait of Trump from a \"leading Russian artist\" that Witkoff delivered to the White House, he said.\n\n\"It was such a gracious moment,\" he added.\n\nAfter Trump was shot in the ear during an assassination attempt last summer, Putin \"prayed\" for Trump , Witkoff said, \"not because he was the President of the United States or could become the President of the United States,\" but because \"he was praying for his friend.\"\n\nWitkoff implied Russia had legitimate claim to four territories of Ukraine that it illegally seized during the invasion - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.\n\nTaking up a talking point brandished by Russia to legitimize its invasion, he said residents of those territories had voted in favor of Russian annexation. Those elections, held in September 2022, months after Russia invaded, were widely denounced as a sham by the U.S. and its European allies.\n\n\"The Russians are de facto in control of these territories,\" Witkoff said. \"The question is...will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?\"\n\nTrump has strengthened ties with Putin, even as he has berated and criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , provoking alarm from lawmakers and Ukraine's European allies.\n\nHe cut off U.S. aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine for around 10 days after an Oval Office meeting with the Ukrainian leader late last month devolved into a shouting match in which Trump berated him for \"gambling with World War III.\"\n\nTrump has called Putin directly several times - an about-face from former President Joe Biden, who sought to ostracize Putin on the world stage and never dealt with him directly after the Feb. 2022 invasion. Last week, Putin agreed on a call with Trump to pause Russia's attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure for 30 days."

After Moscow and Kyiv agree to stop hitting each other's power plants and electric grids, negotiators would move on to a potential halt in fighting on the Black Sea - and then to a full ceasefire and peace agreement in the 3-year-old Ukraine war , a White House statement said.\n\nTrump said on social media the talk ended \"with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine. ...\n\n\"That process is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of Humanity, get the job done!\"\n\nThe White House said that discussions would begin immediately in the Middle East.\n\nTrump's team has been meeting representatives from Moscow and Kyiv separately to nail down a ceasefire and a framework for a deal to end the war. Trump promised a rapid end to the conflict during the 2024 campaign, but he has has been unable to bring about a resolution so far.\n\nSpecial Envoy Steve Witkoff visited Moscow last week. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke on Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The interactions followed in-person talks with top Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia and set the stage for Tuesday's call between Putin and Trump.\n\nThey talked for at least an hour and a half, the White House indicated. Officials declined to say how much longer the leaders spoke.\n\nA readout from the White House provided scant details on what was discussed. A Kremlin statement said Trump proposed a 30-day halt on energy infrastructure attacks and Putin immediately gave his military the order. Russia also said a prisoner exchange would happen Wednesday with each side releasing 175 people. An additional 23 severely injured Ukrainian troops would also be transferred, the Kremlin said.\n\nTrump also backed a Putin proposal for U.S.-Russia hockey matches, according to the Kremlin. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Monday, the president said he intended to lay the groundwork for a peace deal and implore Putin to spare the lives of Ukrainian soldiers under siege from Russian forces.\n\n\"We had to get Ukraine to do the right thing. It was not an easy situation,\" Trump said. \"But I think they're doing the right thing right now. And we're trying to get a peace agreement done.\"\n\nLast week the United States restored intelligence sharing with Ukraine and lifted a pause on military assistance, as officials awaited Russia's response to the temporary truce.\n\nUkraine agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire on the condition that Russia also accepted the terms of the agreement. That proposal called for a temporary freeze to the conflict and a halt to an intense aerial battle between the two nations.\n\nDisputed territory could be monitored during that time with satellites, intelligence and drones.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously pushed for a truce to bar the use of missiles, long-range drones and attacks on civilian and energy infrastructure. He also offered to halt attacks on Russian ships.\n\nZelenskyy's government has also pushed for Russia to agree to a prisoner exchange , the release of detained civilians and the return of kidnapped Ukrainian children.\n\nUkraine backers immediately slammed the scaled-back agreement as one that would primarily benefit Russia.\n\nThe agreement would keep Ukraine from striking Russia's oil refineries, said Edward Fishman, the former Russia sanctions lead at the State Department in the Obama administration..\n\n\"It's a big cash cow for the Kremlin, selling petroleum products like gasoline,\" said Fishman, the author of \"Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare.\"\n\nAt the same time, Fishman said, the Ukrainians don't want to be seen as an impediment to a ceasefire. \"They're in a tough spot.\"\n\nPutin was likely to pull back from attacks on energy infrastructure in warmer weather anyway, said Luke Coffey, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute.\n\n\"Recognizing the need to offer something to stay in President Trump's good graces, he delivered only the bare minimum,\" said Coffey, who was senior adviser Britain's defense ministry.\n\nZelenskyy, on a visit to Finland, said in a Telegram message that Europe must be included in any negotiations.\n\n\"Europe must be at the negotiating table, and everything that concerns European security must be decided together with Europe,\" Zelenskyy wrote.\n\nThe Ukrainian president has long been wary of Putin's willingness to abide by a ceasefire. He said Monday that Russia had already had a week to agree to the terms of the proposed U.S. truce - and that additional pressure is needed to force Putin's hand.\n\n\"It's clear to everyone in the world - even to those who refused to acknowledge the truth for the past three years - that it is Putin who continues to drag out this war,\" Zelenskyy said. \"He's saying whatever he wants, but not what the whole world wants to hear.\"\n\nU.S. officials have said since the talks began that Ukraine would have to make concessions. They range from territory seized by Russia to its dream of NATO membership and include a battle for control of Europe's largest nuclear power plant.\n\nRussia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and launched a large-scale attack against Ukraine in 2022. It is currently in control of roughly 20% of Ukraine's territory, much of it in the east.\n\nTrump indicated over the weekend that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine has been the topic of early discussion. The plant is under Russian occupation.\n\n\"We'll be talking about land. We'll be talking about power plants because that's a big question, but I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides,\" Trump told reporters Sunday.\n\nUkraine is all but certain to lose out on NATO membership for the foreseeable future, U.S. officials have signaled, and it will have to give up at least some of the territory that Russia seized.\n\n\"The Russians can't conquer all of Ukraine, and obviously it'll be very difficult for Ukraine in any reasonable time period to sort of force the Russians back all the way to where they were in 2014,\" Rubio said last week. \"So the only solution to this war is diplomacy and getting them to a table where that's possible.\"\n\nRussia has said that NATO membership , which it has used as a pretext for its war, is a nonstarter. It has also rejected a UK-led proposal to put European peacekeepers in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has said it will not sign a peace agreement without firm security guarantees, citing Russia's history of violating ceasefires.\n\nTrump has abstained from making security guarantees beyond an unsigned critical minerals agreement that would benefit the U.S. financially if private companies invest in Ukraine's natural resources. He has offered his support to a European peacekeeping force without detailing any potential U.S. involvement.\n\nIn its statement after Trump's call with Putin, the White House emphasized his desire to lessen tension with Russia.\n\n\"There is also a broader strategy at play in President Trump's approach to this war that is informed by the realization that the United States needs to reset relations with Russia,\" said Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington this month."

      "text": "Russia says it will stop fighting in Ukraine in the Black sea. It's said that before.\n\nAs President Donald Trump pushes for a speedy end to Russia's war in Ukraine, Russia and Ukraine struck agreements with the United States on Tuesday to pause fighting on the Black Sea , which borders both countries and contains key shipping routes.\n\nFreezing fighting in the sea has been a goal of the international community from the beginning, but Russia pulled out of a similar deal struck before and it remains unclear whether this one will last.\n\nAfter days of U.S.-led separate negotiations in Saudi Arabia - with Russia on Monday, and with Ukraine on Sunday - the warring countries agreed to the maritime ceasefire on Tuesday, which will allow commercial ships from both nations to pass.\n\nRussia also said it will hold to a promise President Vladimir Putin made to Trump not to attack Ukrainian energy infrastructure .\n\nIn exchange, the U.S. agreed to help Russia get more access to agricultural and fertilizer exports, which will require the U.S. to give Russia back its access to SWIFT , the global financial messaging system, and lift sanctions on one Russian bank. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the Biden administration and Ukraine's European allies cut Russia's major banks off from SWIFT, which facilitates global financial transactions.\n\nThat concession was the latest indication of Trump's reversal of the U.S. position towards Russia and Ukraine. In an interview with far-right talk show host Tucker Carlson on Friday, Trump's lead Ukraine negotiator Steve Witkoff praised Putin and regurgitated talking points the Kremlin uses to legitimize its invasion.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden stood squarely behind Ukraine and in opposition to Russian aggression.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022 . That April and May, Russia focused its offensive on Ukraine's southern coastline on the Black Sea, seizing several major port cities and imposing a blockade on food exports.\n\nThe blockade sparked fears that choking off the supply of Ukrainian grain could worsen food shortages and send prices skyrocketing. Ukraine is a major grain exporter - 15 countries in Africa receive more than half their grain imports from Ukraine and Russia, and Ukraine' was the largest supplier to the World Food Programme, which provides food supplies to vulnerable countries, before the war.\n\nIn July 2022, under international pressure, Russia agreed to allow Ukrainian grain ships to leave the Black Sea. But after a year, it unilaterally ended that agreement , claiming Ukraine was using it to bolster its military posture and pointing to U.S. sanctions that made it harder for Russia to sell its own goods.\n\nTrump promised on the campaign trail to get the war \"settled.\" So far, he has zeroed in on extracting smaller concessions from both sides. Trump officials also met with Ukraine in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, a meeting Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's minister of defense, called \"productive and focused.\"\n\nThe pause on energy strikes, \"has been presented as a big, unanimous act by Putin,\" said Rajan Menon, professor emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York. But if agreed to by both sides, it could work out more in Putin's favor, he said.\n\nIn the past year, Ukraine has used its own drones and, more recently, cruise missiles to hit Russian energy production centers like \"oil refineries, compression plants, natural gas storage plants,\" Menon said. Last week, Russia also accused Ukraine of blowing up a Russian gas pumping station in the Kursk region, calling it an \"act of terrorism.\"\n\nAs a result, an agreement from both sides to halt those strikes could hobble Ukraine more than Russia in it standing in the conflict, according to Menon.\n\nRussia is the world's second-largest producer of natural gas, according to the International Energy Agency . In 2022, it produced more than 27 times more natural gas than Ukraine.\n\nMenon said Ukraine is far more susceptible to bending towards a deal than Russia. Last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy kept the door open to a deal, saying he was he was \"ready to work\" with Trump, after Trump publicly dressed him down in an Oval Office meeting. After the meeting, Trump briefly cut off U.S. aid to Ukraine and stopped sharing its intelligence.\n\nTrump's affinity for Russia and Putin has stirred concern in Washington since his first campaign for president. Ahead of the 2016 election, Trump's campaign expressed support for Putin's invasion two years earlier of the Ukrainian region Crimea. A Senate Intelligence Committee report found that Russia attempted to meddle in that election to boost Trump - and it did so again in 2020 and 2024, according to intelligence officials . And last month, Trump branded Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" while declining to say the same of Putin, who is rated as an authoritarian ruler by numerous pro-democracy groups .\n\n\"The U.S. doesn't have much leverage on Russia,\" Menon said. \"But Ukraine is so dependent on the U.S. that Trump does have a lot of leverage, and Putin knows this very well.\""

We will do everything to make diplomacy effective.

Naturally, it's impossible to fix everything in one day or a week. There is a long way to go,\" Peskov said.\n\nAsked if a meeting between Putin and Trump could take place this month, Peskov was quoted by Interfax as saying: \"Possibly. And possibly not.\"\n\nPutin and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden held a summit in Geneva in June 2021. That was the most recent time a U.S. and Russian leader met face to face, though Biden and Putin had a call in February 2022 and messages were passed via intermediaries.\n\nTrump has upended Western policy on Russia and Ukraine, ordering talks with Russia without Ukraine or European powers, speaking to Putin, and talking about bringing down the price of oil - of which Russia is a major exporter.\n\nTrump says he wants to end the war and that he thinks Putin wants to do a deal. But he has yet to spell out his plan for halting a conflict that has left swathes of Ukraine destroyed, killed or injured hundreds of thousands of people and raised fears of a direct confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world's two biggest nuclear powers.\n\nThe talks in Riyadh were the first that the U.S. and Russia have held to seek an end to the war, the deadliest in Europe since World War Two.\n\nNo Ukrainian or European officials were invited. Kyiv has said it will not accept any deal imposed without its consent.\n\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a Russia-friendly president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, with Russian-backed separatist forces fighting Ukraine's armed forces.\n\nIn 2022, Putin sent his army into Ukraine in what he called a \"special military operation\". He said it was needed to protect Russian-speakers in Ukraine and counter what he said was a grave threat to Russia from potential Ukrainian membership of NATO.\n\nUkraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab that threatens European security, and say that Russia could go further and attack NATO one day. Russia dismisses such claims as nonsense.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Guy Faulconbridge and Lucy Papachristou; editing by Mark Trevelyan)"

Ukraine last week backed the agreement.\n\n\"I expect that there will be a call with both presidents this week, and we're also continuing to engage and have conversation with the Ukrainians,\" special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN Sunday morning, referencing Trump and Putin.\n\nAmong the \"reservations\" Putin said he had about the latest deal were how the ceasefire would be enforced and whether it would allow Ukraine time to build back its armed forces. France and the United Kingdom have offered to provide peacekeeping troops if the U.S. provides support.\n\nPutin has repeatedly spoken about the need to eliminate what he describes as the \"root causes\" of the war that he started and is now into its fourth year. By this, he means NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe and questioning the very concept of Ukrainian sovereignty. In the news conference, Putin said any ceasefire deal would have to include an end to Western arms supplies to Ukraine.\n\nWitkoff met with Putin in Moscow on Thursday, shortly after the Russian president offered his first official response to the proposed ceasefire.\n\n\"It was positive,\" Witkoff said of their hours-long conversation. \"It was a solutions-based discussion.\"\n\nWitkoff declined to outline details of the negotiations, including which conditions for Russia are or are not on the table.

The two spoke last month about Russia's bloody, ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTrump during his joint address to Congress earlier this month  announced that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had sent him a letter expressing gratitude for U.S. support in the war, and said he was willing to sign a deal to allow American access to Ukrainian natural resources.

As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources.\n\nU.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are due to visit an American military base in Greenland on Friday on a trip that was scaled back after an uproar by Greenlanders and Danes.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday, Putin noted that Russia is worried about NATO's activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\n\"We are certainly concerned about NATO members describing the Far North as the region of possible conflicts,\" he said, noting that Russia's neighbors Finland and Sweden have joined the alliance. \"Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but we will closely follow the developments and mount an appropriate response by increasing our military capability and modernizing military infrastructure.\"\n\nRussia has sought to assert its influence over wide areas of the Arctic in competition with the United States, Canada, Denmark and Norway as shrinking polar ice from the warming planet offers new opportunities for resources and shipping routes. China also has shown an increasing interest in the region, believed to hold up to one-fourth of the Earth's undiscovered oil and gas.\n\n\"We won't allow any infringement on our country's sovereignty, reliably safeguard our national interests while supporting peace and stability in the polar region,\" Putin said.\n\nWhile pledging to strengthen Russia's military foothold in the Arctic, Putin said that Moscow was holding the door open to broader international cooperation in the region.\n\n\"The stronger our positions will be, the more significant the results will be and the broader opportunities we will have to launch international projects in the Arctic involving the countries that are friendly to us, and, possibly, Western countries if they show interest in joint work. I'm sure the time will come to launch such projects.\"\n\nKirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and Putin's envoy for international investment who took part in talks with U.S. officials, told reporters last month that Russia and the U.S. should develop joint energy ventures.\n\n\"We need joint projects, including in the Arctic and other regions,\" he said."

      "text": "For Vladimir Putin, Russia's position in the world is personal. Here's what he really wants\n\nManage your account\n\nUS President Donald Trump said he thinks Vladimir Putin wants peace. Ukraine and its European allies don't believe he does, while the Russian leader himself said he wants peace but then refused to sign up to it when presented with the option.\n\nWhat Putin really wants, though, is much, much bigger.\n\nThe Russian president has made no secret of the fact that he believes Ukraine should not exist as an independent state and he has repeatedly said he wants NATO to shrink back to its Cold War-era size.\n\nBut more than anything, he wants to see a new global order - and he wants Russia to play the starring role in it.\n\nPutin and several of his most trusted allies emerged from the remnants of the KGB, the Soviet-era intelligence agency. They have never forgotten the humiliation of the fall of the Soviet Union and are not happy with the way the world has turned out since then.\n\nPutin rose to power during the chaos of the 1990s, when the Russian economy collapsed and had to be rescued by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - another humiliation for the former superpower.\n\nBut from 2000, when Putin became president, steadily rising oil prices made Russia and many Russians richer than ever before. And Russia had a voice. It was invited into the G7 group of the world's largest economies - renamed the G8 after it joined.\n\nBut this was not enough for the Russian leader, Kristine Berzina, a managing director at the German Marshal Fund of United States, told CNN.\n\n\"Putin was happy to throw all that away on behalf of his citizens because of higher geopolitical aims,\" Berzina said. Russia was expelled from the G8, sanctioned by the West and ostracized on the global stage because of its aggression against Ukraine.\n\nBerzina said it was never good enough for Russia to be \"the eighth in the G7.\"\n\n\"That doesn't work within Russia's understanding of its own exceptionalism. It is the largest country in the world, the richest in (natural) resources, so how can it simply be one of the players?\" she said.\n\nTo understand what Putin wants from the current talks with the US, it's key to remember that the two sides are talking because the United States made a policy U-turn under Trump - not because of a fundamental change in Russian thinking.\n\nTrump wants the war in Ukraine to end as soon as possible, even if it means further territorial losses for Ukraine.\n\nThis means Putin has little to lose from talking.\n\nTrump has claimed that \"Russia holds all the cards\" in the war with Ukraine, but the battlefield has been mostly stalled for the past two years.\n\nWhile Russia is making some incremental gains, it is definitely not winning - though this could change if the US was to stop supplying arms and intelligence to Ukraine.\n\n\"Putin went into Ukraine thinking that it will be an easy, quick operation. Three years on, he controls 20% of Ukraine, but at terrible, terrible cost. I mean, essentially the Russians are losing. The thing though is that the Ukrainians are losing faster,\" leading Russia analyst Mark Galeotti told CNN.\n\nFor Putin and the people around him, Trump's push for a ceasefire simply presents an opportunity to secure quick wins while keeping an eye on the long-term goals, he said.\n\n\"Putin is an opportunist. He likes creating dynamic, chaotic situations, which throw up a whole variety of opportunities. And then he can then just pick which opportunity appeals to him, and he can change his mind,\" Galeotti said.\n\nPutin and his aides have made it very clear that their long-term goals have not changed. Even as they talk about wanting peace, Russian officials have continued to insist that the \"root causes\" of the conflict in Ukraine must be \"eliminated.\"\n\nIn the Kremlin's view, these \"root causes\" amount to Ukraine's sovereignty and its democratically elected President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as NATO's expansion to the east in the past 30 years.\n\nPutin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 to force a regime change in Kyiv, planning to install a pro-Moscow government. His goal was to turn Ukraine into a vassal state like Belarus and prevent it from joining the European Union and NATO in the future.\n\nHe has not achieved that goal by using military force, but that doesn't mean he has abandoned it.\n\nInstead, he might try to achieve it by other means.\n\n\"The easiest way for Russia to attain what it wants in a different country is not through military means, but through interference and electoral process,\" Berzina said, adding that it is possible - even likely - that this is what Moscow would try to do after a ceasefire was in place.\n\nThis is likely why Russia keeps questioning Zelensky's legitimacy and pushing for an election - and why Kremlin was delighted when Trump adopted this narrative and called the Ukrainian leader \"a dictator without elections.\" Ukraine's martial law - imposed because of Russia's aggression - prohibits elections from taking place while the conflict is ongoing.\n\nTrump and his vice president, JD Vance, have rejected the idea that Ukraine could join NATO any time soon and Putin has asked for a US commitment that this will not happen to be part of any ceasefire agreement.\n\nBut Berzina said that Ukraine's European allies are not buying Putin's promises that he would stop fighting if Ukraine became - as he called it - neutral.\n\n\"No matter what Trump and Putin think they can arrange this week or this year, many people in Europe now find Putin fundamentally untrustworthy,\" she said.\n\n\"Could there be a desire for Russia to try its hand again militarily? Sure. And that is why the Europeans are very clear-eyed on the potential for future military engagement.\"\n\nAndrei Soldatov, a Russian investigative journalist and security expert who lives in exile in London, said Putin and his aides believe they can \"try to get something out of Trump right now.\"\n\n\"They think they can win some tactical battles but that he would not give them what they really want, which is a complete rearrangement of security arrangements in Europe,\" he said.\n\n\"For the Kremlin, it's not a war with Ukraine, it's a war with the West, and a lot of people in Moscow don't really believe that they can get any kind of lasting agreement with the US,\" Soldatov told CNN.\n\nRussia's wariness of the US goes far back.\n\n\"It's very personal to them because they were all young KGB officers back then, and they lost their social standing, they lost a place in Russian society, they lost the country as they describe it now, and it was extremely humiliating,\" Soldatov said.\n\n\"They really believe that the West has been after the complete destruction and subjugation of Russia for centuries. It's not just propaganda, they really, really believe in this.\" But Putin has also framed his plan for Ukraine within his own - inaccurate - interpretation of history, which goes well beyond the fall of the Soviet Union. Putin has often argued that Ukraine is not a real country because Ukraine and Ukrainians are part of a larger \"historical Russia\"\n\nExperts say this is, of course, nonsense.\n\n\"What he's talking about is the fact that Russia and Ukraine and Belarus share a political ancestor called Rus ... but it's very much not the same thing as any modern country. It was an early to late medieval political entity and to say that Ukraine doesn't have a right to exist because of this shared ancestor - no country looks the same as in the 10th century,\" said Monica White, an associate professor in Russian and Slavonic Studies at the University of Nottingham.\n\nPutin has also often turned to Russia's religious identity in support of his plan. The leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, is one of the loudest supporters of the war.\n\n\"After the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia lost its connection with the ancestral Orthodox lands and I think part of Putin's project is to try to bring back that thread connecting 10th century Rus with this pure orthodox continuity,\" White said. \"What he's doing is actually not so different from some of the early Romanov Tzars who kept trying to get back the Orthodox lands that were under either Ottoman or Catholic rule, and they eventually did.\"\n\nPutin's overwhelming desire is to return Russia to the global stage with a bang, she suggests - by creating a wedge between Europe and the US and teaming up with the West's other adversaries.\n\n\"Russia wants to be at all the important tables - so whatever comes next, maybe it doesn't have to mean territorial conquest in Europe, but I think it does have to be in a starring role in the more powerful bloc, if it sees that to include China or Iran or others, a bloc that is defined by its willingness to disrupt and destabilize,\" White added.\n\nPutin clearly believes that Russia - the largest country in the world by area - should be involved in running the world. He might have a like-minded man in the White House. Trump has made it clear that he believes the biggest and most powerful countries should get what they want - whether it's Greenland, the Panama Canal, or a chunk of Ukraine.\n\n\"I think that the fundamental point is that, as far as Trump is concerned, Ukraine is a bought and paid for vassal state and has to understand its place and accept that, essentially, America will work out some kind of a deal with Russia and then bring it back to Ukraine,\" Galeotti said.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

      "text": "Putin has defied Trump once again - and paid no price\n\nManage your account\n\nDonald Trump's ambition to \"stop the killing\" and secure a ceasefire in Ukraine has collided once again with the intransigence of Vladimir Putin. Yet, astonishingly, the American president seems not to have noticed.\n\nLast week, he told Ukraine's leadership that they would never receive another US weapon or intelligence report unless they agreed in principle to a 30-day ceasefire. So they did.\n\nImmediately afterwards, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, declared that the ball was now in \"Russia's court\" .\n\nPutin's 90-minute phone call with Mr Trump on Tuesday was the moment when the ball should have been returned. But the main public outcome was Putin's rejection of a full ceasefire and agreement only to pause attacks on \"energy and infrastructure\" .\n\nAn agreement which did not last long - as just hours later, Russian forces launched an airstrike targeting the energy infrastructure of Slovyansk, a city in the Donetsk region.\n\nBut even prior to this attack, how did Mr Trump react? The White House could have announced that America would now give Russia a taste of the treatment meted out to Ukraine and muscle Putin into stopping the killing.\n\nInstead, the US \"readout\" of the call contains not a hint of pressure; on the contrary, it talks enthusiastically of how an \"improved bilateral relationship between the US and Russia has a huge upside\" including \"enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability\".\n\nThe conclusion is obvious: Putin has once again defied a public demand from Mr Trump - this time for a full ceasefire - and paid no price.\n\nEven Putin's agreement to stop attacking energy infrastructure amounts to less than might be thought.\n\nUkrainian long-range drone strikes on oil refineries and other assets deep inside Russia have probably inflicted more damage in recent weeks than the Kremlin's barrage of missiles in the other direction.\n\nPutin has played his familiar trick of agreeing to something that binds Ukraine's hands much more tightly than his own.\n\nBut the relative lack of substance in the readout must itself raise suspicions.\n\nTwo presidents do not need to talk for 90 minutes to serve up the thin gruel in the public account of their call.\n\nWhat else did Mr Trump and Putin discuss and what private agreements might they have made?\n\nUkraine and the rest of Europe are not party to these talks: they can only guess at what could be happening behind the scenes.\n\nThe only certainty is that the dismal pattern whereby Putin concedes nothing and offers nothing, while Trump declines to respond with any hint of steel, remains the order of the day.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II,\" he added.\n\nTrump seemed to be referring to the sticking point in Russia's Kursk region, something Putin has discussed as an issue in the talks. He also appeared to echo remarks Putin made in response to the U.S.-Ukraine ceasefire proposal on Thursday that Ukrainian troops are encircled in Kursk -- a scenario Ukraine strongly denied.\n\nPutin responded to Trump's remarks on Friday, saying the soldiers need to surrender to be spared.\n\n\"[In] the event of a ceasefire and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and a worthy treatment in accordance with the norms of international law and the laws of the Russian Federation,\" he said.\n\nMORE: Several Ukrainian drones intercepted overnight just 2 miles away from Kremlin, Russia says\n\nUkraine pushed back Friday against the claims that its troops are surrounded in the Kursk region, where Putin this week ordered forces to \"destroy\" all Ukrainian formations remaining in the contested border region.\n\n\"The reports about the supposed 'encirclement' of Ukrainian units in the Kursk region are false and are being fabricated by the Russians for political purposes and to put pressure on Ukraine and its partners,\" the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said in a statement on Friday.\n\n\"The threat of encirclement of our units is absent,\" it added.\n\nThe statement comes a day after Putin referred to an \"encirclement\" in the Kursk region while remarking on the U.S.-Ukraine ceasefire proposal.\n\n\"We are for it. But there is a nuance,\" Putin said of a 30-day ceasefire during a press briefing. \"First, what are we going to do with the encirclement in the Kursk region?\"\n\nHe said the situation in Kursk is \"completely under our control, and the group that invaded our territory is in isolation,\" and that it would be \"very good for the Ukrainian side to reach a truce for at least 30 days.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy countered Friday that Putin is \"lying\" about the conflict and is blocking any diplomatic efforts to end the war.\n\n\"Putin is lying about the real situation on the battlefield, he is lying about the casualties, he is lying about the true state of his economy, which has been damaged by his foolish imperial ambitions, and he is doing everything possible to ensure that diplomacy fails,\" he said.\n\n\"Putin cannot exit this war because that would leave him with nothing,\" he continued. \"That is why he is now doing everything he can to sabotage diplomacy by setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions right from the start even before a ceasefire.\"\n\nThe claim that Ukrainian forces are surrounded was also shot down by defense analyst Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment who focuses on the Russian and Ukrainian militaries, who called it \"simply untrue.\"\n\nMORE: Putin demands Kursk total victory ahead of Moscow talks with Trump envoy\n\nGeorge Barros, the Russian team lead for the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War, also reacted on X to Trump's remarks, saying, \"Available evidence from the battlefield does not indicate any Russian encirclements of Ukrainian forces at scale, and certainly not by the thousands.\"\n\nUkrainian forces pushed into Kursk last August in a surprise offensive, seizing the town of Sudzha and surrounding villages. Kyiv's troops have repelled months of Russian counteroffensives, but recent weeks have seen their salient crumble and Russian forces retake significant ground.\n\nDuring a visit to a command center in Kursk on Wednesday while clad in military fatigues, Putin said, \"Your task is to completely destroy the enemy, which has entrenched itself in the Kursk region and is still conducting warfare here, and fully liberate the Kursk region's territory within the shortest possible time.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian troops raised their flags over central Sudzha in Kursk as Ukrainian forces hurriedly retreated toward the shared border.\n\nRussian advances to the border in the Kursk Oblast appeared to have slowed on Thursday compared to recent days, according to the latest assessment from the Institute for the Study of War .\n\nThe general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said Friday that the situation \"has not undergone significant changes over the past day,\" and that troops are \"regrouping\" and have withdrawn to \"more advantageous defense lines.\"\n\n\"Our soldiers are repelling enemy offensive actions and delivering effective fire damage with all types of weapons,\" it said.\n\nRussian officials have indicated they will not engage in peace negotiations while any of Kursk remains under Ukrainian control.\n\nTrump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Putin in Moscow on Thursday to discuss the proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine -- a step leaders in Kyiv and Washington, D.C., hope will facilitate a larger peace deal to end Russia's three-year-old invasion of its neighbor.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there is \"reason to be cautiously optimistic\" about a ceasefire and said Putin and Trump now need to talk. The timing of that conversation will be determined once Witkoff reports to Trump, he said.\n\nVladimir Putin says Ukraine must surrender after Donald Trump calls for soldiers to be spared originally appeared on abcnews.go.com"

      "text": "Putin predicts Trump will 'systematically' go after Greenland\n\nManage your account\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday the Trump administration likely will move to acquire Greenland \"systemically\" after months of swipes at the autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\n\"It is obvious that the United States will continue to systematically promote its geostrategic, military-political and economic interests in the Arctic. As for Greenland, this is a matter that concerns two specific states and has nothing to do with us,\" the Kremlin leader told a crowd during his address at the International Arctic Forum hosted in Russia.\n\n\"But at the same time, of course, we are only concerned about the fact that NATO countries as a whole are increasingly designating the High North as a springboard for possible conflicts and are practicing the use of troops in these conditions, including with the forces of their new recruits - Finland and Sweden, with which, by the way, until recently we had no problems at all,\" Putin said, according to translations.\n\nHis comments came a day after President Trump reiterated his intent to acquire the Arctic territory.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security and international security. So we'll, I think, we'll go as far as we have to go,\" Trump told reporters Wednesday in the Oval Office.\n\n\"We need Greenland. And the world needs us to have Greenland, including Denmark. Denmark has to have us have Greenland. And, you know, we'll see what happens. But if we don't have Greenland, we can't have great international security.\"\n\nDuring his remarks, Putin addressed the United States' long-standing intent to purchase the island after the establishment of military bases within the island to protect it from Nazi rule during World War II.\n\n\"After the end of the war, the United States offered Denmark to buy these islands quite recently by the standards of world history,\" Putin said.\n\n\"In short, we are talking about serious plans on the American side with regard to Greenland,\" he added.\n\nVice President Vance and second lady Usha Vance are both scheduled to be in Greenland on Friday, with visits slated at an American base in Pituffik further fueling questions about the Trump administration's intentions in the Arctic.\n\nUsha Vance's participation in other public events was canceled following days of controversy over military plans shared in Signal group chat with Vice President Vance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and other high-level officials.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are also expected to join the trip to the island that's rich in raw minerals, a commodity recently identified as desirable by Trump throughout peace negotiations with Russia and Ukraine.\n\nDespite speculation about ulterior motives, the president said the trip is intended to encourage friendly relations.\n\n\"This is friendliness, not provocation. We're dealing with a lot of people from Greenland that would like to see something happen with respect to their being properly protected and properly taken care of. They're calling us. We're not calling them. And we were invited over there, and I thought it would be great,\" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting.\n\nIf the U.S. acquires Greenland, it would add to the presence of Western alliances in the Northern hemisphere in areas surrounding the Kremlin's sovereign borders.\n\nFinland and Sweden were approved for NATO membership in 2024, which grants them access to weapons and other defense resources through the NATO Support and Procurement Agency.\n\nPoland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, all NATO members, announced their intent to withdraw from the 1997 Ottawa Convention treaty outlawing the use of anti-personnel landmines earlier this month, citing the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine as a factor in their decision.\n\nPutin said Russian leaders are noting the rise in tensions and preparing to respond accordingly.\n\n\"I would like to emphasize that Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but we are closely monitoring the development of the situation, building an adequate response line, increasing the combat capabilities of the armed forces and modernizing military facilities,\" the Kremlin leader said.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

      "text": "Opinion - Putin is just playing Trump for time\n\nManage your account\n\nOn Monday, 94 Ukrainian civilians - 23 of them children - learned the hard way how Russian President Vladimir Putin views the ceasefire negotiations in Saudi Arabia between Washington and Moscow. The 94 were injured during a Russian attack that hit a children's hospital in Sumy.\n\nPutin is using the negotiations with the Trump administration as a license to kill not only Ukrainian soldiers but also innocent men, women and children, whom he intentionally targets in civilian population centers.\n\nDuring the attack, 30 other residential high-rises were hit as well as \"15 private residences, and an unspecified number of warehouses, offices, and medical facilities.\" Sumy, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, is about to become ground zero for Putin's plans to invade the Sumy Oblast.\n\nPutin is primarily using the negotiations in Riyadh to expand his war against Ukraine by other means, including dictating future conditions advantageous to Moscow on the battlefield and as distractions to draw attention away from his build-up of Russian forces for a possible multi-front summer offensive.\n\nZelensky believes Putin is intent on launching simultaneous efforts to conquer the Sumy, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. And to get from here to there, Putin is playing rope-a-dope with Team Trump in Saudi Arabia.\n\nPresident Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, is obliging. In a bizarre interview with Tucker Carlson, Witkoff parroted Putin's maximalist talking points one after the other.\n\nWitkoff claimed Ukrainian forces are surrounded in Kursk. They are not. He then claimed, referring to the partial energy infrastructure ceasefire, that he believes, \"we have moved Russia in ways that no one thought was possible.\" They have not - at least not in any way that is good for Ukraine or for NATO.\n\nOf course, Putin agreed to it. Ukraine has been conducting a series of deep strikes into Russia that are decimating Putin's oil and energy infrastructure and putting his armies in Kursk and the Donbas at risk of grinding to a halt for lack of fuel. So foolishly, Witkoff helped Russia at the expense of Ukraine. Even more foolishly, Witkoff does not realize Putin has played him for a fool in doing so.\n\nRussia gets a reprieve, and Ukraine is denied one of its most effective deep-fight battle tools to blunt Putin's ability to finance his war. Not content with pilfering one concession from Witkoff, Team Putin appears close to doing the same in the Black Sea .\n\nLate Monday, according to Reuters, a Russian source told them \"that the talks had concluded late on Monday and a draft joint statement had been sent to Moscow and Washington for approval, with the parties aiming to release it on Tuesday.\" Once again, Team Trump is on the verge of negotiating away a Ukrainian strength.\n\nDespite having no substantial navy, Ukraine has been able to sink or damage nearly one-third of Russia's Black Sea fleet. Essentially, as Basil Germond noted, Putin at the hands of Ukraine \"has lost control of the Black Sea.\" Now, Team Trump, with Witkoff at the helm, is on the verge of giving it back to Moscow. This would be madness.\n\nFar worse, however, is Witkoff falling for Putin's false narrative that NATO expansionism caused the war. Witkoff blindly concedes the point and even more egregiously concedes that \"Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO.\"\n\nWitkoff isn't negotiating with Team Putin. He is capitulating to them, right down to letting Putin control all of the peace negotiation narratives.\n\nDuring his interview with Carlson, Witkoff thoughtlessly bought into Putin's position that Russia is entitled to all of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts despite not fully controlling any of them. Witkoff even aped Putin's points that they are \"Russian speaking,\" and that Moscow's referendums were proof that \"the overwhelming majority ... indicated that they want to be under Russian rule.\"\n\nNever mind that these were sham referendums , or that many Ukrainians residing there had already fled ahead of the Russian invaders. Team Zelensky, understandably, is irate. Witkoff is hardly acting as an honest broker. To the contrary, at times Witkoff appears to be negotiating on the Kremlin's behalf.\n\nAnd for what? Many Americans, Europeans and Ukrainians would like to know.\n\nLost on Team Trump - and lost in particular to Witkoff - is that they keep handing Putin a license to kill Ukrainians. Instead of moving Russia closer to a comprehensive ceasefire, Team Trump is, wittingly or not, setting conditions for Putin and his generals to expand his war in Ukraine. He is not interested in a \"piece\" of Ukraine. He wants all of it.\n\nIt does not help either that Witkoff is star-struck. Telling Carlson that he liked Putin after meeting him is Twilight Zone territory. How do you \"like\" a man who is intentionally targeting and killing Ukrainian civilians?\n\nAs documented by the upcoming Faith Under Siege documentary, more than 22,000 Ukrainian children have been \"injured, killed or kidnapped\" by Russians. More than 600 churches have been \"shelled, looted, or destroyed.\" And more than 47 Ukrainian priests, pastors, and other faither leaders have been killed during Putin's special military operation.\n\nHow does Witkoff \"like\" a man - Putin - who on average is firing \"93 ballistic missiles and Iranian drones at Ukrainian cities every day?\" Why is Team Trump continuing to give the Russian war machine a carte blanche license to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians?\n\nPutin's victims have names. Including those of the Bazylevych family. The family of five was reduced to one when Eugenia, 43, Yaryna, 21, Daria, 18, and Emilia, 7, were killed in a Russian missile and drone strike in Lviv. Only their father, Yaroslav Bazylevych, survived this heinous war crime.\n\nIt is not enough just to get Putin to the negotiating table. Team Trump must demand that Russia enter into an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire, and in doing so put an end to his license to kill and plans to widen the war this summer.\n\nThat means empowering Ukraine to take the fight to Putin and getting back on board with shutting down Russia's shadow fleets, so as to drag him kicking and screaming to a real negotiating table. If not, then more families like the Bazylevych family will keep dying and true peace in Ukraine will be fleeting.\n\nMark Toth writes on national security and foreign policy. Col. (Ret.) Jonathan E.

      "text": "Airbus chairman sees 'strong indications' an emboldened Putin is mobilizing forces to attack NATO's eastern flank\n\nManage your account\n\nAirbus chair René Obermann says Putin may seize a moment of weakness in the U.S.-Europe alliance to build a strategic land bridge via the Suwałki Gap, which connects the Russian ethnic enclave of Kaliningrad to its client state of Belarus.\n\nEmboldened by the Trump administration's split with Europe, Russian President Vladimir Putin may be preparing to directly test the resolve of the postwar Western military alliance.\n\nIn an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt, the chairman of European aerospace and defense group Airbus warned the continent needs to arm itself now that it's likely the United States will not honor its obligations under NATO's Article 5 common defense clause.\n\n\"There are strong indications that Russia is preparing an attack on NATO's eastern flank,\" René Obermann told the newspaper on Monday, adding that Putin will not likely wait until Europe has enough time to build up its own sovereign capabilities for deterrence before striking.\n\n\"Putin sees NATO as increasingly weakened, because Trump's solidarity with Europe is shaky, to put it politely,\" he said.\n\nObermann argues the Russian dictator has placed his country's economy on a wartime footing with a fiscally unsustainable 10% of gross domestic product diverted to its military, according to Obermann. That's five times the NATO minimum target, and Putin also plans to mobilize 1.5 million soldiers- the world's second largest standing army after China.\n\nWith so much already invested, ending his expansionist campaign and returning to peace risks the one thing Putin appears to fear most-political upheaval. That may be one reason why a joint military exercise is planned for this year in Russia's neighboring client state of Belarus.\n\n\"That is reminiscent of the events leading up to the Ukraine invasion. Furthermore, the internal pressure [in Russia] to deliver new victories through military conquest likely will grow,\" he said.\n\nThe Airbus chairman suspects that, much like Putin's invasion of Crimea in 2014, plans would involve another ethnic enclave-this time Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, which forms Russia's westernmost territory.\n\nPutin may aspire to build a strategic land bridge to the historic Hanseatic port city via its client state of Belarus after the former was cut off from Russia proper following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThis would occur by seizing what's known as the Suwałki Gap , a corridor along the Polish border with Lithuania that separates the Kaliningrad oblast (region) from Belarus.\n\nA spokesperson for NATO did not respond by press time to Fortune' s request for comment.\n\nObermann argued in favor of a pragmatic approach to security, including sticking to Germany's contractual plans to acquire Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter jet despite other allies now considering canceling their purchase .\n\nHe wants Europe to cooperate with Americans where necessary, for example in the stationing of Tomahawk cruise missiles capable of striking distant targets in Russia, while prioritizing a deterrence strategy of its own complete with tactical nuclear weapons provided by the French.\n\nBut the Trump administration has fostered a split in the transatlantic alliance and has openly displayed scorn for its allies on several occasions. Just this week, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote to Vice President JD Vance in texts accidentally leaked: \"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading. It's pathetic.\"\n\nTrump's open courtship of Russia prompted one billionaire heiress to the Walmart fortune, Christy Walton, to take to the New York Times in defense of long-standing American principles like the rule of law and loyalty to its allies .\n\n\"It would be grossly negligent if we did not prepare for the scenario that the U.S.A. either partially or fully withdraws its forces,\" said Obermann.\n\nAirbus generated a combined €13.4 billion in 2024 across its defense and military helicopter operations, making it a midsize European player, smaller than a Thales or Leonardo , but larger than Rheinmetall and Saab. By comparison, Obermann's company generates €50.6 billion from its civilian aerospace division through the sale of models like the Airbus A320, the airline industry's narrow-body workhorse.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

And the Kremlin seems as surprised as everyone else.\n\nNow, say Russian analysts, the midnight oil is likely burning in Russian President Vladimir Putin's office as his team tries to figure out the best way to exploit the many opportunities that have opened up.\n\nIt's been less than a month since a dramatic phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin led to high-level talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and in Istanbul aimed at restoring normal ties after over a decade of escalating sanctions and scorched-earth diplomatic hostility.\n\nMoscow's return from the diplomatic wilderness has been as impressive as it is sudden. But Russian President Vladimir Putin's attempts to capitalize on it may not align with Donald Trump's expectations.\n\nMr. Trump appears to have thrown a litany of unilateral concessions Moscow's way, including the suggestion that Russia should be readmitted to the G7 club of Western democracies and a proposal to mutually slash arms budgets. There are also reports that Mr. Trump has requested Mr. Putin mediate U.S. nuclear negotiations with Iran , and that the United States and Russia have begun secret talks on reopening the Nord Stream pipeline that delivered Russian gas to Europe until it was destroyed by mysterious sabotage in 2022.\n\nThe biggest spotlight has been on Mr. Trump's very public effort to broker a quick peace in Ukraine, which has entailed previously unthinkable U.S. deference to Moscow's wishes. In a series of statements, Washington has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine, publicly expressed doubt that Ukraine can take back its Russian-occupied territories, and called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator.\" The White House has also insisted that Ukraine hold new presidential elections, and refused to field U.S. troops in Ukraine or backstop any peace plan that would require U.S. security guarantees.\n\nIn a fractious Oval Office meeting last Friday, Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance called Mr. Zelenskyy \"ungrateful\" and \"disrespectful,\" leading to at least a temporary rupture of relations and pause in U.S. arms shipments to Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian media has covered each of these turns with gleeful amazement and more than a touch of schadenfreude. But foreign policy analysts seem more cautious.\n\n\"This is just a moment. It's an extraordinary one, and it looks very good for Russia, but things can turn around very quickly,\" says Sergei Strokan, an international affairs columnist with the business daily Kommersant.\n\nThe prospect of full normalization of relations with the U.S., even as Europe doubles down on its previous pro-Ukraine policies, suggests that the global order is becoming fragmented in ways that will prevent any future attempt to isolate Russia.\n\nMr. Strokan says the focus of Russian diplomacy will be to create solid, lasting results that will improve Russia's long-term position. \"For years we've been complaining that we're facing unprecedented pressure from the 'collective West,' and now, suddenly, there is no solid front against us anymore,\" he says.\n\nThe Russian foreign policy establishment always speculated that Europe would be most likely to eventually seek rapprochement with Moscow, while U.S. hostility to Russia was thought to be hard-wired. \"Now we have to revise our whole foreign policy outlook,\" Mr. Strokan says. \"It's a huge task, which most of our foreign policy experts are not ready for, to spell out the potentials of this unexpected new situation. And it's very dynamic.\"\n\nThe next challenge will be to hold a productive summit between Russian and U.S. leaders. Mr. Trump has said he's sure Mr. Putin is ready for peace, so as soon as the U.S. president has persuaded Mr. Zelenskyy to accept his peace plan, a summit should be on the horizon.\n\nNot much is known about Mr. Trump's plan, but it seems to involve an immediate ceasefire, a big U.S. stake in Ukrainian reconstruction sealed by a \"minerals deal\" with Ukraine, and a long-term peace settlement whose security guarantees would be provided by Europe, not by the U.S.\n\nRussian experts say there is, as yet, a yawning gap between what Mr. Trump appears to want, and the kind of peace deal that Mr. Putin would be prepared to accept.\n\nBefore a meeting, \"We need to make sure that the U.S. understands our position. We need a deal that addresses our conditions,\" says Anton Grishanov, head researcher at the Russian Foreign Ministry's Diplomatic Academy. \"Ukraine may not be an existential matter for the U.S., but it is for Russia. And it's not only about Ukraine, but a much wider range of issues.\"\n\nRussia's basic conditions for a peace settlement, as spelled out in various statements by Mr. Putin and other leaders, include guarantees of Ukrainian neutrality, substantial demilitarization of Ukraine, and language and religious rights for Ukraine's Russian speakers. Russia also demands that Ukraine cede to it four territories (plus Crimea, which was annexed in 2014): Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. Some experts say Russia will also insist on fresh presidential elections in Ukraine, to ensure the legitimacy of whoever signs a final peace deal.\n\nAnalysts say the Kremlin will likely insist that the summit agenda be thoroughly prepared through intensive meetings of working groups and high level dialogue, so that there will be no surprises when the two leaders finally meet.\n\nOne expert, who asked not to be attributed in order to comment more freely about Mr. Putin, quipped that the Russian president would never put himself into the sort of unscripted or spontaneous position - much less with TV cameras rolling - that Mr. Zelenskyy did in the White House last week.\n\nThe Kremlin seems unlikely to accommodate Mr. Trump's hope for an immediate ceasefire.\n\n\"Why should we agree to a ceasefire when we are winning?\" says Alexey Mukhin, director of the independent consultancy Center for Political Information in Moscow. \"If Ukraine doesn't want to continue fighting, they should capitulate.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Their goal? To prepare an agenda for a face-to-face summit between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, who could possibly meet before the end of this month.\n\nFor the moment, the two sides appear to be more or less on the same page. Mr. Trump is clearly anxious to frame a peace settlement to end the war in Ukraine and move on - and Mr. Putin says he is amenable to that.\n\nBut Moscow is hoping for much more. The Kremlin wants a permanent restoration of full-spectrum bilateral diplomatic relations, in which two superpowers negotiate their differences as equals, Cold War style.\n\nA week ago, Russian president Vladimir Putin was anathema in Western capitals. Then Donald Trump phoned him, and top Russian and American officials met Tuesday. The Kremlin expects to come in from the cold, sparking European worries.\n\nThe process seems to be headed that way. Though no one is yet talking about sanctions relief, one member of Russia's high-powered delegation in Saudi Arabia is sovereign wealth fund chief Kirill Dmitriev, who told journalists on Tuesday that he is already discussing economic cooperation with his American counterparts.\n\n\"A return to normality doesn't sound like a big deal, but it's actually a momentous development,\" says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs, a Moscow-based foreign policy journal.\n\nSince 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, Washington's relations with Moscow have been marked by confrontation over Moscow's war in Ukraine, leading to economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation, Mr. Lukyanov recalls. \"It's all been downhill,\" he says. \"The last time we saw a moment anything like this was the Obama 'reset' a decade and a half ago.\"\n\nA summit between the two presidents will demonstrate to the world that Russia and the United States have returned to respectful and productive dialogue, says Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser.\n\nThe two leaders may signal to their respective establishments that it is time to re-open all the channels - arms control, academia, airlines, even the post office - that have been frozen for years. In addition, he expects, they will probably set up a working group to hammer out terms for a possible peace settlement in Ukraine. That would provide an appropriate format for including the Ukrainian and European governments, he suggests.\n\n\"I believe there is a will to do this on both sides,\" says Mr. Markov. \"There is nothing in Putin's demands for a Ukraine settlement that would harm American interests . Why should the American people care if Ukraine is neutral, if its Russian-speakers have rights, if some traditionally Russian parts of the country revert to Russia, if [Ukraine] has peaceful relations with Moscow?\"\n\nThe breakthrough came last Wednesday with a lengthy phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin in which they agreed to revive bilateral diplomacy.\n\nMr. Trump and his team have been sharply criticized in Europe for having given away in advance key bargaining positions, such as Ukraine's membership of NATO, or its desire to recover Russian-conquered territory. But Moscow seems to view such moves as simply a recognition of reality.\n\nFrom Moscow's perspective , the West, under U.S. leadership, made every effort over the past three years to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, and failed.\n\nUnless western governments directly intervene on the battlefield, Russian analysts say, Ukraine has lost the war, and Russia will dictate terms to Kyiv in the end.\n\nIf the summit fails, says Mr. Lukyanov, President Putin \"will just continue pressing Ukraine on the battlefield. There's not much the West can do that it hasn't already tried. Trump and his team just want to get rid of Ukraine, get it off their plate as quickly as possible. It's a lost cause, and they want to move beyond it.\"\n\nAs for some of the grander ideas that Mr. Trump has expressed, such as weaning Russia away from its deepening association with China, Russian analysts are skeptical. Sanctions have cut Russian economic ties with the West, and supply chains for everything from energy to automobiles have been rerouted, mainly to China .\n\nWhile still short of an alliance, the relationship between Russia and China has started to look unshakeable.\n\nAmong other things, \"there is a very tight personal relationship\" between President Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, says Alexei Mukhin, director of the independent Center for Political Information in Moscow. \"One thing we know about Putin is that he takes his friendships very seriously.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nAndrei Klimov, deputy chair of the international affairs committee of Russia's upper house of parliament, recalls an old Soviet watchword - \"peaceful coexistence\" - to explain the Kremlin's new goal for U.S.-Russia relations.\n\n\"It doesn't mean we're friends,\" he says, \"but there's mutual respect, cooperation where possible, an effort to understand each other's positions, and active diplomacy aimed at finding a balance.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But, in any event, they now know they are lessons the European democracies themselves must find the will and the way to apply.\n\nThe critical lesson, in European eyes, dates from the years immediately before World War II.\n\nIt has become known as the period of \"appeasement,\" when key European governments believed that diplomatic deals could dissuade Germany's Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler, from unleashing his rearmed military and provoking a wider war.\n\nThe main player was Britain's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who felt confident he had secured \"peace in our time\" by signing a 1938 agreement with Hitler in Munich, abandoning a commitment to protect Czechoslovakia, and handing it to Germany.\n\nSome European commentators, including one broadly sympathetic to parts of Mr. Trump's domestic agenda, have recalled an even starker example of prewar appeasement.\n\nThat was the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, in which Soviet Russia signed a nonaggression pact with Germany, agreeing that the two rival powers would divide up control of Eastern Europe.\n\nCrucially, it freed Hitler to pivot his armies westward, subduing France and then, he hoped, opening the way to capture Britain as well.\n\nEuropean leaders are not equating Russian President Vladimir Putin with Hitler. They are aware that there are no exact parallels in history.\n\nBut they have little doubt that the central lesson holds.\n\nWhen U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this month ruled out the idea that Ukraine might recover territory Russia has seized, or that Kyiv might join NATO, the European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, clearly had Chamberlain and Molotov on her mind.\n\n\"Why are we giving them [the Russians] everything they want even before the negotiations have started?\" she asked. \"It's appeasement. It has never worked.\"\n\nStill, with little sign so far that Mr. Trump is loosening his embrace of Mr. Putin, some European politicians are also focused on another historical parallel.\n\nThis one draws on the summit conference held near the end of the war in Europe, almost exactly eight decades ago, in February 1945. Ironically, it took place in Yalta on the Crimean Peninsula - an area seized and annexed from Ukraine by Mr. Putin in 2014, in what proved to be a dress rehearsal for his full-scale invasion three years ago.\n\nThe Yalta summit gathered the leaders of the three major powers that were on the brink of defeating Nazi Germany: U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt; Britain's Winston Churchill, who had replaced Mr. Chamberlain early in the war; and Soviet leader Josef Stalin, who joined the fray after Hitler tore up his nonaggression pact and attacked the Soviet Union in 1941.\n\nTogether, they agreed on a new political map of postwar Europe, which ended up giving the Soviet Union power and influence in Eastern Europe, while America and its allies ruled in the west.\n\nAmid warnings from European politicians and diplomats that Mr. Trump risks \"appeasement\" of Moscow, Finland's President Alexander Stubb argued that they might be drawing the wrong World War II-era parallel.\n\n\"Is this Munich 2.0?\" he wondered, alluding to the Chamberlain-Hitler deal. \"I don't think so.\"\n\nInstead Yalta, and the prospect of a fresh agreement charting new spheres of influence on the European continent, should preoccupy U.S. allies more, he suggested.\n\nIf that came about, the architects this time would be Presidents Trump and Putin - not Yalta-style wartime allies, perhaps, but apparently with a similar, great-power view of the world. Any understanding would very likely be reached over the heads of America's traditional European allies, and almost certainly without a thought for Ukraine.\n\nYet on a more hopeful note, President Stubb urged European democracies not only to keep doing all they could to support Ukraine, but also to bear in mind another historic precedent: the pan-European summit held in his own country's capital, Helsinki, in the Cold War 1970s.\n\nAgreed unanimously by countries on both sides of the Iron Curtain, the Helsinki Final Act, also signed by the U.S. and Canada, became a touchstone for the West's commitment to democratic principles, human rights, and fundamental freedoms.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

All is forgiven.\n\nThat's the message President Donald Trump delivered, first in a phone call last week, and now very publicly, to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nNo matter how this ultimately affects negotiations over Ukraine, the country Mr. Putin invaded three years ago: Mr. Trump's embrace of the man who started Europe's most devastating conflict since World War II is likely to have a lasting impact on U.S. alliances worldwide.\n\nPresident Trump's readiness to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine with the aggressor, Vladimir Putin, while blaming the victim, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has thrown the Western alliance into its worst crisis since World War II.\n\nOne of its immediate effects seems irreversible.\n\nIn a major victory for Moscow even before Ukraine talks have begun, the U.S. president has abandoned a core element of the allied response to Mr. Putin's unprovoked war: isolating Russia and excluding it from the top table of world diplomacy.\n\nAfter last week's phone call, the first such contact since the 2022 invasion, Mr. Trump sent Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Saudi Arabia for talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Moscow's delegation also included Mr. Putin's top foreign policy aide and the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund.\n\nAll three men are still subject to international sanctions imposed after Russia's attack.\n\nIf, as Mr. Trump predicted this week, he and Mr. Putin hold summit talks in the coming days, Moscow's diplomatic isolation will be in tatters.\n\nSo, too, will be a long-unquestioned consensus among the U.S. and its allies: that Mr. Putin's invasion and destruction of Ukraine represent a danger to Europe's security and a violation of international law, and are simply wrong.\n\nIn recent days, Mr. Trump has increasingly echoed Mr. Putin's narrative about the war.\n\nHe has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" who bore responsibility for the war, because he could have negotiated a way out by simply ceding parts of his country to Mr. Putin.\n\nMr. Trump added that, like the Russian leader, he believed Mr. Zelenskyy should hold an election - delayed because of the war - before being given a seat at talks to determine his country's future.\n\nMr. Trump claimed recent polls had Mr. Zelenskyy \"down at 4% in approval rating,\" in an apparent nod to Kremlin arguments that he lacks political legitimacy.\n\nIn fact, the most recently published poll suggests he enjoys nearly 60% backing, comfortably above Mr. Trump's own poll numbers.\n\nBeyond the alarm in Europe at Mr. Trump's U-turn on Russia, allies further afield will be worried about what the move portends for his broader foreign policy in the next four years.\n\nUntil now, countries such as Japan, or Australia, have shared the Europeans' view that by signaling their readiness to address Mr. Trump's concerns about investment and trade, they might find sufficient common ground to ensure their decades-long partnerships held firm.\n\nIn the early weeks of Mr. Trump's second administration, the rule of thumb has been to avoid overreacting to public statements they find worrisome. Private discussions with Washington, they trust, will yield more considered policies.\n\nThat is still what European governments want to believe regarding Ukraine, having taken some encouragement from more nuanced statements by U.S. officials including Secretary of State Rubio and Mr. Trump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg.\n\nThey know, however, that only Mr. Trump's voice will matter in the end.\n\nAnd he appears to have developed a far more coherent overall view of what he wants to accomplish in the world than he had during his first term.\n\nIt is a vision of an America laser-centered on its own economic interests - wielding its influence, above all through the threat of tariffs, to drive harder bargains with its allies. Mr. Trump's use of his personal leverage to shape relations with other world leaders and rivals, such as Vladimir Putin, is key to his vision.\n\nDuring his first term, America's alliances survived some battering to emerge largely unscathed.\n\nBut that was in part due to the presence of senior figures - such as former National Security Adviser John Bolton and Mike Pompeo, CIA director and later Secretary of State - who intermittently tried to moderate Mr. Trump's thinking.\n\nThat was the case, for instance, during a first-term bout of summitry with similarities to this week's Russia embrace: his meetings with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nAfter their first summit, he surprised Asian allies by suddenly canceling regular military exercises by U.S. and South Korean forces - adopting North Korean vocabulary by referring to them as \"war games.\"\n\nBut in the end, despite what Mr. Trump had described as a political love affair with Mr. Kim, North Korea refused to give up its nuclear weapons program, as Mr. Trump had demanded it should.\n\nEuropean governments believe it is equally unlikely that Mr. Putin will abandon his stated conditions for ending the war, including recognition of Russia's annexation of eastern Ukraine and a refusal to accept Ukrainian membership of NATO.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nTheir deepening concern is that Mr. Trump, who said Wednesday that the Russians \"have the cards\" in negotiations over Ukraine's future, might, in fact, agree with the Russian leader's arguments.\n\nIn the absence of any sign so far of serious pushback from within the administration, that will leave European countries, and Ukraine, to fend for themselves.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

This formalizes constitutional changes endorsed in a vote last July, which reset Mr. Putin's presidential term limits.\n\nLoading...\n\nApril 06, 2021, 12:08 p.m. ET | Moscow\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed a law allowing him to potentially hold onto power until 2036, a move that formalizes constitutional changes endorsed in a vote last year.\n\nThe July 1 constitutional vote included a provision that reset Mr. Putin's previous term limits, allowing him to run for president two more times. The change was rubber-stamped by the Kremlin-controlled legislature and the relevant law signed by Mr. Putin was posted Monday on an official portal of legal information.\n\nThe reform, which critics cast as a constitutional coup, was packaged with an array of other amendments that were expected to garner popular support, such as one bolstering pension protections.\n\nThe law signed by Mr. Putin limits any future president to two terms in office. It also prevents anyone who has held foreign citizenship from running for the Kremlin.\n\nThe Russian president, who has been in power for more than two decades - longer than any other Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin - said he would decide later whether to run again in 2024 when his current six-year term ends.\n\nHe has argued that resetting the term count was necessary to keep his lieutenants focused on their work instead of \"darting their eyes in search for possible successors.\"\n\nThe constitutional amendments also emphasized the primacy of Russian law over international norms, outlawed same-sex marriages, and mentioned \"a belief in God\" as a core value. Nearly 78% of voters approved the constitutional amendments during the balloting that lasted for a week and concluded on July 1. Turnout was 68%.\n\nFollowing the vote, Russian lawmakers have methodically modified the national legislation, approving the relevant laws.\n\nThe opposition criticized the constitutional vote, arguing that it was tarnished by widespread reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities, as well as a lack of transparency and hurdles hindering independent monitoring.\n\nIn the months since the vote, Russia has imprisoned the country's most prominent opposition figure, Alexei Navalny.\n\nMr. Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusation.\n\nIn February, Mr. Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation while convalescing in Germany. The sentence stems from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Mr. Navalny has rejected as fabricated - and which the European Сourt of Human Rights has ruled to be unlawful.\n\nAt the same time, the United States and Ukraine say Russia is escalating tensions in eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014. Russia denies having a military presence there. President Joe Biden has publicly rebuked Mr. Putin since taking office, including saying last month he regarded Mr. Putin as a \"killer.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

As he calls for peace with Ukraine and dialogue with the West, the candidate's growing popularity reveals an undercurrent of dissent.\n\nLoading...\n\nJan. 26, 2024, 11:26 a.m. ET | Moscow\n\nThey have lined up by the thousands across Russia in recent days, standing in the bitter cold for a chance to sign petitions to support an unlikely challenger to President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBoris Nadezhdin has become a dilemma for the Kremlin as he seeks to run in the March 17 presidential election. The question now is whether Russian authorities will allow him on the ballot.\n\nThe stocky, bespectacled 60-year-old local legislator and academic has struck a chord with the public, openly calling for a halt to the conflict in Ukraine, the end of mobilizing Russian men for the military, and starting a dialogue with the West. He also has criticized the country's repression of LGBTQ+ activism.\n\n\"The collection of signatures has gone unexpectedly well for us,\" Mr. Nadezhdin told The Associated Press in an interview on Jan. 24 in Moscow. \"We didn't expect this, to be honest.\"\n\nMr. Nadezhdin's name is a form of the Russian word for \"hope,\" and although he is highly unlikely to defeat the still-popular Putin, the lines are a rare sign of protest, defiance, and optimism in a country that has seen a harsh crackdown on dissent since its troops rolled into Ukraine nearly two years ago.\n\nMr. Nadezhdin is running as a candidate for the Civic Initiative Party. Because the party is not represented in parliament, he's not guaranteed a spot on the ballot and must collect over 100,000 signatures, with a limit of 2,500 from each of the dozens of the vast country's regions, not just the biggest, more progressive cities.\n\nMr. Putin, who is running as an independent candidate rather than as the candidate of the United Russia ruling party, has collected over 3 million.\n\nWaiting to sign a petition in St. Petersburg, Alexander Rakityansky told AP he went through a \"period of apathy when I thought I couldn't do anything.\" Now, however, he sees Mr. Nadezhdin's campaign as a chance to exercise his civil rights.\n\nOriginally from Belgorod, the Russian border city hit by repeated Ukrainian attacks, Mr. Rakityansky said he backed Mr. Nadezhdin so his hometown \"doesn't get bombed and people don't die on the streets.\"\n\nOnline videos have shown queues of supporters not just in Moscow and St. Petersburg but also in Krasnodar in the south, Saratov and Voronezh in the southwest, and beyond the Ural Mountains in Yekaterinburg.\n\nEven in the Far East city of Yakutsk, 450 kilometers (280 miles) south of the Arctic Circle, Mr. Nadezhdin's team said up to 400 people a day braved temperatures that plunged to minus 40 Celsius (minus 40 Fahrenheit) to sign petitions.\n\n\"Our weather conditions are not perfect and it's generally accepted that it's difficult to involve people in the north in some kind of activity, but people are coming every day,\" said Alexei Popov, the head of Mr. Nadezhdin's election team in Yakutsk. He said they had initially expected about 500 signatures in total for the entire region.\n\nAt a petition collection site in Moscow, Kirill Savenkov said he supported Mr. Nadezhdin because of his stand on Ukraine and peace negotiations.\n\nOthers said they wanted a real alternative to Mr. Putin, who they suggested had led the country into a dead end.\n\n\"The economy is really falling, people are getting poorer and prices are rising,\" said Anna of St. Petersburg, who refused to give her full name because she feared for her security. Mr. Putin, she said, has not done \"anything good for the country.\"\n\nMr. Nadezhdin's campaign got a boost after opposition leaders abroad, including former tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and supporters of imprisoned opposition politician Alexei Navalny, urged Russians to support any candidate who could deny Putin a share of the vote.\n\nExiled opposition activist Maxim Katz said on YouTube that whatever the outcome, Mr. Nadezhdin's candidacy shows \"there is one thing we know right now: Conversations about civic apathy in Russia are very far from reality. What we have is not civic apathy but a civic famine - an enormous hidden potential.\"\n\nSome analysts say the surge of support for Mr. Nadezhdin has surprised even the Kremlin, although Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Jan. 25 that \"we don't see him as a rival.\"\n\nAnalysts say the election's outcome is a foregone conclusion and that Mr. Putin will stay in power for another six years, but some also suggest it's still a moment of genuine political risk for the Kremlin, which must project an aura of legitimacy for the balloting to be seen as a genuine contest.\n\nFor Mr. Putin to win a convincing victory, he needs his supporters to turn out and his critics must stay home with no \"glimmer of hope,\" said Ekaterina Schulmann, a political scientist and nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin.\n\n\"This is why Mr. Nadezhdin is such a problem,\" she said in an interview. \"He provides a shadow of hope.\"\n\nMr. Nadezhdin's supporters lining up in Moscow and St. Petersburg told AP it gave them the rare opportunity to be with like-minded people who want a different leader from Mr. Putin, who has ruled Russia for 24 years.\n\n\"I understood that these are the people who want to change the current government and I want to be a part of this,\" said Margarita, a student who also declined to give her surname for fear of retribution.\n\nSo far, Russia's Central Election Commission has approved three candidates who were nominated by parties represented in parliament that largely support Kremlin policies: Nikolai Kharitonov of the Communist Party, Leonid Slutsky of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party and Vladislav Davankov of the New People Party. Mr. Kharitonov ran against Putin in 2004, finishing a distant second.\n\nIn December, authorities barred from the ballot Yekatarina Duntsova, a former regional lawmaker who had called for peace in Ukraine. The commission cited technical errors in her paperwork.\n\nMs. Duntsova was probably barred because authorities \"don't know her, and so in their terms she is unpredictable. And above all they dislike unpredictable things,\" Ms. Schulmann said.\n\nAlthough there have been claims that Mr. Nadezhdin secretly has the Kremlin's approval to run and is seen as kind of a spoiler candidate, he still could be ruled ineligible.\n\nHe has appeared as a pundit on Russian television and even criticized the conflict in Ukraine during a talk show on state-controlled NTV in September 2022 - a rare level of visibility not enjoyed by other opposition politicians such as Mr. Navalny and Vladimir Kara-Murza, both now imprisoned.\n\nIn that appearance, Mr. Nadezhdin said Mr. Putin was misled by intelligence services that apparently told him Ukrainian resistance would be brief and ineffective.\n\nIn his AP interview, Mr. Nadezhdin said he believes he has been allowed to run because he is a known entity and has not specifically criticized Mr. Putin.\n\n\"I personally know Putin,\" he said, saying he met him before he became president in 2000, adding that in the 1990s, he was an assistant to then-Prime Minister Sergey Kiriyenko, now Mr. Putin's first deputy chief of staff.\n\nMs. Schulmann said that while authorities could allow Mr. Nadezhdin to run, it's a \"dangerous gamble.\"\n\n\"I think they will cut him off at the next stage when he brings those signatures,\" she said, suggesting the Central Election Commission could declare some of them invalid and bar him from the ballot. She suggested authorities could also threaten him and his team with prison if he later urged his supporters to protest.\n\nThe election is the first since Mr. Putin annexed four Ukrainian regions and the first in which online voting will be used nationwide. Critics suggest that both are opportunities to rig results in favor of Mr. Putin - something the Kremlin has denied it will do.\n\nNo matter what the actual outcome, some analysts and political opponents suggest that the sight of those lining up in the cold for Mr. Nadezhdin reveals more about Russia today than the vote itself.\n\nAlthough Mr. Nadezhdin indicated he believes Mr. Putin's team did not initially perceive him as a risk, he said \"the Kremlin administrators are now in a difficult position.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Mr. Putin emphasized Russian troops are fighting \"Nazism\" to prevent \"genocide,\" a claim emphatically denied by leaders around the globe.\n\nLoading...\n\nMarch 18, 2022, 2:39 p.m. ET\n\nVladimir Putin appeared at a huge flag-waving rally at a Moscow stadium Friday and lavished praise on his troops fighting in Ukraine, three weeks into the invasion that has led to heavier-than-expected Russian losses on the battlefield and increasingly authoritarian rule at home.\n\nMeanwhile, the leader of Russia's delegation in diplomatic talks with Ukraine said the sides have narrowed their differences. The Ukrainian side gave no immediate account of the talks.\n\nThe Moscow rally came as Russian troops continued to rain lethal fire on Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv, and pounded an aircraft repair installation on the outskirts of Lviv, close to the Polish border.\n\n\"Shoulder to shoulder, they help and support each other,\" the Russian president said of the Kremlin's forces in a rare public appearance since the start of the war. \"We have not had unity like this for a long time,\" he added to cheers from the crowd.\n\nThe show of support amid a burst of antiwar protests inside Russia led to allegations in some quarters that the rally - held officially to mark the eighth anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea, which was seized from Ukraine - was a manufactured display of patriotism.\n\nSeveral Telegram channels critical of the Kremlin reported that students and employees of state institutions in a number of regions were ordered by their superiors to attend rallies and concerts marking the Crimea anniversary. Those reports could not be independently verified.\n\nMoscow police said more than 200,000 people were in and around the Luzhniki stadium. The event included patriotic songs, including a performance of \"Made in the U.S.S.R.,\" with the opening lines \"Ukraine and Crimea, Belarus and Moldova, it's all my country.\"\n\nSeeking to portray the war as just, Mr. Putin paraphrased the Bible to say of Russia's troops: \"There is no greater love than giving up one's soul for one's friends.\"\n\nTaking to the stage where a sign read \"For a world without Nazism,\" he railed against his foes in Ukraine as \"neo-Nazis\" and continued to insist his actions were necessary to prevent \"genocide\" - a claim flatly denied by leaders around the globe.\n\nVideo feeds of the event cut out a times but showed a loudly cheering crowd that broke into chants of \"Russia!\"\n\nMr. Putin's appearance marked a change from his relative isolation of recent weeks, when he has been shown meeting with world leaders and his staff either at extraordinarily long tables or via videoconference.\n\nIn the wake of the invasion, the Kremlin has clamped down harder on dissent and the flow of information, arresting thousands of antiwar protesters, banning sites such as Facebook and Twitter, and instituting tough prison sentences for what is deemed to be false reporting on the war, which Moscow refers to as a \"special military operation.\"\n\nThe OVD-Info rights group that monitors political arrests reported that at least seven independent journalists had been detained ahead of or while covering the anniversary events in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\nStanding on stage in a white turtleneck and a blue down jacket, Putin spoke for about five minutes. Some people, including presenters at the event, wore T-shirts or jackets with a \"Z\" - a symbol seen on Russian tanks and other military vehicles in Ukraine and embraced by supporters of the war.\n\nMr. Putin's quoting of the Bible and a Russian admiral of the 18th century reflected his increasing focus in recent years on history and religion as binding forces in Russia's post-Soviet society. His branding of his enemies as Nazis evoked what many Russians consider their country's finest hour, the defense of their homeland from Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\nThe rally came as Vladimir Medinsky, who led Russian negotiators in several rounds of talks with Ukraine, said that the sides have moved closer to agreement on the issue of Ukraine dropping its bid to join NATO and adopting a neutral status.\n\n\"The issue of neutral status and no NATO membership for Ukraine is one of the key issues in talks, and that is the issue where the parties have made their positions maximally close,\" Mr. Medinsky said in remarks carried by Russian media.\n\nHe added that the sides are now \"halfway\" on issues regarding the demilitarization of Ukraine.\n\nEarlier in the day, one person was reported killed in the missile attack near Lviv. Satellite photos showed the strike destroyed a repair hangar and appeared to damage two other buildings. A row of fighter jets appeared intact, but an apparent impact crater sat in front of them.\n\nUkraine said it had shot down two of six missiles in the volley, which came from the Black Sea.\n\nThe early morning attack was the closest strike yet to the center of Lviv, which has become a crossroads for people fleeing from other parts of Ukraine and for others entering to deliver aid or join the fight. The war has swelled the city's population by some 200,000.\n\nIn city after city around Ukraine, hospitals, schools, and buildings where people sought safety have been attacked. Rescue workers continued to search for survivors in the ruins of a theater that was being used a shelter when it was blasted by a Russian airstrike Wednesday in the besieged southern city of Mariupol.\n\nLudmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian Parliament's human rights commissioner, said at least 130 people had survived the theater bombing.\n\n\"But according to our data, there are still more than 1,300 people in these basements, in this bomb shelter,\" Ms. Denisova told Ukrainian television. \"We pray that they will all be alive, but so far there is no information about them.\"\n\nEarly morning barrages also hit a residential building in the Podil neighborhood of Kyiv, killing at least one person, according to emergency services, who said 98 people were evacuated from the building. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said 19 were wounded in the shelling.\n\nTwo others were killed when strikes hit residential and administrative buildings in the eastern city of Kramatorsk, according to the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko.\n\nThe fighting has led nearly 3.3 million people to flee Ukraine, by the U.N.' s estimate. The death toll remains unclear, though thousands of civilians and soldiers on both sides are believed to have been killed.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine's defenses have proved much stronger than expected, and Russia \"didn't know what we had for defense or how we prepared to meet the blow.\"\n\nWorld leaders have demanded Russia be investigated for possible war crimes over its attacks on civilians. The World Health Organization said it has confirmed 43 attacks on hospitals and other health care facilities, with 12 people killed.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He has said so openly, describing that Christmas in 1991 as the \"greatest geopolitical catastrophe\" of the 20th century.\n\nVladimir Putin cannot restore the Soviet Union, but he is seeking to reestablish Moscow's European sphere of influence. Can Western powers ensure their security arrangements?\n\nHe cannot realistically hope to turn back the clock. But both at home and beyond Russia's borders, especially in the escalating standoff with the West over Ukraine, he is clearly trying to undo some of the key changes brought about by the collapse of the USSR.\n\nMore broadly, he wants to expunge what he has felt to be the past three decades of national humiliation, by asserting Russia's renewed status as a major world power.\n\nCan he do it?\n\nAt home - at least in the short term - there seems little prospect of effective pushback. There, alongside a Soviet-style clampdown on human-rights advocates, Mr. Putin has also been rehabilitating the World War II role of Josef Stalin as part of an overarching national narrative of Russian greatness.\n\nThose two strands were intertwined in a court case against Memorial International, an organization set up with the support of the dissident Nobel Prize-winning physicist Andrei Sakharov in the waning years of the USSR to chronicle the stories of the millions of Soviet citizens Stalin sent to their deaths. A sister group monitors contemporary human-rights violations.\n\nLast week, Russia's Supreme Court revoked Memorial's legal status. And in the run-up to the ruling, a state prosecutor explained why the authorities were muzzling the organization. \"Why do we, the descendants of [World War II] victors have to repent and be embarrassed,\" he asked, \"instead of being proud of our glorious past?\"\n\nAbroad, however, Mr. Putin's rehabilitation project is facing sterner opposition, as Western nations rally to deter an estimated 100,000 Russian troops now massed on their border with Ukraine from any plan to invade.\n\nIn the eyes of Ukraine's government, and its allies in Europe and the U.S., the troop buildup is the most recent of Mr. Putin's threats to the stability, independence, and territorial integrity of a neighboring state, following his 2014 intervention in the largely Russian-speaking eastern region of Ukraine and his forcible annexation of Crimea.\n\nFor Mr. Putin, though, something wider is at stake: the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, an array of former Soviet republics, along with former Warsaw Pact satellite allies in Eastern Europe, turned their backs on Moscow to forge close ties with the West. A number joined the NATO military alliance, among them Poland, on Ukraine's western border, along with Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia.\n\nAs far back as 2007, Mr. Putin was publicly insisting that NATO's eastward \"enlargement\" had to stop. It has largely done so: Only the relatively small states of Albania, Croatia, and the former Yugoslav territories of Montenegro and North Macedonia have been welcomed in since then.\n\nBut two other countries, both former Soviet republics, have made no secret of their desire to enter NATO: Georgia, where Russian troops helped separatist regions Abkhazia and South Ossetia break away in 2008, and Ukraine.\n\nUkraine matters most. Historically entwined with Russia, it was - economically, politically, and militarily - a core component of the Soviet Union. Its border with Russia stretches nearly 1,500 miles.\n\nFor security reasons alone, Mr. Putin sees good reason to insist that Ukraine must not join NATO.\n\nBut his aim is broader: to restore to Russia - shrunken in both territory and power since Christmas 1991 - a measure of its former geopolitical clout in its dealings with the West.\n\nIn demands sent to Washington and NATO last month, Moscow insisted not only on a guarantee that neither Ukraine nor other former Soviet states would join NATO. It also demanded the alliance remove its military presence in East European member countries such as Poland, Romania, and the Baltic states, and forgo any deployment outside Western Europe that Russia deemed a threat to its security.\n\nWestern diplomats dismissed the menu of demands as a non-starter. If met, they would land the former Warsaw Pact countries back within a formally reestablished Russian \"sphere of influence.\" Neither they, nor NATO, are going to accept that, as President Putin almost certainly knows.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nBut with a trio of diplomatic meetings on the Ukraine crisis starting next week, he has already succeeded in grabbing Western attention, and in provoking a sense of urgency about dealing with the Kremlin not seen since the Cold War.\n\nThe question now? How much more it will take to convince President Putin to call off his military escalation.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

And while the constitutional change will ensure Mr. Putin's continued influence, it opens the door to a Russia ruled by representative government, rather than autocrat.\n\nRussia's current political system is all about one man: Vladimir Putin. The changes he has proposed will keep him in power, but they also open the door to a broader political playing field in Russia.\n\n\"The purpose of all this is to change the composition of power to provide for a painless transition of the presidency from Putin to another person\" when his term expires in 2024, says Olga Kryshtanovskaya, a political sociologist who has been observing Russia's shifting power elites for at least three decades . \"What matters is not who will be the next president, but where Putin will go. Whatever post Putin takes up, that's where the center of power will be, at least in the beginning. First the new president will have to work in tandem with Putin. But gradually, Putin may disengage.\"\n\nThe plan that Mr. Putin outlined in his annual state of the nation address to parliament is still a work in progress. But its main elements would significantly weaken the all-powerful presidency enshrined in Russia's 1993 Constitution and devolve significant powers to the State Duma (parliament's lower house), including the right to appoint the prime minister and government, as well as to the Federation Council (parliament's upper house). A somewhat weakened president would be limited to two terms of office, rather than two consecutive terms - a loophole that has enabled Mr. Putin himself to remain in power for the past two decades.\n\nAnother highly significant, but as yet unexplained, amendment would give constitutional status and plenary powers to the State Council, a hitherto obscure Kremlin advisory body that was mainly a talking shop for top leaders rather than an active participant in governance.\n\nIn a clear sign that Mr. Putin is in a hurry, he immediately accepted the resignation of the entire government and moved Dmitry Medvedev, his longtime prime minster and political partner, to a prestigious but powerless job in the Kremlin Security Council. He then appointed a new prime minister: Mikhail Mishustin, a professorial, English-speaking technocrat who has radically reformed and modernized Russia's taxation system over the past decade, reputedly raising tax revenues by 40%.\n\nRussian official sources say that, after a public discussion, a nationwide referendum will be held to approve the revised constitution, probably before the end of this year.\n\nStepan Goncharov, a researcher at the Levada Center, Russia's only independent pollster, says that the number of Russians who say they would like to see fundamental political change has been steadily growing, from 57% in 2017 to 59% in 2019. \"Real incomes have been falling, protest moods are growing, and so the pressure on the authorities to relieve tensions and demonstrate that changes are taking place is very strong,\" he says. \"It remains to be seen whether these initiatives are seen as effective.\"\n\nAsked about Mr. Putin's plan Thursday, a few Russians expressed pessimism, tinged with fatalism. \"I think we are heading in the same direction as China, where everything is under the state control, nobody is allowed to speak his mind, and we are all a united and happy state,\" says Natalya Omskaya, a 30-something exhibition organizer.\n\n\"If this is all about who will take this or that post, it's a no-win situation for most of us anyway,\" says Alla Anashkina, a bookkeeper nearing retirement age. \"They should better think about how to raise our pensions.\"\n\nMost Western coverage has focused on the undeniably astonishing spectacle of a Kremlin leader wielding his undisputed authority to rearrange his nation's constitutional furniture in order to ensure the reins of power remain in his own hands, even if he intends to eventually transition from political center stage. One of three basic options that have been under active discussion for the past year now looks certain to be implemented.\n\nFirst, after his current term ends, Mr. Putin might return to the post of prime minister, which he held during the single term of Mr. Medvedev's presidency, but with newly minted powers that no previous Russian prime minister has enjoyed.\n\nSecond, he might take leadership of the freshly empowered State Council, which analysts say will probably be endowed with control over formulating Russia's foreign policy and commanding the security forces.\n\nThird, Mr. Putin might succeed in his long-standing efforts to unify Russia with neighboring Belarus , and then take the leadership of a whole new state, with a new constitutional setup. It's a deeply troubled project that has triggered passionate protests in Belarus , but talks to complete the union state have intensified in recent months.\n\nSome Russians argue there is no contradiction between Mr. Putin hanging around in some capacity to guarantee stability, and his stated goal of redistributing power in favor of the elected parliament. Although post-Soviet Russia's brief experiment with parliamentary democracy ended in gunfire and restoration of Kremlin supremacy in 1993, there are many who still argue that such a vast and diverse country as Russia would be served better by a representative legislature than by a single strong leader.\n\n\"Putin aims to change Russia's governing system from that of an extraordinary situation to one that is more ordinary,\" says Sergei Markov, a former Putin adviser. \"We needed extraordinary measures following the catastrophic 1990s when, under Boris Yeltsin , Russian statehood was nearly destroyed. Russia needed strong personal rule, a kind of dictatorship like Charles de Gaulle imposed in France [when the Fourth Republic collapsed], because the country needed to be saved. ...\n\n\"This has by now been accomplished. Putin fulfilled this role, and Russia is strong and stable again. We can move to a more ordinary system, phase out personal power, and ensure a greater distribution of power.\"\n\nMr. Markov disputes the view that Mr. Putin is just acting to preserve and extend his own personal authority. \"Look,\" he says, \"if Putin wanted to be declared president for life, he could easily make that happen. But he is doing this instead. Putin wants to leave power in 2024 having moved Russia to a more institutional and collective form of government. Possibly he will continue to play a role within that collective, but the system will be changed.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

What we need is serious electoral reform, to introduce real political competition into the system. Then we might see some positive changes.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

(Photo by MIKHAIL KLIMENTYEV/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn widely criticized remarks about Russia, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff has attempted to create the conditions to impose an unfavorable ceasefire deal on Ukraine. Journalists and experts on Russia have faulted Witkoff for lacking the knowledge to negotiate a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine responsibly. The criticism came after Witkoff made a series of disputed statements during an interview with ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, comments praised in the Russian media. In the interview, Witkoff, who Trump has tasked to lead efforts with Russia to end the war in Ukraine, repeated several pro-Kremlin talking points that few analysts believe are trustworthy and said he admired Russian leader Vladimir Putin's kindness and intelligence. The broader context of Witkoff's statements may be Donald Trump's pursuit of a Nobel Peace Prize without concern for a deal's impact on Ukraine's sovereignty and long-term security.\n\nIn February 2025, Donald Trump appointed his longtime friend Steve Witkoff, a New York real estate developer, an American envoy to Russia and Vladimir Putin. There is no publicly available evidence that Witkoff possesses expertise on Russia or the region's history.\n\nTrump officials have jumped into negotiations with Russia on a ceasefire deal in an attempt to fulfill Donald Trump's campaign promise to end the war quickly. Trump has also stated that he would like to improve relations with Russia and seek more significant commercial ties between the two countries, including cooperation on energy and minerals. So long as the war continues, fulfilling the campaign promise and close political and business relationships between Russia and the United States will be out of reach.\n\nOn March 25, 2025, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced , \"All parties have agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.\" Umerov said Ukraine would retain its right to self-defense if there is \"movement by Russia of its military vessels outside of Eastern part of the Black Sea.\"\n\nAfter meeting with Putin in February as part of a prisoner exchange to release American Marc Fogel, Witkoff made the first of many disputed and controversial remarks about Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. (Russia engaged in a more limited invasion in 2014, annexing Crimea and sending troops into other parts of Ukraine.) On CNN in February 2025, Witkoff declared that Russia's invasion of Ukraine \"was provoked.\" He added , \"It doesn't necessarily mean it was provoked by the Russians.\"\n\nIn The Russo-Ukrainian War: The Return of History , Harvard University professor Serhii Plokhy provides a definitive account of the history leading up to Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Plokhy documents that Russia's strategy for many years has been to control Ukraine, disarm its military and choose a leadership to Putin's liking. In Forged in War: A Military History Of Russia From Its Beginnings To Today , Mark Galeotti, a historian and an expert on Russia, writes that Putin's success using select soldiers in small-scale military operations, such as in Georgia, helped lead to Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. Those operations would give \"Putin a mistaken sense of his armed forces as a whole and lead him into a disastrous miscalculation.\" UK intelligence estimates 900,000 Russian soldiers have died or been wounded in Ukraine. (See here for more books.)\n\nIn a March 21, 2025, podcast interview with Tucker Carlson, Witkoff said the main obstacle to peace was not Russia stopping military action and withdrawing to the borders with Ukraine it had agreed to in previous treaties. Instead, he said the problem was the Ukrainian government not recognizing regions that Russia invaded and now occupies to various degrees.\n\nWitkoff could not recall the names of the parts of Ukraine he said the country should cede to Russia. \"He said it was 'correct' that from the Russian perspective the partially occupied territories were now part of Russia,\" reported the BBC. \"The elephant in the room is, there are constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede to with regard to giving up territory. The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. The question is: will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?\" according to Witkoff.\n\nHe repeated Putin's views on Ukraine: \"There's a sensibility in Russia that Ukraine is just a false country, that they just patched together in this sort of mosaic, these regions, and that's what is the root cause, in my opinion, of this war, that Russia regards those five regions as rightfully theirs since World War Two.\"\n\nIn another controversial statement, Witkoff claimed the late Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave the territories to Ukraine and said the regions should belong to Russia because many residents there speak the Russian language. He also cited referendums held during military occupation to justify giving the territories to Russia, even though international authorities condemned the votes and the U.S. State Department called the referendums \"shams,\" where \"Ukrainian civilians were forced to cast ballots under the watch of Russian soldiers.\"\n\n\"The depth of ignorance is something,\" wrote Yaroslav Trofimov, the Wall Street Journal's chief foreign-affairs correspondent and author of the book Our Enemies Will Vanish: The Russian Invasion and Ukraine's War of Independence . \"Not only Steve Witkoff cannot name the five Ukrainian regions he's ready to sign away to Russia, he also thinks they had been handed over to Ukraine by Khrushchev. (Crimea is the only one of the five that was transferred in 1954 to Ukraine under Khrushchev, who was actually not a Ukrainian, though he came from a border area of Russia.)\"\n\nPhil Gordon, a former National Security Council staff member in three White Houses, wrote, \"Also does not seem to know that majorities in all those regions voted for independence from Russia in 1991, that Russia tried to conquer the whole country in 2022, and that what is really at stake here is the principle of not taking even contested territory by force.\"\n\nMilitary analysts dispute Witkoff's claim that Russia had no interest in taking over Ukraine, given that Russian forces invaded the country from multiple directions in 2022 focused on that goal, including landing at Hostomel Airport , 12 miles from the center of the capital, Kyiv. Russian troops withdrew from other parts of the country and concentrated on the regions closest to its border with Ukraine only after fierce fighting by Ukrainians repelled the Russian military.\n\nDespite this well-documented history, Witkoff said, \"First of all, why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose, exactly? They don't need to absorb Ukraine. That would be like occupying Gaza. . . .But the Russians also have what they want. They've gotten-they've reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea, and they've gotten what they want. So why do they need more?\" Few analysts or historians support Witkoff's statement that Russia has \"reclaimed\" rather than conquered sovereign territory. Whether Russia plans to \"absorb\" Ukraine or control the fate of Ukrainians through other means, Ukrainians would say it still entails relinquishing rights to a foreign power that has committed many atrocities on their soil.\n\nExcept for Crimea, Russia does not control the entirety of the other regions, or even the capitals of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. \"Giving Russia control of the entire regions, something they have not won on the battlefield, would also give them a foothold on the right (Western) bank of the Dnipro River, which would make it far easier for them to advance further militarily, including towards Odesa,\" according to Syracuse University professor Brian Taylor, author of Russian Politics: A Very Short Introduction .\n\nHe notes Ukrainian citizens living under Russian occupation in these regions are subjected to a variety of war crimes, including torture, rape, murder, disappearances and the abduction of children. Putin said recently that people living in the occupied territories must take Russian citizenship or be deported. \"Either of these acts constitute a war crime,\" said Taylor.\n\n\"Witkoff is very clearly out of his depth and breathtakingly ill-informed,\" Dr. Bob Seely, a former Tory MP and an expert on the Russian military, told the Daily Mail . \"He doesn't know the names of the areas that he's talking about. Saying the Ukrainian people want to be part of Russia-it is an absolute disgrace. . . .This man is simply regurgitating Kremlin propaganda.\"\n\nRussian expert Mark Galeotti argues the context of Witkoff's statements is as important as what he's saying. \"He's not an analyst or a moderator. He doesn't care about the facts. He's a political hitman out to impose a particular deal, and he'll say what he needs to set up and justify it.\" In that sense, Witkoff is following Donald Trump's playbook by introducing disputed arguments as facts and forcing others to operate from that premise.\n\nSteve Witkoff, a special envoy to the Middle East and Russia, speaks alongside White House Press ... More Secretary Karoline Leavitt to the press outside of the White House on March 6, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nAfter meeting with Vladimir Putin to discuss the war, Witkoff praised Putin and excused the invasion of Ukraine as a \"complicated situation.\" He said, \"I don't regard Putin as a bad guy. That is a complicated situation, that war and all the ingredients that led up to it. You know, it's never just one person, right?\" The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin for abducting approximately 20,000 Ukrainian children and bringing them to Russia, and most democratic governments have condemned him for starting a war that has killed thousands of civilian deaths and generated an estimated one million or more military casualties.\n\nWitkoff passed along to Trump Putin's claim-later disproven-that Russian forces had surrounded and were positioned to decimate Ukrainian troops in Kursk, which is part of Russia. It resulted in Trump repeating the false claim and asking Putin to spare the lives of the Ukrainian soldiers, which served the Russian government's purpose of creating the impression it was defeating Ukraine in the war.\n\n\"The front line is not about to collapse,\" wrote Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment who has made several trips to the front lines during the war. \"Despite AFU [Armed Forces of Ukraine] being largely pressed out of Kursk, the overall situation from Pokrovsk to Kupyansk improved. The implication being that Ukraine is not in a desperate situation requiring a rushed ceasefire under unfavorable terms.\"\n\nDuring a March 23, 2025, Fox News interview, Witkoff made additional statements that were best understood as trying to sell a deal rather than depicting reality. He called repeating Russian talking points \"level setting the facts,\" which recalled a Trump press aide using the term \"alternative facts\" to describe Donald Trump's claims about the crowd size at his first inauguration. Witkoff said he takes Putin \"at his word\" that the Russian leader does not want to take more of Ukraine or parts of Europe.\n\nWitkoff claimed that the \"Europeans are coming to the belief\" that Putin has no greater designs on Europe, a statement contradicted by the actions of those governments. Germany recently approved a historic borrowing authority by changing its constitution to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to bolster its military against Russia. The United Kingdom announced it would increase defense spending to 2.5% of Gross Domestic Product. The European Union approved borrowing authority of nearly $900 billion for countries to invest in defense due to the threat of Russia and concerns about America's retreat from Europe.\n\nIn the Tucker Carlson interview, Witkoff said of Putin: \"He's a super smart guy. Okay. You don't want to give him the credit for it. That's okay. I give him the credit for it.\" He tried to humanize the Russian leader, who has killed and imprisoned political opponents, by repeating an unverified story. \"And told me a story, Tucker, about how when the president was shot, he went to his local church and met with his priest and prayed for the president, not because he was the President of the United States or could become the President of the United States, but because he had a friendship with him and he was praying for his friend.\"\n\nAfter reading Witkoff's remarks about Putin, Shashank Joshi, the defense editor for The Economist , said, \"The Russians must be dumbstruck that their opponents have managed to find perhaps the most gullible man on the planet.\" Whether or not he is gullible or misinformed, Witkoff hopes to create the conditions to impose an unfavorable agreement on Ukraine.\n\n\"The real problem that Trump and Witkoff don't understand is that Putin doesn't want a deal, he wants victory, which he defines as the subjugation of Ukraine,\" said Brian Taylor. \"This has been clear from the first day of the full-scale invasion and remains true today.\""

More Helsinki, on July 16, 2018.\n\nSpecial Envoy Steve Witkoff, who's been handling the Trump administration's work on the Russia-Ukraine war, said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he doesn't believe concerns by Putin critics that the Kremlin is aiming to make bigger incursions into Europe.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned Putin could try to invade more areas of Europe if Russia isn't stopped in Ukraine and the U.S. pulls out of NATO-starting with countries closer to Russia that were formerly part of the Soviet Union-and a sticking point in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine has been what happens to Ukrainian regions that Putin seized during the war.\n\n\"I just don't see that [Putin] wants to take all of Europe,\" Witkoff said on \"Fox News Sunday\" when asked why Putin wouldn't push further if he succeeds in keeping Russian control over areas of Ukraine, claiming he feels the Kremlin leader is solely focused on the regions of Ukraine that Russia has now claimed.\n\nWitkoff said he takes the Russian president \"at his word\" when it comes to trusting Putin doesn't want to invade other parts of Europe, also claiming it \"sort of doesn't matter,\" because the issue is still hypothetical and not material to the immediate negotiations.\n\nWitkoff also downplayed broader concerns about Putin being a \"tyrant,\" saying when asked about how the Russian leader has been characterized, \"I've never, ever seen a situation where there isn't two sides to a story ... there are grievances on both sides.\"\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to begin discussions with leading Ukrainian officials Sunday night in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, before meeting Monday with the Russian government. The U.S. is aiming to broker a 30-day ceasefire so that a broader truce can be reached, Witkoff has previously said, with The New York Times noting the negotiations are largely expected to focus on technical issues involving energy and shipping. \"I think you'll see ... a lot more progress get announced after Monday,\" Witkoff said Sunday on Fox.\n\nRussia has illegally annexed the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Kherson, along with Crimea, which Moscow annexed before the war in 2014. Russia now occupies approximately 20% of Ukraine, according to the Center for Preventative Action, largely eastern parts of the country, and Putin has not yet shown any willingness to cede those regions as part of a ceasefire agreement. Putin has tried to legitimize Russian control of those areas, holding referendums in 2022 designed to show public support for Russian rule there. The referendums showed voters supporting being controlled by Russia, but the votes have been decried as \" shams \" manipulated by the Kremlin.\n\nZelenskyy has made bold claims about Putin wanting to go further into Europe, arguing in a February interview with \"Meet the Press\" that if the Trump administration were to pull the U.S. out of NATO, \"The risk that Russia will occupy Europe is 100%.\" The Ukrainian president has suggested Russia is establishing a military presence near the border of Belarus that's similar to what was seen prior to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Zelenskyy has also been vocal about concerns that Putin will violate any ceasefire agreement that's reached, as the Russian leader has done in the past, and has asked for U.S. military support in the event of a ceasefire, in order to prevent any future invasions. The Ukrainian leader noted in a recent Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance that in 2019, Ukraine and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement, but \"after that [Putin] broke the ceasefire, he killed our people and he didn't exchange prisoners\"-comments that ultimately led to the meeting devolving into a shouting match .\n\nThe Trump administration has been working for weeks to try and negotiate an agreement in the Ukraine-Russia war, despite Trump's previous claims he could end the conflict in 24 hours. Trump has long faced accusations about being aligned with Putin, with an investigation in his first term centering on whether his campaign colluded with the Kremlin. Trump has long drawn criticism for his praise of Putin and his strongman leadership, referring to the Russian president in 2022 as a \"genius.\" Witkoff's comments Sunday come after the Trump envoy previously spoke favorably about Putin in an interview published Saturday with ex-Fox host Tucker Carlson, in which Witkoff recounted meeting with the Russian leader and said he was \"gracious.\" Witkoff described how Putin commissioned a portrait of Trump by a Russian painter, and said the Russian leader told him he had \"prayed for\" Trump after the assassination attempt on him over the summer, claiming Putin was \"praying for his friend.\" \"I don't regard Putin as a bad guy,\" Witkoff said, calling the war with Ukraine a \"complicated situation.\"\n\nOne Community.

      "text": "Trump Lashes Out Over Claims Putin's 'Happy' About Zelenskyy Shouting Match\n\nPresident Donald Trump lashed out against suggestions he supports Russian President Vladimir Putin in Truth Social posts Sunday night and Monday morning, slamming Democrats and his former national security advisor after they suggested his recent argument with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy indicated pro-Russia views.\n\nUS President Donald Trump (L) chats with Russian President Vladimir Putin as they attend the APEC ... More Economic Leaders' Meeting in the central Vietnamese city of Danang on November 11, 2017.\n\nTrump's sparring match with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office Friday has sparked widespread criticism that his actions backed Russia, with Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., telling CNN Sunday the Trump administration is \"becoming an arm of the Kremlin\" and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, saying the White House \"appears to be ... embracing Putin.\"\n\nTrump responded to that criticism in Truth Social posts , saying Monday he is \"the only president who gave none of Ukraine's land to Putin's Russia\" and adding, \"Remember that when the weak and ineffective Democrat's criticize, and the Fake News gladly puts out anything they say!\"\n\nThe president was likely referring to how Crimea, formerly part of Ukraine, was annexed by Russia in 2014 under President Barack Obama, and Ukraine has lost 11% of its land since the war with Russia began during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nHe claimed Sunday night the U.S. should \"spend less time worrying about Putin, and more time\" worrying about an influx of undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe president also responded to comments his former National Security Advisor HR McMaster made on \"60 Minutes\" Sunday about Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy, telling the news program that \"Putin couldn't be happier\" about how Trump's Oval Office meeting went, \"because what he sees is all of the pressure on Zelenskyy, all of the pressure on Ukraine and no pressure on him.\"\n\nMcMaster \"IS A WEAK AND TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE LOSER!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social Sunday night following his former advisor's comments.\n\nTrump is being \"played\" by Putin, McMaster told \"60 Minutes,\" saying Putin \"appeals to President Trump's sense of aggrievement, right? That, you know, 'Donald, you know, like me, you know, you've been treated so unfairly.'\" The Russian president has \"been very successful at it because he's a master manipulator and one of the best liars in the world,\" McMaster, whom Trump fired in 2018, added.\n\nRussia gave indications that it's happy with how Trump is handling the war in Ukraine even before the Friday Oval Office meeting, as Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media Wednesday the Trump administration's \"foreign policy configurations\" now \"largely [align]\n\n46%. That's the share of U.S. adults who believe Trump favors Russia in its war against Ukraine, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll that was conducted last week but largely before the Oval Office argument. Only 11% of respondents believed Trump sides with Ukraine in the conflict, while 43%-including a majority of Republicans-believe he's treating both sides equally.\n\nTrump's meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday-slated to be a straightforward meeting ahead of signing a planned minerals deal-devolved into an argument before the press, after Zelenskyy noted to Trump and Vice President JD Vance that Putin has refused to follow ceasefire agreements in the past. Vance responded by accusing Zelenskyy of being \"disrespectful\" and \"try[ing] to litigate this in front of the American media,\" leading to an argument between the leaders. Trump told Zelenskyy Ukraine was \"not really in a good position right now\" and accused the Ukrainian president of \"gambling with World War III.\" \"You're either gonna make a deal or we are out, and if we're out, you'll fight it out,\" Trump told Zelenskyy about Ukraine's negotiations with Russia. The argument caused the planned minerals deal to fall apart and threw a wrench into the U.S.' negotiations with Ukraine and Russia on ending the war, with Trump saying after the meeting he \"determined that [Zelenskyy] is not ready for peace if America is involved because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations.\"\n\nThe accusations from Democrats about Trump acting in line with Putin comes as the president has long raised scrutiny over his ties to Russia. Special Counsel Robert Mueller conducted an investigation during Trump's first term into whether his 2016 campaign colluded with Moscow. That probe did not \"establish\" there was any illegal collaboration, but concluded \"the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome,\" while the Trump campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.\" Trump has also praised Putin as a \"genius\" who was \"pretty savvy\" in his invasion of Ukraine, and reports before the election suggested Trump spoke with the Russian leader seven times while he was out of office. The Trump administration has been trying to reach a negotiation to end the war in Ukraine after Trump previously claimed he could end the conflict in \"24 hours,\" and Trump spoke to Putin in what he described as a \"lengthy and highly productive\" phone call in February. The Trump administration has also said it's speaking with Russia about other matters like restoring embassy offices, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio has previously said his office is in discussions about exploring closer relations with Moscow.\n\nOne Community.

More leaders. (Photo by Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images)\n\nJust as President Volodymyr Zelensky was preparing to arrive in Washington D.C. on Friday, February 28 th to sign an unprecedented US-Ukraine agreement on strategic minerals , Vladimir Putin came up with a proposal of his own , involving joint development with the U.S. of rare earth metals, aluminum, and hydro power in Russia. It's trolling of 99 th level.\n\nAt face value, this could be seen as a step towards renormalizing U.S.-Russia trade relations. President Trump is entertaining the notion of economic rapprochement but isn't ready to commit yet. Economic cooperation comes after the cease-fire or peace accord in Ukraine, not before. On February 27 th , only a couple of days after Putin's proposal, Trump extended wide-ranging sanctions on Russia . Meanwhile, US Russia watchers are telling this author that Putin's offer is nothing more than a troll to counter the Trump-Zelensky mineral deal.\n\nDuring an interview on state television with journalist Pavel Zarubin, Putin surprised the audience by talking up potential joint energy and metallurgical megaprojects with the U.S, highlighting an estimated $15 billion hydropower and aluminum production project in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, touting Russia's ability to resume supplying the U.S. with aluminum - a market where it once had a 15% share of imports.\n\nDespite claiming that a potential U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal is \"of no concern\" to Russia, Putin's offer to work with Americans to access mineral reserves in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories was meant to muddle the discussions leading up to the deal. His comment that Russia has \"an order of magnitude more resources of this kind than in Ukraine\" is simply an attempt to one-up Zelensky's mineral deal amidst already tense U.S.-Ukraine negotiations.\n\nPutin's offer comes shortly before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visits the United States ... More to sign a strategic mineral agreement with U.S. President Donald Trump. (Photo by Uliana Boichuk/Novyny LIVE/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)\n\nThis is not the first time that Putin has trolled Trump by making business proposals. After Houthi/Iranian strikes on Saudi oil facilities in 2019 , Putin joked that Riyadh should consider purchasing Russian S-300 or S-400 air defense systems instead of depending on American technology for defense. When Europe faced an energy crisis in 2022 after Russia cut its gas flow, he commented that if Europe wanted more gas, it should just lift sanctions and activate Nord Stream 2. The Russian president has a track record of stirring the pot by identifying real needs or issues and offering seemingly plausible but politically unrealistic solutions.\n\nRussia's current business climate starkly contrasts with how it was before the second invasion of Ukraine. Western companies have abandoned Russia after more than 30 years of successful development. Russian banks face severe financial sanctions, and currency transactions are significantly limited. Moreover, launching new investment projects is impossible without the systematic lifting of sanctions. It may take years to alter this new reality, and Putin is aware of it.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has amplified the imbalance of Russia's economy, as high inflation has driven interest rates to a record 21% , and Russia's workforce has been severely affected by war losses , with many working-age men still on the frontlines, working in military factories, or wounded and dead.\n\nEconomic factors aside, the political risks for American businesses in Russia are greater than they were after the fall of the Soviet Union. The dangers of corruption, criminal conviction and imprisonment of business leaders, as happened with Michael Calvey and Eugene Spector , and seizures of Western companies such as French yogurt maker Danone and Danish brewer Carlsberg by state-owned businesses have continued. Russia's second invasion of Ukraine has turned the clock back 40 years to the pre-Gorbachev era of the Cold War. The Kremlin has taken greater control of the Russian economy, carving up assets across industries, and redistributing them to regime loyalists.\n\nThe privatization of Russia's only major rare earth producer, Solikamsk Magnesium Plant , previously owned by billionaire Pyotr Kondrashov, was declared illegal , and all assets were transferred to Russia's state nuclear monopoly, Rosatom. The nuclear behemoth is closely associated with Mikhail Kovalchuk , President of the famed Kurchatov Institute for nuclear physics, a Putin crony and supporter of the Ukraine war. Kovalchuk is also head of the Scientific Council of the Russian Maritime Board, a hardline group of former security leaders who supported the Ukraine invasion, including Putin's former National Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev.\n\nAny business or investor seeking to reenter the Russian market will have to ask themselves whether they want their operations to be at the mercy of the Russian siloviki security bosses and the Kremlin-controlled judicial system.\n\nSeveral factors, such as corruption and state control of industries pose political risk to any ... More Russian joint venture. (UC Rusal Photo Gallery, Wikimedia Commons)\n\nReturning to Russia will also create major compliance issues for American companies, even if Trump opted to lift the sanctions. Washington's engagement with Moscow has widened the growing rift between the U.S. and its allies. If the U.S. were to unilaterally lift sanctions, it is likely that there would be a major push in some European countries to reinforce their own, while others would also accommodate Moscow to get a leg up for cheap natural resources.\n\nOne of the concerns regarding the viability of the Ukraine-US mineral deal is whether American companies are willing to make capital-intensive, long-term investments in a high-risk environment . The Russian offer, even if serious, can pose even greater risks. Russia's uncertain business environment and the potential for a future US shift in strategy back to confrontation with the Kremlin call into question the viability of any significant investment in Russia at this stage. But Putin is aware of this. Trump's strategic mineral agreement with Zelensky highlights the president's intent to claim a win for the U.S. as part of any peace settlement, while Putin's energy and metals offer is an opportunistic gambit to exploit this desire and deepen divisions in the West.\n\nBlake Amann contributed to the production of this article"

More the White House on February 28 in Washington, DC.\n\nThe Trump administration \"is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,\" which \"largely aligns with our vision,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media in comments that aired Sunday, as translated by Agence France-Presse.\n\nImproving the U.S.' relationship with Russia has \"a long way to go because a lot of damage has been done to the whole complex of bilateral relations,\" Peskov said, but if Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin's current \"political will ... is maintained, this path can be quite quick and successful.\"\n\nPeskov's comments were made Wednesday, The New York Times reports , before Trump and Vice President JD Vance fought with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday, scuttling a planned minerals deal.\n\nTrump said Ukraine was \"not really in a good position right now\" during the Oval Office argument and accused Zelenskyy of \"gambling with World War III,\" saying about Ukraine reaching a deal with Russia and the U.S., \"You're either gonna make a deal or we are out, and if we're out, you'll fight it out.\"\n\nThe incident has sparked criticism that the Trump administration is aligning itself with Russia, with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, saying the White House \"appears to be ... embracing Putin\" and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., telling CNN on Sunday the Trump administration is \"becoming an arm of the Kremlin.\"\n\nIt's unclear what will happen with negotiations to bring about an end to Russia's war with Ukraine in the wake of Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy. Trump said following the Oval Office argument that Zelenskyy can \"come back when he is ready for peace,\" adding he \"determined that [Zelenskyy] is not ready for peace if America is involved because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations.\"\n\nTrump National Security Advisor Michael Waltz told CNN on Sunday the State Department is speaking with both Ukraine and Russia right now \"about what they need to see to end this war.\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio has previously said the administration was speaking about how it could explore closer relations with Russia, and Russia's foreign minister suggested in late February the country is preparing for a possible meeting between Trump and Putin. When asked about what the U.S. was discussing with Russia, Waltz said Sunday the Trump administration is \"having conversations\" with Russia about \"broadening [the U.S.'s]\n\nTrump's meeting with Zelenskyy has derailed the president's efforts to negotiate peace with Ukraine and Russia, after Trump previously claimed he could end the ongoing war in \"24 hours.\" The incident has led heads of democracies around the world to express support for Ukraine, and comes after Ukraine has relied on aid and military support from the U.S. in its war against Russia. Trump has long faced scrutiny for his relationship with Russia and Putin, with Special Counsel Robert Mueller conducting an investigation during his first term into whether Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with Moscow. Mueller's probe \"did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government\" on the election, Mueller wrote in his final report, but noted, \"The Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome,\" while the Trump campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.\" Trump has praised Putin as a \"genius\" and said the Russian leader was \"pretty savvy\" in his invasion of Ukraine, with reports before the election suggesting Trump spoke with Putin seven times while he was out of office. Trump then had what he described as a \"lengthy and highly productive\" phone call with Putin in February as he sought to begin negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, which the Associated Press notes brought an end to a three-year effort the Biden administration led to \"isolate\" Putin from other Western leaders.\n\nCORRECTION (3/2): This article has been updated to clarify when Peskov's comments were made.\n\nOne Community.

      "text": "Putin's Long Tables Explained: Why He Puts Some Leaders, Including Germany's Scholz, At An Extreme Distance\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's every move is dissected as fears escalate that he'll soon order an invasion of Ukraine, but attention has recently turned to why Putin sits across from a comically large table during meetings with other world leaders, the most recent instance of which came Tuesday during a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin (L) and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are seen ahead of their ... More meeting over Ukraine security at the Kremlin, in Moscow, on February 15, 2022.\n\nThe issue first took global spotlight last week after Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron sat at opposite ends of a table pegged by Reuters to be 20 feet long during their meeting in Moscow.\n\nThe extreme social distance came after Macron refused to take a Russian-administered Covid-19 PCR test, and Reuters reported Thursday it was because France didn't want Russia to have access to Macron's DNA, citing two anonymous sources close to Macron.\n\nAnother French official told Reuters the protocols were due to Putin living a \"strict health bubble,\" and the Kremlin confirmed the extreme distance is to protect Putin.\n\nScholz met the same distanced fate as Macron during his Tuesday meeting in Moscow, sparking memes and providing comic relief during otherwise tense negotiations.\n\nThe distance came after Scholz refused to take a Russian-administered Covid-19 PCR test, an unnamed German official told AFP Tuesday.\n\nPutin even keeps his own aides at a major distance: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov sat at the opposite end of a different, extremely long table during a one-on-one Monday meeting with the Russian president, but Lavrov's distance may be due to his February 10 meeting with U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who Lavrov met in Moscow 10 days after Truss tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin (L) and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban (R) hold a meeting on ...

More Kremlin, in Moscow on February 14, 2022.\n\nThe extremely distanced table made its first appearance during Putin's February 1 meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and The Guardian speculated at the time Orbán's banishment was due to not quarantining before seeing Putin, a typical requirement for Russian officials coming face to face with the president. Putin has not kept all leaders at an extreme distance: Putin appeared in images in close proximity to Chinese President Xi Jingping and Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev during separate February meetings with the two, causing some to suggest that Putin's decision on who to distance is a political power play.\n\nThe meeting between Putin and Scholz comes at a particularly pivotal moment in diplomacy between the West and Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stoked fear when he predicted Russia will invade Ukraine Wednesday, though his aides later clarified it was a dark joke. During a televised portion of their Monday meeting, Lavrov told Putin that Russia should continue to engage in diplomatic negotiations with the West, saying the possibility of a diplomatic solution in Ukraine is \"far from exhausted.\" Putin agreed to continue negotiations, even as the West increasingly warns of an impending Russian invasion. Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security advisor, said Sunday an attack could come as early as this week, while U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday an invasion could come in the next 48 hours. Russia said Tuesday they will pull back some of its more than 130,000 troops reportedly at the Ukraine border, a preliminary indication that Russia is willing to walk down its aggression, at least temporarily.\n\nTable Separating Macron And Putin Was So Long Due To Macron's Reported Fears Over Russian Spying Via PCR Test ( Forbes )\n\nPutin kept Macron at a distance for snubbing COVID demands: sources (Reuters)\n\nPutin's massive table: powerplay or paranoia?

He has since served four terms as president and one term as prime minister, making him the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Joseph Stalin. He reportedly won his most recent election in 2018 with 77% of the electorate, though experts generally view elections in Russia as fraudulent. In February 2022, Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine, seeking to topple the country's leadership and install a pro-Kremlin government, a move that was met by international condemnation. That has turned into a prolonged war that's currently in a stalemate. Putin recently fended off what many observers considered the most serious threat to his power when Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner mercenary group, attempted an apparent military coup, which abruptly ended as his forces approached Moscow. Progozhin died in a mysterious plane crash in Russia two months later.\n\nRecent changes to the Russian constitution mean that Putin could stay in office another two terms, until 2036.\n\nPutin Declares Wartime Reelection Run at Meeting With Troops (Bloomberg)\n\nPutin sends message to world with 'spontaneous' election announcement (Reuters)"

      "text": "How Can Putin Afford War In Ukraine? His $130 Billion Gold Hoard Helps\n\nBy Christopher Helman\n\nBy Christopher Helman ,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\nPutin visiting the Central Depository of the Bank of Russia in 2011.\n\nHow can Russian President Vladimir Putin afford the costs-both direct and indirect-of a new war in Ukraine? Easy-he's been preparing for years. Russia's central bank reserves now stand at $640 billion , a record. That pile is equivalent to 17 months of Russian export revenues, and continues to grow, thanks to surging oil prices.\n\nRussia exports some 5 million barrels per day of crude oil, plus 2.5 million bpd of refined petroleum products, according to Cowen & Co., amounting to about 10% of the global oil trade. With Brent crude hitting an eight-year high of $88.88 this morning, that amounts to more than $600 million a day in petro-cash.\n\nOn top of that is 23 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas exports (roughly 2 bcfd of which now transits through Ukraine)-worth another $400 million a day at today's elevated European prices .\n\nImportantly, it's no longer apt to refer to Russia's fossil fuel income as \"petro-dollars,\" as Putin has been working hard to \"de-dollarize\" the Russian economy. Back in 2013 Russia received dollars for 95% of its exports to Brazil, India, South Africa and China. Today, according to the Congressional Research Service , after a decade of de-dollarization just 10% of that trade is in greenbacks.\n\nAnd Putin has created new payment processing systems, as a replacement for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT (from which Biden has threatened to cut Russia off); in 2015 after U.S. sanctions Moscow launched the Mir payment platform ( now even connected to Apple Pay ).\n\nPutin has increasingly replaced trade in dollars with gold. From a record low of $2 billion worth of gold in 1995, Russia has piled up a mountain of it- now worth $130 billion , or 20% of total reserves. That's equivalent to about 72 million 1 oz. gold coins, or 4.5 million pounds. Only the U.S., Germany and Italy hold more gold.\n\nThough Russia mines a lot of gold, platinum and palladium itself, some of the pile may be coming from friends like Venezuela, which in 2019 reportedly loaded 20 tons of it onto a Russian Boeing 777, part of a liquidation of some 300 tons from Caracas coffers.\n\n(Putin is not the only goldbug-central banks have added 4,500 tons of gold reserves over the past decade.)\n\nAccording to Johns Hopkins University economist professor Steve Hanke, Russia's central bank has displayed high competence in managing the rouble, and it shows: Since 2016 it has held mostly steady at .013 per dollar, though dropping about 8% in recent months during the Ukraine military buildup.\n\nClearly, Putin has been putting funds to work investing in his military. Spending ramped up to a peak of $90 billion per year in 2013, ahead of his Crimea invasion, and totaled $60 billion in 2020, according to World Bank data .\n\nThis pales in comparison to U.S. military spending of $780 billion and China's $250 billion in 2020-though Russia does spend more as a percentage of GDP, at 4%. Putin could likely ramp that spending more if he wanted to-according to BNP Paribas data , Russia's public debt is 18% of GDP, while total external debt is less than 30% of GDP. Ukraine's debt load is 80% of GDP, while the U.S.' is more than 100% ."

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe U.S. should maintain the political and economic isolation of Vladimir Putin as the Russian leader will not be around forever, Volodymyr Zelensky has said.\n\nIn an interview with European broadcasters on Wednesday, the Ukrainian president said that it would be \"dangerous\" for the U.S. to ease the pressure on the Russian leader who \"will die soon.\"\n\nZelensky did not elaborate further about the health of the Russian leader but also went on to discuss a Black Sea ceasefire agreed upon in Saudi Arabia and spoke about the U.S. role as an ally for Ukraine's fight against Russia.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the Kremlin for comment.\n\nOver the war, rumors have abounded about Putin's health. Zelensky may have been simply referring to how no leader lives forever. But Zelensky's insistence that the United States continue isolating Putin underscores Kyiv's fear that Western concessions-especially around sanctions-could erode international leverage.\n\nZelensky took questions from several broadcasters on Wednesday in Paris where European leaders are meeting for a Ukraine security summit.\n\nThe wide-ranging interview followed talks in Saudi Arabia in which Russia and Ukraine agreed to a partial ceasefire in the Black Sea and halts to strikes against energy infrastructure. In return, the U.S. agreed to help restore Russian access to global markets.\n\nBut Zelensky said he hoped the U.S. would \"stand strong\" in the face of Russian demands to lift sanctions as a condition for the Black Sea ceasefire.\n\nZelensky said that the U.S. should not bring Putin out of political and economic isolation and that right now was \"one of the most dangerous moments.\"\n\nThe Russian leader wanted to remain in power until his death and he had ambitions beyond Ukraine which was why the U.S. and Europe should stay united in pressuring the Russian leader, Zelensky said.\n\nHe added that \"he will die soon,\" after which \"everything will be over.\"\n\nZelensky gave no further details and while Putin has faced questions about his health which the Kremlin has always dismissed, the Ukrainian president may have been more broadly referring to how no leader can go on indefinitely.\n\nZelensky said that Ukraine was disturbed by comments made by Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff that Ukrainians living under Russian occupation may want to be ruled by Moscow.\n\nWitkoff's recent comments to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson have sparked criticism that he was repeating Kremlin rhetoric about the four mainland Ukrainian regions Putin has claimed to have annexed.\n\nWitkoff said that referendums in the Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine had showed \"the overwhelming majority of people have indicated they want to be under Russian rule.\"\n\nZelensky also appeared to disparage Witkoff saying that he had a background in property development rather than diplomacy. \"He knows very well how to buy and sell real estate, but that's somewhat different,\" said Zelensky.\n\nReferring to Witkoff's comments, Zelensky has said he was concerned about the influence of Russian disinformation among U.S. government officials\n\nZelensky has previously said that the Trump administration was buying the lines pushed by the Kremlin, and returned to this theme on Wednesday, saying: \"We are fighting for ourselves and will fight these narratives, wherever they are.\"\n\nHowever, Zelensky also expressed confidence that Trump could see through the Kremlin narratives and earlier this week, the U.S. president admitted that Vladimir Putin could be \"dragging his feet\" over the Riyadh ceasefire deal.\n\nZelensky was asked about how reliable the U.S. under President Donald Trump was as an ally, given its brief pause of military assistance and intelligence and that in the Ukrainian president's own words, the U.S. administration had swallowed Russian rhetoric.\n\nZelensky said that the was grateful for the U.S. weapons that were provided, such as Patriot missile systems.\n\nBut he said that Kyiv believed the Americans would be reliable partners and praised the unblocking of aid, which Zelensky said showed Trump understood the threats Ukraine was facing.\n\nZelensky said the return of Ukrainian children illegally deported to Russia was a major priority for Kyiv during its ceasefire talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia.\n\nKyiv says that Russia abducted at least 19,500 Ukrainian children since the start of the war. About 1,200 have been brought home, according to the Ukrainian government's Children of War database.\n\nThe return of these children are among key conditions for any future peace agreement with Russia, Zelensky said, adding that the fate of the missing children had disappeared from media coverage but it was \"the number one\" priority for Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. has said it remained committed to the return of kidnapped Ukrainian children, the exchange of prisoners of war and the release civilian detainees.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the interview: \"He (Putin) will die soon, that is a fact, and everything will be over...it is very important that America does not help Putin to get out of this global isolation now.\"\n\nMiddle East special envoy Steve Witkoff told Tucker Carlson: \"I want to see Ukraine come out of this OK, I want to see Russia come out of this OK.\"\n\nThe interview took place shortly after Zelensky met French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. The Ukrainian president will meet European leaders on Thursday to discuss how they can help Ukraine in the event of a permanent ceasefire as the prospect of a peacekeeping force has been floated.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington is evaluating conditions put forward by Russia after Moscow agreed in principle to the Black Sea ceasefire.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nBrendan Cole is a Newsweek Senior News Reporter based in London, UK.

His focus is domestic U.S. politics, but he has experience covering Foreign Affairs, Business and Technology. Peter joined Newsweek in 2024 from Fox News Digital and had previously freelanced at Business Insider. He has interviewed such notable figures as Benjamin Netanyahu, Gen. David H. Petraeus, British Foreign Ministers James Cleverly and Grant Shapps and a ranking member of the Taliban. He graduated from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, but is New York born and raised.

Languages: English.\n\nBased on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nEstonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Margus Tsahkna told Newsweek in an interview that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is \"playing\" with the Trump administration when it comes to a lasting peace deal with Ukraine.\n\nEstonia is a NATO member and one of the three NATO allies - including newly-admitted Finland - that share a border with Russia.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday announced that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to a deal that would \"eliminate the use of force\" in the Black Sea following talks in Saudi Arabia - a key step towards a broader peace deal that could end the war in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously raised concerns about the long-term viability of any deal with Putin, most notably during last month's high-profile argument with Trump and Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office. He said then that Kyiv had previously signed agreements with Russia that Putin ignored when he invade Ukraine in 2022.\n\nZelensky reiterated that stance on Wednesday , accusing Russia of sending 117 drones overnight and targeting civilian infrastructure, including homes, following the news of the Black Sea deal. He argued that Putin sent a \"clear signal to the whole world that Moscow is not going to pursue real peace.\"\n\nIn the interview Tuesday in Washington, Estonia's Tsahkna agreed with Zelensky, saying Putin had\"broken all the deals that he has made,\" adding \"from our perspective and our experiences, we can't trust Putin.\"\n\n\"My greatest concern is that Putin actually doesn't want to have any kind of peace - just and lasting peace, sustainable peace - and he's just playing with President Trump, playing with Ukraine, playing with all of us,\" Tsahkna said.\n\n\"Because I have some reasons for that as well to be suspicious: Because President Putin has always said that the main thing he's going to use all these talks [to do] is to eliminate the \"root causes,\" and the root causes for him is not about Ukraine or some territories. It's about U.S. influence in Europe.\"\n\nAt the same time, Tsahkna stressed that Estonia remains confident in the U.S. commitment to NATO and the alliance's strength and power following a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday.\n\nTsahkna said he has \"no doubt\" that the U.S. is \"committed to NATO\" and \"committed to Baltic States,\" and he is \"happy as well that President Trump again has pushed European countries in NATO to invest more heavily to defense.\"\n\nNewsweek spoke with Tsahkna on camera at the Estonian Embassy in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday. The Estonian foreign minister has held his post since April 2023, having served in his role for the majority of the Russia-Ukraine war. The discussion has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nQ : Obviously, the great concern right now is what's going on in Ukraine and Russia, and the impacts in NATO. What is your greatest concern regarding the current talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US?\n\nA: My greatest concern is that Putin actually doesn't want to have any kind of peace - just and lasting peace, sustainable peace - and he's just playing with President Trump, playing with Ukraine, playing with all of us, because I have some reasons for that as well to be suspicious: Because President Putin has always said that the main thing he's going to use all these talks is to eliminate the root causes, and the root causes for him is not about Ukraine or some territories. It's about U.S. influence in Europe. It's about the NATO enlargement processes from the past. It's about European security architecture. It's about, actually, so-called, restoration of Soviet Union. So he actually declared that already, 2007 in Munich Security Conference, and now he's fulfilling the plans. And the facts, what [they] are based on, is that actually he had a plan for the six or three days special operation in Ukraine, take over Ukraine and destroy totally the independence of Ukraine. He failed that totally.\n\nNow he's waging more than three years full-scale war, with all the atrocities, killing hundreds of thousands of people - Russian people, Ukraine people, deporting children - but he hasn't not been successful. He has not been successful about gaining these kind of goals he had, and he has not made any strategic breakthroughs during this war, because Ukrainians, they have been fighting heavily, and also we all, we have been supporting Ukraine. Now he's trying to use these talks about gaining the other goals, and it's not about finding the peace. We see as well that President Trump, together with President Zelensky, U.S. and Ukraine, they have put on the table the proposal, let's have a full scale ceasefire. It's like a precondition to start -to] negotiate, and we don't have it. We don't have it.\n\nAnd also, we have more conditions from Putin side, even today, after the talks. If you read the notes from U.S. and Ukraine side, they're talking about the Black Sea...if you read the readout from Russian side, you are reading more conditions, preconditions for this kind of thing. So, I cannot see the real willingness from Putin. What we need to do together with President Trump and Ukraine is actually to make it clear whether Putin wants to have peace or not. This is my main concern.\n\nQ: Do you worry that Putin would break this deal in a similar way that he allowed the grain deal brokered through the UN to collapse?\n\nA: Putin has broken all the deals that he has made. As president Zelensky has said as well, and we can ensure that from our perspective and our experiences, we can't trust Putin, and this is already old, knowing from our side as well, because we have been living long time as a bordering country of Russia, you must put Russia in the weak position, and then talk to them. And you need to push them to the solution. They only accept the strength.\n\nThis has been always like this, and it is, as I said before, as well, it is exactly right now as well. So every new compromise is a new red line for them, and they are asking more, and they are not asking about even about the topic how to find the peace in Ukraine. They're asking many, many other things,so that's really unfortunate.\n\nQ: Over the weekend, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff gave a few interviews in which he made comments essentially legitimizing Russia's claim over the disputed territories in Ukraine, and he said that he takes Putin at his word. Do you worry that the Trump administration is too trusting of Putin, and what do you say to Witkoff after making those kinds of comments?\n\nA: Yes, we are going to comment everything online, what one or the other person is saying, so we can find ourselves in a very difficult situation, but I think that maybe it is a part of the tactics. Maybe not. I don't know, but I'm really sure that, as with Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, U.S. would not recognize the occupation in the beginning. During the 50 years of Soviet Union occupation in the Baltic states, there was a really clear non-recognition policy.\n\nSo I can say only as a foreign minister of Estonia that Estonia will never accept the fact that one of the other countries changing the territories, using military force. So territorial integrity is a core issue for us, and I think for everyone else in the world. But if we are talking about the ceasefire, if we are talking about the momentum, where Ukrainians, where Russia is, that we need to have this kind of ceasefire to start to negotiate about the further steps, because the goal for Trump and also for Ukraine and for us as well, is a sustainable peace ... a long, lasting peace.\n\nThen we need to talk about, as well, the release of hostages. We didn't know that more than 20,000 children they had deported. So as well territories. But as well, we need to talk about the working security guarantees or the or the other system of architecture that Russia will never start aggression again. But we are not at that point yet.\n\nIn Europe, we have understood clearly that we need to take responsibility, so we already formed the coalition of the willing. European leaders are meeting again this Thursday in Paris. Estonia will be there. We are ready to put our commitment on the table. But there are preconditions, and the first precondition is actually that we will see that Putin will like to have a peace. So these are the cases. So let's see what is going to happen.\n\nQ: The Trump administration has stressed that they believe economic security guarantees are as effective as military security guarantees . Do you agree with that view, and should the U.S. expand those kinds of economic guarantees to more countries within the alliance or on the border with Russia?\n\nA: Of course, the economic guarantees are very well-working guarantees in the meaning that if you have a strategic investments, you have your companies in one of the other country, though you need to protect them. But the question is, how then you're going to protect them, if one or the other will attack this precise country?\n\nSo finally, we reach on that level that Ukraine and as well other countries as Estonia is already more than 20 years in NATO, there must be established as well the security guarantees, which are mainly military. Europe is ready to do that. Europe is ready to take responsibility, but we need to work together. That's the main thing. So this is what we are talking about. This is an alliance in the beginning, and of course, if U.S. is going to decide to invest heavily to strategic economy, to Ukraine or to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, whenever, we will be more than happy. This is like assurance that the U.S. is taking this concrete country as an ally and ready to protect it as well.\n\nBut, you know, we are member of NATO. We are a member of European Union , but Ukraine is just in the middle of the war, which has been started by President Putin and Russia. I think that this minerals agreement is framed that it can be followed by Western real cooperation, companies and people working in Ukraine, of course, establishing the higher level of security guarantees right now.\n\nQ: Do you have any concerns about the U.S. commitment to NATO? And do you believe that NATO is in a better place now than it was three years ago?\n\nA: NATO is in better place than three years ago, because NATO is stronger than ever before. We have Finland. Sweden joined NATO and from all perspective and in our region, it's a lot. And this is a paradox that Putin has been the best salesman of the NATO enlargement and also the enlargement processes of the European Union. And now happily we welcome these two very strong nations in our region to NATO. So NATO is in solid place. So if you wanted to ask about Article Five and this kind of assurances, I have no doubt that the U.S. is there. We had a meeting today with Secretary Rubio. Had no doubt that U.S. is committed to NATO. U.S. is committed to Baltic states, but as a foreign minister of Estonia and previous defense minister, I'm happy as well that President Trump again has pushed European countries in NATO to invest more heavily in defense.\n\nI think that they would have done it and should have done it already 10 years ago, and we Estonians, we don't need to change our policies. We have decided already that we are crossing the two percent agreed investment level. We decided last week that we reach at least five percent next year, and it can probably it's going to be even up. So we see that all the Baltics, also Poland, which is a big country, is doing five percent within the next years. But it is not only because of President Trump. It's because we see the real threat from Russia. We have agreed in NATO the regional defense plans already during the NATO Summit in Vilnius two years ago, and we are just fulfilling the gaps that we have agreed.\n\nAnd I'm very happy that the other NATO member states in Europe, they are following that. We saw last week the historical decision from Germany, when Germany really decided first time after the Second World War, to invest to its own security and defense capabilities close to a trillion euros. This is amazing thing, and they are the largest economy in Europe as well. So we see that many other nations, as in all the Nordics, they are doing the same things. This is something that satisfies as well, the criticism from the U.S. side, more precisely, maybe as well, from President Trump, sides that Europe really has been working up, so we invest heavily more.\n\nBut I'm sure that the NATO is important for both sides, for Europe, for for U.S. as well. Because if anything is happening with with with NATO, meaning that Article Five is not working, everyone will lose, and also U.S. will lose its strong position as a leader on global level. So that's why I'm sure, I have no any kind of proof, that actually U.S. is not committed to NATO.\n\nQ: Do you have a message for the NATO members who still haven't met that 2 percent level? [NATO Secretary General Mark] Rutte said recently that NATO should [consider] spending way more than 3 percent. You said you're aiming for 5 [percent]. Do you believe that all NATO members can achieve that?\n\nA: You know, the GDP figure is always bigger. Even the country sizes are different. Economies are smaller and bigger, but 5 percent or whatever, percent of GDP shows the burden to your people, to your economies. So Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, we have as well pensioners, we have as well the education systems, we have as well the social systems, medical systems, but my message is clear that these kind of peace times are over.\n\nThe second thing is that no one else is coming to solve our problems in Europe. We need to understand that if we want U.S. standing together with us, we need to pay and invest as well to our capabilities. The burden must be shared. It's very, very honest thing to us from U.S. as well. It is a good thing for our alliance, but as well, Russia will remain a threat. And it's not only our problem as bordering countries. We are protecting, literally, NATO. We are protecting Europe, and we have witnessed during the last three years, during the full scale of war in Ukraine, that even the war in Ukraine has put our economy - we all pay more, not only by supporting Ukraine, but also if you see the economic or growth in Europe, if you see the sanction regime results so on.\n\nSo it is most, cheapest way now to invest in defense. Two percent, it's not any more than ... if you're talking at least like three, 3.5 percent average for every NATO member, and I do believe that we will find this kind of common understanding during the Hague NATO Summit this summer.\n\nQ: Do you have concerns that increasing military spending will hurt other areas of the economy or other programs in terms of - you mentioned pensioners and education - do you worry that you will have to move resources from those programs to finance the military growth?\n\nA: You know, my nickname in Estonia is \"cutting crocodile,\" so we have passed this already, 2008 and 2009, when we have economic crisis as well. Now we are doing heavy cuts, but not from actually the benefits or this kind of social systems as much, but for about how much actually we are spending for running our bureaucracies, our, you know, state solutions. And I see lots of opportunities for innovation.\n\nEstonia is the, you know, the digital nation. We are very digitalized country about our services, so I see many, many opportunities to cut the bureaucracies. But of course, cutting our budgets, this is not the only solution, because this jump - what we need to do all together with our capabilities - I think that it needs to for us to take the long term loans, and our children will pay for that as well. But it's better to have the secured environment, to have the secured countries, to have freedom, instead of waging the full scale war. And this is reality, the war may come if we are not investing enough to our defense expense, and also, this is not for preparing the war. This is for deterrence that Putin would understand that the price for him will be too high to even think about the new aggression.\n\nQ: One of the [issues] that has also troubled Europe in the past decade has been the immigration crisis - something that the U.S. is also concerned about on its front. Do you feel that Europe has made good progress with this crisis? Where do you see the current state of immigration across the union?\n\nA: It's a rightful question, because the mass immigration to Europe from different countries, it has happened before. Maybe I think that the most critical year was 2015, [2016]. And if you see as well the different elections amongst you know, different countries. The question is, there we see as well this part is increasing - the popularity of those who were very critical about the immigration questions - but also European Union has taken the measures against that. But from Estonian perspective, I can say that we are securing the border between different between different civilizations. So we are protecting the NATO and EU border, and this border is closed as well.\n\nIn Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Poland, we check literally every asset, every person, every vehicle, every car who's trying to cross the border. We are pushing back illegal people who normally are weaponized as well from the Russian side as so-called immigrants, but actually they are weapons to disturb our societies and so on. So I think that there has been a huge change about the attitude towards the immigration in Europe as well. We see, unfortunately, increase of antisemitism in Europe as well, and it has been connected to Gaza situation. So we have this instability as well different countries about the foreign policy based on the domestic problems. So I think that this problem is well heard as well in Europe.\n\nQ: As you mentioned Gaza: There's been a collapse recently with th at ceasefire deal , but there's still this eye towards what happens next. Do you see a role for Europe in a rebuild of Gaza, or is that something you think needs to mainly be handled by the Middle Eastern countries and the neighbors in that region?\n\nA: European Union and European countries, we have been very active already years in the region. And also we have been very, I think, the largest and the biggest donor to build up societies there, and also humanitarian support and education support and so on. But of course, it needs, finally, the two state solution, needs the two states to agree that they can live together and people they can live together, but we are really far away from that.\n\nAnd of course, Israel has all the right to protect itself, and no one is happy about this humanitarian crisis there as well. But there is no excuse for the terroristic organizations to terrorize the Israeli people, terrorize the region as a whole, and I'm really happy that we can talk to the leading countries in the region as well to find the ways out. We have had the ceasefires. We have had the exchange of the [prisoners] and so on. But now as well, I cannot see the very quick solution there, unfortunately.\n\nQ: Circling back to immigration: A lot of the migrants came from other countries, and I believe most of them were actually in Middle East - from Yemen and other countries - and there's been talk about moving the Palestinians as part of this rebuild . Do you see that as a problem to try and displace them? Or is that something you see as a step towards rebuilding?\n\nA: You know, as a Estonian, I can say that the displaced people from the territories they have been living in is not a solution. So I think that we need to find another solution. Then there won't be a terroristic organizations who are terrorizing the neighbors. There won't be an unstable situation that actually the people can live together.... be honest, there is a conflict between different religions. And it's not only about the Christianity and Muslims like different understandings, and this is about the history as well.\n\nMy question is, can we find a peace in this kind of regions when the causes, root causes, really, they're going back to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years? So the bad thing is that just innocent people are paying for that, and they are used by political ways. So just dislocating people, just like mechanically, it doesn't bring the solution there.\n\nQ: [We have] seen a surge of right-wing support in Europe. We saw that the elections last year in the European Parliament , there was a surge. We've seen [right wing] parties making gains in Germany , especially. Do you see a near future possibility that the right wing parties dominate European politics? Or do you think this is a short term issue?\n\nA: If the establishment, or however we call it, these parties who are responsible for the government, are not actually meeting the expectation from the people - so it may happen. But I think as well as I see the democracy in Europe, which is in very good condition, that the reactions they have been there, you see more conservative policies about immigration. You see more conservative understanding about the total openness of different issues. So this is the reaction, but my concern is that we need to give the opportunity for all people, wherever they are, to base their own choices on the solid information.\n\nSo we are living in the times when you can find in social media platforms, everywhere, online, total disinformation. I'm not talking only about the flat earth theory ... but I'm talking about real issues that people are deeply concerned and they very often they don't have, actually the objective information of what is really going on, and this kind of manipulations, they are more often using AI solutions, using AI-based communication robots in the future as well, which is not controlled by the civil societies. They are controlled by whatever the organization.\n\nSo I think that we all need to face with a new reality. How can we really run our democracies, which are based on the solid information and based on freedoms, freedom of speech, freedom of religions, freedom of internet as well? We need to understand that we are living in a totally new world, and these technologies are developing quicker than we are thinking. We are not talking about decades. We're talking about weeks, months and years. This is the topic we need to deal with.\n\nQ: People would say that the greatest competitor in those areas [technology] is China. Do you worry about the advances China is making in technology , including AI robotics, and do you believe that this is a significant threat to Europe?\n\nA: Of course, China is not based on economy. Everything in China is political, and China is using economical power to control the world. So this is a threat, of course, and it's not about only AI, it's about many other solutions of technological level. We are talking about defense industry, we're talking about energy, we're talking about communication. So we need to face that, and we need to cut the dependence from China. But also we are talking about the global companies, which is even hard to say which government is controlling that. This is something we need to understand, that we need to protect our people.\n\nAnd this is a debate as well will be probably between Europe and U.S., about how can we develop together, the AI platforms, how we develop together the global companies which are actually putting our people on the dependence positions. So I think that this kind of debate and also cooperation is crucial. But you are right. China is using all the different opportunities to increase its influence. They call it economical cooperation, but be honest, behind that, this is one thousand year plan how to have more influence on political level.\n\nQ: What do you view as the number one issue facing the U.S. and European relationship, and what would your advice to President Trump be to handle it and start to move towards a solution for it?\n\nA: I think that we both need to understand Europe and also U.S. that this transatlantic point is really very strong, and this is existential. And I'm not talking about defense cooperation. I think that NATO is in solid place if we can share the burden, and Europe is doing more, really, this is this is our duty anyways, but I'm talking about dependence as well between each other on economical level. So Europe is creating lots of jobs and invest in U.S. and the other way around. And if we're going to have this tariffs war, if you're going to cut this economical ties make our businesses more complicated to cooperate, only China, Russia, Iran, North Korea will gain from that.\n\nSo I need, I think that we just need to sit down and negotiate, if us, if President Trump's administration is feeling that actually the burden is shifted, it's not there. So we can talk about that. But can you imagine as well about defense industry... Europe will invest probably more than two trillion - not billion, but trillion - euros within the next years to defense industry. I think that they must happen together with us. We need as well U.S. energy. We need U.S. [liquified natural gas], we need U.S. as a partner, and together we share, actually the same values, which is freedom, which is a personal freedom for people, which is freedom of the different nations, to declare that the right to exist, you know, in the free world.\n\nSo we are talking about different values. What we have with China or with Russia or with North Korea or Iran. So this is something we need to understand before we are going to hit the road in the meeting with the wrong direction.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nPeter Aitken is a Newsweek Politics Editor based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin could be stalling in talks over a full ceasefire in Ukraine, U.S. President Donald Trump said, after Washington announced separate agreements with Kyiv and Moscow on pausing strikes and opening up trade in the Black Sea.\n\nTrump had accused Ukraine of not being \"ready\" for peace, which Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly denied. The Ukrainian leader has blamed Russia for the slow progress of talks, hurried on by the White House in the just over two months since Trump's inauguration.\n\nTrump told Newsmax on Tuesday that he believed Russia \"wants to see an end\" to the more than three years of war, \"but it could be they're dragging their feet.\"\n\n\"I've done it over the years,\" the Republican president then said. \"I don't want to sign a contract; I want to sort of stay in the game, but maybe I don't want to do it.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Ukraine agreed to a U.S.-proposed 30-day full ceasefire, while Russia refused to sign the deal after Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, who has emerged as a main conduit to Moscow, visited the Russian capital.\n\nZelensky accused the Kremlin of tripping up ceasefire talks, adding: \"Putin is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war and keep killing Ukrainians.\"\n\n\"It is Russia's stance that is prolonging this war,\" Zelensky then said in his daily evening address on Tuesday.\n\nRussia and Ukraine both agreed to a ceasefire covering the Black Sea, a key battleground, on Tuesday after fresh talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia.\n\nT he White House said Washington and Moscow had agreed to protect safe passage in the Black Sea, stop attacks and to prevent commercial vessels being used for military ends. A separate accord was reached between the U.S. and Ukraine.\n\nA Turkey-backed and United Nations-brokered deal, known as the Black Sea Grain Initiative, had been in place earlier in the war to allow Ukrainian grain exports to leave the Black Sea area. This deal expired when Russia withdrew from the agreement in summer 2023, saying its demands on grain and fertilizer exports had not been met.\n\nBoth sides committed to \"develop measures\" for implementing a ban on attacking energy infrastructure in Ukraine and Russia, the White House said.\n\nIn its own readout, the Kremlin said the Black Sea truce would come into effect only once the U.S. had lifted sanctions on its fertilizers and agricultural trade while expanding access to ports and payment systems.\n\n\"How Russia behaves in the coming days will reveal a lot-if not everything,\" Zelensky said on Tuesday. The Ukrainian leader said he was \"grateful\" to the U.S. for facilitating \"constructive and effective work,\" but added Kyiv did \"not trust\" Russia to stand by ceasefire deals.\n\n\"Frankly-the world doesn't trust Russia,\" Zelensky added.\n\nIn a separate document, Russia said Moscow and Washington had agreed that oil refineries, pipelines, pumping stations, electricity infrastructure and power plants, including nuclear sites, were off-limits for strikes orchestrated by Russia or Ukraine for 30 days.\n\nThe moratorium on energy attacks came into force on March 18, the Kremlin said. Zelensky added that Moscow was \"already trying to distort the agreements.\"\n\nBoth sides have accused one another of attacking energy infrastructure since March 18.\n\nTrump said he thinks \"R ussia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they're dragging their feet.\"\n\nZelensky said on Tuesday that \"if there are air raid alerts again, if there is renewed military activity in the Black Sea, if Russian manipulations and threats continue-then new measures will need to be taken, specifically against Moscow.\"\n\nIt is not clear whether the U.S. officials will be able to broker a full ceasefire, as they are still contending with apparently incompatible demands from Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nEllie Cook is a Newsweek security and defense reporter based in London, U.K. Her work focuses largely on the Russia-Ukraine war, the U.S. military, weapons systems and emerging technology.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nTo hear President Donald Trump tell it, the United States has never been more prosperous than now, six weeks into his presidency. In Trump's view, the economy is soaring, U.S. allies are finally stepping up and its foes are shrinking in the face of his \"America first\" geopolitical realignment.\n\nTrump proclaimed a \"golden age of America\" during his inauguration and doubled down in a speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, saying that since he's taken office, \"it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country.\"\n\n\"America is back,\" the president said to Republican roars.\n\nBut longtime U.S. allies see a different picture as they reel from the administration's pause in military and intelligence aid to Ukraine and Trump's deteriorating relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky .\n\nThe presidential address came days after Trump sent shockwaves across Europe when he and Vice President JD Vance got into a public spat with Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday in front of cameras, leading to Zelensky's dismissal from the White House without a minerals deal in hand that was the basis of his visit.\n\nWhile nearly every NATO ally balked at what they saw as the American president's display of contempt for Zelensky's wartime leadership, there was at least one long-serving leader who likely couldn't have imagined a better outcome.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and his allies in state media rejoiced after Friday's public blowup between Trump and Zelensky, while the Kremlin's spokesperson crowing that the White House's foreign policy now \"largely aligns with our vision.\"\n\nTrump's Oval Office showdown with Zelensky was perhaps the nadir in a series of steps the administration has taken that, according to at least some geopolitical analysts and Russia experts, amounts to a clear picture of American capitulation to Moscow.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the White House for comment on Wednesday.\n\nThe shift in the relationship started almost immediately after Trump took office, when Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) began systematically dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Trump and Musk have repeatedly called USAID a poster child for waste, fraud and abuse of American taxpayer dollars. A little over 1 percent of total federal spending in 2023 went towards foreign aid.\n\nAmong USAID's initiatives was a program designed to help Ukraine recover from Russia's repeated targeted strikes against its power grid. Moscow has used Ukraine as something of a cyberweapon testing ground for more than a decade, predating the war, and U.S. support has been critical in keeping Kyiv's energy grid up and running, potentially saving millions of civilians from freezing to death in the harsh winters.\n\nThe U.S. State Department quietly shuttered that initiative last week, according to NBC News.\n\nRussia welcomed the cuts, calling USAID, which primarily provides food, medicine and other services to impoverished populations - and thus acts as a projection of American soft power around the world - a \"machine for interfering in international affairs ... a mechanism for changing regimes, political order, state structure.\"\n\nTrump has also targeted the FBI and the CIA , the two main intelligence and counterintelligence agencies, for sweeping cuts. At the Justice Department, one of the first things Attorney General Pam Bondi did after being confirmed was disband the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force , a Biden-era initiative that aimed to counter foreign influence in American elections.\n\nBondi also narrowed the scope of the DOJ's enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which prosecutors have used to go after unregistered foreign lobbyists, including Trump's onetime campaign chairman, Paul Manafort . Trump pardoned Manafort shortly before leaving office his first term.\n\nIn another boon to Putin and pro-Russia forces, Bondi decided to shutter KleptoCapture, a special government unit geared toward enforcing sanctions on Russia and seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs.\n\nNone of these actions \"could be reasonably seen as bad for Russia,\" one Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of professional retaliation, told Newsweek .\n\nAt the United Nations , the U.S. joined Russia, North Korea and Belarus in voting against a resolution that condemned Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe vote, which took place on the third anniversary of that invasion, served as the first time since 1945 that Washington had sided with Moscow on an issue of European security at the UN.\n\nMeanwhile, during a visit to NATO headquarters last month, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth effectively took the remaining military leverage Ukraine may have against Russia off the table when he said Ukraine joining NATO is not a \"realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement.\"\n\nIn another blow to Kyiv, Hegseth said the U.S. would not deploy troops to Ukraine as part of a security guarantee, adding that any European peacekeepers sent to Ukraine should be deployed as part of a \"non-NATO mission,\" meaning Article 5, the alliance's collective defense agreement, would not protect them.\n\nHegseth pushed back sharply when Axios asked him whether Ukraine has any leverage left. \"It's just a cheap political point to say, 'Oh we've left all the negotiating cards off the table by recognizing some realities that exist on the ground,'\" he told the outlet.\n\nThe defense secretary's visit to Europe kicked off a whirlwind few weeks that brought about the biggest shift in American policy since the post-WWII rules-based international order was created.\n\nIn the following days, Trump held a call with Putin about negotiating a ceasefire in Ukraine, effectively ending the U.S.'s policy of isolating Russia on the world stage.\n\nAdding insult to injury, in Ukraine's eyes, Trump effectively shut Zelensky out of a conversation about his country's future.\n\nThe U.S. then sent a high-level delegation that included Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz to Saudi Arabia to meet with a Russian delegation for ceasefire talks.\n\nZelensky was again snubbed on getting an invite and canceled a planned visit to Saudi Arabia after saying negotiations in the Russia-Ukraine war should not happen \"behind the backs\" of the parties involved.\n\nTrump, rankled by Zelensky's public rebukes of the U.S.-Russia talks and accusation that the American president lived in a Russian \"disinformation space,\" then accused the Ukrainian president of being a \"dictator\" and called for elections to be held in Ukraine.\n\nUkraine is currently under martial law while it fights the war and cannot, under that law, hold a presidential election.\n\nThat was the backdrop for Friday's explosive Oval Office meeting, where Trump and Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of not being appreciative of U.S. support and Trump shouted him down for \"gambling with World War 3.\"\n\nThe public blowup came about 40 minutes into an otherwise unassuming bilateral discussion, in which Zelensky interrupted the pair to publicly litigate his position on a potential ceasefire that he said Putin would never abide by, citing a 2014 agreement that the Russian president had reneged on repeatedly.\n\nTrump, appearing agitated, then told Zelensky he doesn't \"have the cards,\" adding: \"You either make a deal or we're out.\"\n\nThe deal he was referring to was a rare earths agreement in which Ukraine would put a substantial portion of its minerals revenue in an \"investment fund\" set up for Ukraine's reconstruction.\n\nA grim-faced Zelensky was subsequently seen leaving the White House without having signed the deal. A joint news conference between the two leaders and a scheduled lunch was also abruptly canceled.\n\nTrump then took to social media to say Zelensky was only welcome back when he wanted to achieve peace. Zelensky released his own statement thanking the U.S., Trump, Congress and the American people for their support and has since said he is ready to repair the fractured relationship.\n\nSam Greene, a professor of Russian politics at King's College London's Russia Institute, didn't mince words when reacting to the meeting, telling The Guardian : \"That was a train wreck by design. The quiet conversation since [the Munich Security Conference] has been about setting Ukraine up for a fall.\"\n\nMichael McFaul, the U.S.'s former ambassador to Russia, also offered a scathing view of the meeting.\n\n\"I can tell you that our president is going about this the wrong way; he is giving away his 'cards,' to use Trump's favored metaphor, up front,\" McFaul wrote in an opinion piece for U.S. News & World Report , adding, \"Trump seems to be viewing the entire war through Putin's distorted lens.\"\n\nIn Russia, meanwhile, officials celebrated the Trump-Zelensky blowup, which became fodder for pro-Kremlin propaganda that was circulated widely within the country. Officials also expressed optimism that the U.S. would cut military aid to Ukraine, enabling a Russian victory.\n\nTrump delivered on that hope on Monday as a White House official said Washington was pausing its aid so it can \"ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\"\n\nThe move came hours after it was reported that the State Department is considering easing sanctions on Russia that were imposed as a deterrent when Putin first invaded Ukraine.\n\nDmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesperson, subsequently hailed Trump's decision to pause aid as one that \"will probably be the best contribution to peace.\"\n\nZelensky, for his part, called his falling out with Trump \"regrettable\" on Tuesday and said Ukraine was ready to sign the minerals deal \"as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer.\"\n\nTrump briefly referenced Zelensky's outreach during his speech to Congress on Tuesday, in which he criticized the ongoing U.S. aid to Ukraine and repeated misleading claims about the extent of American support as it related to European aid.\n\n\"The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense, with no security, with no anything,\" he said.\n\nWhen Democrats clapped in acknowledgement of the American security assistance to its longtime ally, Trump shot back: \"You wanna keep it going for another five years? Yeah, you would say\" that.\n\nHe went on to reference Zelensky's statement and added Ukraine is ready to sign the mineral deal.\n\n\"Simultaneously,\" Trump said, \"we have had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't that be beautiful?\" Trump said.\n\nHe did not say the U.S. had agreed to the deal, whether it meant he would resume security assistance to Ukraine, or if Russia would have to make any concessions as part of any agreement.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nSonam Sheth is an Evening Politics Editor at Newsweek who is based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been accused of repeating Kremlin rhetoric about the war it started, with one Ukrainian charity chief telling Newsweek he \"is completely in Putin's corner.\"\n\nAhead of talks in Saudi Arabia about a ceasefire in Ukraine, Witkoff told broadcaster Tucker Carlson that Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"super smart\" and didn't regard him as a \"bad guy.\"\n\nHe repeated Kremlin claims that referendums in the four Ukrainian regions claimed to have been seized by Moscow but do not fully control-Kherson, Zaporizhia, Luhansk and Donetsk-showed most there wanted to be under Russian rule. In 2022, the U.S. State Department denounced the referendums there as sham ballots.\n\nYuriy Boyechko, who founded Hope for Ukraine, a group that provides Ukrainians under Russian bombardment with essentials for survival, told Newsweek that Witkoff is repeating \"almost word for word Russian demands.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nA lot hinges on talks in Saudi Arabia, where Washington's negotiators will hold separate talks with Ukrainian and Russian sides in the hope of ceasing hostilities. Witkoff's comments have raised concerns among Ukraine's allies that the United States will try to push a deal that serves Putin's interests.\n\nWhile speaking with Carlson, a media personality criticized for an interview with Putin in Moscow in February 2024, Witkoff uncritically amplified the Kremlin's line on its invasion.\n\nThis included saying that Russia \"100 percent\" does not want to invade Europe and that it \"does not need to absorb Ukraine.\n\nThe envoy also said that Russia \"reclaimed\" five regions in Ukraine-Crimea and Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts-and \"will not want more.\" He praised Putin as a \"smart guy.\"\n\nBoyechko questioned how Witkoff could be an honest peace broker when he did not regard Putin as a \"bad guy\" despite targeting civilians and infrastructure and being subject to an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for crimes against humanity.\n\nBoyechko said that Witkoff repeated \"almost word for word\" Russian demands that Russia wants Ukraine to surrender areas of Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nBoyechko added that Ukraine would never give up the four mainland regions Witkoff appeared to struggle to name and that the referendums there produced no legitimate expression of public voice.\n\nHe said the interview showed that Trump's top negotiator is in Putin's corner, and peace negotiations will now be between Ukraine and Russia without anyone backing Ukrainian interests in these talks except Ukraine itself.\n\nRussian state newspapers also dissected Witkoff's comments. Nezavisimaya Gazeta said the remarks showed that officials from Moscow and Washington were \"speaking the same language\" and that Witkoff's comment that Europe has nothing to fear from Putin devalued many European Union and NATO decisions .\n\nMeanwhile, the tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda reported that Putin gave Witkoff a painting of Trump to take back to Washington as a sign of the warming of ties between the countries.\n\nU.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff: \" There are constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede to with regard to giving up territory. The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. The question is, will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?\"\n\nYuriy Boyechko, Hope for Ukraine CEO: \"Steve Witkoff repeats almost word for word Russian demands that Russia wants Ukraine to surrender areas of Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions that under Ukrainian control now.\"\n\nThere is hope that progress can be made in the talks held in Riyadh on Monday. A key sticking point is which areas of Ukrainian territory Russia can hold onto if there is a longer-term peace deal.\n\nKyiv has made it clear that while some land cannot yet be recaptured, it would never recognize Russian sovereignty over Ukrainian territory.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nBrendan Cole is a Newsweek Senior News Reporter based in London, UK.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nAn envoy for Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the world a \"safer place\" on Tuesday as the United States and Russia released readouts of a high-stakes phone call between Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump .\n\n\"Under the leadership of President Putin and President Trump, the world has become a much safer place today!\" Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, wrote on X, formerly Twitter , after the call. \"Historic! Epic!\"\n\nPutin agreed during the call to a limited ceasefire on attacks against energy infrastructure targets, the Kremlin said in a readout, but he declined to sign on to the conditions of a broader ceasefire that Ukraine had agreed to.\n\nThe Russian president also called for a \"complete cessation\" of foreign military aid and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine, emphasizing the ask as a \"key condition\" for lasting peace.\n\nIn its readout, the White House described the call as the first step in a \"movement to peace\" it hopes will eventually include a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea and a full and lasting end to the war, which Russia launched in February 2022.\n\nTrump's phone call with Putin was the first known conversation between the two leaders since Ukraine agreed to a temporary 30-day ceasefire with Russia last week.\n\nThe Trump administration's thawing of relations with Russia comes after Trump stunned Ukraine and NATO allies by berating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at an Oval Office meeting last month.\n\nShortly after the meeting ended, Trump ordered that the United States halt military assistance to Ukraine until Zelensky agreed to sign a rare earth minerals agreement with the U.S. Multiple media reports also said the U.S. had paused some intelligence-sharing with its longtime ally.\n\nUkraine later said it was ready to sign a temporary ceasefire deal with Russia following talks with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia, subject to the Kremlin's agreement.\n\nThe White House issued its readout of Trump and Putin's phone call on Tuesday afternoon, saying the two leaders \"agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace.\"\n\n\"They also stressed the need for improved bilateral relations between the United States and Russia. The blood and treasure that both Ukraine and Russia have been spending in this war would be better spent on the needs of their people.\"\n\nThe White House's readout of the call, which lasted for more than two hours, went on to say the Russia-Ukraine war \"should never have started and should have been ended long ago with sincere and good faith peace efforts.\"\n\nIt did not say who was responsible for starting the war.\n\nTrump and Putin further \"agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace.\"\n\nAccording to the White House's readout, the two leaders also discussed tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Iran.\n\nThey \"spoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent further conflicts\" and \"shared the view that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel,\" the readout said.\n\nThe Kremlin's readout did not mention any discussion of Iran.\n\nThe White House again emphasized that an \"improved bilateral relationship\" between the U.S. and Russia \"has huge upside,\" including \"enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.\"\n\nThe Kremlin's readout, meanwhile, said Putin has agreed to a 30-day ceasefire on attacks against Ukrainian energy infrastructure targets.\n\n\"Donald Trump put forward a proposal for the parties to the conflict to mutually refrain from attacks on energy infrastructure facilities for 30 days,\" the readout said. \"Vladimir Putin responded positively to this initiative and immediately gave the Russian military the corresponding order.\"\n\nHowever, the Kremlin went on to say that a 30-day ceasefire must include an end to \"forced mobilization in Ukraine\" and the rearmament of Ukraine's armed forces. It did not include any concessions from Russia's side regarding its mobilization efforts.\n\nTrump wrote on Truth Social after the call: \"My phone conversation today with President Putin of Russia was a very good and productive one. We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine.\"\n\nHe added: \"This War would have never started if I were President! Many elements of a Contract for Peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would like to see it end. That process is now in full force and effect, and we will, hopefully, for the sake of Humanity, get the job done!\"\n\nDan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, wrote on X as the call was underway: \"Happening Now-President Trump is currently in the Oval Office speaking with President Vladimir Putin of Russia since 10:00amEDT. The call is going well, and still in progress.\"\n\nZelensky expressed \"skepticism\" after the call but said that \"if there is a partial ceasefire, this is a positive result,\" according to ABC News .\n\nUpdate 3/18/25, 1:51 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nUpdate 3/18/25, 2:31 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information and a new headline.\n\nUpdate 3/18/25, 4:34 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nGabe Whisnant is a Breaking News Editor at Newsweek based in North Carolina.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nKremlin propagandist Vladimir Solovyov has said that the current Trump administration would side with Russia in the event of a global conflict.\n\nSolovyov, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin , and one of the most prominent figures in Kremlin-backed media, made the comments in reaction to a meeting between officials from Moscow and Washington in Saudi Arabia this week.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has reopened dialogue with Russia in an effort to end the war in Ukraine, following months of Moscow's isolation by the international community.\n\nAt the same time, NATO members are increasingly alarmed by signs that the U.S. may be pulling back from its long-standing security commitments in Europe, particularly as Trump intensifies his criticism of the alliance and offers praise for Putin.\n\nThese developments are fueling anxiety about a deepening divide between the U.S. and Europe amid rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nJulia Davis, founder of the Russia Media Monitor watchdog group, posted a segment from the Russian radio show Full Contact , featuring host Solovyov.\n\n\"Meanwhile in Russia: state TV host Vladimir Solovyov explained why the Black Sea ceasefire deal is a victory for Putin. He reiterated that Russia does not intend to stop its military actions and predicted the U.S. would team up with Russia against Europe,\" Davis wrote.\n\nMeanwhile in Russia: state TV host Vladimir Solovyov explained why the Black Sea ceasefire deal is a victory for Putin. He reiterated that Russia does not intend to stop its military actions and predicted the U.S. would team up with Russia against Europe. https://t.co/OpJrHLtaOo\n\nSolovyov told his audience that the outcome of discussions between U.S. and Russia in Riyadh this week \"already benefits us to a large degree, because it causes colossal divisions with NATO countries.\"\n\nSolovyov was alluding to discussions on a Black Sea maritime ceasefire deal, which Washington framed as part of Trump's push to bring an end to the three-year-long conflict. After talks wrapped up in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Russia said on Tuesday that the U.S. had agreed to assist with easing Western sanctions and restrictions on agricultural exports as preconditions for the pact.\n\nThe U.S. hasn't confirmed that it will be offering sanctions relief.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he didn't support easing sanctions on Russia.\n\n\"The position of the U.S. is diametrically opposite to the position of Europe and Canada. When there is no unity among your enemies, this is already a gigantic plus,\" said Solovyov of the developments.\n\n\"The terms of the game are already completely different. First, the phone call between Putin and Trump has shown there is no more blockade or international isolation. Europe and Canada are now in global isolation. Nobody needs them. More than that, America says, 'We don't want to fight against Russia,'\" the propagandist went on.\n\nSolovyov said Russia may \"ally\" with the U.S. \"the way it was during WWII\" as Washington may no longer see it beneficial to join forces with Europe.\n\nJohn E. Herbst , the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said in commentary published Tuesday:\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Trump team, in its effort to persuade the Kremlin to accept the naval ceasefire, offered more concessions. The official Russian statement clearly conditioned the implementation of the ceasefire on the lifting of multiple sanctions.\n\n\"The problem is that major sanctions relief would be a shot in the arm for the stumbling Russian economy-making it easier for Putin to continue the land war he refuses to end. I think Trump still wants an early ceasefire to establish a durable peace. To do that, he needs to change tactics and do what he promised in the first week of his new term: bring the hammer down on the Kremlin.\"\n\nArnold C. Dupuy, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said: \"For a Ukraine ceasefire to succeed, the United States and the European Union ( EU ) must work together, a potentially difficult ask in the current trans-Atlantic environment.\n\n\"We should anticipate additional details in the days to come, to include more definition on Western security [guarantees] to Ukraine, a general plan for its reconstruction, and assurances to the other Black Sea states. All of this will require collaboration between the United States and Europe, which are experiencing a period of increasing tensions.\"\n\nTerms of the proposed Black Sea Initiative are being discussed, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nIsabel van Brugen is a Newsweek Reporter based in Kuala Lumpur.

      "text": "NEW: The Effects of the US Foreign Aid Freeze on Freedom House\n\nPower in Russia's authoritarian political system is concentrated in the hands of President Vladimir Putin. With loyalist security forces, a subservient judiciary, a controlled media environment, and a legislature consisting of a ruling party and pliable opposition factions, the Kremlin is able to manipulate elections and suppress genuine dissent. Rampant corruption facilitates shifting links among state officials and organized crime groups.\n\nThe constitution establishes a strong presidency with the power to dismiss and appoint, pending parliamentary confirmation, the prime minister. The president is elected for as many as two consecutive six-year terms. Constitutional amendments approved in 2020 allow Putin, but not future presidents, to run for an additional two consecutive terms as president, potentially extending his rule to 2036.\n\nAs with past elections, President Putin's 2018 reelection campaign benefited from advantages including preferential media treatment, numerous abuses of incumbency, and procedural irregularities during the vote count. His most influential rival, Aleksey Navalny, was disqualified before the campaign began due to a politically motivated criminal conviction, creating what the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) called \"a lack of genuine competition.\" The funding sources for Putin's campaign were also notably opaque.\n\nThe Federal Assembly consists of the 450-seat State Duma and an upper chamber, the Federation Council. The 2020 constitutional amendments altered the makeup of the Federation Council to include: two representatives from each of Russia's 85 regions (including two regions in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory of Crimea), with half appointed by governors and half by the regional legislatures, usually with strong federal input; former presidents, who are lifetime members; and no more than 30 \"representatives of the Russian Federation,\" appointed by the president, of whom no more than seven can be appointed for life. The rest of the Federation Council's members are appointed for six-year terms.\n\nHalf of Duma members are elected by nationwide proportional representation, and the other half are elected in single-member districts, with all serving five-year terms. Electoral rules are designed to benefit the ruling party, United Russia.\n\nIn the 2021 Duma elections, United Russia won 324 seats, maintaining its supermajority. The main Kremlin-approved opposition parties-the Communist Party, A Just Russia, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), and the New People party-won the bulk of the remainder, totaling 118 seats. Three smaller parties and five independents garnered 8 seats. The Central Election Commission reported a voter turnout of 52 percent, up from 48 percent in 2016. The election took place over three days, and Russians were permitted to use an opaque online voting system for the first time.\n\nThe OSCE was unable to send an observation mission due to new government-imposed restrictions on the number of observers. The Russian election-monitoring group Golos and independent media reported numerous violations, including vote buying, pressure on voters, \"clone\" candidates, and ballot stuffing. Under pressure from the authorities, Apple and Google removed the Navalny-backed Smart Voting mobile application from their online stores; the app was designed to inform citizens on how to avoid splitting the opposition vote in their respective districts. Some opposition candidates were not permitted to register, including associates of Navalny's organization. In Moscow, early results showed challengers to United Russia leading in several districts, but pro-Kremlin candidates were later declared the victors in each of these districts after delayed online-voting results were released, prompting further accusations of fraud.\n\nRussia's electoral system is designed to maintain the dominance of United Russia. The authorities make frequent changes to electoral laws and the timing of elections in order to secure advantages for their preferred candidates. Opposition candidates have little chance of success in appealing these decisions, or in securing a level playing field. In 2020, Putin signed a law permitting the use of electronic voting across Russia, raising concerns about the security and secrecy of ballots in the 2021 Duma polls and other future elections. Also that year, the president signed a law allowing a three-day voting period in future elections; critics argued that the expanded timeframe increased officials' ability to manipulate electoral outcomes.\n\nThe multiparty system is carefully managed by the Kremlin, which tolerates only superficial competition against the ruling party. A 2012 law liberalized party registration rules, allowing the creation of hundreds of new parties. However, none posed a significant political threat to the authorities, and many seemed designed to encourage division and confusion among the opposition. The Justice Ministry has repeatedly refused to register Navalny's political party. In June 2021, Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) was declared an extremist organization, effectively preventing anyone associated with it from running for office.\n\nThree new parties met a voting threshold in the 2020 local elections that would allow them to qualify for the 2021 Duma elections: New People, For Truth, and Green Alternative. In practice, each has links to the ruling party, allowing Kremlin-friendly political figures to distance themselves from the increasingly unpopular United Russia and siphon off voters who might otherwise support genuine opposition parties.\n\nRussia has never experienced a democratic transfer of power between rival groups. Putin, then the prime minister, initially received the presidency on an acting basis from the retiring Boris Yeltsin at the end of 1999. He served two four-year presidential terms from 2000 to 2008, then remained the de facto paramount leader while working as prime minister until he returned to the presidency in 2012, violating the spirit if not the letter of the constitution's two-term limit. A 2008 constitutional amendment extended presidential terms to six years, and a 2020 amendment allowed Putin to run for an additional two terms, meaning he could remain in office until 2036.\n\nOpposition politicians and activists are frequently targeted with fabricated criminal cases and other forms of administrative harassment designed to prevent their participation in the political process. Navalny was poisoned with a toxic nerve agent in August 2020 while he was investigating corruption and campaigning in Siberia, with evidence later emerging that the attack was carried out by the Federal Security Service (FSB). He had to be evacuated to Germany to prevent the authorities from interfering with his treatment, and he was arrested upon his return in January 2021 for violating probation, receiving a prison term in February.\n\nLegislation enacted in June 2021 banned individuals associated with extremist organizations from running for election. The Central Election Commission subsequently disqualified a number of candidates who were accused of extremism or association with undesirable organizations. Other opposition activists were sentenced to prison or fled the country due to charges they said were politically motivated. Among other new restrictions, Russian citizens who hold a second citizenship or a foreign residence permit, and people who have been found guilty of one of 400 criminal and administrative offenses, were unable to run for office as of 2021. In June, Golos reported that around nine million Russians, or nearly one in 10 adults, had effectively been denied the right to run for any public office.\n\nRussia's numerous security agencies work to maintain tight control over society and prevent any political challenges to the incumbent regime. The country's leadership is also closely intertwined with powerful business magnates who benefit from government patronage in exchange for political loyalty and various forms of service. The Russian Orthodox Church similarly works to support the status quo, receiving financial support and a privileged status in return. Recent reports from the Riga-based online news outlet Meduza, echoing other research, have shown that many employers-particularly in the public sector-pressure their employees to vote, partly to deliver the government's desired level of voter turnout.\n\nThe formation of parties based on ethnicity or religion is not permitted by law. In practice, many regions inhabited by distinct ethnic groups are carefully monitored and controlled by federal authorities. Most republics in the restive North Caucasus area and some autonomous districts in energy-rich western Siberia have opted out of direct gubernatorial elections; instead, their legislatures choose a governor from candidates proposed by the president.\n\nWomen are underrepresented in politics and government. As of 2021, they held less than a fifth of the seats in the State Duma and the Federation Council. Only about a tenth of cabinet members are women, and many issues of importance to women are not prominent in Russian politics.\n\nConstitutional amendments that were approved in the 2020 referendum and enacted in April 2021 formally defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, both reflecting and deepening the systemic challenges LGBT+ people face in pursuing their political interests.\n\nRussia's authoritarian president dominates the political system, along with powerful allies in the security services and the business sector. These groups effectively control the output of the parliament, which is not freely elected. The 2020 constitutional amendments formalized the power of the president over the legislature and allow Putin to retain the presidency until 2036, demonstrating his ability to manipulate the system. In 2021, the parliament passed a series of bills designed to increase political centralization at the expense of regional autonomy. However, the federal authorities have limited ability to impose policy decisions in Chechnya, where Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has been granted unchecked power in exchange for violently suppressing dissent and keeping the republic within the Russian Federation.\n\nCorruption in the government and the business world is pervasive, and a growing lack of accountability enables officials to engage in malfeasance with impunity. Many analysts have argued that the political system is essentially a kleptocracy, a regime whose defining characteristic is the plunder of public wealth by ruling elites. Some of these elites openly work to fulfill President Putin's policy aims and receive government contracts and protection from prosecution in return for their loyalty.\n\nThere is little transparency and accountability in the day-to-day workings of the government. Decisions are adopted behind closed doors by a small group of individuals whose identities are often unclear to the public, and are announced to the population after the fact.\n\nAlthough the constitution provides for freedom of speech, vague laws on extremism grant the authorities great discretion to crack down on any speech, organization, or activity that lacks official support. The government controls, directly or through state-owned companies and friendly business magnates, all of the national television networks and many radio and print outlets, as well as most of the media advertising market. A handful of independent outlets still operate, most of them online and some headquartered abroad. The few still based in the country struggle to maintain their independence from state interests. Television remains the most popular source of news, but its influence is declining, particularly among young people who rely more on social media.\n\nLaws on extremism, foreign agents, and undesirable organizations have been used to harass media outlets, curtailing their access to funding and forcing many to cease operations in Russia. In late 2020, legislators expanded the foreign agents law to apply to individuals and informal organizations. Authorities cracked down on journalists who reported on protest events in 2021, for example by arresting editors at the student-led newspaper Doxa . Also during the year, a number of prominent independent media outlets were declared foreign agents, including Meduza, VTimes, Dozhd, OVD-Info, Mediazona, and iStories. Roskomnadzor, the federal media and telecommunications agency, required several media outlets to delete reports by the investigative news outlet Proekt, which was declared an undesirable organization in July.\n\nA series of new laws that have gone into effect since 2020 require social media networks to take down \"illegal\" content, fine websites that fail to block illegal content, and enforce prison sentences for online \"libel,\" among other provisions. In the weeks following the introduction of these laws, Roskomnadzor issued warnings and fines to TikTok, VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for failing to block posts that allegedly encouraged minors to participate in protests. In December, a court fined Google $100 million for failure to delete banned content. Activists have also been fined and jailed for allegedly promoting extremist content on social media.\n\nFreedom of religion is upheld unevenly. A 1997 law on religion gives the state extensive control and makes it difficult for new or independent groups to operate. The Russian Orthodox Church has a privileged position, working closely with the government on foreign and domestic policy priorities. Antiterrorism legislation approved in 2016 grants authorities the power to suppress religious groups that are deemed extremist.\n\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses were declared an extremist organization in 2017, leading to a protracted campaign against worshippers marked by surveillance, property seizures, arrests, and torture. Since the ban, more than 500 Jehovah's Witnesses have been charged with or convicted of extremism. In October 2021, however, the Supreme Court ruled that authorities could not prosecute adherents merely for individual or collective worship, requiring additional evidence of extremist activity.\n\nMany Muslims have been detained in recent years for alleged membership in banned Islamist groups, including Hizb ut-Tahrir.\n\nThe higher education system and the government-controlled Academy of Sciences are hampered by bureaucratic interference, state-imposed international isolation, and increasing pressure to toe the Kremlin line on politically sensitive topics, though some academics still express dissenting views. A number of universities have banned student and faculty participation in antigovernment rallies or threatened students with expulsion should they participate. Educators have also been fired for attending or sharing information about protests on social media.\n\nA law enacted in April 2021 requires educators and academics to receive permission from authorities for public \"educational activities\" and partnerships involving foreign scholars. In July, US-based Bard College became the first foreign institution of higher education to be designated as an undesirable organization in Russia. In October, the FSB announced that individuals who work on military technology and related issues and share even nonsecret information with foreigners could be named as foreign agents.\n\nPervasive, hyperpatriotic propaganda and political repression-particularly since Russian forces' invasion of Ukraine in 2014-have had a cumulative impact on open and free private discussion, and the chilling effect is exacerbated by growing state efforts to control expression on the internet.\n\nIn recent years, authorities have adopted a series of laws that impose fines or prison sentences for insulting the state, spreading false news, committing libel, and using social media to discuss the personal information of judges and law enforcement officials or to share information on corruption. These and other laws are actively enforced to punish and deter expressions of dissent.\n\nThe government restricts freedom of assembly. Overwhelming police responses, the excessive use of force, routine arrests, and harsh fines and prison sentences have discouraged unsanctioned protests, while pro-Kremlin groups are able to demonstrate freely. Despite the risks, thousands of people have turned out for a series of antigovernment demonstrations in recent years.\n\nIt is extremely difficult for groups opposing the Kremlin to obtain permission to hold a protest or rally. At the regional level, extensive location-based restrictions prohibit assemblies in as much as 70 percent of public space. While some of these restrictions have been invalidated over the years, authorities can ban rallies on vaguely defined \"public interest\" grounds. Since 2014, nine major legislative amendments have been introduced to curtail freedom of assembly. Some protesters have resorted to single-person pickets to circumvent limits on mass gatherings, but authorities have used a variety of laws and tactics to crack down on the practice in recent years.\n\nThe government has invoked public health concerns to tighten restrictions on assembly during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the rules are selectively applied to target critics of the regime.\n\nIn early 2021, mass demonstrations in response to the arrest and imprisonment of Aleksey Navalny were met with excessive force by state security personnel. At least 11,500 people were detained, more than 130 criminal investigations were opened, and multiple protesters and journalists were injured, with many reporting beatings and other abuse in custody. Some of those convicted over the subsequent months received multiyear prison sentences. Facial-recognition technology installed in Moscow and several other cities was reportedly used to identify and arrest participants in the protests.\n\nScore Change: The score declined from 1 to 0 because authorities pursued a campaign of retaliation against opposition protesters, arresting thousands of participants, engaging in physical abuse during arrests and in detention, and imposing criminal penalties.\n\nThe government has relentlessly persecuted NGOs, particularly those that work on human rights and governance issues. Civic activists are frequently arrested on politically motivated charges.\n\nAuthorities impede and block NGO work by requiring groups that receive foreign support and are deemed to engage in broadly defined \"political activity\" to register as \"foreign agents.\" This designation, which is interpreted by much of the Russian public as denoting a foreign spying operation, entails onerous registration requirements, obliges groups to tag their materials with a \"foreign agent\" label, and generally makes it extremely difficult for them to pursue their objectives. Under amendments adopted in late 2020, authorities can designate individuals and informal organizations as foreign agents. Those who fail to comply with the law risk fines or prison time.\n\nIn June 2021, the president signed laws that made it easier to open criminal cases for alleged affiliation with \"undesirable\" organizations and banned individuals affiliated with \"extremist\" organizations from seeking public office. As of December 2021, the Ministry of Justice had listed 86 NGOs and public associations, 36 media outlets, and 75 individuals as foreign agents. Separately, a total of 48 organizations had been deemed \"undesirable.\" That month, Russia's Supreme Court ordered the closure of Memorial International, one of Russia's most well-respected human rights organizations, on the grounds that it had repeatedly failed to meet the requirements of the foreign agents legislation.\n\nWhile trade union rights are legally protected, they are limited in practice. Strikes and worker protests have occurred in prominent industries, including automobile manufacturing, but antiunion discrimination and reprisals are common. Employers often ignore collective bargaining rights. The largest labor federation works in close cooperation with the Kremlin, though independent unions are active in some industrial sectors and regions.\n\nThe judiciary lacks independence from the executive branch, and judges' career advancement is effectively tied to compliance with Kremlin preferences. The Presidential Personnel Commission and court chairpersons control the appointment of the country's judges, who tend to be promoted from inside the judicial system rather than gaining independent experience as lawyers. The 2020 constitutional amendments empowered the president to remove judges from the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court, with the support of the Federation Council, further damaging the judiciary's already negligible autonomy.\n\nSafeguards against arbitrary arrest and other due process guarantees are regularly violated, particularly for individuals who oppose or are perceived as threatening to the interests of the political leadership and its allies. Many Russians have consequently sought justice from international courts, but a 2015 law authorizes the Russian judiciary to overrule the decisions of such bodies, and it has since done so on a number of occasions. In December 2021, the president signed legislation that granted police broader authority to break into homes and vehicles and search personal belongings without a warrant. While arbitrary arrests are rarely punished, a court in May sentenced five former police officers to prison terms for the 2019 arrest of journalist Ivan Golunov on fabricated drug charges.\n\nMemorial Human Rights Center counted 410 people as political prisoners as of August 2021, with 329 of them held in connection with the exercise of religious freedom. Those counted included opposition leader Aleksey Navalny along with several of his supporters, journalists, and potential opposition candidates for the 2021 parliamentary elections.\n\nUse of excessive force by police is widespread, and rights groups have reported that law enforcement agents who carry out such abuses have deliberately employed electric shocks, suffocation, and the stretching of a detainee's body so as to avoid leaving visible injuries. Prisons are overcrowded and unsanitary; inmates lack access to health care and are subject to abuse by guards. In 2021, lawyers for Navalny reported that he had been subjected to sleep deprivation and denied medical treatment while in prison.\n\nParts of the country, especially the North Caucasus, suffer from high levels of violence; targets include officials, Islamist insurgents, and civilians. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has been accused of using abductions, torture, extrajudicial killings, and other forms of violence to maintain control. This activity sometimes extends to other parts of Russia and foreign countries, where Kadyrov is suspected of arranging the assassination of asylum seekers and political opponents living in exile.\n\nImmigrants and ethnic minorities-particularly those who appear to be from the Caucasus or Central Asia-face governmental and societal discrimination and harassment. Constitutional amendments establish the primacy of the Russian language within the state, favoring ethnic Russians by implication.\n\nLGBT+ people are also subject to considerable discrimination. A federal law banning the dissemination of information on \"nontraditional sexual relationships\" has been in force since 2013, making public discussion of homosexuality illegal.\n\nChechnya remains particularly dangerous for LGBT+ people, with authorities launching a crackdown in 2019 that ensnared nearly 40 people; two of the detainees reportedly died after they were tortured by police. In 2021, police arrested and forcibly returned to Chechnya individuals who were associated with LGBT+ organizations.\n\nThe government places some restrictions on freedoms of movement and residence. Adults must carry internal passports while traveling and to obtain many government services. Some regional authorities impose registration rules that limit the right of citizens to choose their place of residence, typically targeting members of ethnic minorities and migrants from the Caucasus and Central Asia. Most Russians are free to travel abroad, but more than four million employees tied to the military and security services were banned from foreign travel under rules issued in 2014.\n\nState power and private property are intimately connected, with senior officials often using their government positions to amass vast property holdings. State takeovers of key industries and large tax penalties imposed on select companies after dubious legal proceedings have illustrated the precarious nature of property rights under Putin's rule, especially when political interests are involved. Private businesses more broadly are routinely targeted for extortion or expropriation by law enforcement officials and organized criminal groups.\n\nConstitutional amendments approved in 2020 define marriage as a union between a man and a woman; the changes were formally adopted in April 2021, effectively barring any future law recognizing same-sex marriage.\n\nDomestic violence receives little attention from the authorities. Instead, survivors who kill their abusers in self-defense are commonly imprisoned; as many as 80 percent of women imprisoned in Russia may fall under this category. A 2017 law decriminalized acts of domestic violence that do not result in permanent physical harm. The measure also relieved police of the obligation to initiate cases, transferring that burden to survivors. During Russia's COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, Russian NGOs reported a doubling of domestic violence cases, while official police statistics reported a decrease. In December 2020, the Justice Ministry listed the NGO Nasiliu.net, which fights gender-based violence, as a \"foreign agent.\" In April 2021, the Constitutional Court called on lawmakers to strengthen victim protections as well as penalties for repeat offenders.\n\nResidents of certain regions, particularly in the North Caucasus, face tighter societal restrictions on personal appearance and relationships, and some so-called honor killings have been reported. In Chechnya, Kadyrov has spoken in favor of polygamy and sought to compel divorced couples to remarry.\n\nLegal protections against labor exploitation are poorly enforced. Migrant workers are often exposed to unsafe or exploitative working conditions. Both Russians facing economic hardship and migrants to Russia from other countries are vulnerable to sex and labor trafficking. The US State Department's 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report criticized the government's lack of significant efforts to address trafficking. While it acknowledged the government's extension of work and residence permits for foreign workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, its identification of some victims, and other positive steps, the report found that the government records a far lower number of trafficking victims than the estimated scope of the problem would suggest, and that the state is actively complicit in the forced labor of North Korean workers. Trafficking victims are routinely detained, deported, and prosecuted for activity they were forced to participate in.\n\nSee all data, scores & information on this country or territory.\n\nFor over 50 years, Freedom in the World has been widely used by policymakers, researchers, students, international organizations, and investors.

      "text": "Putin sides with military chiefs over placing Wagner under direct control\n\nRussian leader says move must be made 'as quickly as possible' after Wagner boss refuses to sign contracts\n\nAfter a destructive feud between his top military chiefs and the mercenary warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin, Vladimir Putin has appeared to side with his top brass, calling for Russia's \"volunteer detachments\" fighting in Ukraine to be placed under the direct control of the defence ministry.\n\nThe decision severely undermines Prigozhin, who has turned Wagner's role in the capture of Bakhmut into an outsized public profile in Russia that he uses to berate Putin's generals and promote himself.\n\nSpeaking to a group of pro-war bloggers on Tuesday, the Russian president said he welcomed the defence minister Sergei Shoigu's initiative to force mercenary groups to sign contracts with the ministry - an order Prigozhin has refused to follow.\n\n\"This has to be done and it has to be done as quickly as possible,\" Putin said of the military contracts, saying it was \"in line with common sense, with established practice and the law\".\n\nEarlier, Shoigu had ordered all volunteer detachments to sign contracts with his ministry by the end of the month, a step seen as an attempt to rein in Prigozhin by integrating Wagner into the army.\n\n\"Wagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,\" Prigozhin said in response, criticising Shoigu for failing to \"properly manage military formations\".\n\nWhen asked to comment on Putin's statements on Wednesday, a defiant Prigozhin doubled down. \"When we started participating in this war, no one said that we would be obliged to conclude agreements with the Ministry of Defence,\" he said in a rare direct rebuke of the president.\n\n\"None of the Wagner fighters is ready to go down the path of shame again. And so no one will sign contracts,\" he said, adding that he believed the Russian president would find a \"compromise\" for Wagner.\n\nThe feud between Prigozhin and the military reached new heights this month when a Russian commander accused Wagner of kidnapping and torturing his soldiers .\n\nPutin's intervention is seen as a big boost for Shoigu, a longtime ally of the president who has faced political pressure for Moscow's faltering efforts in Ukraine . It has also put Prigozhin in his most precarious position since the invasion began.\n\n\"Shoigu has Prigozhin in more or less a checkmate. If Wagner does not sign a [defence ministry] contract in a few weeks, the state could have grounds to stop supporting Wagner, or even make legal moves against them,\" said Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation.\n\nSome analysts suggested that Putin probably made the decision to limit Wagner's influence in Ukraine months earlier.\n\n\"The decision was made in January, but they were waiting for Wagner to take Bakhmut,\" said Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of the political analysis firm R Politik. \"It was decided that at least on Ukraine's territory, everyone should be subjugated to the general staff.\"\n\nPrigozhin announced earlier this month that his troops had largely pulled back from Bakhmut, most of which they captured after taking heavy casualties .\n\nPrigozhin's exclusion from Ukraine would sideline one of Russia's most recognisable war figures. Through the daily use of social media, he has cultivated a populist, anti-elite persona that has resonated with Russians unhappy with the foundering invasion.\n\nThe warlord's public standing peaked as his troops gradually captured Bakhmut, delivering Moscow its first tangible military victory since last summer.\n\n\"Prigozhin understands that his publicity is his protection,\" said a former defence official who worked with him. \"He has no official status, but he knows that Putin prefers stability and wouldn't want to cause chaos by letting others go after such a public figure.\"\n\nWith his troubles mounting, Prigozhin embarked on a publicity tour across Russia, addressing audiences alongside hardliners such as the ex-arms dealer Viktor Bout.\n\nQuestions remain about whether he can maintain his standing through a publicity tour alone.\n\n\"I don't think that it will have the same effect as his battle for Bakhmut,\" said Stanovaya. \"Prigozhin is pushed into a corner a bit and is trying to figure out how to realise his goals.\"\n\nThe mercenary boss has continued his public attacks against Russia's military leadership. Speaking in the central Ulyanovsk region on Tuesday, he directly contradicted Putin, who claimed earlier that day that Kyiv's counteroffensive had failed on all fronts.\n\n\"They [Ukraine] are fighting correctly,\" Prigozhin said, claiming that Moscow was not doing enough to \"counter the adversary\".\n\nStill, some believe it is too soon to speculate about Prigozhin's downfall.\n\n\"People have wrongly written off Prigozhin many times,\" said the former defence official. \"Shoigu currently has the upper hand, but if Ukraine's counteroffensive fails, Prigozhin will likely be called upon again,\" they added, saying that Putin traditionally played off different factions against one another.\n\nThe former official also noted that Putin hinted on Tuesday that some of Prigozhin's criticism of the military was justified. \"At the start of the special military operation, we quickly realised that the 'carpet generals' [...] are not effective, to put it mildly,\" Putin said. \"People started to come out of the shadows who we hadn't heard or seen before, and they turned out to be very effective and made themselves useful.\"\n\nPrigozhin's future could depend on the success or failure of Ukraine's counteroffensive, Stanovaya argued. \"He's waiting for them to see that without his abilities and skills, the Russian army will lose territory and Putin or Shoigu will come to him for help ... He dreams about that.\""

      "text": "The War in Ukraine Is Putin's Fault, but 30 Years of Misguided U.S. Foreign Policy Didn't Help\n\nUkraine\n\nRobby Soave | 2.28.2022 10:56 AM\n\nThere is one person-and just one person-who is responsible for the widespread death and devastation inside Ukraine right now, and that is Vladimir Putin. He has attacked and invaded a sovereign nation without justification. Putin's nostalgia for the old Soviet Union is despicable, and his imperialist ambitions to expand his authoritarian grasp are in direct violation of international law, humanitarian principles, and the very stability of the post-World War II peace that has endured in much of the word for decades.\n\nPutin is a tyrant and a killer. His decision to put Russia's nuclear forces on high is unconscionable. It's a move that harkens all the way back to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962-a leader of a superpower has unilaterally brought civilization closer to nuclear war. This is indefensible, and the whole world knows it. The people of Russia know it: That's why thousands of them are protesting Putin's war all over their country. Putin's government has arrested more than 6,000 peaceful demonstrators so far.\n\nPutin's nuclear threats will put the rest of the developed world on high alert in response. This means we've rapidly landed in a place where the risk of all-out nuclear war is significantly higher. There's no reason for this. We are in this situation because of the actions of one very evil man.\n\nAll of that said, it's important to call out the bad U.S. foreign policy moves that helped get us here. And even though no one did this but Putin, the U.S.'s failed approach to Russia for the last 30 years-a bipartisan effort that includes mistakes by Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden-deserves criticism as well.\n\nLet's start with the Clinton administration in the 1990s. As Reason 's Eric Boehm pointed out , Clinton was the first U.S. president in decades to inherit a world that did not include the Soviet Union. Clinton could have completely revamped NATO now that its purpose-defending member nations against the expansion of the Soviet Union-was no longer applicable. Instead, Clinton, with the Republican Party's support, oversaw an expansion of NATO. Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland all joined. Years later, Putin would cite this enlargement of NATO as one of the West's \"broken promises\" that justified his Ukraine policy.\n\nAgain, Putin is dead wrong. Nothing justifies his Ukraine policy. But the purpose of NATO was defensive: to protect the world from Russian aggression. If NATO policy is antagonizing Russia and being used as a pretext for invasion, it clearly isn't serving that goal.\n\nWith the Clinton administration's backing, NATO also intervened in Yugoslavia in 1999 to ensure an independent Kosovo. That military action never had the backing of the United Nations; it was a violation of international law, just like Putin's attack on Ukraine.\n\nGeorge Bush's foreign policy has not held up well, due to the U.S.'s horrendous misadventures in the Middle East, but Bush blundered in Europe as well. At a 2008 NATO summit-one attended by Putin-Bush staunchly supported Ukraine's eventual admittance to NATO, over the objections of France, the U.K., and Germany.\n\nThe Obama administration, of course, inflamed tensions with Russia when the U.S. took sides in the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. And then came Donald Trump. Democrats and their allies in the mainstream media ceaselessly accused Trump of being a Russian stooge, even a pro-Putin plant, installed by Russia as president of the U.S. due to a subtle influence campaign on Facebook. This was of course ridiculous-and as evidence of how ridiculous the claims are, Trump's actual administration was just as foolishly tough on Russia as his predecessors. In 2017, Vice President Mike Pence even reiterated the 2008 Bucharest declaration.\n\nThe Biden administration maintained that same fiction. A clear declaration that the Ukraine would not be joining NATO might have deprived Putin of the intellectual ammo he required to move forward with this invasion. We don't know for sure. But it was incumbent on the U.S. to try. NATO is a means to an end-a more safe and secure Europe-not an end unto itself. If expansion is creating the very conditions that NATO's existence is supposed to prevent, it's not working. Yet every single U.S. president since the end of the Cold War has misunderstood this. And now here we are.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Putin's government was behind the death of the Russian opposition leader.\n\nBy Erica L. Green\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nThe Biden administration is preparing \"major sanctions\" against Moscow in response to the death of the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny , a White House official said on Tuesday.\n\nJohn F. Kirby, a National Security Council spokesman, said the sanctions would be announced on Friday. President Biden has said there is \"no doubt\" that Vladimir V. Putin's government was behind the death of Mr. Navalny.\n\n\"Whatever story the Russian government decides to tell the world, it's clear that President Putin and his government are responsible for Mr. Navalny's death,\" Mr. Kirby told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Kirby declined to detail what would be included in the sanctions package but said it would be devised to \"hold Russia accountable for what happened to Mr. Navalny and, quite frankly, for all its actions over the course of this vicious and brutal war that has now raged on for two years.\"\n\nRussian officials have said Mr. Navalny, 47, lost consciousness and died after taking a walk on Friday in the Arctic prison where he was moved last year . Russia has announced an investigation into Mr. Navalny's death, but Mr. Kirby said on Tuesday that \"regardless of the actual scientific answer, Mr. Putin is responsible for it.\"\n\n\"Absent some credible investigation into his death, it's hard to get to a point where we can just take the Russians' word for it,\" he said.\n\nMr. Navalny's death came as Russia's invasion of Ukraine neared the end of its second year and billions of dollars in U.S. aid remained stuck in Congress. Mr. Navalny, who was one of Mr. Putin's fiercest critics, was also a forceful voice in condemning the invasion.\n\n\"One of the most powerful things that we can do right now to stand up to Vladimir Putin, of course, is to again pass the bipartisan national security supplemental bill and support Ukraine as they continue to fight bravely in defense of their country,\" Mr. Kirby said.\n\nSince Russia's invasion in 2022, the Biden administration has announced a series of sanctions that the United States hoped would hobble Russia economically and militarily. Washington has cut off Russia's largest banks and companies from Western financial markets, joined with Europe to freeze hundreds of billions of dollars of Russian central bank assets, and joined its Group of 7 allies in taking steps to curb the flow of military technology to Russia.\n\nBut the sanctions have largely failed to alter the country's ability to endure economically throughout the war as Mr. Biden had hoped. Just last month, the International Monetary Fund said Russia's economy is actually growing faster than expected .\n\nIn response to a question about the effectiveness of previous sanctions, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, maintained that the United States and its partners had \"imposed the most severe sanctions on Russia that any economy of its size has ever faced.\"\n\n\"We've kicked them out of the international organization and worked to isolate them on the world stage,\" she added.\n\nAlan Rappeport and Katie Rogers contributed reporting.\n\nErica L. Green is a White House correspondent, covering President Biden and his administration.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Cathy Young on Putin's American Fans\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nRussia\n\nIlya Somin | 4.4.2024 11:15 PM\n\nAt the UnPopulist site, Cathy Young has a valuable analysis of Vladimir Putin's admirers on the political right in the US:\n\n[W]hile opposition to aid to Ukraine doesn't necessarily entail support for Vladimir Putin.... Putin-friendly themes have been increasingly prominent on the right. At this point, pro-Putinism is no longer an undercurrent in right-wing rhetoric: it's on the surface.\n\nBut not all Putin-friendly conservatives are the same. For some, their hatred of the American left overrides any feelings they have about Putin. Others are more ideological: they oppose the Western liberal project itself. Untangling these different strains is key to explaining why so many on today's right embrace views that, until recently, would have gotten them branded Kremlin stooges by other conservatives....\n\n[Tucker] Carlson reflects the dominant mode on the Trumpist right: if not actively pro-Putin, then at best anti-anti-Putin. The anti-anti-Putinists may concede that Putin is kinda bad , but only to insist that other things are far worse: Mexican drug cartels , progressive philanthropist George Soros , \" the left ,\" or America's \" ruling class .\" Like the left-wing Soviet apologists of old, they make up faux political prisoners in America to suggest moral equivalency with the dictatorship in the Kremlin....\n\nIt's hardly news by now that many American right-wingers see Putin's Russia as the antithesis of Western \"wokeness.\" This is especially true with regard to sexual and gender norms: I noted the beginnings of this trend in 2013, when several right-wing groups and conservative pundits praised a Russian law censoring \"propaganda\" of homosexuality. Discussing the phenomenon recently in the context of the GOP's anti-Ukraine turn, David French pointed to such examples as far-right strategist Steve Bannon's praise for Putin's \"anti-woke\" persona and Russia's conservative gender politics, or psychologist Jordan Peterson's suggestion that Russia's war in Ukraine was partly self-defense against the decadence of \"the pathological West.\"\n\nThe idea of Russia as a bulwark of traditionalism and \"anti-woke\" resistance is an image the Putin regime deliberately cultivates-not only to appeal to its own population's biases but to win friends among conservatives in the West. And many are seduced into an affinity that goes well beyond anti-anti-Putinism.....\n\nYet distaste for post-1960s social and sexual liberalism doesn't entirely explain the right's Putin love. Some right-wing pro-Putin rhetoric indicates a far more radical rejection of liberalism, even in its more classical varieties (the liberalism of John Locke and John Stuart Mill....)....\n\n[Christopher] Caldwell, who unabashedly hails Putin as \"a hero to populist conservatives,\" just as unabashedly acknowledges that the \"hero\" has suppressed \"peaceful demonstrations\" and jailed and probably murdered political opponents. Yet he asserts that \"if we were to use traditional measures for understanding leaders, which involve the defense of borders and national flourishing, Putin would count as the pre-eminent statesman of our time.\" Leaving aside dubious claims about Russia's \"flourishing\" under Putin, perhaps the most revealing thing about this defense is that it openly invokes standards which predate and reject modern, Enlightenment-based beliefs about liberty, self-government, and human rights.\n\nYoung rightly analogizes Putin's American right-wing fans to earlier  left-wing Western admirers of the Soviet Union and other communist regimes. Both groups feel a strong enough affinity to a foreign dictatorship that they overlook or deny horrific atrocities, which in Putin's case include both large-scale domestic repression and horrific atrocities in Ukraine, comparable to those committed by Hamas against Israel, but on a much larger scale .\n\nInterestingly, as Young notes, one of Putin's American right-wing fans even embraces the analogy with support for communism:\n\nCaldwell praises Putin's refusal to accept \"a subservient role in an American-run world system drawn up by foreign politicians and business leaders\"-and offers a startling analogy:\n\n\"Populist conservatives see [Putin] the way progressives once saw Fidel Castro, as the one person who says he won't submit to the world that surrounds him. You didn't have to be a Communist to appreciate the way Castro, whatever his excesses, was carving out a space of autonomy for his country.\"\n\nIf Putin-friendly \"populist conservatives\" are the equivalent of Castro-friendly, Cold War-era progressives, that's quite a self-own-and a self-reveal.\n\nI made related points about Putin's Western fans (including Europeans as well as Americans) in this video, part of Marshall University's series of podcasts about the Russia-Ukraine war:\n\nIf I have a disagreement with Young, it's that I give more emphasis to the nationalist element in Western right-wingers' affinity for Putin. I think that, for many, this is more significant than social conservatism and cultural grievances.  US social conservatives who are not also highly nationalistic tend to be far less sympathetic to Putin, and some strongly support aiding Ukraine against him. Examples include former Vice President Mike Pence and GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nBut these two sources of pro-Putin attitudes are often interconnected, and their relative importance varies from case to case.\n\nYoung also devotes part of her article to Tucker Carlson, one of the American right's most prominent cheerleaders for Putin. I discussed some of his fallacies regarding Russia here .\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Vladimir the Weak\n\nIs Trump getting tough with Russia?\n\nNot everything about this presidency will be terrible.\n\nMost of it will be terrible. There will be surreal civic travesties, for sure. (There already have been .) All of us frogs who haven't yet boiled will emerge on the other side with a much lower opinion of our country and its people.\n\nBut not everything will be terrible. There are upsides to a second Trump administration.\n\nStricter immigration enforcement will discourage many migrants from trying their luck, easing the crush at the border. Deregulation is usually more good than bad, and there's plenty of that to come. Tax cuts are nice as a personal matter, however irresponsible they might be as fiscal policy. And Trump's buddies in Saudi Arabia will likely reach a long overdue peace with Israel.\n\nIt's the least they can do to say thanks, frankly, after the Israelis spent the past year pulverizing their mutual enemies.\n\nEvery dark orange cloud has a silver lining. There will even be a pleasant surprise or two from Trump 2.0, cases when the man in charge catches everyone off guard by sounding more like a Reagan conservative than the postliberal goon we know and loathe.\n\nWednesday brought us the first case of him zigging when most of us assumed he would zag.\n\n\"I'm not looking to hurt Russia. I love the Russian people, and always had a very good relationship with President Putin,\" Trump wrote yesterday on Truth Social, sounding very much like himself. Then came the curveball: \"Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War! IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. If we don't make a 'deal,' and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries.\"\n\nThat sure didn't sound like him.\n\nCritics have always viewed Trump's reluctance to criticize Vladimir Putin and Russia suspiciously. It's so out of character, such a jarring departure from his usual dominance politics, that one can't help but speculate about ulterior motives to explain it. Yet here he was on Day 3 of his second term threatening Putin outright. And not just that: He correctly put the onus on Russia, not on Ukraine, to end a war that will enter its fourth year next month.\n\nCommon sense, no? Russia started the conflict by invading and Russia alone can end it by withdrawing, obviously . To hear some populists tell it, though, Ukraine bears ultimate responsibility for the bloodletting because it refused to let itself be subjugated by an authoritarian power and allied itself instead with the godless decadent NATO-loving liberal resistance of the West. One such populist was Donald Trump -until, weirdly, this week.\n\nHis social media post wasn't the only time he criticized Russia either. On Tuesday he told reporters that Ukraine wants peace \"but it takes two to tango,\" again placing blame on Moscow for prolonging the war. \"He should make a deal. I think he's destroying Russia by not making a deal,\" Trump went on to say of Putin, describing the country as \"in big trouble.\"\n\nThis is not the Donald Trump I thought I knew. Or is it?\n\nThe simplest explanation is usually the correct one, and the simplest explanation for Trump's apparent turnabout on Russia would be that pro-Ukrainian elements are privately appealing to his ego.\n\nChina understands that flattery is the way to the president's heart. So do tech titans . No doubt Volodymyr Zelensky and his European patrons have been laying it on thick behind the scenes as well, starting with the face-to-face meeting that French President Emmanuel Macron cleverly orchestrated by inviting Trump to the reopening of the cathedral of Notre Dame last month.\n\nYou're the only man in the world who can save Ukraine. Stopping Russia is going to get you that Peace Prize you should have won for the Abraham Accords. That's the sort of pitch that Putin, for all his levers of influence, can't match. His strongman pride and silly nationalist pretensions to superpower status would never allow him to grovel to Trump for support the way Trump wants to be groveled to.\n\nThe czar has always met U.S. leaders by posturing as their equal, not as a supplicant. But Russia isn't America's equal, as the last three years have made shockingly clear. And that, ultimately, is Putin's real problem in Trump's eyes, I think: The weakness he and his country have displayed in struggling to subdue a far lesser power may have shattered the president's respect for an authoritarian counterpart.\n\nRemember how Trump talked about Russia's invasion in the days immediately following? \"I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, 'This is genius.' Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine-of Ukraine-Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful,\" he said in an interview in February 2022. \"He used the word 'independent' and 'we're gonna go out and we're gonna go in and we're gonna help keep peace.' You gotta say that's pretty savvy.\"\n\nAt the time, Russia expected Kyiv to fall in three days. Three years later, the Russian military still controls only 20 percent or so of Ukraine and none of its major cities. It has taken more than 600,000 casualties in the process, forcing it to turn to North Korea for reinforcements. The Russian economy, while more resilient than expected, has lately begun to sag under the weight of soaring inflation. Not so \"genius.\" Not so \"savvy.\"\n\nTrump admires autocrats like Putin and Xi Jinping because he shares their instincts toward ruthlessness and dominance and envies their ability to bully weaker opponents unimpeded. Watching Russia fail miserably in bullying Ukraine must have been sobering, even disillusioning, for him about the true extent of Putin's \"strength.\" I wonder, in fact, if the reason Xi sounds like his dictator of choice lately is because he's come to understand that Russia isn't nearly as great a power as he assumed.\n\nNever forget that Trump is a creature of nostalgia. He may well have spent the past 40 years operating off of an image of Russia that he formed circa 1982. Now that he's been disabused of it, his sense of kinship with Moscow may have eroded and the war in Ukraine might be just another conflict in which his position changes month to month depending on what he thinks makes him look best .\n\nAnd what would make him look best at this particular moment is keeping his campaign promise to end the war quickly. Russia, not Ukraine, is the obstacle to that; whether Trump understood that all along or had the postliberal scales fall from his eyes as his respect for Putin collapsed is known only to him. Either way, he's appropriately applying pressure to the party in the conflict that can give him what he wants.\n\nHe has a heavy club to beat Russia with, too, should he choose to use it\n\nForget the nonsense in his Truth Social post about tariffs, as Russia exports next to nothing to the United States . Oil revenue is what's keeping Putin's war machine running. If the White House wants to force Moscow to the bargaining table, the obvious move is to throttle that revenue by getting foreign powers to impose stronger sanctions on Russian oil and/or to boost the global supply, driving prices downward.\n\nLo and behold, that's exactly what Trump threatened to do on Thursday when he addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos-and he has some important friends in Riyadh who might plausibly help him do it. It sounds like \"big trouble\" really is in the making for Russia, just like the president said.\n\nBut only for now.\n\nThe problem for Ukraine, and to a lesser extent Trump, is that Russia is winning the war.\n\n\"Winning\" is a relative term given the massive casualties taken to achieve modest gains, but the Russians are making gains. \"At the moment, [the war] is moving not in the right direction,\" NATO chief Mark Rutte said recently. The frontline \"should be moving eastwards and it [is] moving westwards.\" Best estimates are that the Ukrainians have suffered half the losses Russia has-but with a population roughly one-fourth the size.\n\nZelensky isn't the heroic political juggernaut he used to be either. Last year his approval rating dropped to 60 percent, down from 84 at the start of the war, while public confidence in the government declined to just 28 percent . A more recent survey finds him at around 50 percent approval overall and below that number when pitted against other potential presidential candidates , some of whom are reportedly in contact with Trump's team.\n\nTrump being Trump, it's easy to imagine him handling a stalemate in peace negotiations by shifting away from pressuring Russia and toward scapegoating Zelensky, hoping to see him replaced with a more cooperative (read: pliable) Ukrainian leader. The president doesn't care about ensuring a just peace for Ukraine, he cares about being seen as a peacemaker and keeping his promise to end the war. The terms, in the end, are but a detail.\n\nThe Russians understand that, I assume. And so, given their halting momentum on the battlefield and the well-known fact that Donald Trump is, er, a tad fickle by temperament, they sound inclined to keep fighting at least until fall in hopes of extracting more concessions from Ukraine and its American sponsor.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post , the Kremlin's vision of a peace deal \"involves a neutral, demilitarized Ukraine outside of NATO, with Russia keeping the territory it has already annexed. It may also encompass Moscow's demands for broader talks on Europe's security architecture and for NATO to roll back its military infrastructure from its eastern borders.\" Above all, one analyst said, Russia wants the other side to acknowledge its right to dominate its neighbor: \"The main thing is a friendly Ukraine. Kyiv should capitulate and admit that it has lost the war and stop resisting.\"\n\nThat's a dealbreaker for Zelensky, I'm sure. Is it a dealbreaker for Trump?\n\nImagine that the White House organizes peace talks between the two combatants this spring. Russia insists that Ukraine surrender and that its Western allies concede that Ukraine properly belongs to Moscow's \"sphere of influence,\" not to Europe's. The Ukrainians laugh and refuse. Talks break down and the shooting resumes. Trump, the alleged dealmaker who once boasted about ending the war in 24 hours, feels humiliated by having failed so miserably.\n\nWhat does he do then?\n\nHe could turn up the pressure on Russia to reduce its demands by going all-in on Ukraine, ordering another massive round of U.S. military aid to Kyiv and playing hardball on oil prices. But that would be risky. Ukrainian forces have been sufficiently degraded that even more American weapons might not stave off the Russian offensive.\n\nMany populist Republicans would be furious at him for continuing to fund Ukraine's defense after they spent three years browbeating Democrats and Reagan Republicans in Congress for supporting it. And Trump would be furious at Ukraine if he gambled on its military's ability to fight on until fall, only to see its forces steamrolled before a deal is reached. The last thing he wants to do is lose a test of \"strength\" with a foreign authoritarian by having his proxy exposed as weak.\n\nIn the end, he wouldn't risk it. What's likely to happen-and what Russia is surely counting on-is that Trump's current tough-guy posture toward Moscow will soften over the next eight months as Russian troops continue to advance. A narcissist can't bear not being on the winner's side; the clearer it becomes that Putin is winning, the likelier it is that Trump will stop pressuring him for concessions and start pressuring Zelensky to throw in the towel.\n\nThe president may have a low opinion of Russian power right now, but there's nothing that impresses him more than resolve amid adversity, as his various Cabinet nominees have been made to understand . From the Access Hollywood tape to the fallout from January 6 to his criminal tribulations, his own approach has always been to plow ahead defiantly knowing that, if he wins in the end, many of his opponents will capitulate to him.\n\nPutin intends to win him over to Russia's side, I assume, by demonstrating the same strength of will in Ukraine. If so, his strategy is wholly Trumpy.\n\nIn the end, if I were negotiating for Russia, I wouldn't put up much of a fuss if Trump proposed a peace deal in which the U.S. pledged to guarantee Ukraine's security.\n\nMoscow has good reason not to want Ukraine in NATO, as some or all of NATO's European members really might invoke Article 5 and ride to Kyiv's defense the next time Russia attacks, I think. But if, in lieu of admitting Ukraine to the alliance, the Trump White House promised to send U.S. troops to repel the next Russian invasion, I'd take that deal all day long if I were Putin.\n\nWhy not? No U.S. administration would actually honor those terms if Russia called its bluff by crossing the border.\n\nTrump's certainly wouldn't. It would be beyond preposterous for an \"America First\" president, of all people, to get sucked into a hot war with the Kremlin. Trump would end up ignoring his obligations under the treaty. So would President J.D. Vance or whichever other nationalist chud ends up succeeding him in office. The postliberal vanguard of the GOP is more devoutly isolationist than Trump himself is.\n\nOnly a Democratic president might honor a pledge to defend Ukraine, but I'm even skeptical about that. The liberal establishment is desperate to keep pace with an electorate that's grown Trumpier; it's hard to believe that, having evolved on policy to overcome that challenge, a new Democratic commander in chief would turn right around and put boots on the ground to confront an army with the world's largest nuclear arsenal behind it.\n\nAn American pledge to defend Ukraine would be worthless, as American pledges to defend Ukraine tend to be . If Putin needs to accept a worthless promise in order to get everything else he wants, he'd be foolish not to do so.\n\nNick Catoggio is a staff writer at The Dispatch and is based in Texas.

      "text": "Vladimir Putin Isn't Buying Donald Trump's Shtick\n\nWhy the president's tariff threat against Russia falls flat.\n\nOne of the problems with Donald Trump is that he doesn't ... know stuff.\n\nMy own theory of the case, following Sherlock Holmes' advice-\"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth\"-is that Trump is exactly what he appears to be: an ignorant buffoon who has been carried to the presidency twice on the winds of resentment, romanticism, and nihilism. Trump is a weird combination of Chauncey Gardiner and the Bizarro World version of Pope Celestine V, the naïve hermit who was dragged out of his hole in the ground and plunked down in the Chair of St. Peter when exasperated cardinals decided that what the sclerotic papacy needed was a political outsider ... who could be easily manipulated by insiders. (Fun fact: Celestine was nominated to the papacy by Cardinal Latino Malabranca Orsini, nephew of Pope Nicholas III and one of the reasons we talk about nepotism , or nephew -ism.) Even with years in the wilderness to prepare-not that anybody thought he was going to make profitable use of the time!-Trump walks around malevolently ignorant of the most elementary facts of political and economic life.\n\nFor example, when President Trump recently tried to bully Vladimir Putin (via social media, of course) into accepting a Ukraine \"peace deal\" (which is not a peace deal at all but another one of those \"We have a ... concept of a plan\" Trump things), Putin did not budge. (The czar is not for budging.) And so Trump broke out his big gun, practically the only weapon in his arsenal: He threatened to impose heavy tariffs on Russian exports to the United States.\n\nPutin seemed nonplussed. So did a lot of other people.\n\nInconveniently for the tariff-loving Trump, Russia exports almost nothing to the United States, which as of 2022 accounted for about 3 percent of Russian trade. Historically, most of the Russian exports to the United States have been exactly what you'd expect them to be: petroleum products. (Russian coal imports to the United States were prohibited in 2022.) Which is to say, Trump's big idea for putting Putin in his place is a measure that would have had very little effect on Russia (which is already dealing with Western economic sanctions) but might have led to marginally higher energy prices in the United States, where the price of gasoline is even more of an explosive political issue than the price of eggs .\n\nNot that Trump has figured out a way to crack egg prices: After making egg-flation a prominent part of the 2024 campaign discourse, Trump is watching helplessly as egg prices skyrocket toward record highs . Trump now says it is very hard to get prices to go down once they have gone up. (Obviously, Trump is reading Guillermo Calvo on nominal rigidity in his spare time.) The president, who has been two weeks away from releasing a health-care plan for about a decade, once remarked : \"Nobody knew health care could be so complicated!\"\n\nOf course, some people knew. Everybody but him.\n\nAnd as it is with health care and inflation, so it is with Russia's literally genocidal ambitions in Ukraine. It is one thing to push around a country such as Colombia , which is relatively small and highly dependent on trade with the United States, the destination of one-fourth of Colombia's exports (mainly petroleum again, as well as coffee). But Russia is far away, has an economy nearly six times the size of Colombia's, and can lean on trade relationships with China and India, among others, with no particular need for access to the U.S. market. Which is to say, threatening to take away Putin's access to U.S. markets is like threatening to take away Donald Trump's library card-it's not like he's using it a whole heck of a lot.\n\nTrump's flurry of executive orders and memos in his first hours back in the White House made for a lot of drama, but there is only so much even the president of the United States can do by sending out sternly worded missives. Donald Trump may have convinced the lumpensuburbariat that he's a world-class tough guy, but Vladimir Putin isn't buying his shtick. I've been to Ukraine and seen some of the damage done. On July 8 of last year, Putin's forces bombed a children's hospital in Kyiv. Putin knows a soft target when he sees it, and there are few targets in the geopolitical theater right now softer than Donald Trump.\n\nKevin D.

Or I should say, own the neo-libs.\n\nBut that's the gist. Write a letter explaining how you're fleeing the \"destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes\" of the West and Russia will be a \"safe haven\" for you in a country where \"traditional values reign supreme.\"\n\nYou know that feeling when you have more stuff than one piece of luggage can handle and you convince yourself that if you just pack things differently-shoes like this, jackets like that, the head of Alfredo Garcia , just so-it will all fit, like one of those woodblock puzzles? That's how I feel about this newsletter, which is why I've spent the last hour moving paragraphs and sections around as if the word count will get shorter if I just rearrange things.\n\nRather than continue to break the fourth wall, let me forgo the satisfaction of seamless narrative flow and just get this point out there. Lots of the people who like and admire Russia and Vladimir Putin very much believe that immigration-particularly migrants who claim refugee status-are destroying our country. Never mind that the refugees coming here are often Christians from places where traditional values are stronger and more widely held than in the United States. Putin fans think America should turn them all away. Whatever you think of that position on the merits, it's remarkable that many who subscribe to it are celebrating Putin's new policy as a game changer or some kind of brilliant ploy. Just for defecations and guffaws, let's imagine the United States adopted a policy like Putin's. Would they support it?\n\nWhile you're noodling that, let's get back to Putin's attempt to supplant the old claim of Russia being a \"workers' paradise\" with the claim that it's now a Trad Shangri-La. As you might expect, this announcement went out across the globe. It was like a frequency that most just heard and dismissed like an annoying TV jingle or neighborhood leaf blower. But for some, it was like an activation signal. They weren't sleeper agents, aliens, or Treadstone operatives, but they were-and are-what experts in the field call \"idiots.\"\n\nBut not any or all idiots. Putin isn't looking for conventional fools who run with scissors or put hardwood floors in their rented apartments. He's not even looking for people who do not like \"wokeness,\" \"gender ideology,\" or \"neoliberalism.\" Nor is he actually much interested in inviting devotees of traditional values.\n\nAll of that stuff is just the sizzle not the steak.\n\nPutin's idiot-bait is really designed to select people who take Vladimir Putin and his propaganda seriously. You know: the folks who think Putin is a man of peace, that his invasion of Ukraine was justified and is going perfectly according to plan, that Russia is the world's guardian of traditional values. Most important, he wants people so unimaginably stupid (or venal) as to willingly spout this stuff uncritically in Western countries. In fact, I think that's the real point. I doubt Putin thinks very many people will take him up on his offer. What he wants is people to broadcast the offer in Western democracies as a way to undermine them. If he gets a few dozen or few hundred actual \"refugees\" from Wokeness, that's great for him (it will almost surely suck for them). Every family getting off a plane in Moscow provides more content for the propaganda mills in the West.\n\nIn short, he wants useful idiots. Like, you know, this guy:\n\n🚨BREAKING: PUTIN JUST DROPPED A BOMBSHELL DECREE-INVITING PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE WHO ARE FED UP WITH THE GLOBALIST, NEOLIBERAL NIGHTMARE TO SEEK SANCTUARY IN TRADITIONAL RUSSIA!\n\nThis new decree blows the lid off the establishment's agenda, letting freedom-loving folks... pic.twitter.com/lVPHeKWRIC\n\n- Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones) August 19, 2024\n\nNow, we have a rule around here. Actually, we have a lot of rules. But somewhere after \"do not take a bath with a toaster\" and \"don't buy bitcoin from a guy in a van\" and before \"don't start a conversation with Steve about Spanish wine\" is \"do not take Alex Jones seriously.\" And I'm going to stick to that rule.\n\nThe problem is a lot of, well, idiots, don't . If you read the replies to his post, you'll see what I mean.\n\nI do think it's worth discussing the ideas and arguments that Putin and his useful idiots are leveraging for propaganda purposes.\n\nNow the devil is in the details, and much depends on the eye of the beholder, but as a general statement, I'm a fan of \"traditional values.\"\n\nBut \"traditional values\" is a funny phrase because it generally refers to second- or third-order values in the moral hierarchy. In other words, what people usually mean by \"traditional values\" are things like the sanctity of marriage and primacy of family, modesty, hard work, good manners, thrift, sexual restraint, etc. I should note that the louder and more shrill one gets about traditional values, the more likely it is that the speaker-or shouter-means things like rejecting homosexuality or trans ideology and embracing some very politicized version of Christianity, etc. I usually walk away from those conversations.\n\nMy only point is that most of the stuff captured by \"traditional values\" refers to how to live decently, honorably, and happily. That kind of thing.  It's important.\n\nYou can fall short of adhering to traditional values without being a criminal or, well, evil.\n\nI am open to good faith correction from orthodox adherents of almost any faith or school of moral teaching. But, I'm pretty sure that murder is considered to be at the top of the list of what most people call \"bad things.\" And Vladimir Putin is a murderer. Nay, he's a mass murderer. I don't know whether he's killed many people with his bare hands, but there's no honest or serious student of Vladimir Putin who disagrees that he's ordered the murder of a great number of people, and this doesn't even count the mass slaughter of Ukrainians, Chechens, Syrians, et al. But that's relevant too because he's a warmonger. He's also a thief, a torturer, philanderer, and a dictator. He's also, not surprisingly, a very bad Christian, if he is one at all. He's made the Russian Orthodox Church a party to war and a vassal of the state. He's also a racist, who values ethnic Russian life over the more disposable ethnicities of his empire. A disproportionate share of the \" meat \" he's fed to the grinder in Ukraine is not of pure Russian stock. He prefers to march his duskier subjects to the machine gun nests.\n\nThat's sort of what I am getting at when I say that traditional values-as important as they are-rank lower than some other values. Now, I understand that there's a rich theological debate about some of this. I'm not going down that rabbit hole. But I will say that wherever you come out on these questions, odds are very strong that as a matter of law and commonsense, you're with me that murder, torture, even theft, are usually worse than, say, infidelity, adultery, or some other violation of traditional values. Or at least, you recognize the obvious role of government to police crimes while being a bit more laissez-faire, or at least lenient, about policing sins -never mind bad manners.\n\nMost people think murderers should go to jail or death row. Few, even among the loudest proponents of \"traditional values,\" think adulterers or liars should (which would not bode well for Donald Trump). Heck, I think there's a case for criminal punishments-i.e. fines-for deadbeat dads, but I don't know anyone who thinks the penalty for abandoning your kids should be the same as for murder.\n\nSo even if you idiotically think Putin is sincere in his support of \"traditional values,\" your moral compass is broken if you let him off the hook for being an evil guy.\n\nThis may seem like a bit of a digression, but I'll try to explain its relevance. Free societies operate more or less on what is frequently called the \" harm principle .\" You're free to do pretty much what you want so long as you don't harm someone else. We can-and do, constantly-debate the edge cases. But pretty much everybody subscribes to this view to one extent or another, at least with regard to their own freedom. Right-wingers occasionally want to curtail the freedom of left-wingers to be offensive, and vice versa-hence the bipartisan asininity of \"cancel culture\"-but you almost never hear people demand that their speech be censored, their freedom be denied, their lifestyle-traditional or otherwise-be circumscribed. Americans, regardless of ideology, tend to be jealous guardians of their own civil and cultural liberties.\n\nLiberties, by the way, is just the plural of the word \"liberty,\" which is another word for \"free.\" So when I referred earlier to \"free societies\" I could have used the phrase \"liberal societies\" without changing any of the meaning.\n\nI do apologize for writing in a tone that sounds like I should be using simple flashcards and hand puppets, or explaining to Billy Ray Valentine that you can find bacon in a \"bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich,\" but I think it's necessary because people like to make this stuff more complicated than it needs to be.\n\nWhich brings me to the term \"neoliberal,\" which is a word people use to make liberalism-not progressivism, but free society equals liberal society liberalism-sound sinister and dangerous. I am aware that most of the people who use \"neoliberalism\" have a specific economic definition in mind. Suffice it to say that when you hear someone condemning \"neoliberal\" policies, nine times out of 10 they mean they don't like capitalism, free trade, or, occasionally, stuff like \"meritocracy.\"\n\nBut that's not what Putin means when he declares he's opening his doors to refugees from \"neoliberalism.\" He means people fleeing \"gender ideology,\" or otherwise morally decadent culture. That's kind of funny, because on the far left the people who whine about \"neoliberalism\" think it's a homophobic , Christian thing . It just goes to show you that when people start from the premise that capitalism is bad, they'll hang everything else they think is bad on it as well.\n\nStill, the more mainstream take on \"neoliberalism\" from its enemies on the left, and increasingly on the right, is that it is an economic doctrine that fosters inequality and alienation, rewarding the haves over the have-nots.\n\nWell, if your problem is with that stuff, Russia is one of the last places in the world you should want to live. Relative to the size of its economy, Russia has more billionaires than any other country. Of course America has a lot more billionaires (in 2023 we had 735 while Russia had 105), but the amount of national wealth owned by billionaires in Russia was greater. And while some studies claim that America has more economic inequality than Russia, this obscures the more practical point: Poor Americans are a lot richer than poor Russians. Household annual income in Russia is just shy of $8,000 . Median household income in Mississippi, America's poorest state, is just shy of $45,000 .\n\nDonald Trump is fond of saying America is a \"nation in decline.\" Indeed, he thinks he coined the term and everyone who says it is copying him. For what it's worth, people have, usually wrongly, been describing America as a nation in decline since the Adams administration. Regardless, the tangible arguments that America is in decline often rest on things like \"deaths of despair.\" This is often linked to more atmospheric cultural and economic nostrums. Whatever you make of those arguments, it's at least worth noting that Russia's suicide rate is markedly higher than ours (and that's if you trust that Russia isn't underreporting). Its rate of deaths from alcohol is nearly 300 percent higher than ours.\n\nOh and by the way, Russia is shrinking. Supposedly family-friendly Russia's birth rate is lower than ours. And ethnic Russians are bringing the fertility rate down , which is one reason Putin is feeding as many Muslim and non-Russian soldiers into the war machine. Russia is also shrinking because many of the most talented Russians are fleeing the country in droves . It's almost as if the advantages of rhetorical support of anti-wokeness and traditional values doesn't outweigh the hardships of a corrupt regime, tyranny, and a barbaric and unjust war.\n\nWe hear a lot about America's corrupt elites. Not all of those arguments are without merit. But our corruption is more metaphorical. It's measured in our failure to live up to our ideals and liberal principles. Russia's corruption is endemic because the regime is literally based on conventional corruption. You don't become a billionaire in Russia by being the better businessman, you become a billionaire by being an adept supplicant of Vladimir Putin who, by the way, some have said may be the world's richest man. That's impressive for a lifetime public servant.\n\nAnd say what you will about Hunter Biden, but he's being prosecuted for at least some of his crimes. But in Russia, the rule of law isn't a thing. Here's how one expert in 2005 described how judges reach their verdicts:\n\nJudicial decisions are typically made according to one of three formulas: the judge makes a decision based on the merits of the case, but then seeks bribes to issue the appropriate ruling; the judge seeks bribes from both sides and rules in favor of the highest bidder; or the judge issues a ruling based on the dictates of state officials or organized crime.\n\nLast year, Russian political scientist Dmitry Evstafiev explained on Russian state TV that the West is trying to seduce Russians with promises of Nutella, paved roads, and indoor toilets, \" a toilet bowl for every region! \" No one on the show burst into laughter because in Russia this seems plausible. You know why? Well, for starters, because Russia is a backward country where the elites traffic in deranged paranoia and insecurity. But, more tangibly, because more than 1 in 5 Russian households do not have indoor plumbing. America has roughly 131.5 million households, and I found a report that almost 500,000 households lack indoor plumbing. That's bad. But that works out to something like one out of 263 households with no indoor plumbing. So if you think being able to crap in your own home (in a functioning toilet) is desirable-and I certainly do-Russia is not the place I'd want to flee to.\n\nNow, I suspect that a large share of those Americans without indoor plumbing are immigrants. They're living in substandard places because that's all they can afford and because, at least some of them, are not here legally and have little recourse to complain about their conditions. Poor immigrants have always flocked to urban tenements, historically the first rung in the ladder out of poverty. That's a real public policy problem and always has been. But one of the reasons we've always had such problems is that millions upon millions of people desperately want to live in America. I'm the first to admit we can't take them all, or even a large fraction of them.\n\nBut why do they want to come to America? Well, to put it bluntly, for the neoliberalism . I doubt many would put it that way. But they certainly want to live in a country where if you work hard, you can get ahead. Where you can get a fair shake in a court. Where you can reap the rewards that come with living in accordance with traditional values. Sure, many just want to live in a rich country. But you know what makes America rich? The frick'n liberalism, whether you call it neoliberalism, paleoliberalism, or just plain capitalism.\n\nAs I wrote in Suicide of the West , the biggest problem with so-called neoliberalism is that it makes us so rich that some people take prosperity for granted. Some become untethered from traditional values that make liberal democratic capitalism work. They latch onto false faiths that they believe will fill the holes in their souls, and these false faiths blame \"the system\" for their adherents' own failings. Since the French Revolution, radicals and revolutionaries have been drawn from the ranks not of the poor but of the arrivistes, the prosperous, ambitious, overeducated, and bitter zealots who think they have a better way than the one offered by a system that doesn't confer on them the status they think they deserve. Such people were Lenin's \"useful idiots\" (though there's little evidence he actually used that precise phrase).\n\nSome of the people celebrating Putin's bold overture are, similarly, his useful idiots. But others are more morally and intellectually perverted. They have no desire to move to Russia. They simply want to monetize or politically exploit the idiocy of people who don't know better by making the twisted and rotted timber of Russia into a yardstick to judge America by. Say what you will about the old left that constantly bleated about how much better Scandinavian countries are than America-at least those countries were pretty nice places to live, thanks in part to their neoliberalism. But Russia as it exists today is in every meaningful sense a craptacular country . Spare me the \"but what about Russian literature!?\" retorts. Russian literature is great because it turns out that oppression, misery, and brutal weather are great muses for dour prose.\n\nIf you envy real, existing Putinism, you envy corruption, authoritarianism, fanatical militarism, and pristine anti-Americanism. If you apologize for it, you are confessing either your ignorance or your villainy. I'm not an \"America: Love it or leave it\" guy. But by all means if you love Russia as it is, vote with your feet and go there. You won't be missed.\n\nJonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "The Anti-War Right's Misguided View of Putin\n\nFor many, he's simply an avatar for a wholesale critique of America.\n\nIt's an article of various faiths-both secular and religious-that misunderstanding is the cause of conflict.\n\nThis sort of insight is generally true for individuals, so it's often considered equally true of nations. Hence vast amounts of anti-war activism and state-level diplomacy rest on the assumption that nations are like people and if we can just get adversaries to talk to each other, and thereby to understand each other's perspective, the bloodshed will end or be avoided in the first place.\n\nThe only problem: It's not true.\n\nConsider the Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to Vladimir Putin, Ukrainians are Russians. He's long insisted that they are \"one people.\" In 2021 he issued a 5,000 word manifesto on this theme. I have only revulsion for Putin's criminal invasion of Ukraine, but Ukraine and Russia do have a deeply intertwined past. That connection doesn't justify Putin's attempted annexation of Ukraine any more than it would justify Ukraine in attempting to annex Russia. But it does illuminate how mutual understanding isn't a safeguard against war.\n\nPakistanis and Indians, Israelis and Palestinians, Irish Catholics and Protestants, Serbs and Croats, Hutus and Tutsis, and nearly every other warring group you can think of do not lack for understanding of each other.\n\nSigmund Freud coined the term \"narcissism of small differences\" to describe the phenomenon. \"It is precisely the minor differences in people who are otherwise alike that form the basis of feelings of hostility between them.\"\n\nIn his book, Bloodlust , Russell Jacoby recounts how civil wars are usually crueler and bloodier than wars between \"external\" enemies. In the American Civil War, North and South understood each other very well. Brothers, both literally and figuratively, fought each other . Mutual understanding fueled anger rather than dampen it because mutual understanding illuminates the sense of betrayal, even heresy.\n\nUnderstanding the limits of understanding is essential because if you believe talking is the only solution to conflict (and not merely the most preferable one), your opponent will use talk solely to distract or delay.\n\nMore importantly, this view often fosters sympathy or even support for bad actors on the assumption that they've been unfairly misunderstood-and that America is to blame for foolishly \"provoking\" them.\n\nIt's amazing how some people feel that merely describing our adversaries motives is a justification for their actions. By confusing explanations for excuses- Putin feels surrounded! Iran wants a nuke to protect its regime!-this perspective often puts all of the blame for tensions or conflict on America or the West.\n\nI've made this point many times before, usually as a critique of left-leaning opponents of American foreign policy who insisted that all tensions stemmed from our misunderstanding of our adversaries.\n\nThere's still a lot of that on the left, but it's now a much more bipartisan affair , with many on the right insisting that we are being \" provocative \" by aiding Ukraine.\n\nTo listen to some critics of American support for Ukraine, Putin is less a human being with the ability to make decisions and more like a force of nature or a wild animal. Like a grizzly bear that-understandably!-mauls someone who teases it, Putin is just doing what he must, like some Aesopian creature.\n\nThe right's newfound fondness for Putin and its (in Jeanne Kirkpatrick's memorable phrase) \" blame America first \" mindset (much like the old Cold War left-wing versions) has much to do with ideological commitments that only tangentially have to do with foreign policy.\n\nFor many on the nationalist right, Putin plays the same role Fidel Castro did for the socialist left-an avatar for a wholesale critique of America. They like him because Putin is \" strong ,\" anti-gay, anti-woke, and a Christian nationalist .\n\nThe hitch to all of this is that their understanding of Putin is little more than a fantasy. The mastery and competence his fans once celebrated is now a joke. Up to 60,000 Russians have died in Ukraine since February-roughly four times the number of casualties in the decade-long Soviet invasion of Afghanistan-and more Russians have tried to flee the country to avoid fighting in this criminally stupid war than have been deployed to Ukraine.\n\nObviously, we have to take nuclear threats from a sociopath seriously. But Putin is counting on his belief that America and the West are weak and decadent to save him from a disaster of his own making. The last thing we should do is act like he understands us better than we understand ourselves.\n\nJonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Assessing Claims by Vladimir Putin in His Interview With Tucker Carlson\n\nThe Russian president made a series of false or misleading statements.\n\nIn an interview lasting more than two hours, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson sat down with Vladimir Putin in what was the Russian president's first major interview with a Western journalist since his country's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The discussion-which began with a lengthy Putin monologue reviewing centuries of Russian history-covered many of the topics on which Putin has propagandized for decades, such as the allegedly artificial construction of the modern Ukrainian nation, supposed U.S.-led coups in support of Western interests, and the ostracization of Russia by the West after the fall of the Soviet Union. Many of Putin's points were outright false, and the interview omitted essential information related to many of his claims. So, which of the Russian president's answers were the most questionable? We'll take on a few of them here, relying on the transcript of the conversation made available by the Tucker Carlson Network.\n\nWhile Putin considers the question of Ukrainian nationhood-or lack thereof-rooted in centuries of Russian history, he blames much of the current conflict on 2013 and 2014 Euromaidan protests and the Revolution of Dignity. \"In 2014, there was a coup,\" Putin told Carlson. \"[Ukraine] started persecuting those who did not accept the coup, and it was indeed a coup. [Ukraine] created the threat to Crimea, which we had to take under our protection. [Ukraine] launched the war in Donbas in 2014 with the use of aircraft and artillery against civilians. This is when it all started.\" Carlson asked who the \"coup\" was backed by.\n\n\"With the backing of CIA, of course,\" Putin responded.\n\nIt benefits Putin politically to describe the Revolution of Dignity as a coup, but the reality of what transpired is much more complex.\n\nThe 2014 Euromaidan protests began after Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign the European Union-Ukraine Association Agreement , which would have strengthened ties between the EU and Ukraine and established a comprehensive free trade agreement between the two. The agreement had sailed through the Ukrainian parliament in February of that year, but Yanukovych backed away from the proposal despite having originally supported it. Initial protests against Yanukovych's decision in late 2013 were peaceful, but tensions flared in January 2014 after a set of repressive new laws restricted rights of protest. By the end of February, Yanukovych had fled Ukraine for Russia and the parliament voted to oust him from office, though the constitutionality of the measures taken by the Ukrainian parliament is still debated . New elections were scheduled for May, when oligarch Petro Poroshenko won victory.\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly described the 2014 ousting of Yanukovych as a coup, and even orchestrated a complex disinformation operation to support secession movements in Crimea. After Yanukovych's departure, Russian military forces and separatist militias in Crimea invaded Crimea on February 27, 2014, seized key facilities, and then held a sham referendum in March resulting in the peninsula's annexation. These actions violated the 1991 post-Soviet Belavezha Accords accepting then-existing borders, commitments made in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum , and the 1997 Ukrainian-Russian Treaty of Friendship .\n\n\"There were free elections in Ukraine after the revolution, in which Petro Poroshenko came to power who had no role in the revolution, who was an oligarch, who was not particularly friendly with the West, and who actually had quite tight ties with Russia,\" Peter Dickinson, a Ukraine and Russia expert at the Atlantic Council told The Dispatch Fact Check . \"That's an obvious issue with the whole narrative of this coup.\"\n\nAnother point reinforced by Putin in the interview was the need for \"de-Nazification\" in Ukraine. According to Putin, after gaining independence, Ukraine adopted a national identity built upon \"false heroes who collaborated with Hitler.\" Because of this, Putin says, the modern Ukrainian state is rooted in Nazi ideology.\n\nPutin is not entirely incorrect that Ukraine has a complicated history with Nazism: The country has erected statues and named streets after a number of Ukrainian nationalists-such as Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych-who collaborated with Nazi forces during World War II. Likewise, modern Ukraine has struggled to address neo-Nazi sympathy, including in some of its far-right political parties and volunteer battalions . Putin overstates these links, however, and even blatantly misrepresents an event in the Canadian Parliament as a key point of evidence for modern Nazi sympathies in Ukraine.\n\n\"The president of Ukraine visited Canada. ... The Canadian Parliament introduced the man who, as the speaker of the Parliament said, fought against the Russians during World War II,\" Putin told Carlson. \"Well, who fought against the Russians during World War II? Hitler and his accomplices. And it turned out that this man served in the SS troops, he personally killed Russians, Poles, and Jews. ... The president of Ukraine stood up with the entire Parliament of Canada and applauded this man. How can this be imagined?\"\n\nThe Dispatch Fact Check addressed a similar claim by Vivek Ramaswamy in November, explaining that the Ukrainian delegation was unaware of the veteran's Nazi affiliation.\n\nWhile Zelensky did applaud Hunka alongside the rest of the Canadian House of Commons, any suggestion that he knew of Hunka's Nazi affiliation-let alone supported him because of it-is unsubstantiated. Anthony Rota, the speaker of Canada's House of Commons, later said he had not informed either the Canadian government or the Ukrainian delegation of the plan to honor Hunka, and resigned from his post. \"This House is above any of us,\" he told his fellow lawmakers. \"I reiterate my profound regret.\"\n\nAnother point of emphasis for Putin during the interview surrounded the prospect of peace talks with Ukraine and Russia's good will attempts to reach a deal. In one instance, he claimed that the two countries had agreed to terms before British Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Ukraine and tanked the deal. \"We negotiated with Ukraine in Istanbul, we agreed,\" Putin said. \"But then [Ukraine's lead negotiator, Davyd Arakhamia] publicly stated to the whole world, 'We were ready to sign this document but Mr. Johnson [then the prime minister] came and dissuaded us from doing this, saying it was better to fight Russia.'\"\n\nThe claim is a misrepresentation of actual statements made by Arakhamia. In an interview about the Istanbul negotiations, Arakhamia said that Boris Johnson , visiting Kyiv in April 2022, had encouraged the Ukrainian government to continue fighting Russia and not sign any agreement. While Johnson admits to expressing concerns over a potential negotiation to Zelensky, he denied that he had pressured Ukraine to end negotiations in an interview with The Times , saying that allegations from Russia to the contrary were propaganda .\n\n\"They really hoped almost to the last that they would put the squeeze on us to sign such an agreement so that we would take neutrality,\" Arakhamia said of the peace talks. \"They were ready to end the war if we took, as Finland once did, neutrality and made commitments that we would not join NATO.\" However, Arakhamia explained that Ukraine would have had to change its constitution to accept the proposed Russian terms-the document explicitly calls for Ukraine to become a NATO member-and added that Ukraine did not trust that the Russians would uphold their end of any deal.\n\nPutin's claim that Russia withdrew troops from Kyiv to facilitate negotiations is also inaccurate. \"We withdrew the troops from Kyiv,\" he said. \"As soon as we pulled back our troops from Kyiv, our Ukrainian negotiators immediately threw all our agreements reached in Istanbul into the bin and got prepared for a long-standing armed confrontation with the help of the United States and its satellites in Europe.\"\n\nBut the Russian military's withdrawal from Kyiv around that time wasn't driven by the goodness of Putin's heart-the Kremlin's forces were defeated by Ukrainian troops in the field. \"It does not stand up to even the very smallest amount of scrutiny,\" Dickinson said. \"Russia was beaten in the Battle of Kyiv, they withdrew with their tail between their legs, and then tried to dress it up by saying, 'Well, actually, it's part of our peace negotiation plans.'\"\n\nPutin also claimed that Zelensky \"issued a decree prohibiting negotiations with us.\" This is somewhat misleading. In October 2022, Zelensky issued a decree that specifically ruled out negotiations with Putin himself, but did not ban any negotiations with the country. \"[Putin] does not know what dignity and honesty are,\" Zelensky said . \"Therefore, we are ready for a dialogue with Russia, but with another president of Russia.\"\n\nAlongside his bold claim that the CIA backed a coup in Ukraine, Putin also asserted that the U.S. and CIA were responsible for the destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline in late 2022. \"Who blew up Nord Stream?\" Tucker asked. \"You, for sure,\" Putin responded. \"You personally may have an alibi, but the CIA has no such alibi.\" Investigations are still ongoing, but there is no evidence as of yet that the U.S. or CIA orchestrated the sabotage.\n\nThe Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines run from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea and are used to transport natural gas directly from Russia to the European market. On September 26, 2022, seismic stations in Scandinavia registered explosions near the pipelines, with Denmark and Sweden later determining that the blast that caused the resulting leaks resulted from large amounts of explosives .\n\nIn June 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported that the CIA had warned the Ukrainian government not to attack the pipelines after it heard of plans to \"destroy a main energy connection between Russia and Europe\" weeks before the sabotage occurred. Some intelligence has suggested that a pro-Ukrainian group orchestrated the attacks, but U.S. officials have said that they do not believe an operation was carried out with the knowledge of Ukrainian government officials. Many theories exist blaming a number of potential perpetrators-including the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia itself-but none are conclusive. On February 7, 2024, Sweden announced that it was closing its own investigation into the sabotage due to the country lacking jurisdiction, however investigations remain ongoing in both Germany and Denmark.\n\nCarlson ended the interview by questioning Putin on the case of Evan Gershkovich , a Wall Street Journal reporter who has been detained in Russia for almost a year. \"The guy's obviously not a spy. He's a kid, and maybe he was breaking your law in some way, but he's not a super spy and everybody knows that,\" Tucker told Putin.\n\n\"You can give a different interpretation to what constitutes a spy, but there are certain things provided by law,\" Putin responded. \"If a person gets secret information and does that in a conspiratorial manner, then this is qualified as espionage. And that is exactly what he was doing. He was receiving classified, confidential information, and he did it covertly.\"\n\nGershkovich was arrested in March 2023 while on a reporting trip in Yekaterinburg-a large city in central Russia. The FSB alleged that Gershkovich \"was acting on instructions from the American side to collect information about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex that constitutes a state secret.\" Russian officials have said that Gershkovich was caught red-handed trying to access Russian state secrets-though no evidence has yet been presented publicly to back up this assertion, and both the Wall Street Journal and U.S. government deny any allegations of espionage. A Moscow court recently ruled to extend Gershkovich's detention until March 30, the fourth time his detention has been extended.\n\nRussia has previously used detentions for both the purpose of retaliation and of bargaining, though this is the first time a U.S. journalist has been arrested for espionage since the Cold War.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "The Villainy Is the Point\n\nPutin's war crimes are the continuation of a sinister tradition that dates back to the czars.\n\nVladimir Putin and his war machine get more respect than they deserve from the West.\n\nThis may seem a bit counterintuitive. After all, just 9 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of Russia, and the International Criminal Court recently issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes.\n\nBut if you listen to a lot of the debate over Ukraine, you might be forgiven for thinking Putin's invasion was just a bad mistake, badly implemented by an otherwise serious country. Sure, terrible things are happening in Ukraine, but terrible things happen in war. What's left out is that the terrible things are the policy, not the unintended consequence of it.\n\nReports of torture and rape started pouring in from the earliest days of the invasion. In March 2022 , Russian troops electrocuted the genitals of male civilian prisoners and sexually brutalized girls and women from age 4 to 82.\n\nThese weren't isolated incidents but the beginning of a campaign of atrocities to come. Numerous mass graves full of corpses, some showing evidence of execution, rape , and torture , have been found in areas liberated by Ukrainian forces. The bodies of mutilated children have been discovered. Such horrors can distract from the more routine evils of targeting civilians, including schools and hospitals, and the stealing of thousands of children .\n\nIt also leaves out the fact that such tactics aren't aberrations. Similar crimes were committed in Putin's other adventures , in Chechnya , Georgia , and Syria .\n\nBut the most conspicuous fact that's absent from the public conversation is that the Russian military has been a villainous force for more than a century.\n\nThe horrendous crimes of imperial Russia were part of a pre-modern era of warfare prior to the Geneva Conventions and other laws of war. But it's worth remembering that the armies of the czars were famously brutal even for a brutal age. Even Alexander II, the \"liberal\" reformer who freed the serfs also ordered the genocide of the Circassians and other natives of the Caucuses. Between 600,000 and 1.5 million people were killed, the rest deported to the Ottoman Empire. That institutional memory lived on, like a ghost in the Russian killing machine.\n\nThe Bolsheviks may have dispatched the czars, but they only amplified the czarist approach to war. Stalin's genocides and forced deportations look more like a continuation than a break with the czarist past. And today's atrocities extend that sinister tradition, too.\n\nPutin has built on the Soviet effort to turn World War II into a kind of state religion , in which the messianic Red Army saved Europe from fascism. Obviously, the Russian sacrifice in World War II-after Hitler broke his pact with Stalin-was staggering. But the Soviet approach to war-using Russian soldiers as fodder for enemy guns until the enemy is exhausted- replicated in Ukraine today is nothing to be proud of.\n\nNeither is the Red Army's record as \"liberators\" in Eastern Europe, where they terrorized the population with mass rape. In Hungary , the estimates of rape range from 50,000 to 200,000. So many pregnancies resulted, that in January 1946, Hungary's social-welfare minister requested of his superiors \"to qualify all babies as abandoned whose date of births is from 9 to 18 months after the liberation.\"\n\nIn Vienna alone, there were between 70,000 and 100,000 rapes. Estimates in Soviet-controlled Poland exceed 100,000. In Germany, they run as high as 2 million . Stalin dismissed complaints saying that his troops had been through so much they deserved to \" have fun with a woman .\"\n\nThe full scale of the mass rapes will never be known, in part because the Soviets destroyed records and kept them secret until the end. And it is now an official secret in Russia once again, as Putin has made it a crime to denigrate the military or to besmirch the memory of the Red Army. He also preemptively exempted troops committing war crimes from prosecution at home or abroad under the Geneva Convention. On Saturday, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev vowed that Ukraine will be erased .\n\nHorrible things happen in every war. However imperfectly, the West has tried to adhere to principles of war and to minimize future horrors and crimes. The Russian military has never bothered with such views, and under Putin, who's nostalgic for the worst aspects of both czarist and Soviet Russia, it seems to see barbarism and cruelty as part of its identity.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine is the product of a society that, having never successfully confronted the sins of its past, has come to see them as virtues.\n\nJonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Putin's Ukrainian Fantasy\n\nHe created a nightmare scenario-for Ukraine, the West, and Russia itself.\n\nOne year ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin ignored the lessons of military history and labored under the false belief that a conquest of Ukraine would be quick and easy, a matter of taking an airport and rolling armored vehicles into Kyiv to accept its surrender. Today, his invasion of Ukraine has exposed the weakness of Russia's military and the incompetence of its leadership, and the war grinds on in bloody fashion. The Ukrainians have shown they've learned from past mistakes, and they've remained united in defense of their country despite unrelenting attacks on civilians and infrastructure. This is a war Ukraine can win-provided the West maintains its support.\n\nThe signs were there from the beginning. The Russian army, acting as though it had no historical experience in winter warfare, struck during the Rasputitsa , a semiannual period of wet, above-freezing weather during which unpaved roads and the countryside turn into seas of mud. Rather than folding, the Ukrainian army and people fought back fiercely, denying Putin a rapid victory and devastating the largely unprepared Russian forces.\n\nThe Russian armed forces were thought to be among the most potent among the great powers, but Russian commanders could not execute combined arms operations (the synchronized use of infantry, armor, artillery, aviation, and other military branches to fight battles), could not keep their forces supplied, and failed to gain and maintain air superiority. They could not mass troops and equipment at the critical points on the battlefield, instead spreading their forces out along multiple avenues of approach under the assumption that the Ukrainian army would collapse under the weight of the assault.\n\nIt did not. Since the Russian seizure of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, the Ukrainian armed forces, under the tutelage of Western military advisers, have created a corps of commissioned and noncommissioned officers who have exhibited competence and flexibility in battle. The ability of the Ukrainians to skillfully defend the approaches to Kyiv as opposed to Russian forces bogged down in a miles-long column with limited room or unwillingness to maneuver is a case in point\n\nLeaders of the Russian army, by comparison, lack initiative and an ability to adapt on the battlefield. When events don't go according to plan, they freeze and wait for orders, a route to certain defeat on the modern battlefield. Forces are poorly trained and inadequately supplied. Russian weapons and technology, once thought to be catching up to the standards of NATO, have proven poorly designed and constructed.\n\nRussian leaders have resorted to stopgap measures to fill the ranks: relying on mercenaries from the Wagner Group, dragooning jailed convicts into the military, and mobilizing several hundred thousand untrained young men. But these measures are not substitutes for regularly constituted military forces; mercenaries dredged from the depths of Russian prison are unlikely to turn the tide of battle in Russia's favor. Their poor discipline and morale have resulted in war crimes. Whether those offenses have been overlooked by senior officials or Putin just doesn't care matters little-the result is the same. And Putin's nuclear saber-rattling is a desperate gamble made necessary only because of the inability of Russian forces to fight effectively on the battlefield.\n\nSince the Russian army stalled during the initial weeks of the invasion-its vehicles bogged down and its damaged and abandoned tanks hauled off by Ukrainian farmers-Putin and his generals have regrouped to focus on taking the remainder of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and retain their hold on the land bridge between that area and the Crimean Peninsula. Putin has also ordered a strategic bombing offensive targeting the Ukrainian electrical grid and other infrastructure. The Ukrainian people have suffered, but like Londoners before them, they have \"kept calm and carried on.\" An influx of Western anti-aircraft systems has enabled Ukraine to stave off the worst of the Russian attacks.\n\nUkrainian counteroffensives in the summer and fall regained territory north of Kyiv, east of Kharkiv, and west of the Dnipro River, including the city of Kherson. By contrast, a newly launched Russian offensive has sputtered, instead sacrificing thousands of poorly trained and motivated soldiers for scant gains.\n\nUkrainians have demonstrated unity and resolve and shown their willingness to sacrifice their lives to maintain their freedom. NATO countries have supplied tens of billions of dollars' worth of advanced weaponry to Ukraine, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, ammunition, and most recently, tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. Ukraine needs the ability to conduct combined arms warfare to turn the fighting into a war of maneuver. This will advantage the side with better weapons and training, which is what Western support of the Ukrainian army will achieve provided it is sustained. With continued support the Ukrainians can regain their territory, protect their sovereignty, and reinforce the strength of international law. That will be a victory for all of us.\n\nPeter Mansoor is a retired U.S. Army colonel with 26 years of active service as an armor officer, including two combat tours in Iraq.

      "text": "Vladimir Putin's Crisis Averted-For Now\n\nThe Wagner Group's move on Moscow may be over, but a Russian collapse could be on the horizon.\n\nLike many people, I was glued to the news for much of Saturday, watching what seemed, at least for a moment, to be the first stages of a coup d'état in Russia-and it still might be.\n\nThe only thing we know for certain is that if this is the beginning of the end of Vladimir Putin's rule, that story won't begin with the mutinous mercenary warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin leading an armored column of troops, guns a-blazing, into Moscow.\n\nThe funniest thing about much of the reporting and commentary of Prigozhin's \"March For Justice,\" both in real-time and afterward, is how often observers described the spectacle as \" unprecedented .\" The Telegraph 's \" Ukraine: The Latest\" podcast -the best single source for daily coverage of the Ukraine war-described the \"unprecedented coup against the Kremlin\" at the top of a special Saturday episode, only for the panelists to start debating which coups from Russian history served as the best precedent for the unfolding events in Russia.\n\nEven Putin, in his angry Saturday address , compared Prigozhin's \"stab in the back\" to General Lavr Kornilov's attempted coup in 1917 that paved the way for the Bolshevik Revolution and the Russian Civil War.\n\nThe point isn't to nitpick-\"unprecedented\" isn't a synonym for \"shocking\" or \"momentous\"-but to note that you can't understand what's unfolding in Russia unless you take into account that such events have lots of precedent. Indeed, since at least the 1700s, Russian history is really a story of coups of one sort or another.\n\nIn Western Europe, nobles drew their power and authority from their deep roots in their feudal territories. They answered to the throne, but they were largely sovereign over their own holdings. This diffusion of power and legitimacy created the space for the rise of liberalism and democracy in the West. The Magna Carta, for instance, was essentially a power-sharing agreement between King John and his nobles.\n\nIn Russia, under the pomestie system , nobles ruled various regions as emissaries of the czar, who literally owned all of Russia. Russian pomeshchiki were more like colonial governors, or warlord-contractors, with little connection to, or interest in, the serfs and peasants they exploited.\n\n\"All the things that connected the nobility of feudal Europe to a village or county - networks of charity and patronage, parish life, corporate bodies and local government, in short everything that fosters regional identities and loyalties - were thus missing in Russia,\" writes Orlando Figes in his masterful The Story of Russia . \"It was only from the middle of the nineteenth century that these local networks and identities began to evolve - too late, as it turned out, to sustain the development of an independent civil society or a democratic form of government.\"\n\nThus, Figes observes, the \"persistence of autocracy in Russia is explained less by the state's strength than by the weakness of society.\"\n\nA parallel dynamic can be seen in the evolution of religion in Western Europe, where the authority of the church and the authority of monarchs were in constant tension. In Russia, no such tension existed because the czar was simultaneously the supreme religious authority and secular ruler to the point where the distinction between secular and religious did not exist.\n\nSeen from this perspective, Soviet rule, particularly under Stalin, was more of a continuation of Russian history than a break with it. Putin sees himself in this light, which explains why he lionizes both czarist and communist history without any sense of contradiction.\n\nThis political tradition not only makes it very hard for Westerners to understand the Russian mind, it makes it hard to understand what the hell is going on there. We tend to see power as something granted from below, primarily through elections. Power is held accountable by the press but also competing spheres of power via divided government, checks and balances, and the rule of law. In Russia, power is unitary and seized from the top. Elections-if they occur at all-and the press are propaganda tools used to ratify the unitary power of the ruler.\n\nLiberal democracies are designed to be adaptive, flexible, or resilient under stress. Russian autocracy is like marble, extremely strong, but also very brittle. That's why cracks in the perception of power, often after military setbacks, can quickly lead to real collapses in power.\n\nPutin and his apologists have assumed that time is on Russia's side in the war with Ukraine. On paper, it can look that way militarily. But Ukraine and its Western backers have proven strong and supple while Putin's Russia looks more brittle by the day. The Wagner incident is not likely to be the last crack we'll see in Putin's façade.\n\nJonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C.

But he said even though SpaceX has been \"phenomenally successful\" and intends to develop a spacecraft that will land on the moon, The Wall Street Journal report raises questions.\n\n\"I don't know that that story is true, [but] I think it should be investigated,\" Nelson said. \"If the story is true, that there have been multiple conversations between Elon Musk and the president of Russia, then I think that would be concerning, particularly for NASA, for the Department of Defense, for some of the intelligence agencies.\"\n\nNASA works with SpaceX, whose Dragon capsule brought back three astronauts and one cosmonaut from the International Space Station Friday.\n\nMARK CUBAN DOUBTS MUSK WOULD SERVE IN TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DUE TO 'CONFLICTS OF INTEREST'\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson on Friday said a report claiming SpaceX owner Elon Musk has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin since 2022 \"should be investigated.\" (Paul Hennessy/NurPhoto via Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nMusk has regularly spoken to Putin since 2022 on issues related to international politics, personal issues and business, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing officials from the U.S., Europe and Russia.\n\nThe Journal noted that SpaceX earned a $1.8 billion classified U.S. government contract in 2021, and Musk has a top-secret security clearance.\n\nA U.S. official said people in the government aware of Musk's relationship with Putin don't \"love\" it, but no alerts of possible national security breaches have been raised, the Journal reported.\n\nDuring one of their conversations, Putin asked Musk to delay activating Starlink over Taiwan as a favor to China, the Journal reported. Starlink never got permission for Starlink in Taiwan, where there are restrictions on foreign satellite providers.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Elon Musk and Russian President Vladimir Putin have been in regular contact since 2022. (Contributor/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nELON MUSK'S NET WORTH JUMPS AFTER TESLA SHARES SURGE\n\nMonths after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, increased restrictions were put on Ukraine's military use of Starlink, the Journal reported. Musk reportedly said that the restrictions were over concerns of nuclear war in Crimea.\n\nSpaceX denied the Journal's claims in a statement posted to social media, calling the story \"misleading\" and noting the company has aided Ukraine ever since Russia invaded in 2022.\n\n\"Starlink has kept Ukrainians online and connected to the world throughout the conflict, and Starlink has defended itself against major efforts to disrupt that connection, at great cost to the company,\" the statement said in part.\n\n\"Regarding Taiwan, as even the Taiwan government has confirmed, Starlink is not available there because Taiwan has not given us a license to operate, and regulators declined to remove a requirement that a foreign entity own 51% of Starlink to operate there. SpaceX has not accepted such a condition for any market in which it operates. This has nothing to do with Russia or China.\"\n\nRegarding the report, Musk reposted a comment on X that said, \"Welp, the Swamp's 'Trump is Hitler' didn't work. Might as well give 'Elon is a Russian agent' a whirl.\" He added two laughing emoji.\n\nBill Nelson is NASA's administrator. (Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images / Getty Images)\n\nMusk has endorsed former President Trump for president and there has been speculation he could have a position in a second Trump administration.\n\nA Pentagon spokesperson told the Journal, \"We do not comment on any individual's security clearance, review or status or about personnel security policy matters in the context of reports about any individual's actions.\"\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on Friday said in a press briefing, \"I'm not a position to corroborate the veracity of those reports, and we would refer you to Mr. Musk to speak to his private communications.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFOX Business has reached out to SpaceX and NASA for comment.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

      "text": "Subscribe to our newsletters and always be informed.\n\nBy signing up to our newsletters you agree to the Just the News Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"The leaders spoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts,\" the White House said.\n\nPublished: March 18, 2025 11:00pm\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Tuesday phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to signal both a potential end to the Ukraine War and possible Russian cooperation as the U.S. moves its diplomatic attention toward Iran and its proxies in the Middle East.\n\nTrump and Putin spoke on the phone for about two hours on Tuesday and discussed a range of topics, including the implementation and an \"energy and infrastructure\" ceasefire, and a \"maritime ceasefire.\" While neither signify a definitive end to the conflict, as the Russians have pummeled the Ukrainian infrastructure and energy grid, statements suggesting a desire for normalized relations and agreement on the Iran-Israel tensions seem to augur a pivot in the administration's priorities.\n\n\"This conflict should never have started and should have been ended long ago with sincere and good faith peace efforts,\" read a readout of the call from the White House . \"The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"The leaders spoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts,\" it continued. \"They further discussed the need to stop proliferation of strategic weapons and will engage with others to ensure the broadest possible application. The two leaders shared the view that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel.\"\n\nThe statements come as the Trump administration has launched airstrikes against Ansarallah (Houthis), a terrorist group based in Yemen that has disrupted shipping through the Red Sea in support of Hamas. Israeli airstrikes on Gaza on Monday terminated a ceasefire agreement with Hamas that began in January.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry claimed as many as 400 dead thus far, though that number has not been independently verified. Collectively, the developments seem to signal that Washington hopes to settle things in Eastern Europe so it can better focus on the escalating conflict in the Middle East.\n\nPutin is far from agreeing to a total cessation of the conflict, and the initial ceasefire categories are unlikely to be of military consequence. While the energy and infrastructure ceasefire will likely quell international concerns about the targeting of nuclear plants, the Russians have already leveled much of Ukraine's non-nuclear power generation. Should a ceasefire in the Black Sea happen, it would do little other than to shield the Russian Black Sea Fleet - which has seen minimal action - from Ukrainian potshots.\n\nThe move comes in the wake of a disastrous Ukrainian expedition in Russia's Kursk Oblast that began last year. During the brief halt in American intelligence sharing with Ukraine, Russian special forces conducted a daring mission through a drained pipeline to attack the Ukrainian rear in a gambit that ultimately forced the evacuation of Ukrainian troops from Russian soil. Russian troops have since pursued troops into the neighboring Sumy Oblast of Ukraine, and that front will evidently remain unaffected by the limited ceasefire. Moscow has also posted gains along the Zaporizhzhia and Donbas fronts. The ground and air conflict is expected to continue amid negotiations.\n\nThe White House readout on the Trump-Putin call mentioned not only an understanding that Iran shouldn't be able to destroy Israel, but stated that the pair \"spoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts.\" That statement followed reports that Russia had proposed acting as a mediator between Washington and Tehran on nuclear talks.\n\nAs a loose Iranian ally and active party in the ongoing Syrian conflict, the Russians maintain a degree of clout in the region that could prove beneficial to the United States should both nations conclude an agreement that restores relations and puts Russia in a position to assist more actively in the Middle East.\n\nSpeaking to Just the News 's Amanda Head, former National Security Council chief of staff Fred Fleitz opined on the prospect of Russian intervention to temper Iranian hostility, saying \"I think Trump should ask for that.\" He did, however, express caution about the prospect of success, saying \"I don't know that Russia is going to be that effective in convincing the Iranians to stop supporting Hamas, but we may be able to [convince] the Iranians through other ways.\"\n\nFleitz personally took a more hawkish approach to the issue, pointing to American support for Israel against Hamas and recent American strikes on Ansarallah in Yemen as demonstrative of a Trump-favored \"peace through strength approach.\"\n\n\"The attack on the Houthis was a powerful way [of sending a message],\" Fleitz said. As were \"the very open statements [that] the Trump administration officials are saying that these Houthi missile and drone attacks are Iranian attacks, because all these weapons came from Iran, and we know that they are a client state of Iran, a proxy state, and Iran is responsible.\"\n\n\"And given how weak [Iran's] defense is - we learned that last year with Israeli airstrikes - they are very vulnerable to devastating airstrikes by Israel and the United States,\" he added.\n\nIsrael's air strikes on the Gaza Strip this week ended a ceasefire agreement that Trump special envoy Steve Witkoff helped negotiate ahead of the president's return to office in late January. The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas forces stormed Israeli border towns, seized roughly 250 hostages, and murdered as many as 1,200 civilians . The Israel Defense Forces subsequently invaded the Gaza Strip in a bid to oust Hamas from power, but were bogged down in grueling urban warfare.\n\nThe reignition of the conflict comes as the Americans put pressure on Hamas's allies in other areas as part of a broader conflict.\n\nPrior to Trump's call with Putin, he ordered a strike on Ansarallah in northern Yemen. The Houthi terrorist group is one of three primary combatants in the ongoing Yemeni Civil War and maintains a block of territory along the Red Sea coast near the Bab el Mandeb. That area is a key access point between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, a vital shipping lane leading to the Suez Canal.\n\nThe Houthis have targeted commercial and military vessels alike in their bid to support Hamas. The Biden administration delisted them as a terrorist organization, though Trump speedily reversed that move earlier this year. Amid the attacks, Trump made clear that he regarded Ansarallah as an Iranian proxy and appeared to forecast the prospect of military action in that country.\n\n\"Let nobody be fooled! The hundreds of attacks being made by Houthi, the sinister mobsters and thugs based in Yemen, who are hated by the Yemeni people, all emanate from, and are created by, IRAN,\" Trump posted on Truth Social Monday morning. \"Any further attack or retaliation by the 'Houthis' will be met with great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there.\"\n\n\"Iran has played 'the innocent victim' of rogue terrorists from which they've lost control, but they haven't lost control. They're dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, 'Intelligence,'\" he insisted. \"Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!\"\n\nFleitz linked the attacks on the Houthis to American strategy with respect to Moscow, Beijing and Tehran, saying \"I think Trump is either acting or taking or supporting actions like this [to] demonstrate American strength. Peace through strength.\"\n\n\"We know our adversaries respect strength. We know despots in China and Iran, Russia respect strength,\" he added. \"They respect strong American presidents and strikes on the Houthis, with our support against Hamas, it is sending a message to our enemies worldwide,\" Fleitz said."

They are already trying to distort the agreements and actually deceive our mediators and the whole world,\" Zelensky said in a statement.\n\nRussia and Ukraine agreed to end combat in and around the Black Sea on Tuesday, US officials said, with the deal sparking hope that a greater cease-fire deal could be obtained.\n\nBut like with the previous cease-fire barring attacks on energy facilities, Russia immediately went back on its word and launched a drone attack on Mykolaiv, a port city in the northwest region of the Black Sea.\n\nMoscow now claims that the maritime truce will only begin once the European Union revokes the sanctions on the state agricultural bank Rosselkhozbank and restores access to the SWIFT international payment system.\n\nThe EU suspended many Russian financial institutions' access to SWIFT following the 2022 invasion, dealing a major blow to Moscow's energy and agricultural exports.\n\nThe EU is likely to reject Moscow's demands, with a European Commission spokesperson saying the sanctions would only be lifted once Russia's forces withdraw from Ukraine, the BBC reported .\n\n\"Moscow always lies,\" he added.\n\nDespite Ukraine and EU's opposition to lifting sanctions against Russia, US officials said they were \"looking at\" the possibility in order to secure the Black Sea truce.\n\n\"There are about five or six conditions. We're looking at all of them,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nAfter Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, both sides initially agreed to a maritime cease-fire that allowed Kyiv to safely export nearly 33 million metric tons of grain - as Ukraine is one of the world's largest suppliers of wheat.\n\nBut Moscow withdrew from the truce a year later after being hit with sanctions over its invasion, with maritime attacks continuing since then.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Russia rejects full cease-fire, but agrees to stop attacks on energy and 'infrastructure' in two-hour Trump call\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin rejected President Trump's proposal of a full, unconditional cease-fire with Ukraine on Tuesday, but agreed to halt attacks on \"energy and infrastructure\" - sectors Kyiv has recently, and successfully, targeted.\n\nElsewhere in the two-hour phone call, the Russian president demanded that Trump cut all military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine, according to a readout from the Kremlin.\n\nA White House summary of the call did not mention the bold ask and American aid continued to flow Tuesday. Trump in a Fox News interview denied the leaders discussed aid \"at all.\"\n\nTrump was apparently able to secure one element of his cease-fire proposal, as the Kremlin announced Russia and Ukraine would release 175 of each other's prisoners of war, with Moscow also freeing \"23 seriously wounded Ukrainian servicemen\" to receive treatment in their home country.\n\nDespite Putin failing to back down, Trump called the call \"very good and productive\" in a post to Truth Social.\n\n\"We agreed to an immediate Ceasefire on all Energy and Infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine,\" he said.\n\n\"This War would have never started if I were President!\" Trump added. \"Many elements of a Contract for Peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would like to see it end.\"\n\nHowever, the Kremlin specified that only \"energy infrastructure\" would be subject to the ceasefire, should Kyiv agree - meaning Russia's attacks on other civilian infrastructure would continue.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters Tuesday afternoon that \"if there is a partial ceasefire, this is a positive result\" - but also expressed \"skepticism\" Russia would stick to its word, according to ABC News .\n\nAbout an hour after the Kremlin said Putin \"immediately gave the Russian military the appropriate command,\" Russia broke the cease-fire with an attack affecting the energy grid in Sloviansk, Ukraine.\n\n\"Putin backed Trump's 30-day pause on energy strikes-then broke his word in less than an hour. Russia hit Sloviansk's energy infrastructure, leaving half the city without power,\" Ukrainian Member of Parliament Inna Sovsun posted to X. \"Shocking? Absolutely not.\"\n\nMoscow is seeking the \"energy infrastructure\" cease-fire after Ukraine targeted multiple Russian oil facilities in recent weeks.\n\nOn March 11, Kyiv launched a drone attack on Moscow Oil Refinery, which provides the Russian capital with about half of its diesel and gasoline needs.\n\nThough Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to Trump's provisional proposal of an unconditional cease-fire last week, it is unclear whether Kyiv would agree to the modified truce discussed by the American and Russian leaders.\n\n\"Russia has an interest in stopping the Ukrainian strikes on its energy infrastructure,\" Foundation for Defense of Democracies Russia expert John Hardie told The Post. \"Moscow and Kyiv quietly held preliminary talks on such a cease-fire last year, though they ultimately broke down.\"\n\nRussia has also targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure, often timing their heaviest attacks to the start of each winter, as temperatures drop and civilians need energy and gas for heat.\n\nTrump welcomed Russia's willingness to stop attacking Ukraine's energy infrastructure, but discussions will continue on how to achieve the rest of the US president's cease-fire aims, the White House said.\n\n\"The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on the implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace,\" the White House said in a statement. \"These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.\"\n\nHardie said Putin likely offered the restricted cease-fire to further delay talks and make Trump believe Moscow was willing to give something.\n\n\"Putin needed to appear constructive. He wasn't ready to agree to an unconditional comprehensive cease-fire, but rejecting everything Trump proposed would have been risky,\" Hardie said.\n\n\"Putin wants to keep Trump focused on luring Russia to the negotiating table rather than seeking to compel Russia via sanctions or other means.\"\n\nTrump and his national security team have been trying to get Putin to agree to the same 30-day deal Kyiv assented to last week following talks in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe US proposal was designed to reveal which party to the war was ready to talk peace, administration officials have said. It involved no terms other than a commitment to diplomatic talks, a pause on all hostilities, the exchange of prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children that Russians have kidnapped.\n\nSince the start of the Trump administration, the president has been pushing for Russia and Ukraine to first \"stop the killing,\" then hold negotiations under a cease-fire, according to the special envoy to Ukraine, Gen. Keith Kellogg.\n\nAhead of the scheduled call, Putin appeared in no hurry to pick up the phone to chat with Trump about the truce proposal.\n\nAt 5:30 p.m. Moscow time, Putin was still on stage at the Congress of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, speaking to oligarchs about \"the decline of 'Western dominance,\" according to Russia's state-run TASS news agency.\n\nIn a video clip from the summit, an interviewer reminded Putin that his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, had indicated the Russia president's phone call with Trump was \"supposed to last until\" 6 p.m.\n\nPutin waved off the comment, indicating that he could stay on stage for longer and joking: \"I don't listen [to Peskov].\"\n\nThe Kremlin tyrant could have signed the cease-fire on Friday, when special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff went to Moscow to present Putin with the agreement that Ukraine had inked two days before.\n\nPutin sent Witkoff home to Washington with little more than a demand that Trump call him directly to discuss the potential deal.\n\nThe Russian president made the Americans wait for him that day as well, putting Witkoff off for roughly eight hours - a period that included a dinner with Belarussian leader Alexander Lukashenko, according to Kremlin reports.\n\nBut Trump insisted reports that Witkoff was left waiting were incorrect, claiming that the envoy was meeting with low-level Russian officials rather than cooling his heels.\n\nAdvertisement"

But last week, Israel resumed its military campaign in the Gaza Strip amid the ongoing conflict with Hamas.\n\n\"I certainly hope we get everybody back to the table and get the hostages home,\" Witkoff said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"I thought we had a deal - an acceptable deal. I even thought we had an approval from Hamas.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's just me getting duped,\" he added. \"I thought we were there, and evidently, we weren't.\"\n\nWitkoff affirmed that the US \"stands with the state of Israel\" and stressed, \"We need to be clear who the aggressor is here and that is Hamas.\"\n\nIsrael's military resumed fighting in Gaza due to \"Hamas' refusal to release the hostages and threats to harm IDF soldiers and Israeli communities,\" the country's defense minister Israel Katz claimed on Friday, one of several leading politicians to declare a ramping up in the conflict.\n\n\"From now on, negotiations will only take place under fire,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared on Tuesday night .\n\nWith respect to the bloody war in Ukraine, Witkoff struck a more conciliatory tone towards the Russians who began the unprovoked war against its neighbor three years ago.\n\n\"In my 68 years on this Earth, I've never ever seen a situation where there isn't two sides to a story,\" Witkoff replied when asked if Putin has been mischaracterized as a \"tyrant\" who kills his political rivals.\n\nWitkoff has met with Putin in person twice, including earlier this month. He recently recounted how the former KGB agent gave him a portrait of Trump and told him that he went to church to pray for the 47th president after the assassination attempt.\n\n\"I simply have said that I just don't see that he wants to take all of Europe,\" Witkoff assessed. \"This is a much different situation than it was in World War II. In World War II, there was no NATO.\"\n\nThe US special envoy explained that in Putin's speeches for years, he's talked about the \"five regions,\" likely referring to Crimea as well as the Donbas oblasts of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.\n\nRussia currently controls Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and controls a majority, but not all of the four Donbas oblasts.\n\n\"That's an academic issue,\" Witkoff added about Putin's true objectives. \"The real issue here, the agenda set forth by President Trump, he is my boss and I adhere to that fact. That the agenda is stop the killing. Stop the carnage. Let's end this thing.\"\n\nLast week, Putin rejected the Trump administration's framework for a 30-day ceasefire so that more comprehensive peace talks could take place, something to which Ukraine agreed.\n\nInstead, Moscow offered to pause attacks on \"energy and infrastructure\" for 30 days. A readout from Moscow stated that Putin demanded the US cease military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine, but Trump has publicly denied that claim.\n\nZelensky later agreed to the scaled-down ceasefire the Russians proposed but warned that \"nothing has changed\" with the Russians, who launched a brutal and massive drone attack on the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement"

Instead, it is an isolated country embroiled in war and plagued by systemic decay.\n\nDemographers warn that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has accelerated its long-term population decline .\n\nEconomists highlight how the country's dependence on oil - a classic \"resource curse\" - and its wartime economy have locked it into a trajectory of prolonged stagnation .\n\nThese structural trends show no signs of change over the coming year.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian National Wealth Fund teeters on the brink of insolvency.\n\nPutin has squandered his country's resources on an imperial façade of high-tech power and affluence, funding hypersonic missiles, nuclear-capable submarines and a $2 billion St. Petersburg skyscraper for Gazprom, the Kremlin's natural gas monopoly.\n\nYet the average monthly wage in Russia remains a mere $787, with citizens spending an alarming 30% of their income on food.(By comparison, Americans spend around 11%.)\n\nRussia's international alliances fare no better.\n\nRather than building a coalition of strong allies, Russia has gathered a motley crew of weak dependents like Belarus, African kleptocracies and rogue \"frenemies\" such as Iran. These partnerships are precarious at best.\n\nThe recent collapse of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad dealt a significant blow to the power projection capabilities of both Russia and Iran.\n\nSubscribe to our daily Post Opinion newsletter!\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nAssad now joins a growing list of deposed leaders from Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia and Armenia - all of whom have sought refuge in Russia after Moscow's backing failed to sustain their rule.\n\nThis leaves China.\n\nInstead of fostering a relationship of equals with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Putin has been forced to rely on Chinese cash flow and industrial support to sustain his military and imperial ambitions.\n\nInitially, Moscow celebrated Beijing's 2022 pledge of a \" no limits \" partnership. However, as Putin's war in Ukraine became a stalemate, China began to distance itself from this commitment.\n\nIn 2023, China's former ambassador to the European Union dismissed the \"no limits\" promise as \"nothing but rhetoric.\" More humiliating for Putin, Beijing omitted the phrase from a statement on Sino-Russian relations during his latest visit to China .\n\nThese conditions create an unprecedented opportunity for the incoming Trump administration.\n\nOver the next year, the Trump White House must deny Putin the ability to spread instability across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThe fastest way to do so: Tighten the screws of Western sanctions first, and ease off later.\n\nWashington's immediate target should be Putin's energy revenue - the lifeblood of his imperial pretensions.\n\nTo achieve this, the US and its G7 allies must sharply reduce their \"oil price cap\" on Russian crude exports.\n\nAlthough initially proposed by the EU as a tool to slash Moscow's earnings, the cap became a major loophole to Russian sanctions - and the Biden White House signed on to the scheme.\n\nLetting Russia sell oil freely at prices under $65 per barrel now allows the Kremlin to rake in vast revenues without facing meaningful penalties.\n\nThat money funds Russia's ability to spread chaos around the world.\n\nThe Trump White House should drastically tighten this exemption - perhaps lowering the sanctions bar to as low as $35 per barrel.\n\nSince Putin cannot long survive without this cash flow, such a move would vastly increase Trump 2.0's negotiating leverage over Moscow.\n\nEventually, the Kremlin will seek relief from Western sanctions to stabilize its crumbling economy, likely offering empty promises of good behavior.\n\nWashington must remain cautious, ensuring that no concessions are granted without first seeing concrete action from Russia.\n\nUltimately, the United States cannot be expected to save Russia from Putin's legacy of squandered national potential and self-inflicted decline.\n\nWe can, however, hold a firm line against Putin while assisting our allies in resisting him over the coming year.\n\nPeter Doran is an adjunct senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies."

We've had other calls.\"\n\n\"That's not been made public before,\" I said. \"No, but this is a continuation of positive,\" Trump replied. \"If it was not positive, I'd tell you.\"\n\nOn what comes next, Trump said: \"Probably a full ceasefire at the appropriate time. It's hard right now because you've got guys looking at each other with gun barrels ... but the next thing would be a full ceasefire and a deal.\"\n\nIs that a long way away? \"No,\" Trump answered. \"I think it will go pretty quickly.\" Of course, the president noted, both sides, Russia and Ukraine, will have to agree for that to happen.\n\nI asked the president how he can exert pressure on Putin. It's a much simpler situation with Ukraine, which is heavily dependent on the United States. But how to pressure Putin? \"Well, I don't want to get into it, but there are good reasons why [Putin] would do this,\" Trump answered. \"But if I wasn't here, he would never do it.\"\n\n\"They weren't talking at all,\" Trump said of his predecessors in the White House. \"Biden wasn't capable of talking.\"\n\n\"I'm doing this because of the fact that number one, I don't want people to die,\" Trump said. \"And number two, I don't like the fact that we've spent, in my opinion, $350 billion. You know, they like to say $190 billion, $200 billion - whether it was or not, we've spent in my opinion $350 billion, with nothing to show. Much more importantly, people are being killed. They're not from our country, but that could easily be a third World War at some point.\"\n\nThe call that took place Tuesday was not a video call - just audio on both sides. I asked Trump whether, even with translators, he could read anything from Putin's demeanor. \"Putin was very solid, very strong, which he is,\" Trump said. \"It was a very good call. I know him very well. I think he is very serious that he wants to end it.\""

      "text": "Putin manipulates Trump, gets KGB art of the ceasefire deal\n\nAfter delaying their phone call and then laughing about it to assembled Russian industrialists and state media (a very Russian attempt to show President Donald Trump who is boss), Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to have thoroughly manipulated Trump during their conversation on Tuesday.\n\nTrump was willing to put extraordinary pressure on Ukraine to agree to a full 30-day ceasefire, but Pu tin has now somehow persuaded Trump that the ceasefire should be limited to attacks on infrastructure and energy targets. This deal is a gift to Russia for three reasons.\n\nFirst, because it shows Ukraine and U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere that Trump is not a fair arbiter for peace and can be corralled by Putin's word games .\n\nSecond, because this deal is not a ceasefire so much as it is the absolute minimum fiction Putin evidently decided he had to give Trump in order to avoid U.S. sanctions. Absent a full ceasefire, Russian forces will be able to maintain their offensive pressure against Ukrainian forces along the front lines. They are escalating that pressure to exploit Ukrainian and European fears over the reduction of U.S. support.\n\nThird, because the Russian leader will continue to attack most Ukrainian civilian and government facilities under the guise that those targets do not constitute \"infrastructure\" or that any Russian strikes on these targets are accidental. In contrast, and of key benefit to Russia, Ukraine will now have to suspend its strikes on Russian energy targets. Those strikes offered Ukraine its key means of weakening Russia's war machine and denying Putin the sole export industry via which to earn foreign capital to fund his continuing war.\n\nTo consider how masterfully Putin has played Trump here, consider the contrast in how Trump dealt with Ukraine and how he has now dealt with Russia. Trump suspended munitions and intelligence support to a country defending itself from invasion in order to secure its commitment to a full ceasefire. In contrast, Trump has now accepted Putin's refusal of a full ceasefire without Russia suffering any U.S. consequences whatsoever. Even for a president who had already made abundantly clear his delusional trust in Putin's nonexistent better intentions, his acquiescence to Putin's gambit is an embarrassment. Trump warned Putin that playing games over a ceasefire would result in U.S. sanctions. Instead, he will now surely thank the KGB man on Truth Social for playing him for a patsy.\n\nHOW TRUMP FEARS AND TRUSTS PUTIN TOO MUCH\n\nTrump's action undermines America's moral and strategic credibility, weakens the already fraying trust of allies from Australia to the United Kingdom (already weak because Trump has declared trade wars on most of them), and suggests that Trump prefers the Russian art of a deal to no deal at all.\n\nEven if, that is, the Russian deal is built on the destruction of human lives, democratic nations, and, in the future, the security of America's best European allies . Still, the American president can at least be grateful that the Russian leader has given him another thinly veiled \" Tennis balls, my liege \" insult gift via his proposition for NHL and Russian hockey league exhibitions."

      "text": "Key questions ahead of Trump-Putin ceasefire talk\n\nPresident Donald Trump will speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week to discuss the viability of ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with a trio of high-ranking Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia , where diplomats hammered out a proposal for peace that would establish a preliminary 30-day ceasefire.\n\nPutin responded to the proposal with mixed messages, simultaneously affirming that the crux of the proposal was \"good\" and \"correct\" but signaling opposition to signing due to concerns about how soldiers in occupied areas of Russia would be handled.\n\nThe phone call scheduled for Tuesday will be an opportunity for the U.S. and other world powers to gain some insight into the Kremlin's machinations.\n\nThe most pressing question U.S. leaders must find an answer to is whether Putin is sincerely interested in establishing lasting peace in Ukraine or if his reserved praise of the proposal is meant to string along the White House and Kyiv.\n\n\"We agree with the proposal to cease hostilities. But we believe this cessation should lead to long-term peace and eliminate the root causes of the conflict,\" Putin previously said of the proposal.\n\nHis specific contentions revolve around the 30-day time frame of the ceasefire. He said Ukraine could use the pause to regroup and fortify its position.\n\n\"How will these 30 days be used? To continue forced mobilization in Ukraine? To send more weapons there?\" he added. \"How will issues of control and verification be handled - how can we be guaranteed that none of this will happen?\"\n\nHe also expressed frustration about the immediate fate of Ukrainian soldiers occupying Russian land in the Kursk region and elsewhere.\n\n\"Are we supposed to let them go after they committed mass crimes against civilians?\" Putin asked. \"Or will the Ukrainian leadership order them to lay down arms and surrender?\"\n\nCritics say these points of disagreement are designed to hide the Kremlin's desire to continue fighting while Russian forces make progress on the front lines and surge deeper into Ukrainian territory.\n\n\"After the talks in Jeddah and the American proposal for a ceasefire on the front line, Russia stole almost another week - a week of war that only Russia wants,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said via social media on Sunday.\n\n\"We will do everything to further intensify diplomacy. We will do everything to make diplomacy effective. But every day now is about defending our independence, our state, and our people,\" he continued.\n\nThe longer the conflict continues in its current trajectory, the more influence and land Russia will be able to amass from the overwhelmed Ukrainian military .\n\nThe granular details of the U.S.-Ukraine proposal remain unknown, but the division and allocation of contested territories will undoubtedly be a stumbling block to finalizing a ceasefire.\n\nTrump told the press aboard Air Force One on Sunday that his conversation with Putin would touch on \"dividing up certain assets\" between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n\"We will be talking about land. We will be talking about power plants,\" he said. \"I think a lot of it has already been discussed at length by both sides, Ukraine and Russia.\"\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, occupied by Russia since 2022, is among the most prominent assets to be allocated. It is a crucial piece of energy infrastructure for Ukraine, and Kyiv has repeatedly demanded that Moscow pull troops out of the area, which is currently not in operation.\n\nRussia is clear it will not accept a deal that does not return control of the Kursk region, which remains occupied by Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nThe Russian military continues to reclaim territory in Kursk, and on a long enough timeline, the region may be reclaimed without the aid of the U.S. - a scenario that would lose one of Ukraine's most valuable bargaining chips.\n\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, perhaps Putin's closest ally on the world stage, said last week that he is convinced U.S. officials will be unable to put forward an acceptable plan for the ceasefire.\n\n\"I can say for sure the Americans have no plan for the conflict in Ukraine. Absolutely none,\" he said, according to translations from the Moscow Times . \"It's easier for [Russia] on the front line, that's why they have the big cards, as Trump said.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Trump treated Zelensky with hostility during a meeting in the Oval Office over a perceived lack of commitment to U.S. plans for peace.\n\nTrump called the Ukrainian president a \"dictator\" and accused him of warmongering for his own benefit. But when Zelensky showed deference to the White House, Trump relented.\n\nIt's unclear if Trump is willing to direct the same harsh rhetoric at Putin if the Russian president fails to signal a cooperative spirit in the negotiations, but he has already floated the idea of punishing the invading nation economically.\n\n\"I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED,\" he posted to his social media site, Truth Social. \"To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late.\"\n\nA long-term peace agreement will do little to quell the fears of the Ukrainian public without some sort of security guarantee to prevent future resumption of hostilities.\n\nRussia is clear that Ukraine receiving NATO membership is off the table. Similarly, the Kremlin has made clear the mere presence of NATO peacekeepers in the region would tank any peace agreement.\n\nZelensky said following the Jeddah meeting that all involved parties \"need to put security guarantees on paper.\" He tempered expectations for Ukraine to gain a seat in NATO but criticized the idea that Russia had a say in such decisions.\n\nUS TO WITHDRAW FROM BODY INVESTIGATING RUSSIAN RESPONSIBILITY FOR UKRAINE WAR\n\n\"We understand that the decision regarding NATO membership or any other format should depend on NATO allies or other partners, but certainly not on Russia's desires or their vision, especially not on Russia's veto over NATO,\" he wrote in a social media statement. \"They have no legal authority here, and we should not give them the chance to exert such influence.\"\n\nAn option remains for Ukraine to patch together individual security agreements with its strongest European allies, such as France and the United Kingdom, to form a non-NATO alliance of protector states.\n\nThe White House is signaling that postwar investment in Ukraine would serve as a de facto security agreement, entangling American interests and creating much greater risks for future Russian invasions."

Top envoys of all three countries are set to meet to discuss the ceasefire proposal starting Sunday in Saudi Arabia."

      "text": "Trump and Putin agree to preliminary ceasefire negotiations in Middle East\n\nThe United States and Russia are preparing to meet in the Middle East to conduct negotiations that will hopefully end the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin for almost two hours on a Tuesday phone call that U.S. and Ukrainian leaders hoped would push the Kremlin to end its invasion.\n\nThe White House said following the conversation that preliminary ceasefire negotiations will begin soon, citing \"the need for improved bilateral relations between the United States and Russia.\"\n\n\"The blood and treasure that both Ukraine and Russia have been spending in this war would be better spent on the needs of their people,\" the White House readout stated.\n\n\"This conflict should never have started and should have been ended long ago with sincere and good faith peace efforts,\" the readout continued. \"The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.\"\n\nA read-out issued by the Kremlin following the meeting noted that a 30-day ceasefire on attacks against energy infrastructure was proposed by Trump and agreed to by Putin.\n\nThe Russian document went into far greater detail about the topics addressed in the call, including the creation of negotiating groups, a mutual agreement to work towards safety for vessels in the Black Sea, and a proposal from Trump to organize friendly hockey matches between the U.S. and Russia to normalize relations after peace.\n\nThe Kremlin read-out also asserts that in response to Trump's request for mercy on Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region of Russia - which is being quickly reclaimed by Russian forces - the Kremlin is prepared to spare all combatants in the event of surrender.\n\nThe scheduled talks in the Middle East are another half-step as Ukraine urges the U.S. to force Russia into agreement with the parameters drafted last week at a bilateral meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. That deal, struck between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and three counterparts from the Ukrainian government, proposed a preliminary 30-day ceasefire period on land, air, and sea.\n\nRussian officials walked away from the Tuesday phone call with positive attitudes, with Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev posting on social media that \"under the leadership of President Putin and President Trump,\" the world \"has become a much safer place today.\"\n\nPutin has played coy about his country's willingness to end hostilities with Ukraine after gaining a significant upper hand on the front lines. Russia has surged further into Ukrainian territory and reclaimed tracts of the occupied Kursk region.\n\nTrump is taking a less aggressive posture dealing with Putin than he did with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he called a \"dictator\" and warmonger over perceived unwillingness to sign immediately onto U.S. proposals for peace.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters before the call on Tuesday that the two presidents have a \"certain understanding\" that will help reach a mutually agreeable outcome but clarified that \"there are also a large number of questions regarding the further normalization of our bilateral relations, and a settlement on Ukraine.\"\n\nThe Kremlin read-out stated that Putin told Trump that Ukrainian officials are untrustworthy and attempting to sabotage peace negotiations.\n\nZelensky is likely frustrated with the lack of a firm resolution, recently accusing the Russians of intentionally drawing out peace talks as a method of gaining as much territory as possible before a ceasefire.\n\n\"Tomorrow marks one week since the U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in the sky, at sea, and on the front lines has been on the table,\" Zelensky said Monday on social media. \"The implementation of this proposal could have begun long ago. Every day in wartime is a matter of human lives.\"\n\nUS TO WITHDRAW FROM BODY INVESTIGATING RUSSIAN RESPONSIBILITY FOR UKRAINE WAR\n\nHe continued, \"Now, almost a week later, it's clear to everyone in the world-even to those who refused to acknowledge the truth for the past three years-that it is Putin who continues to drag out this war. For a week now, Putin has been unable to squeeze out 'yes' to the ceasefire proposal. He's saying whatever he wants, but not what the whole world wants to hear.\"\n\nUkraine will ultimately need to approve any negotiated peace deal concerning its conflict with Russia, but the massive amounts of casualties on both sides is stretching the country's much smaller combat-capable population to its limits.\n\nThe longer negotiations continue, the less leverage Ukraine will have against Russian demands."

      "text": "Will Trump let Putin play him with ceasefire 'nuances' game?\n\nResponding to Ukraine's acceptance of a U.S.-brokered 30-day ceasefire agreement on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin attempted to manipulate President Donald Trump regarding Russia's acceptance of that agreement.\n\nEver the KGB-trained manipulator, Putin knows he cannot outright reject Trump's overture. To do so would invite Trump's wrath and crystalize for the president what is known to most other objective observers, namely that Russia remains the primary aggressor in this conflict and the major obstacle to its just resolution. To counter this perception, Putin suggested that a ceasefire was \"good\" and that \"we absolutely support it.\" Just as long as, that is, the ceasefire addressed certain \"nuances.\"\n\nA book could be written on the KGB definition of nuances - The Mitrokhin Archive offers a good start.\n\nPutin's gamesmanship here was entirely predictable. As I noted on Tuesday, \"It is likely that Putin will not reject a ceasefire outright, fearing that doing so would aggravate Trump. Instead, the Russian leader may attempt to extract further concessions from Trump in return for his ceasefire commitment. These might include the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Russia's city of Kursk or perhaps a statement from Trump that most of Russian-occupied Ukraine will remain under Russian control as part of any final status accord.\"\n\nThe cautious word choice of \"nuances\" notwithstanding, Putin then made pretty clear what he wants from Trump in return for a ceasefire. It goes way beyond what could objectively be called nuances. Putin demanded \"guarantees\" that \"Ukraine will not conduct mobilization, will not train soldiers and will not receive weapons\" during the pause in fighting. This is a nonstarter in that Russia plainly will not match these caveats. Putin also questioned how the ceasefire would affect fighting in Russia's Kursk province, where a Ukrainian penetration force continues to control areas of Russian territory. Notably, in light of Russia's near-pristine record of signing then systematically breaking ceasefire agreements, Putin also questioned whether a ceasefire would actually work. As he put it, \"Who will give orders to cease hostilities and what is the cost of these orders?\"\n\nHere we see a more diplomatically skillful elocution of Putin's maximalist agenda than that which his top U.S. policy adviser offered on Thursday. Yuri Ushakov more honestly declared that Russia believes the ceasefire plan is a product of \"hasty actions\" that would serve as little more than a \"temporary respite for the Ukrainian military.\" Putin will now do everything he can to present his nuances as small, reasonable requests when he speaks to Trump via phone this weekend. He will simultaneously whisper sweet things in Trump's ear about his earnest interest in securing a durable peace.\n\nTrump must resist the manipulator's rhetoric. Putin will bet he can succeed. After all, Trump has shown a problematic tendency both to take Putin at his word, and allow himself to be pressured by that same word in excessive deference to Putin's threats . Instead, flowing from his oft-stated moral interest in ending the killing this war has wrought, the president should stand firm in his call. He should make clear that a just peace requires the starting point of a mutual show of sincerity by Ukraine and Russia that they are willing to end the fighting. Trump should state that just as Ukraine has accepted a no-strings-attached ceasefire, he expects Russia to do the same.\n\nBut that will simply be the start. Just as he has been willing to put extraordinary pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to make sacrifices for peace, Trump must be ready to do the same with Putin. He should warn the Russian president that any delay or effort to add strings to the ceasefire accord will result in punitive new sanctions on Russia's energy export industry, including secondary sanctions on its critical trading partners in China, the United Arab Emirates, and India.\n\nTRUMP'S RUSSIA PROSTRATION IS A GREAT GLOBAL GIFT TO CHINA\n\nThose sanctions could implode the Russian economy, which is far weaker than commonly understood. In short, Trump has the ace cards here. But unless he's willing to dangle their use, Putin will continue to undermine the noble cause Trump has set upon. And alongside the American allies who will be crucial to preserving any final status peace deal , Ukraine will see that Trump is not a reliable interlocutor who can be trusted.\n\nIn other words, the cause of peace will die with Trump's obedience to Putin's manipulation."

      "text": "Putin rejects US ceasefire plan, sees no incentive to pause fighting while his troops are advancing\n\nPUTIN: 'RUSSIAN TROOPS ARE ADVANCING IN ALMOST ALL AREAS': Russian President Vladimir Putin clearly believes he's sitting in the catbird seat, as he smugly listed his many objections to accepting a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the Americans. His chief argument? I'm winning. Why would I stop now?\n\nAt a news conference in Moscow, Putin said that while the U.S. may have pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept the proposal, the Ukrainian President should have \"asked most emphatically\" for the ceasefire \"in view of the situation evolving on the ground.\"\n\n\"Russian troops are advancing in almost all areas of combat contact,\" Putin said of his forces along the 1,200-mile line. \"Conditions are also very favorable there for us.\" Putin said the Ukrainian troops that seized the Kursk area of Russia last August are now surrounded and on the verge of being routed. \"Just a week or two ago, Ukrainian servicemen tried to get out of there in small groups. Now it is impossible,\" he said. \"The control of Ukrainian troops inside this incursion zone has been lost ... The situation there is completely under our control.\"\n\nWhile Putin paid lip service to the U.S. diplomatic initiative - thanking President Donald Trump for his \"attention to the Ukraine settlement\" and saying the \"idea itself is right\" - Putin wants negotiations first over his long list of demands and then a ceasefire on his terms. \"The idea to put an end to this conflict by peaceful means gets our full support,\" he said. \"However, there are issues that must be discussed. I think we must talk them over with our American colleagues and partners, perhaps have a telephone conversation with President Trump and discuss them with him.\"\n\nDID THE US INTEL AND MILITARY SUPPORT PAUSE LEAD TO RUSSIA'S KURSK ADVANCE?\n\n'PUTIN IS TRYING TO SET A TRAP': In an extended Oval Office photo op with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte , Trump said he saw Putin's desire to negotiate directly with him \"a very promising statement,\" but that \"it wasn't complete.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'd love to meet with him or talk to him. But we have to get it over with fast. You know, every day people are being killed,\" Trump said, revealing he already has some ideas about how Ukraine should be carved up, including who gets the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, which is now under Russian control.\n\n\"There's a power plant involved - you know, very big power plant involved. Who's going to get the power plant, and who's going to get this and that?\" Trump said. \"We have, you know, not been working in the dark. We've been discussing with Ukraine land - pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement.\"\n\n\"We've been discussing concepts of land because you don't want to waste time with a ceasefire if it's not going to mean anything,\" Trump said. \"So we say, look, this is what you can get. This is what you can't get.\"\n\n\"From my perspective, Putin is trying to set a trap, and the trap is that he wants to negotiate a lot of other issues that should be left to negotiations once you get a ceasefire,\" former Defense Secretary and CIA director Leon Panetta said on CNN. \"But if he's going to start negotiating on those issues now, then I think this ceasefire approach is going to collapse.\"\n\n\"[Putin] wants to talk about the NATO issue. He wants to talk about territory. He wants to talk about, you know, the power plant. There are a lot of issues, obviously, that have to be discussed, but you have to get a ceasefire first,\" Panetta argues. \"This is a moment where the president has to really be strong, that what we need is a clean ceasefire. He's being tested right now by Putin.\"\n\n\"If you try to start negotiating those issues now, then you're going to run into a lot of trouble with the parties; you're going to run into trouble with Ukraine; you're going to run into trouble with NATO,\" he said.\n\nWILL TRUMP LET PUTIN PLAY HIM WITH CEASEFIRE 'NUANCES' GAME?\n\nTRUMP'S DESPERATION IS SHOWING: By telegraphing the concessions he's willing to make - including taking NATO membership off the table for Ukraine and allowing Russia to keep most if not all of the territory it currently occupies - Trump has left himself little leverage.\n\nAs author Tony Schwartz wrote, channeling Trump in the 1987 bestseller The Art of the Deal , \"The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. That makes the other guy smell blood, and then you're dead. The best thing you can do is deal from strength, and leverage is the biggest strength you can have. Leverage is having something the other guy wants. Or better yet, needs. Or best of all, simply can't do without.\"\n\nRight now, Trump is giving off all the vibes that indicate a ceasefire in Ukraine is something he desperately wants, needs, and \"simply can't do without.\"\n\n\"I do have leverage, but I don't want to talk about leverage now because right now, we're talking to him, and based on the statements he made today, they were pretty positive,\" Trump insisted. While Trump has made vague threats about adding new sanctions against Russia, his own Secretary of State conceded this week, \"They're pretty sanctioned up. I mean, there's a lot of sanctions on already.\"\n\nThe one major leverage that Trump has is the one he is least interested in using. \"Until Russia lays down its weapons, Ukraine must continue to receive intelligence and military tools from not only the United States but also our NATO allies,\" Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL) and Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) Armed Services Committee chairman wrote in a joint statement . \"We must make clear that the costs of continuing the bloodshed will far exceed anything Putin has experienced to date. Toward that end, we applaud the Trump administration's decision today to end the Biden banking sanctions loophole that allowed for the continued purchase of Russian energy and funded Putin's war machine.\"\n\n\"I think [Trump] has the instincts to see when he's being jerked around, when Russia is diverting rather than actually doing what he's asking them to do,\" Trump's former ambassador to Ukraine Kurt Volker , said on CNN . \"He is fundamentally transactional. He wants to end the war so that he can get on with other things, not because he really cares about the end state, he just wants people to stop dying so you can get on with other things.\"\n\nEDITORIAL: TRUMP MUST NOW GET TOUGH WITH PUTIN\n\nGood Friday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre's Daily on Defense , written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre ( @jamiejmcintyre ) and edited by Christopher Tremoglie .

Unless at least eight Democrats join Senate Republicans in approving a continuing resolution that would extend federal funding through September, the government will shut down adding more chaos to the convulsions roiling the federal workforce.\n\nYesterday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who the day before said Democrats had the votes to block the measure, caved, saying he'll vote for the measure, even if he sees it as a vehicle for Trump and his DOGE deputies to continue to wreak havoc by dismantling the government.\n\n\"This week, Democrats offered a sensible way out: fund the government for another month to give appropriators more time to do their jobs. Republicans rejected this proposal outright. Why did they reject it? Because Donald Trump doesn't want the appropriators to do their job. He wants full control over government spending,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor . \"He isn't the first president to want this, but he's the first president to cower his party into submission.\"\n\n\"It's a Hobson's Choice: either proceed with the bill before us or risk Donald Trump throwing America into the chaos of a shutdown. This, in my view, is no choice at all,\" Schumer said. \"While the CR bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse.\"\n\n\"Under a shutdown, the Trump administration would have full authority to deem whole agencies, programs, and personnel \"non-essential,\" furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired. The decision on what is essential would be solely left to the executive branch, with nobody left at agencies to check them,\" Schumer argued. \"In short, a shutdown would give Donald Trump , Elon Musk , and DOGE, and Russell Vought the keys to the city, state and country.\"\n\nSo far only one other Democrat, Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) has publicly said he'll vote for the funding measure, but Schumer is said to have met privately with his members and believes the votes are there for passage.\n\nSCHUMER CAVES ON SHUTDOWN BATTLE WITH GOP, CLEARING WAY FOR FUNDING BILL PASSAGE\n\nIT'S OK TO BE GAY, ENOLA GAY THAT IS: When stories first surfaced that Pentagon purgers - following instructions to remove contents from DOD websites that referenced \"immutable characteristics\" of service members such as race, gender, ethnicity - had flagged images of the World War II bomber that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, because it was named after the pilot's mother Enola Gay, the Pentagon's \" rapid response\" X account pushed back.\n\n\"We are NOT removing images of the Enola Gay or any other pictures that honor the legacy of our warfighters,\" the Pentagon said, throwing in a dig at \" Anderson Cooper , CNN, and all 5 viewers they are speaking to.\" But the dogged team at the Associated Press kept checking the web pages and discovered that, yes, in fact, at least three images related to the B-29 Superfortress have been removed.\n\n\"The images that have disappeared include a historical black-and-white photo of the Enola Gay 'undergoing modification at Oklahoma City Air Depot to be able to drop atomic weapons, according to a thumbnail of the photograph, which remains,\" writes AP Pentagon reporter Tara Copp . \"Two others that mention a grandson of a member of the original Enola Gay crew flying a refurbished B-29 to honor his family have also been deleted, although their thumbnails are also still visible.\"\n\nA story earlier this week from Air & Space Forces Magazine , revealed how a pioneering female Air Force pilot saw her story erased from a DOD website. \"This morning, I discovered that USCENTCOM's story about my journey reaching 1,000 combat hours in the F-15E was removed during a recent purge of DEI history,\" said retired Lt. Col. Jennifer Cannon , a former F-15E Strike Eagle weapons systems officer, in a LinkedIn post on March 8. \"Interestingly, my story didn't focus on DEI - it was about dedication, teamwork, and supporting our ground troops[.]\"\n\n\"Efforts to divide the force - to put one group ahead of another - erode camaraderie and threaten mission execution,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote in guidance to the force on Jan. 31. \"We are proud of our warriors and their history, but we will focus on the character of their service instead of their immutable characteristics.\"\n\nTRUMP'S 'GOLDEN DOME FOR AMERICA' REKINDLES DECADESLONG DEBATE OVER MISSILE DEFENSES\n\nFOX'S GRIFFIN STRIKES AGAIN: One of the most respected members of the Pentagon press corps, known for her dogged commitment to holding public servants accountable, is once again pointing out how the Trump administration can say one thing while doing another.\n\n\"DOGE cuts at TSA hit Canine (K-9) bomb sniffing units as the White House celebrates K9 Veterans Day,\" Fox Chief National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin posted on X , along with a screen grab of guidance from TSA/Security Operations National Explosives Detection Canine Team Program that said \"all requests for everything to include vet visits, kenneling and dog food, etc.,\" have been put on hold until further guidance has been received.\n\nThat was juxtaposed with an X post from the White House showing a smiling President Trump posing with Conan the military working dog \"who fearlessly participated in the military operation that ended ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019.\"\n\n\"Happy K9 Veterans Day to all of our heroic working dogs,\" the post said.\n\nTHE RUNDOWN:\n\nWashington Examiner : Putin praises Trump over Ukraine but outlines several problems he has with possible ceasefire\n\nWashington Examiner : Russian negotiator rejects US-Ukraine ceasefire agreement\n\nWashington Examiner : Did the US intel and military support pause lead to Russia's Kursk advance?\n\nWashington Examiner : Opinion: Will Trump let Putin play him with ceasefire 'nuances' game?\n\nWashington Examiner : Editorial: Trump must now get tough with Putin\n\nWashington Examiner : Schumer caves on shutdown battle with GOP, clearing way for funding bill passage\n\nWashington Examiner : Canada warns it's 'canary in the coal mine' for Trump aggression as G7 gathers in Quebec\n\nWashington Examiner : Trump indicates change of heart for plans to relocate Palestinians out of Gaza\n\nWashington Examiner : Trump floats Canada and Greenland takeovers in meeting with NATO chief\n\nWashington Examiner : What is the Alien Enemies Act?

      "text": "Trump touts agreement after 'very good and productive' phone call with Putin, while critics say he's being played, bigly\n\nTRUMP: 'IT WAS A VERY GOOD CALL': President Donald Trump was upbeat when he spoke to the Washington Examiner's Byron York after his lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin . \"It was a very good call,\" Trump said. \"I think it's the beginning of something good.\"\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social network, Trump called the two-hour conversation \"a very good and productive one\" and announced that he had agreed on Ukraine's behalf to an immediate ceasefire on all energy and infrastructure. \"We will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine,\" he added.\n\nTrump also told York that this wasn't his first call with Putin, revealing that he had been working out details of a potential peace deal for weeks. This would appear to explain his Monday comments to reporters on Air Force One about having \"a lot of it already discussed\" and \"already talking about that, dividing up certain assets.\"\n\n\"This isn't just a call that began it. We've had other calls,\" Trump told the Washington Examiner . \"That's not been made public before.\"\n\nIn a White House readout posted on X , press secretary Karoline Levitt said the two leaders also agreed to \"technical negotiations on the implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace\" and said the negotiations \"will begin immediately in the Middle East.\"\n\nEXCLUSIVE: TRUMP REVEALS HE HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO PUTIN FOR WEEKS AS HE HAILS ENERGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT\n\nPUTIN: A LITTLE 'DA,' AND A BIG 'NYET': When it came to the U.S. proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire - which Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in Jeddah would show if Russia was \"the impediment is to peace\" - Putin was a big \"nyet.\"\n\nThe one thing he was interested in was ending Ukraine's increasingly effective drone attacks on Russian oil refineries and energy distribution networks, which are in more peril now that Ukraine has developed a home-grown cruise missile with a range of more than 1,800 miles.\n\nNotably, while Trump and White House say the ceasefire would apply to energy and infrastructure, the Kremlin readout indicated it would only apply to \"energy infrastructure,\" not other infrastructure, which would still put many civilian targets at risk, as evidenced by the direct hit by a \"Shahed\" drone on a hospital in Sumy just an hour after Putin agreed to the pause.\n\n\"Is it energy only, or is it energy and infrastructure that would be part of a 30-day ceasefire?\" Sean Hannity asked Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff , last night on Fox.\n\n\"No, it's energy and infrastructure in general,\" he responded, which appeared at odds with the Kremlin's interpretation.\n\nAccording to the Kremlin, Putin outlined a long list of demands to be met before any full ceasefire, including a requirement that Ukraine stop mobilizing fresh troops and a complete end to all Western aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said that once Putin rejected the 30-day total ceasefire proposal, Trump quickly pivoted to his backup plan: \"Donald Trump put forward a proposal for the parties to mutually refrain from strikes on energy infrastructure for 30 days. Vladimir Putin responded favorably to the proposal and immediately gave the relevant order to the Russian troops,\" the Russian readout said.\n\nRussia was clearly very pleased with Putin's handling of Trump. \"It is official now - a PERFECT call,\" Kirill Dmitriev , a top Russian official and key adviser to Putin, gloated on X .\n\n'CLASSIC KGB ROPE-A-DOPE': The general reaction from Kremlin watchers and national security experts to the \"perfect call\" was that Trump was effectively played by Putin, who gave up nothing while paying lip service to the promise of a \"peaceful\" resolution to the war.\n\n\"This is typical of Putin,\" said former Trump national security advisor retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster on Fox . \"What he's really going to try to do ... is try to get Trump and the U.S. to accept a deal that is unacceptable to the Ukrainians and then try to turn the U.S. not only against Ukraine but against Europe.\"\n\n\"Putin's call with Trump today was classic KGB rope-a-dope,\" said William Browder , head of the Global Magnitsky Justice campaign, on CNN . \"Giving Trump a nonanswer to his ceasefire proposal as Putin promises endless talks and negotiations without any intention of settling anything.\"\n\nFormer Supreme NATO Commander, retired Adm. James Stavridis , also used the rope-a-dope analogy. \"He's going to try and do everything he can to appease Donald Trump. But at the same time, he really does not want to give up what he perceives, I think correctly at the moment, is a military advantage,\" Stavridis said on CNN . \"So, what is he going to do? He'll agree to what is, frankly, a kind of a minor ceasefire, a sliver.\"\n\n\"One of the things that I really took away from the Kremlin readout was how much this is framed as two great men, who are running great powers, and our role is to have this global responsibility,\" said Beth Sanner , former deputy director of national intelligence, said on CNN where she is now an analyst. \"All of this is about rehabilitating Putin, bringing him back into the international community, and being seen at home as being very, very strong. And I think that he is actually succeeding in these ways.\"\n\n\"There is literally zero penalty for Putin saying, 'No,'\" Sanner said.\n\nGood Wednesday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre's Daily on Defense , written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre ( @jamiejmcintyre ) and edited by Christopher Tremoglie .

The air raid alarm in Ukraine - that's your answer. This is how Putin shows he doesn't want war,\" Zelensky said, according to a translation provided on X by Tymofiy Mylovanov , president of the Kyiv School of Economics. \"We support all steps toward ending the war. But to support something, we need to understand the specifics. If President Trump has time, he'll call. We're ready.\"\n\nIn Helsinki, Zelensky indicated that he hoped to talk to Trump today. \"We will discuss the details of the next steps with him,\" he said at a news conference. \"For us, the red line is the recognition of the Ukrainian temporarily occupied territories as Russian. We will not go for it,\"\n\n\"I want President Trump to see what Putin is really after - a new offensive in Zaporizhzhia, the east, Kharkiv, and Sumy. Why? To put maximum pressure on Ukraine and then dictate ultimatums from a position of strength,\" Zelensky said in video comments. \"Russia and Ukraine, with U.S. mediation, might agree not to hit energy infrastructure. But it can't be that Russia keeps striking our energy sector while we stay silent. We will respond.\"\n\nTRUMP: 'AID WAS NEVER DISCUSSED': In an interview last night on Laura Ingraham's Fox program, Trump disputed the Kremlin characterization of Putin's demand that \"a complete cessation of providing Kyiv with foreign military aid and intelligence must become the key condition for preventing an escalation of the conflict.\"\n\n\"Were there non-negotiables mentioned by Putin?\" Ingraham asked, \"Kremlin media actually stated that he demanded an immediate cessation of aid to Ukraine in order to get to this multistep deal.\"\n\n\"No, he didn't,\" Trump responded. \"We didn't talk about aid, actually. We didn't talk about aid at all. We talked about a lot of things, but aid was never discussed.\"\n\nWITKOFF: 'THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS': In his appearance on Fox last night, Steve Witkoff, Trump's point man on the negotiations with Putin, defended Trump's command of the two-hour call, which he said resulted in 'some breakthroughs.'\n\n\"I can't overstate how compelling he was on this call. He's a natural-born leader, Sean, and he demonstrated that today,\" Witkoff said. \"I think there have been some breakthroughs.\"\n\n\"I would commend President Putin for all he did today on that call to move his country close to a final peace deal,\" he added. \"And I would give all the credit to President Trump, his election, peace through strength, the perception that there are no alternatives, that a good peace, a lasting peace, a durable peace is important for both sides.\"\n\n\"I think the devil's in the details. We have got a team going to Saudi Arabia led by our national security adviser and our secretary of state,\" Witkoff said. \"And I think we have got to figure out those details. The point is that, up until recently, we really didn't have consensus around these two aspects, the energy and infrastructure ceasefire and the Black Sea moratorium on firing. And, today, we got to that place.\"\n\nTHE RUNDOWN:\n\nWashington Examiner : Trump and Putin agree to preliminary ceasefire negotiations in Middle East\n\nWashington Examiner : Exclusive: Trump reveals he has been speaking to Putin for weeks as he hails energy and infrastructure ceasefire agreement\n\nWashington Examiner : Putin manipulates Trump, gets KGB art of the ceasefire deal\n\nWashington Examiner : Trump administration warns Iran over proxies' continued behavior\n\nWashington Examiner : 20,000 civilian DOD employees accept voluntary resignation, one-third of desired cuts\n\nWashington Examiner : Hamas 'chose' war as Israel restarts military operations, White House says\n\nWashington Examiner : 'Fiscal bazooka': Bundestag approves massive spending on militarization\n\nWashington Examiner : Denver mayor erupts after ICE arrests Jeanette Vizguerra: 'Putin-style persecution'\n\nWashington Examiner : Berlin investigating multiple incidents of US detaining Germans at border\n\nWashington Examiner : Judge scolds Trump DOJ in transgender military case and downplays Hegseth's service\n\nAP : Ukrainian leader Zelensky to speak with Trump after US president's ceasefire talks with Putin\n\nReuters : US suspends some efforts to counter Russian sabotage as Trump moves closer to Putin\n\nNew York Times : Russia Escalated Sabotage to Pressure US and Allies on Ukraine, Study Says\n\nWall Street Journal : Federal Judge Blocks Trump Ban on Transgender People Serving in Military\n\nDefense News : Shipyards, Military Clinics Exempted from Pentagon Hiring Freeze\n\nAP : Canada's New Prime Minister Announces Australian Radar Purchase While Visiting Edge of Arctic Circle\n\nReuters : Radio Free Europe sues Trump administration over grant termination\n\nBreaking Defense : No, There's No 'Kill Switch': Pentagon Tries to Reassure International F-35 Partners\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine : China Practicing 'Dogfighting in Space,' US Space Force Says\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine : STRATCOM Chief: Air Force Needs 145 B-21s and More New Strategic Systems\n\nThe War Zone : F-16 Is Getting Massive Anti-Ship Missile Upgrade\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine : Allvin: Air Force Needs 'High-End Penetrating Capability' in Future Combat\n\nSpaceNews : Space Force Prepared to Divest Legacy Systems in Favor of Market-Ready Solutions\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine : Air Force Sending Teams to Make Sure Bases Are Following Executive Orders\n\nDefense One : The Army Wants AI to Take Physical Risk off of Its Soldiers\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine : F-15E Strike Eagle Crew Unhurt After Emergency Landing\n\nBBC : 'End of an Era': Last Surviving Battle of Britain Pilot Dies\n\nTHE CALENDAR:\n\nWEDNESDAY | MARCH 19\n\n12 p.m. 2000 H St. NW - George Washington University National Security Law Program and National Security Law Association discussion: \"National Security Lawyering in the Intelligence Community,\" with William Gade , deputy general counsel for intelligence, Defense Department; and Katie Kedian , visiting associate professor and GW national security, cybersecurity and foreign relations law fellow https://calendar.gwu.edu/event/national-security-lawyering\n\n2 p.m. - Washington Institute for Near East Policy virtual forum: \"Bombing Iran's Nuclear Program: Implications of Preventive Action,\" with Richard Nephew , WINEP adjunct fellow; Holly Dagres, WINEP senior fellow; and Michael Eisenstadt, WINEP senior fellow https://washingtoninstitute-org.zoom.us/webinar/register\n\n3:30 p.m. 1211 Connecticut Ave. NW - Henry L.

      "text": "Trump and Putin to talk Tuesday about ending Ukraine war\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he plans to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday to discuss a possible ending to the war in Ukraine . The planned conversation comes after U.S. and Russian officials met in Moscow to discuss the recently proposed ceasefire agreement.\n\n\"I'll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday,\" the president told reporters on Air Force One early Monday after returning from Florida. \"A lot of work's been done over the weekend. We want to see if we can bring that war to an end. Maybe we can, maybe we can't, but I think we have a very good chance.\"\n\nThe president characterized the recent discussion between Russian and U.S. officials as positive, according to Reuters . The diplomatic meeting followed last week's meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian officials.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz met with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to discuss a ceasefire proposal to end the war. Officials announced a joint statement that Ukraine was prepared to \"accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire.\"\n\n\"We're going to tell them this is what's on the table, Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking, and now it'll be up to them to say yes or no,\" Rubio said after the meeting in Saudi Arabia. \"I hope they're going to say yes. And if they do, then I think we made great progress. If they say no, then we'll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here.\"\n\nRussia reportedly previously rejected the ceasefire proposal . Putin aide Yuri Ushakov told Russian media that the proposal, in its current form, was designed to help Ukraine and went against Russian interests.\n\n\"I, naturally, commented on the agreements reached on a temporary truce and stated our position that this is nothing more than a temporary respite for the Ukrainian military, nothing more,\" Ushakov said . \"We believe that our goal is still a long-term, peaceful settlement. We are striving for this, a peaceful settlement that takes into account the legitimate interests of our side. Our concerns are known. It seems to me that no one needs such steps that imitate peaceful actions in this situation.\"\n\nWHITE HOUSE TO FIGHT RULING ORDERING TRUMP TO REHIRE FIRED FEDERAL WORKERS\n\nHowever, on Monday morning, Trump said both sides discussed concessions to reach a peace agreement. The president said the conversations involved Russia and Ukraine dividing up land and power plants and that they would continue to discuss details regarding an agreement in the immediate future, Reuters reported.\n\n\"We'll be talking about land, it's a lot of land,\" Trump said. \"It's a lot different than it was before the war, you know. And we'll be talking about power plants. You know, that's a big question, but I think we have a lot of it already discussed, very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets.\""

      "text": "Russia Not Releasing Details Of Talks With The US On Ukraine\n\nBy Charles Kennedy of OiPrice.com\n\nRussia on Tuesday said that it would not make public details of the 12 hours of talks with the U.S. on Ukraine which ended on Monday amid expectations that a joint U.S.-Russia statement would be issued shortly.\n\n\"After all, this is about technical talks,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.\n\n\"Technical - meaning the talks with getting into details so, certainly, the content of these talks will not be made public for sure. This is something that should not be expected,\" Russian news agency TASS quoted Vladimir Putin's spokesman as saying.\n\nPeskov's words raised doubts over whether any progress was made in Monday's round of talks which took place in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"Currently, the reports made [by the delegations] to their capitals are being analyzed, and only later it will be possible to speak of any understanding,\" the Russian official said.\n\nPeskov also declined to name which other countries could be involved in the talks.\n\nThe reports shared by the U.S. technical team with the Trump Administration seemed optimistic, sources with knowledge of the matter told CBS News on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S.-Russia talks were held a day after separate U.S.-Ukraine talks on Sunday, which were described as \"productive\" by Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov.\n\n\"We have concluded our meeting with the American team.\n\nThe discussion was productive and focused - we addressed key points including energy,\" Umerov posted on X on Sunday.\n\n\"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's goal is to secure a just and lasting peace for our country and our people - and, by extension, for all of Europe. We are working to make that goal a reality.\"\n\nLast week, Putin agreed to impose a 30-day suspension on attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in exchange for an identical halt of attacks on Russian infrastructure from the Ukrainian side. However, hours after the Putin-Trump call last Tuesday, Russia and Ukraine traded accusations of hits on the energy infrastructure of the other.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "White House Says 'Peace To Begin' As Putin Agrees To Halt Attacks On Ukraine's Energy Facilities For 30 Days\n\nSummary: The call readouts from both sides are out, outlining the some 90-minute 'positive' conversation between Presidents Trump and Putin. The huge 'win' for Trump diplomacy is getting his Russian counterpart's agreement to halt all aerial strikes on Ukraine's badly damaged energy infrastructure. This is a first of the war . It marks a huge victory for the White House, albeit much will be determined on Ukraine's willingness to cooperate. After all, Zelensky has been cut out of this deal-making and is in the meantime being urged on to escalate action from some quarters of Europe, particularly the UK, France, and the Baltic states. \"Both leaders agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace,\" the White House readout says. It pledges that Washington and Moscow will improve the bilateral relationship with an eye towards achieving \"enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.\"\n\n\"This conflict should never have started and should have been ended long ago with sincere and good faith peace efforts,\" the US readout emphasizes, in another swipe at the Biden administration. The Russian readout crucially acknowledges the commitment for a 30-day pause in attacks on energy infrastructure . \"During the conversation, Trump proposed a mutual agreement between both sides to refrain from striking energy infrastructure for 30 days. Putin welcomed the initiative and immediately instructed the Russian military to comply,\" it says.\n\nFurther, \"Putin also responded constructively to Trump's proposal regarding maritime security in the Black Sea, and both leaders agreed to initiate negotiations to further refine the details of such an arrangement.\" Interestingly there was mention of a possibly diplomatic hockey game between US and Russia teams. But the bulk of the Kremlin readout is very guarded, as expected:\n\nReaffirming his commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict, President Putin expressed readiness to work closely with American partners on a thorough and comprehensive settlement . He emphasized that any agreement must be sustainable and long-term, addressing the root causes of the crisis while considering Russia's legitimate security interests.\n\nRegarding President Trump's initiative for a 30-day ceasefire, the Russian side highlighted key concerns , including effective monitoring of the ceasefire across the entire front line, halting forced mobilization in Ukraine, and stopping the rearmament of its military. Russia also noted serious risks due to Kiev's history of undermining previous agreements and drew attention to terrorist attacks carried out by Ukrainian militants against civilians in the Kursk region.\n\nIt was emphasized that a crucial condition for preventing further escalation and working toward a political-diplomatic resolution is the complete cessation of foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine .\n\nGermany's Scholz has in immediate response said \"there must be no decisions\" on the war \"without Ukraine's backing\" . This coming evening and overnight will be crucial, as for the past week nighttime cross-border drone strikes on either side have been constant. Highlights of the Trump-Putin call below:\n\n* * *\n\nUpdate(1333ET) : According to the emerging call readouts, Putin and Trump held \"detailed and frank talks on Ukraine\". Both are characterizing that the call went 'very well'. But much in the readouts. The White House called for the need for peace and a ceasefire in the Ukraine war. Putin agreed to start talks to \"work something out\". But perhaps the most substantial agreement included a Putin pledge not to hit Ukraine's energy infrastructure for a period of 30-days, in an apparent nod to the US-backed interim ceasefire proposal:\n\nBut so far the plan to refrain from energy attacks is an 'idea' - suggesting that if Ukraine keeps up its own cross-border attacks on Russia, it will all be moot.\n\nWill this really take shape?\n\n* * *\n\nUpdate(1235ET) : The highly anticipated Trump-Putin call has ended, and given the length (akin to the first one), there was no doubt a lot covered, which included the prioritization of working on \"normalization\" of US-Russia ties, as earlier previewed by the White House:\n\nPHONE CALL LASTED ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF: MSNBC\n\nIt was widely reported earlier Tuesday that the US could be ready to extend to Moscow the recognition of sovereignty over the Crimean peninsula, which should be the easiest to grant. The White House has also been floating possible territorial concessions - something which Zelensky and hawkish supporters in the EU have rejected.\n\n* * *\n\nJust ahead of the high-stakes phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, Bloomberg is reporting that the Russian leader will stipulate that all weapons deliveries to Ukraine, including US and European aid, be suspended . At this very moment the European Union has been busy ramping up efforts to deliver fresh military aid packages.\n\nThis comes as no surprise, given that from the start Moscow has condemned the build-up of NATO military infrastructure in Ukraine. It will be the first call between the two since Washington advanced the 30-day ceasefire plan with an aim of achieving a lasting peace. Putin is also expected to request that Ukraine's military cannot resupply or conduct training - especially by Western military programs - during the interim truce.\n\n\"Many elements of a Final Agreement have been agreed to, but much remains,\" Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social. He stressed that the war \"must end NOW.\" Reports say the call is expected between 9am and 11am Washington time, and will include focus on \"further normalization\" - the Russian side indicated.\n\nTrump's prior mention of \"dividing up certain assets\" was cause for much speculation on Monday, with much of the commentary focused on the likely question of control over Ukraine's nuclear power plants.\n\nAccording to the latest from Bloomberg :\n\nAnd: As of 8:00am S&P futures are down 0.3%, losing ground after Bloomberg reported Russian President Vladimir Putin is demanding a suspension of all weapons deliveries to Ukraine...\n\nThere are also reports saying that the US is mulling recognizing Crimea as part of Russia , and that it may urge the Untied Nations to do the same. This could be an 'easy' one for the US, which is likely to entice Putin.\n\nTrump had continued in his Monday social media post, \"I look very much forward to the call with President Putin. Many elements of a Final Agreement have been agreed to, but much remains.\"\n\nAnd Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that the two leaders will discuss \"a large number of issues from the normalization of our relations and the Ukrainian issue.\" He said, \"The leaders will speak for as long as they deem necessary \" - after their first phone call had lasted 90-minutes.\n\nEU leaders are said to be \"trembling\"... \"That is why there is a mood of alarm in Europe's capitals,\" Bild wrote Tuesday. This also as Trump has floated the possibility of dropping anti-Russia sanctions for the sake of peace.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

The conversation occurred just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reached out to President Donald Trump, requesting a meeting to secure a mineral deal amid increasing prospects for a peace deal.\n\nBloomberg cited state broadcaster China Central Television, which said that Xi and Putin spoke via telephone on Monday afternoon \"at the request of the latter.\"\n\nCCTV quoted Xi as saying that China and Russia share a \"unique strategic value\" that is \"not aimed at any third party or influenced by any third party.\"\n\nRecall that China and Russia formed a \"no limits\" partnership in the days before Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Xi considers Putin an \"ally,\" and the two have met dozens of times over the past decade.\n\nThe call comes one day after Zelensky spoke at a forum in Kyiv about Ukraine's future. He called for Trump to solidify a mineral deal with his country. The Ukrainian president would step down if a peace deal materializes or his country is accepted into NATO.\n\nZelensky also demanded that Trump visit Kyiv first before meeting with Putin. If Trump were to meet with Putin first, Zelensky cautioned, \"there would be disbelief in the United States... It would be bad for US society.\"\n\nWith preparations underway for a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin, this would mark a massive shift from warmongering Western officials who have attempted to isolate Moscow from the world's global economy over its invasion of Ukraine. And these officials were hellbent on sparking World War III.\n\n\"The question is about starting to move toward normalizing relations between our countries , finding ways to resolve the most acute and potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many, Ukraine among them,\" Russia's deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters on Saturday.\n\nBloomberg noted, \" The readout of Monday's call said Beijing was happy to see the efforts made by Moscow to resolve the war in Ukraine .\"\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters over the weekend that Beijing would welcome direct communications between Putin and Trump and that the \"window for peace is opening up.\"\n\nThe \"no limits\" partnership between China and Russia remains a significant concern for the West, as the Biden-Harris regime's weak foreign policy only pushed the two great powers closer, economically and militarily.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Trump Affirms He'll Meet Putin 'Very Quickly' After Inauguration\n\nUS President-elect Donald Trump has unveiled plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin \"very quickly\" after being sworn in on January 20, he said in a Monday interview. He was interviewed by conservative news outlet Newsmax and was asked about specifics on his strategy to end the Ukraine war, to which Trump replied \"there is only one strategy, and it's up to Putin.\"\n\nTrump explained, \"I can't imagine he's too thrilled with the way it's gone, because it hasn't gone exactly well for him either .\"\n\n\"I know he [Putin] wants to meet, and I'm going to meet very quickly,\" the president-elect said. \"I would have done it sooner, but... you have to get into the office.\" These words came the day after Trump's incoming national security adviser, Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), told ABC News that \"the preparations are underway\" for a meeting between Trump and the Russian leader.\n\n\"I do expect a call ... at least in the coming days and weeks,\" Waltz said. \"So, that would be a step, and we'll take it from there.\"\n\nVarious reports in the last weeks have made clear that meeting with Putin and seeking a breakthrough toward Ukraine peace is Trump's biggest foreign policy priority at this point, though his eye is still on China as a top priority too :\n\nTrump noted at the time he's had \"a lot of communication\" with Chinese President Xi Jinping and has spoken with numerous other world leaders. But he has yet to speak with Putin.\n\n\"But President Putin wants to meet. He's said that even publicly, and we have to get that war over with. That's a bloody mess,\" Trump said of the war in Ukraine.\n\nKremlin statements issued in the past days have reaffirmed openness to such a meeting, \"but that any concrete steps to set up such talks could be made only once Mr. Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20,\" The New York Times recently noted.\n\n\"We need a mutual desire and political willingness to engage in a dialogue,\" Putin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told reporters last Friday. \"We see that Mr. Trump also declares his readiness to solve issues via dialogue. We welcome that.\"\n\nPeskov added that Russia's understanding is that there is a \"mutual readiness for a meeting\" but that \"it looks like things will start to move after Trump enters the Oval Office.\"\n\nPrior reporting on the 'Trump peace plan' suggests that the US side will offer Ukraine a twenty-year waiting period before it can hope to join NATO; however, Moscow has rejected even this possibility as a non-starter.\n\nWithout doubt, Moscow sees itself in the driver's seat - even as Ukraine tries to inflict as much damage as possible through drone and missile strikes on Russian territory. Russian forces have made weeks of rapid gains in the Donetsk, including having captured another key industrial town just this past week.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Trump Says He Has Spoken Directly To Putin About Ending War In Ukraine\n\nAuthored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times,\n\nPresident Donald Trump said this weekend that he spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the Russia-Ukraine war, drawing a response from the Kremlin.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Post in an exclusive interview on Air Force Once, Trump said that he did speak with the Russian leader about the war, which started in 2022. Asked about how many times he's spoken to Putin in recent days, Trump said, \"I'd rather not say.\"\n\nHowever, Trump said he believes Putin \"does care\" about the carnage on the battlefield and \"wants to see people stop dying.\"\n\n\"All those dead people. Young, young, beautiful people. They're like your kids, two million of them-and for no reason,\" Trump said, referring to soldiers dying in the war, adding that the conflict \"never would have happened\" if he was president in 2022.\n\nElaborating, but without providing many details, Trump said that he has a plan to end the war and added that he has a good relationship with Putin.\n\n\"I hope it's fast,\" he said.\n\n\"Every day people are dying. This war is so bad in Ukraine. I want to end this damn thing.\"\n\nLongtime Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the TASS state news agency that \"many different communications are emerging\" between Moscow and Washington, according to a Russian-to-English translation.\n\n\"These communications are conducted through different channels,\" Peskov said when asked by TASS to comment directly on Trump's interview with the Post.\n\n\"I personally may not know something, be unaware of something. Therefore, in this case, I can neither confirm nor deny it.\"\n\nIn February 2022, Putin sent thousands of troops, tanks, and other military hardware to Ukraine as part of a \"special military operation\" for what he said was an attempt to end a possible threat to Russian sovereignty by Ukrainian forces backed by NATO. He also has said that Russia wants to protect Russian speakers living in Ukraine.\n\nBut Ukraine and its Western backers, led by the Biden administration, have said the invasion was an imperial-style land grab and vowed to defeat Russian forces. Moscow controls a chunk of Ukraine about the size of the American state of Virginia and is advancing at the fastest pace since the early days of the 2022 invasion.\n\nBefore taking office in January, Trump has said that he wants to quickly end the war, at several points saying he would end it within 24 hours of taking office.\n\nOn Feb. 7, Trump said he would probably meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy next week to discuss ending the war. Zelenskyy told Reuters on the same day that he wanted Ukraine to supply the United States with rare earths and other minerals in return for continued financial support its war effort.\n\n\"If we are talking about a deal, then let's do a deal, we are only for it,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Let's develop this together, make money, and most importantly, it's about the security of the Western world.\"\n\nBut Zelenskyy cautioned that Trump must meet with him before he meets with Putin on ending the war. The reason, he said, is because meeting with Putin first would \"look like a dialogue about Ukraine without Ukraine.\"\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

A lot of work's been done over the weekend,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One while en route back from Florida to Washington.\n\n\"We want to see if we can bring that war to an end.

      "text": "Can Vladimir Putin Be Negotiated With?\n\nVia The Libertarian Institute\n\nAs President Donald Trump attempts to engage with Russia to end the conflict in Ukraine, supporters of the proxy war in Washington, Europe, and Ukraine claim that President Vladimir Putin is an evil dictator who cannot be trusted . The implication is that talking with the Kremlin is equivalent to surrender for Kiev because Putin wants all of Ukraine, and will use any pause in fighting to gear up for the next invasion.\n\nHowever, history disproves that assertion . For Moscow, the war was never about seizing Ukrainian territory or attempting to reconstitute the USSR, but pushing back on NATO expansion after the bloc threatened to add Kiev as a member.\n\nBefore the invasion and in the early months of the war, Putin made serious offers to both Washington and Kiev to allow eastern and southern Ukraine to remain under Kiev's control if the country agreed not to join NATO .\n\nThe Joe Biden administration outright refused to negotiate on those terms, even if they were acceptable to Kiev. Preventing those talks from occurring first provoked the Russian invasion, then prevented it from ending within a few months.\n\nAs Scott Horton explains in the following excerpt from his latest book, Provoked: How Washington Started the New Cold War with Russia and the Catastrophe in Ukraine , there were talks in Istanbul, Turkey that nearly ended with conflict within two months.\n\nA Ukrainian negotiator explained the dialogue was \"completely successful\" and could have allowed the war to come to an end by April 2022 . But Western leaders like then-United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not want peace, and pressed Kiev to fight.\n\nYou can own a signed copy of Provoked by making a contribution to The Libertarian Institute's fundraiser .\n\n* * *\n\nUS, UK Prevent Peace\n\nEarly indications that Russia and Ukraine could achieve a quick negotiated solution soon gave way to the reality that the Biden administration was instead determined to drag out the war to \"weaken Russia.\"\n\nOne day after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, State Department spokesman Ned Price was asked about the proposed terms to begin negotiations. Though an innocent third person might have assumed that achieving a ceasefire and early end to the fighting would be the highest priority, Price made it clear this was not the case with the American administration. \"Those are not the conditions for real diplomacy,\" he said .\n\nAs Secretary Blinken confirmed in October 2022, the only time he had spoken to Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov since February 15, 2022, nine days before the invasion, was over the release of the basketball player Brittney Griner, who had been convicted of bringing a THC vape pen into the country . Otherwise, the policy was \" Do not engage .\"\n\nTwo days after the war began, Zelensky said he wanted to negotiate. \"We are not afraid to talk to Russia. We are not afraid to say everything about security guarantees for our state. We are not afraid to talk about neutral status. We are not in NATO now.\" But he said the main question was \"what security guarantees will we have? And what specific countries will give them? We need to talk about the end of this invasion. We need to talk about a ceasefire .\"\n\nBelarus Talks\n\nThe two sides met in Gomel, Belarus on February 28. Though they did not make a deal, they departed on positive terms and agreed to talk again on March 3 . Early attempts at negotiation by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Turkish President Recep Erdogan, though they showed some promise , went nowhere without American interest or support. The Financial Times reported on March 16 that negotiators had \"made significant progress\" on a ceasefire deal, based on a Russian withdrawal in exchange for neutrality and limits on the size of Ukraine's armed forces. They said Lavrov had also told them they were very close to a deal .\n\nBennett\n\nBoth sides trusted former Prime Minister Bennett, so at the same time their agents were meeting in Belarus, Putin and Zelensky were communicating through him, outlining the major points of the ceasefire. As Bennett later explained in an interview, Putin promised not to kill Zelensky and dropped his demand for the \"disarmament of Ukraine.\" In return, Zelensky vowed to drop his attempts to join NATO. Instead, they agreed on something they called the \"Israeli model,\" which would keep Ukraine outside of NATO, but well-armed enough to guarantee its own independence. \"I had the impression at the time that both sides were very interested in a ceasefire,\" Bennett said . But the Americans decided to \"crush Putin rather than to negotiate.\" The former PM did not seem to disagree with the policy, but was just being honest about it. \"I think there was a decision by the west (a legitimate one) that right now what's needed is to keep hitting Putin and not to reach a ceasefire. ... I'll tell you what - I'm not sure they were mistaken.\" He said he was merely \"acting as an intermediary,\" adding, \"Everything I did was coordinated to the smallest detail not just with the U.S. but also Germany and France.\"\n\nWhen asked if the U.S. stopped the negotiations, Bennett replied, \"Yes, basically they stopped it and at the time I thought they were making a mistake.\" He continued, \"[T]here's a not-too-bad chance they could have reached [an agreement] if they didn't stop it. Not for sure. But I'm not arguing that it was correct to try. In real time I thought it was correct to reach a ceasefire - now I don't know .\"\n\nThough Bennett later tried to walk back his claims, saying there was only a 50 percent chance of making a deal at the time, it is obvious he was being honest the first time and trying to get out of trouble for it .\n\nFiona Spills\n\nIt was only later we found out that was exactly what had happened: both the Ukrainians and Russians had been prepared to make serious concessions to bring the war to an early end .  The diplomats had ironed out a few differences, and it was time for the presidents to meet to make the bigger decisions. Fiona Hill confirmed in Foreign Affairs in the fall of 2022 that they had been on the verge of a deal, citing former U.S. officials. \"In April 2022, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators appeared to have tentatively agreed on the outlines of a negotiated interim settlement,\" she explained. \"Russia would withdraw to its position on February 23, when it controlled part of the Donbas region and all of Crimea, and in exchange, Ukraine would promise not to seek NATO membership and instead receive security guarantees from a number of countries .\"\n\nNay No Ned\n\nOn March 21, State Department spokesman Price shot down a question about the peace talks, saying the president had \"made it very clear that he is open to a diplomatic solution that does not compromise the core principles at the heart of the Kremlin's war against Ukraine.\" He elaborated, \"[T]his is a war that is in many ways bigger than Russia, it's bigger than Ukraine.\" This was about the whole world order. \"[T]here are principles that are at stake here that have universal applicability everywhere, [including] the principle that each and every country has a sovereign right ... to determine for itself with whom it will choose to associate in terms of its alliances.\"\n\nThe reporter got his drift. \"But does that mean that if under pressure of negotiation and war, that Zelensky gives up the previous desire to join NATO ... that the U.S. wouldn't go along with ... a negotiated agreement?\" Price refused to answer .\n\nAt that time, Kiev was in a better position to negotiate than at any point after. And by the end of March, Zelensky was signaling that he was willing to make major concessions to achieve an early end to the war . As Anchal Vohra wrote in Foreign Policy, \"These include a commitment to Ukrainian neutrality with respect to military alliances, a rejection of any nuclear arsenal, and an acceptance of Russian control over Ukraine's eastern regions.\" She said, \"He even indicated a readiness to change language policies that had disadvantaged Russian speakers. Zelensky's announcements gave the face-to-face talks convening this week in Istanbul some hope of a ceasefire .\"\n\nWhen White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked what the U.S. was doing to encourage diplomacy, she responded only that \"[t]he role that we feel we can play most effectively is by continuing to provide a broad range of security assistance, military assistance to them as well as economic and humanitarian assistance to strengthen their hand in these negotiations .\"\n\nTurkey\n\nOn March 29, the parties convened in Istanbul, where they issued the Istanbul Communiqué based on Ukraine's proposals. The key concession from the Ukrainian side was an offer of \"permanent\" neutrality, to refrain from developing nuclear weapons, recognize de facto Russian sovereignty over Crimea, punt on the question of the future of the Donbas and promise not to host any foreign forces on their soil. In exchange they would receive security guarantees from Western nations and Russia, including a promise to be allowed to join the EU . These represented major concessions by Russia compared to its attempt to sack the Ukrainian capital and achieve regime change just weeks before . For their part, \"Russian negotiators said they would look into these proposals while Russia [would] 'drastically reduce' military activity near the cities of Chernihiv and Kyiv 'to increase mutual trust and create the necessary conditions for further negotiations .'\"\n\nAlexey Arestovich\n\nThen-Zelensky adviser Alexey Arestovich, the same man who had seemed to predict the war and accept its inevitability three years before, later said that the talks had been \"completely successful.\" Having participated in the Istanbul negotiations, he explained that \"it was the most profitable agreement we could have done. ... We opened the champagne bottle. We had discussed demilitarization, denazification, issues concerning the Russian language, Russian church and much else.\" He continued, \"And that month, it was the question of the amount of Ukrainian armed forces in peacetime, and President Zelensky said, 'I could decide this question indirectly with Mr. Putin.'\" Arestovich added, \"The Istanbul agreements were a protocol of intentions and was 90 percent prepared for directly meeting with Putin. That was to be the next step of negotiations .\"\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nBut then UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson came to town with an offer of weapons and a message from the Biden administration: now was not the time to negotiate. They should instead increase the pressure on Putin. If Ukraine made a deal with Russia, they could not count on U.S. and UK support. So the talks were canceled. This tragic tale was told in extensive reporting by Ukrainska Pravda - a paper with a similar name but no ties to the Russian publication. In fact, it is owned by Dragon Capital , in a fund managed by Soros Fund Management LLC , and has a strong pro-Kiev slant. They said Johnson \"appeared in the capital almost without warning\" with two messages from Biden. The first was, \"Putin should be pressured, not negotiated with,\" and the second was that \"even if Ukraine is ready to sign some agreements on guarantees with Putin, they are not.\" Then they got right to the heart of the issue: \"[T]he collective West ... now felt that Putin was not really as powerful as they had previously imagined, and that here was a chance to 'press him .'\"\n\nAs Michael von der Schulenburg, a former UN assistant secretary-general, later explained: \"As late as 27 March 2022, Zelensky had shown the courage to defend the preliminary results of the Ukrainian-Russian peace negotiations in public in front of Russian journalists - despite the fact that NATO had by then already decided at its special summit on 24 March 2022 ... to oppose these peace negotiations. In the end, Zelensky gave in to NATO pressures and opted for a continuation of the war .\"\n\nLavrov later said that after a workable proposal was on the table, in mid-April the Ukrainians simply broke off talks . Putin complained that after Istanbul, \"Kyiv representatives voiced quite a positive response to our proposals. These proposals concerned above all ensuring Russia's security and interests. But a peaceful settlement obviously did not suit the West, which is why, after certain compromises were coordinated, Kyiv was actually ordered to wreck all these agreements .\" He was obviously being a major hypocrite in saying this, since he was surely playing his own role in the conflict. But he was not wrong.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Putin Invites Trump To Visit Moscow In 'Highly Productive' Call, Ready For Peace\n\nUpdate(1330ET) : Just on the heels of the historic Putin call, President Trump has revealed an outline of his call with Ukraine's President Zelensky, calling it a \"meaningful conversation\". He had earlier vowed to inform Zelensky of the contents of the Putin phone call, at a moment European allies are stressing that there can be no peace deal without Ukraine's direct input and participation.\n\nTrump has pledged that talks to end the war will start immediately. Wednesday marks the first known conversation between Trump and Putin since the new US president entered office last month.\n\n* * *\n\nUS President Trump and Russian President Putin held a nearly hour-and-a-half call this morning which the US president described as \"lengthy and highly productive.\"\n\nTrump said on Truth Social that both leaders had extended invitations of \"visiting each other's nations,\" while, the US leader said he would be calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"right now\" to inform him about the call.\n\nPresident Trump took to his Truth Social account to explain what was discussed (emphasis ours):\n\nI just had a lengthy and highly productive phone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia.\n\nWe discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects. We both reflected on the Great History of our Nations, and the fact that we fought so successfully together in World War II, remembering, that Russia lost tens of millions of people, and we, likewise, lost so many!\n\nWe each talked about the strengths of our respective Nations, and the great benefit that we will someday have in working together.\n\nBut first, as we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.\n\nPresident Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, \" COMMON SENSE .\"\n\nWe both believe very strongly in it. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other's Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now .\n\nI have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful.\n\nMillions of people have died in a War that would not have happened if I were President, but it did happen, so it must end.\n\nNo more lives should be lost!\n\nI want to thank President Putin for his time and effort with respect to this call, and for the release, yesterday, of Marc Fogel, a wonderful man that I personally greeted last night at the White House.\n\nI believe this effort will lead to a successful conclusion, hopefully soon!\n\nMost significantly, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has announced immediately on the heels of Trump's statement that President Putin has invited Trump for an official state visit to Moscow .\n\nBelow are breaking newswire headlines from the Russian side:\n\nPUTIN INVITES TRUMP TO VISIT MOSCOW DURING PHONE CALL, EXPRESSES READINESS TO RECEIVE U.S. OFFICIALS IN RUSSIA - PESKOV\n\nPUTIN SPOKE OF NEED TO ELIMINATE ROOT CAUSES OF UKRAINE CONFLICT IN PHONE CALL WITH TRUMP, AGREED THAT LASTING SETTLEMENT\n\nPESKOV: TRUMP ASSURES PUTIN THAT U.S. FULFILLING ALL AGREEMENTS REACHED WITH REGARD TO SWAP OF RUSSIAN, U.S. CITIZENS\n\nJust the night prior, American school teacher Marc Fogel arrived in Washington, fresh out of a 3+ year stint in Russian prison, after a successful prisoner exchange. Walz has declared this an act of good faith from Putin. What's clear is that things are moving fast .\n\nUkraine dollar bonds are rallying on news of the call, and have seen price rise dramatically since the restructuring last year - and since Trump was elected....\n\nSo it seems the market is growing more optimistic now that peace is close .\n\nPolymarket's odds of Trump ending the war within 90 days are also rising...\n\nAt the same time, Pete Hegseth is in Brussels and has declared that NATO membership for Ukraine is off the table .\n\n* * *\n\nGeopolitical observer Arnaud Bertrand writes...\n\nThis is a monumental shift : the U.S. finally renounces NATO membership for Ukraine after 17 years of trying...

      "text": "Mike Waltz Asked If Putin Is Playing Trump: 'Almost Laughable'\n\nUS national security adviser Mike Waltz laughed off a question posed by a Fox News host on Sunday. Show host Jacqui Heinrich asked him whether President Trump is \"being played\" by Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\n\" That's almost laughable. I'll take President Trump in dealing with the likes of Xi Jinping, ...Kim Jong Un, Putin, and others - certainly ahead of his predecessor,\" Walz responded to the question.\n\nCurrently the US-backed 30-day Ukraine war ceasefire proposal appears stalled, but Trump and Putin will hold a key phone call on Tuesday. Putin has said any temporary ceasefire would only allow Ukraine to rearm, resupply and regroup its forces.\n\n\"And really, as both President Putin and Zelenskyy said on our first call just a few weeks ago, only President Trump could drive this to an end . We know who we're dealing with on all sides,\" Waltz continued.\n\n\"And we are going to engage in diplomacy. We are engaging in diplomacy,\" the top Trump adviser said. \"And that will involve both carrots and sticks to get both sides to the table, but to also resolve this in a way that is permanent and enduring,\" he said.\n\nThe question from the Fox host was motivated at least in part from recent Washington Post reporting which claims Russian intelligence is seeking ways to sabotage the Washington-European Union relationship.\n\n\"Russia should work to weaken the U.S. negotiating position on Ukraine by stoking tensions between the Trump administration and other countries while pushing ahead with Moscow's efforts to dismantle the Ukrainian state, according to a document prepared for the Kremlin,\" WaPo wrote last week.\n\nThe report continued:\n\nThe document, written in February by an influential Moscow-based think tank close to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), lays out Russia's maximalist demands for any end to the conflict in Ukraine. It dismisses President Donald Trump's preliminary plans for a peace deal within 100 days as \"impossible to realize\" and says that \"a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis cannot happen before 2026.\"\n\nCurrently European leaders, particularly the UK's Kier Starmer and France's Emmanuel Macron, are pursuing alternate plans to back Ukraine quite apart from the Trump White House.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry has meanwhile indicated that Moscow will demand Kiev's neutral status and that NATO can never accept Ukraine for membership.\n\n\"Almost laughable\" ...\n\nThis is Great!

Of course, this is to include a ban on NATO building up military infrastructure in Ukraine as well.\n\nBut other Western allies are challenging the progress made, and are likely even trying to sabotage any potential deal. \"If Ukraine requests allied forces to be on its territory, it is not up to Russia to accept or reject them,\" French President Emmanuel Macron has said.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Russian Self-Destruction Helps America Putin has gone from a flirtation with free-market capitalism to increasingly authoritarian kleptomania.\n\nT he news from Moscow is that Russia is likely to abandon the 13 percent flat-rate income tax enacted in 2000, not long after a group of visiting conservative/libertarian American economists, including me, advised newly installed President Vladimir Putin to dramatically lower the country's income tax. As I pointed out in this space last year, Russian economic growth flourished (over 7 percent annual economic growth) in Putin's first two terms after the flat tax was adopted. Income tax revenues actually increased sharply, as transactions in the vast underground economy dramatically declined as individuals felt they could afford to be honest since the new tax burden was not oppressive. It is the Laffer Curve at work - tax rates fall, so economic activity dramatically expands, increasing tax revenues.\n\nPutin's predicament has been eased by incredibly inept policies by his adversaries, especially the United States.\n\nYet Russia is now suffering from fiscal strain. Its cash and gold reserves are small and declining. Trying to compete with much bigger nations economically, like the U.S. and China, is straining the economy, particularly given Russia's territorial ambitions. Some things never change in Russia -Putin is Ivan the Terrible (1553-1584) without the charisma. The war with Ukraine is taking longer than expected and creating a drain on young productive human resources that Russia can ill afford, since an extremely low birth rate is producing relatively few war-worthy young men.\n\nIncreasingly desperate for revenues, Putin apparently now is contemplating a progressive income tax. The American experience: The original 1913 tax had a single digit top rate (7 percent), but within a few years the maximum rate hit 77 percent, and it has never fallen below 25 percent since. History suggests that, like virginity, once lost, flat-rate or zero income taxation is usually gone forever. And this is very good news for America, Russia's top adversary. (READ MORE from Richard K. Vedder: Malthus Reversed: The Birth Dearth and Our Future )\n\nThe experience of the 50 American states is instructive. Looking at Census Bureau estimates of population change from 2020 to 2023, we see enormous domestic migration into the nine U.S. states with the ultimate flat-rate state income tax - a zero rate. Some 1,818,421 persons net moved into those states from states with income taxes. Looking at the six states with top personal tax rates of 9 percent or higher (California, Hawaii, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Oregon), every single one had a net out-flow of migrants, totaling an extraordinary 2,362,181. One of the great out-migrations in human history is occurring unpublicized by our woke media.\n\nInterestingly, tropical paradise Hawaii with extremely high taxes had a net out -migration of over 40,000 , while distinctly more frigid South Dakota gained nearly 20,000. Also, the 12 states with positive flat rates collectively had net in-migration from progressive rate states. Flat rates are loved, especially zero rates.\n\nRussia's 2000 flat tax followed the policy initiatives of Prime Minister Mart Laar of Estonia as well as other Baltic states, all of whom have flourished relative to Russia and old large Western welfare states like France and Germany. And then there is Ireland, which used low flat-rate corporate income tax policies to trigger a massive income growth that is the envy of Europe.\n\nIf Russians are like Americans, I would expect their move away from flat-rate to progressive taxes will prove quite unpopular. At the margin, will it by itself lead to revolt against a long reigning dictator who has gone from desperately flirting with free-market capitalism (Putin I, 2000-2008) to increasingly authoritarian kleptomania (Putin II, 2013-2024), trying to ignore market forces and human nature? Probably not. But in conjunction with other outrages, it might shorten Putin's already too long political life expectancy.\n\nPutin's predicament has been eased by incredibly inept policies by his adversaries, especially the United States, whose anti-fossil-fuel policies in the Biden era helped Russia maximize foreign exchange earnings, and whose comparative neglect of national defense encourages Russian adventurism. But as Putin ages and Russia's population and economy stagnate, the current regime's days are numbered.\n\nRichard Vedder is Distinguished Professor of Economics Emeritus at Ohio University and Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

No man, no problem.\" So declared Joseph Stalin, the murderous tyrant whose own death arrived on March 5, 1953, five months after the birth of Vladimir Putin. Stalin's death solved a great problem for his vast nation's countless suffering citizens. His ultimate successor, Nikita Khrushchev, would denounce old \"Uncle Joe\" (as Franklin D. Roosevelt called him) in his crucial February 1956 \"Crimes of Stalin\" speech.\n\nREAD MORE from Paul Kengor: Russian Dissident Alexei Navalny Dies in Brutal Arctic Gulag\n\nSpeaking of crimes, it's difficult to find a worst criminal in today's Russia than Vladimir Putin. Putin clearly subscribes to Stalin's death recipe. Back in July, he had his old friend, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner Group leader who led a rebellion against him, blown out of the sky with a conveniently timed airplane explosion. Two weeks ago, he had his main political rival, Alexei Navalny , eliminated in a Siberian gulag.\n\nDeath solves all problems. No man, no problem.\n\nOne person who doesn't feel so glib about death is Yulia Navalnaya, Alexei's widow and the mother of his two children.\n\nLast week, both Yulia and Alexei's own mother received reports that their loved one's corpse showed significant \" signs of bruising,\" even as Kremlin officials told them that he had died of something called \"sudden death syndrome.\" They insisted that Alexei's body cannot be sent home until an \"official investigation\" is completed, one of an unknown duration.\n\nHow Stalin-esque. How Putin-esque.\n\nYulia is, of course, outraged. She accuses Putin of being downright \"demonic \" in his mistreatment of her husband. Choice words indeed. Her words ought to be a wake-up call to the weird American Putinists who find reasons to defend and sometimes even praise the despot. Among their reasons, they see Putin as a faithful Russian traditionalist and Christian. (For the record, Stalin had once attended seminary.)\n\nFrom Yulia's vantage, however, she discerns quite the opposite. \"We already knew that Putin's faith was fake, but now we see it more clearly than ever before,\" said Yulia . \"No true Christian could ever do what Putin is now doing with Alexei's body.\"\n\nThat and then some. Putin is refusing Navalny anything but a decent burial. He wants no one to see that corpse.\n\n\"Give us back the body of my husband,\" Yulia pleads the dictator in a videotaped message on YouTube. \"We want to hold a funeral service and bury him in a humane way, in the ground, as is customary in Orthodox Christianity.\"\n\nIn an interesting juxtaposition, Yulia notes that her husband actually was a devout Christian whose faith inspired his views and his courage. He not only went to church, but in the gulag, he was actually fasting during the Lenten season. Yes, even while in prison.\n\nAlexei Navalny made sacrifices. Putin, in turn, sacrificed Alexei.\n\nBut more to the point, Alexei Navalny's elimination helps Mad Dog Putin solve another problem, namely, that Navalny no longer exists to challenge Vlad's next presidential election this coming March.\n\nAnd that election is the next key episode to watch closely in the deadly authoritarian rule of Vladimir Putin, which has taken the following winding road.\n\nOn Dec. 31, 1999, Boris Yeltsin, Russia's first freely elected president ever in the country's long history, announced that he was resigning the presidency, which at that point in his two terms had only several months remaining. Yeltsin was worn out. He turned over the reins to his prime minister, Vladimir Putin.\n\nPutin then duly stood for election in March 2000. He won easily and fairly. Four years later, he won handily again and, at that point, was a popular president. Putin liked the job so much that he found a way after March 2008 to exceed the two four-year term limits on the president. First, he became prime minister to his handpicked puppet presidential successor, Dimitri Medvedev, the one to whom President Barack Obama pledged his \" flexibility \" after the November 2012 election - that is, the flexibility to backstab our NATO allies Poland and Czechoslovakia on joint missile defense. \"Very good,\" replied a pleased Medvedev in an open-mic moment to Obama. \"I tell Vladimir.\"\n\nSoon enough, Putin schemed a way to return himself to the presidency and ensconce himself as dictator. Furthermore, in 2020 and 2021, through a referendum and a new Russian law, he created a way to allow himself to run for two more presidential terms - this time, six-year terms - potentially extending his rule into 2030 and even up to 2036.\n\nNews alert to Putin's strange American defenders on the right: According to the original Russian democratic constitution, which the post-communist nation had fought so hard to secure, former KGB Lt. Col. Vladimir Putin's reign should have ended in 2008. It's now up to 2024 and will continue as long as the now-71-year-old desires to stay in power.\n\nThe next two elections (read: rubber-stamp coronations) for Putin will occur in 2024 and 2030. The first will take place this March from the 15th to the 17th. That's only two weeks away.\n\nAnd you can bet a billion rubles that Vladimir Putin will win. To quote another line from Stalin , it isn't the votes that count, but he \"who will count the votes.\"\n\nWhen Alexei Navalny was alive, Putin had a viable, popular competitor, even as Navalny had no chance in a rigged game. But now with Navalny altogether eliminated, Putin will run virtually uncontested. Should anyone emerge as Vlad's new challenger, he might want to bow out right away or get himself a food-taster or flunky to start his car every morning.\n\nAfter all, death solves all problems. No man, no problem.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit... Read More\n\nIt's been a busy few weeks for Bernie Sanders, traveling...

      "text": "When Putin Got Into Reaganomics For a time, he implemented serious tax reform, an American adviser to Putin recalls.\n\nU narguably, the war in Ukraine is the result of the machinations of Vladimir Putin, who has been the clear leader of Russia for nearly 23 years. Yet, as one who had a rather unique (for an American) association with Putin at the beginning of his presidency, I would argue that the Putin of today is behaving quite differently than the way he did at the start of his rule. There is a Putin I and a Putin II.\n\nThat said, I think the Russian leader's zeitgeist has not fundamentally changed. Both Putin I and Putin II have been typical Russian leaders: fierce Russian patriots who, like virtually every predecessor dating back to at least Ivan the Terrible (1533-1584), have believed that Russia needs to expand its role on the European (if not the world) stage and overcome the derision that allegedly more civilized Europeans have showed toward it, thus gaining new respect and becoming a world power. As now-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu concluded (based on a 2001 meeting with the Russian president), \"Putin was smart and shrewd and totally committed to restoring Russia's standing as a great power.\" Indeed, I find it richly ironic that, before Napoleon and Hitler, arguably the last foreign government to seriously threaten Russia was that of Sweden. Russia's defeat of Sweden in 1709 at the Battle of Poltava - in central Ukraine - more than any other event heralded Russia's rise to great-power status. Might Ukraine be playing a role now in Russia losing that status?\n\nWhen this century began on Jan. 1, 2000, Russia was in pretty bad shape. Literally the day before, Dec. 31, 1999, Vladimir Putin became the acting president of the Russian Federation, replacing Boris Yeltsin. Estimates of output change are notoriously unreliable for nations like Russia, which moved from a centrally planned to a more market-oriented regime, so some estimates of about a one-third decline in output in the first eight years after the demise of the old Soviet Union at the end of 1991 are probably exaggerated, but clearly the transition from communism had gone poorly under Yeltsin. A new breed of politically well-connected oligarchs in the 1990s seized control of previously state-owned assets, culminating in a horrendous financial crisis in 1998 in which Russia defaulted on its debt and was forced to devalue its currency, the ruble.\n\nYet times changed dramatically in the first two terms of Putin's presidency, or Putin I, from early 2000 to 2008. The World Bank tells us that the country's gross domestic product rose 74 percent, a compounded annual growth rate of 7.2 percent per year. Russia, no longer burdened by the inefficiencies of communism, belatedly began to show significant convergence with Western Europe and the U.S. as it increasingly embraced the advantages of free-market capitalism.\n\nBut the \"Russian economic miracle\" that seemed so promising in Putin's early years has dramatically stalled. The era of Putin II probably formally started with Putin's third term in office, which began in 2012. (From 2008 to 2012, Putin was constitutionally demoted to prime minister, although even in that period, he was the country's most powerful leader.) Economic performance during Putin II looks altogether different. Looking at the last six pre-COVID pandemic years of 2014 to 2019, for example, the World Bank estimates that Russia's gross domestic product rose an anemic 1 percent per year - far less than it did in booming neighbors and former Soviet satellites such as Poland ( 4.2 percent ) or Estonia ( 3.7 percent ), not to mention such Western rivals as the U.S. ( 2.5 percent ), Germany ( 1.8 percent ), or France ( 1.5 percent ), or booming Asian nations like China and India.\n\nPutin was formally elected president of Russia on March 26, 2000. A few days later, I received a phone call asking if I would like to join a small group of other economists in advising the Russian government on how to reform and revitalize its economy. I was an economic historian with a public policy orientation and interested in the process of economic change generally and specifically in Russia, which I had visited on multiple occasions dating back to 1970 and about whose economic history I taught students at Ohio University. A bit over two weeks later, I was in Moscow, joined by four others: a former president of the American Economic Association and prominent University of California Los Angeles and University of Chicago economist, Arnold \"Al\" Harberger; Florida State University economics professor James Gwartney; Jim Carter, a young staff person who had worked at the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee (JEC), and Peruvian economist and former finance minister, the late Carlos Boloña .\n\nIt was not unusual for Russian leaders to seek foreign advice. Peter the Great (1682-1725) had done so in his attempts to modernize Russia at the beginning of the 18th century. Similarly, Yeltsin's government had invited the prominent Keynesian economist Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard (later Columbia) University and other international advisers from organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to offer technical assistance.\n\nBut the delegation of economists first advising Putin on his ascension to power had a quite different perspective: They were all strong believers in the power and efficiency of markets, with strong conservative or libertarian political orientation. Why? Putin in early 2000 had selected as his top economic adviser a young economist (age 38), Andrei Illarionov, who admired such classical liberal economists as Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Ludwig von Mises. He had also read the distinct supply-side writings done for the JEC by Jim Gwartney and by me that cast grave doubts on the alleged economic advantages of large activist governments. Our evidence, which was independently published, suggested that existing Western governments tended to far exceed the size that would maximize incomes. Big government financed by high levels of taxation tended to inhibit economic growth, a key message of the American supply-side revolution of the 1970s and 1980s. In time, however, Illarionov became disillusioned with Putin and ended up at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, D.C. - probably the most remarkable career change of an economist that I have ever seen.\n\nOur group garnered a good deal of press attention. A story in the leading business newspaper Kommersant by Constantine Levin had the headline \"Putin Will Be Trained in Jesuit Methods of Managing the Economy.\" In it, Al Harberger was called the \"father of the Chicago boys,\" and I was termed \"the ideologue of Reaganomics.\" Excerpts of one lecture I gave to university students showed up on Russian national TV.\n\nOur little delegation of economic experts spent four days meeting key officials such as Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, IMF and World Bank officials, Russian central bank executives, and others. All of us independently gave lectures at prominent local universities and elsewhere. For me, a highlight was a lecture that I gave to a large number of apparatchiks and leaders of the Russian nomenklatura who were mandated by the Kremlin to attend my presentation. Drawing on Russian economic history, I asserted that Russia's economy had advanced the most when Russia improved private-property rights and the rule of law, such as in the 1890s and early 1900s, and that economic decentralization, low taxes, and minimal regulation, which support a booming private economy, were the keys to Russia's future prosperity. It was a gloriously ironic moment, as my lecture was delivered to a largely indifferent or hostile audience from what until recently had been the Communist Party headquarters.\n\nThe culmination of our weeklong Moscow visit came on April 21, when the five of us met for about an hour and a half with Putin, Illarionov, and an interpreter. Putin, who was clearly very smart, actually seemed to understand English far better than he let on. We had a lovely opulent Russian lunch, which came complete with four basic alcoholic food groups: vodka, white wine, Russian imitation champagne, and cognac, in addition to such Russian delicacies as beluga caviar. Each of us made different points. Harberger, for example, was particularly concerned about the exchange rate between the ruble and other currencies. Gwartney and I were more focused on the fact that, considering social insurance and other levies, the marginal income tax rate for some Russians far exceeded 80 percent, creating a massive underground economy. The American ambassador (James F. Collins) had already warned us before the Putin meeting that \"no one in Russia is paying all those taxes.\"\n\nEven Putin-favored oligarchs moved vast amounts of assets to places like London or the Bahamas, as Russia belatedly abandoned the popular low flat-rate income tax that the American libertarians persuaded Putin to adopt over two decades ago.\n\nEven Putin-favored oligarchs moved vast amounts of assets to places like London or the Bahamas, as Russia belatedly abandoned the popular low flat-rate income tax that the American libertarians persuaded Putin to adopt over two decades ago.\n\nThe American experience throughout modern history - the Mellon (Harding-Coolidge) tax cuts of the 1920s, the Kennedy tax reductions of the 1960s, and the Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s - showed that income tax reductions served to reallocate resources from a highly inefficient public sector to a more efficient and innovative private one, accelerating economic growth. The private sector was disciplined by markets and incentivized to minimize resource use, adopt new innovations to satisfy consumers, and reduce costs. So, I stressed the need to reduce marginal tax rates, which would stimulate an increased supply of both labor and capital resources. Others appropriately talked about other Russian economic weaknesses, such as the failure to fully follow standard international accounting standards or the lack of a fully independent impartial judiciary enforcing the rule of law. We also argued that America's federal system had positive dimensions for promoting economic growth, such as by encouraging tax competition among the 50 states.\n\nLess than four months after the American delegation left, Russia adopted a flat-rate income tax with a 13 percent rate, which took effect at the beginning of 2001. While I always embraced Winston Churchill's admonition that \"democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms,\" Putin's quick action suggests that while a relatively authoritarian government may not serve the public welfare, it can act decisively and quickly. When speaking to groups of American politicians, I sometimes say, only half-jokingly, that \"the only politician who has ever acted on my advice is Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nIn what may be the best example ever of the Laffer Curve, the dramatic reduction in income tax rates (the corporate rate was also reduced considerably), led total tax revenues to rise - sharply. Within two years of the introduction of the new tax code, tax revenues had risen by 50 percent, even after adjusting for inflation. The underground economy shrunk dramatically, a triumph of the rule of law - people felt they could now afford to obey the tax statutes.\n\nThere are lessons here from America that arise from our federal system of different rates of taxation for each state. For example, take the nine states (Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming) with no general state income tax (the ultimate flat tax) and compare the number of jobs created there from November 2021 to November 2022 with that created in the five jurisdictions (California, D.C., Hawaii, New York, and New Jersey) with a top marginal state income tax rate in the double digits - at least 10 percent. The population of the two areas is nearly identical - slightly higher in the high-tax areas. Yet 198,000 more jobs were created in the states where workers got to keep more of their earnings. It's no wonder that the flat-tax movement is spreading in America, with states such as Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, and Mississippi now transitioning from a graduated to a flat-rate income tax. In Iowa, for example, a highly progressive tax with a top rate of 8.53 percent will become a 3.9 percent flat tax by 2026, and even sooner Arizona will have a 2.5 percent rate.\n\nAn even better indicator of human welfare probably is net migration - are people moving into or out of a jurisdiction? People move into places usually expecting to have a better life and leave places because they think other areas will provide them with a more satisfying living environment. In the latest census estimates, for mid-2020 to mid-2021, 494,430 persons on net moved into the nine jurisdictions without state income taxes - an average of almost precisely one person each minute of every day and night over that period. By contrast, about 1,000 per day on net moved away from each of two very-high-tax jurisdictions, California and New York.\n\nWe spent a fair amount of time with Putin and other advisers talking about standardizing accounting procedures, protecting shareholder rights, ensuring that there is a level playing field for all participants in economic activity, and promoting the sanctity of intellectual property (patents, etc.). We mentioned something the Western world as a whole and the U.S. in particular often ignores these days: balancing budgets, stabilizing currency values, and promoting price stability. We promoted the idea of intergovernmental competition, which the American federal system of government has encouraged and which we thought probably had potential in Russia, a country with scores of regional governments reaching 11 time zones. We stayed away from discussing world politics and Russia's perpetual yearning for power and international respectability. Although not our intent, it undoubtedly was a big part of Putin's thinking that achieving greater output through tax and other reforms would enable Russia to strengthen its military prowess and great-power status. And clearly a sizable portion of increased resources from vibrant Russian growth under Putin I went to enhancing military prowess.\n\nWhat happened to Russia during Putin II, the last decade or so? I think Mark Whitehouse summarized it well in a 2018 Bloomberg article: \"Oppressive governance and an aging population have left the economy with little capacity to grow.... Putin says he wants a breakthrough, yet the crucial conditions - the sanctity of private property and personal freedom - are precisely what he can't deliver: The Kremlin elite derive their wealth and position from violating them.\"\n\nWith the passage of time and the consolidation of power, Putin jailed, poisoned, or otherwise neutralized businessmen and others who disagreed with his increasingly dictatorial rule. In a nation that for centuries had rightly prided itself on its brilliant intelligentsia, some of the best and brightest of its \"human capital\" fled or were jailed, perhaps personified best by the former world chess champion (1984-2005) Garry Kasparov, but also including bright, rising political leaders such as Alexei Navalny. Brilliant, innovative, and entrepreneurial Russians such as Google co-founder Sergey Brin had already moved to Silicon Valley pre-Putin I, part of a sizable outmigration of Russian Jews. Even Putin-favored oligarchs moved vast amounts of assets to places like London or the Bahamas, as Russia belatedly abandoned the popular low flat-rate income tax that the American libertarians persuaded Putin to adopt over two decades ago.\n\nAnother politician's leadership very roughly coincides with Putin's: that of Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister from 1996 to 1999, finance minister in the early 2000s, and prime minister again most of the time since 2009. Unlike Putin, he chafed at the socialist nature of Israeli society and embarked on a campaign to lower taxes, kill stifling regulations, open financial markets, privatize property ownership, build needed transportation infrastructure, and so on. I was speaking at a conference on tax issues in Vienna around 2005 with then-Finance Minister Netanyahu, and as I listened to him both in private conversation and in speaking to a broader audience, I thought that he was a bigger proponent of Reaganomics than Reagan himself. During Putin I, when the Russian economy opened up considerably to capitalism but Netanyahu's leadership within Israel was severely diminished, Russia outgrew Israel. Yet in the last decade (2012- 2021), World Bank data show that Netanyahu's Israel had an impressive 3.65 percent annual growth in total output, nearly three times that of Putin's Russia's 1.32 percent.\n\nAnd these indicators of economic weakness may ultimately bring the era of Putin to an end. A relatively economically weak Russia simply cannot afford to be a great power. Russia's abundant natural resources are not enough to overcome the hubris and what Hayek called the \"fatal conceit\" arising from believing that the iron fist of government can outwit and outproduce the invisible hand of markets.\n\nRichard Vedder is a distinguished professor of economics emeritus at Ohio University and a Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute.\n\nUkraine: How Much Is Enough?\n\nPutin's Patsy: Biden Plays Sucker to the Russkies\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Putin's March to the Red Sea Russian imperialism continues its push on the African front.\n\nVladimir Putin's ambitions to revive the Soviet empire go beyond his war in Ukraine, involving lower-intensity geostrategic moves in various parts of the world producing disturbing results in Africa, where a growing chain of anti-Western military dictatorships controlled by the Kremlin could soon reach the Red Sea.\n\nRussia has signed security agreements with more than 20 African countries, 13 of which were signed in the past five years, according to the Morocco-based think tank Policy Center for the New South . Moscow is Africa's single largest arms supplier, accounting for 40 percent of African arms purchases between 2018-2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , far outstripping the 16 percent U.S. share and dwarfing that of France, the former colonial power whose 8 percent participation may shrink even further.\n\nREAD MORE from Martin Arostegui: Zelensky Responds to Putin's Missile War\n\nNewly installed military dictatorships in Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso, as well as the Central African Republic (CAR), have expelled the French foreign legionnaires that traditionally policed the region to replace them with the Russian \"Spetsnaz\" of the Wagner private military company and other PMCs created by Moscow. \"Russian mercenaries have established complex networks of political, economic and military influence\" in Sahel and North Africa, reports an extensive policy research paper by the Warsaw-based Casimir Pulaski Foundation .\n\nRussia has been consolidating its operations in Africa since the assassination of Wagner CEO Yevgeny Prigozhin, who spearheaded Moscow's penetration of the continent by backing coups and rebellions along a strip of chronically unstable countries stretching from the western Sahara to the Red Sea.\n\nPrigozhin provided a screen of \"plausible deniability\" for the Kremlin by personally negotiating deals for major mineral and energy concessions in exchange for arms, military training, and advisers to back regimes shunned by Western powers for their savagely repressive practices. \"The West has been losing the race for geopolitical influence in Africa to ... Russia ... because of, among other things, its insistence on implementing ... its own ideological models regarding human rights, political rules, etc., which are alien to local culture and tradition,\" says the Pulaski think tank.\n\nSince assassinating Prigozhin last August (see The American Spectator 's coverage ), Russia's intelligence services have rushed to assert control over Wagner's widespread assets. High-level delegations led by the military intelligence (GRU) chief, Gen. Andrei Averyanov, and Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov have repeatedly traveled to the capitals of the Sahel, the Central African Republic (CAR), and Libya, where Wagner has established extensive military bases containing Pantsir mobile air defense systems, Mi-8 heavy lift and Mi-35 combat helicopters, and Sukhoi and MiG fighter aircraft. While providing critical support for Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LAN) in its struggle with the Turkish-supported central government in Tripoli, they also operate \"autonomously,\" according to the Pulaski Foundation, providing \"forward bases\" for Moscow to pursue ventures throughout Africa.\n\nTalks between Russian defense officials, Haftar, and the camouflage-clad, sunglass-sporting army officers now ruling the Sahel countries have involved substituting their contracts with Wagner for more direct agreements with the Russian defense ministry, which is offering to further coordinate arms deliveries and upgrade military training for their armies. Russia's defense ministry is incorporating the thousands of Wagner mercenaries spread throughout the continent into a new PMC called \" Africa Corps ,\" according to recruitment ads posted by Russian military bloggers on Telegram.\n\nSuch plans were underway prior to Prigozhin's death. During a July meeting in St. Petersburg between Putin and 17 African heads of state, the president of Central African Republic, Faustin-Archange Touadéra, expressed concern about the future of his Wagner bodyguards following Prigozhin's June 24 rebellion. Putin introduced him to GRU general Andrei Averyanov, as the new authority \"responsible\" for the group in Africa.\n\nThe CAR president had considered switching his security to the Washington-based firm Bancroft Global Development, which says that it has communicated with him. But he was visited at his palace in Bangui by Averyanov in September. Subsequently, a Russian ex-intelligence operative who closely advised Touadéra at the time of his crackdown on opponents in 2021, and has recently started his own PCM, came to see him last month.\n\nDespite being the poorest country in Africa, CAR has valuable gold mines which were given as concessions to Wagner to mitigate Russia's international sanctions and finance the Kremlin's expanding operations in Africa. The mines straddle the border with Sudan, where Wagner teams are supporting Sudanese rebel gendarmes of the Rapid Support Forces led by general Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo who took over government buildings in the capital, Khartoum, last year as the Russians pressured president Abdel Fattah al-Burhan to give them a Red Sea naval base in Port Sudan.\n\nWagner recruited Dagalo when he was already indicted by the International Criminal Court for \"crimes against humanity\" over the alleged genocide of rival tribes in his home region of Darfur. Hundreds of Russian mercenaries are similarly assisting Col. Assimi Goita in Mali who took power in a 2021 coup and has been accused of conducting systematic slaughters in villages suspected of harboring Islamic insurgents. Russian flags and posters lauding Putin instantly blossomed at rallies supporting Niger's military junta when general Abdourahamane Tchiani overthrew president Mohamed Bazoum last July, imprisoning him and his family in conditions that UN observers have described as \"inhumane.\"\n\nResponses to Russian encroachments have been weak. The Economic Community of West African States led by oil rich Nigeria threatened to intervene militarily to reestablish democratic rule in Niger following the July coup. But ECOWAS was faced down by Sahel's three military juntas which declared an alliance against any invasion at a summit in Mali. France withdrew its 1,500 troops from Niger and shut down its besieged embassy last month. ( READ MORE from Martin Arostegui: Russia and Iran's Deadly Terrorist Diplomacy )\n\nCIA director Nicolas Burns made a surprise visit to Libya a year ago to try to convince Marshal Haftar to shut down Wagner's bases. The U.S. spy chief may have acted on intelligence of rising tensions between Wagner and LAN commanders increasingly irritated by the impunity of the Russian mercenaries, according to the Pulaski Foundation. But the U.S. has not agreed to give Haftar sophisticated weapons to replace his Russian gear and he fears that Wagner could shut down his oil fields. \"Given Wagner's military resources in the country, Russian mercenaries could overthrow the authorities in the eastern part of Libya without too much trouble,\" says the Pulaski report.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies may ultimately be forced to draw the line in Sudan where the government remains besieged by Dagalo, who has close ties with the Iranian-backed Houthis trying to close the Red Sea to western shipping. There are signs that Ukrainian special forces, possibly contracted through NATO governments, are already operating covertly against Wagner teams supporting Dagalo. A video recently broadcast on CNN shows Ukrainian markings on drones used to attack a Russian convoy entering the Sudanese city of Omdurman.\n\nAfrica has always been the scene of proxy wars. The Soviet Union used Cuban troops to install pro-Moscow regimes in Angola, Mozambique, and Ethiopia during the Cold War. A former head of the French intelligence service (DGSE) once told me of how special forces of its Direct Action Service were ordered into the presidential palace in Bangui to fight off a pro-Soviet coup attempt in the 1980s. French President Macron declined to do it in Niger, but such high risk operations may soon be necessary to counter strategic Russian advances in the increasingly unstable region.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Liberals Supported Deals With Communists but Not With Putin Why were liberals OK with the US making deals with Czarist Russia, the Stalinist USSR, and the genocidal Mao Zedong but not Putin?\n\nW hat is it about Washington liberals and Democratic leaders that made them so anxious for a deal with Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, Konstantin Chernenko, and Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1970s and 1980s, but not with Vladimir Putin in the second decade of the 21st century? Why was making a deal with Russia's communist leaders preferable to making a deal with Russia's current nationalist leader? What is it about Putin that sets him apart from Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko, and Gorbachev in the eyes and minds of Washington's liberals?\n\nThe same crowd that was more than willing to strike deals with Russia's communist leaders ... are loathe to engage in similar diplomacy with Putin.\n\nOne answer might be that liberals instinctively position themselves in opposition to Republican presidents, but that would not explain their support for President Nixon's deals with Brezhnev and later President Reagan's deals with Gorbachev. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Washington Democrats (with a few notable exceptions like Sen. Henry M. \"Scoop\" Jackson) were the strongest proponents of détente and lessening tensions with our Soviet enemy.\n\nLiberal Democrats and others on the left in the United States often advocated unilateral nuclear disarmament, no-first use of nuclear weapons, a nuclear \"freeze\" that would have left Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles (SS-20s) in Europe unopposed by U.S. intermediate-range missiles there, and generally looked to improve relations with the Soviet Union - even after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan.\n\nMany liberals opposed President Reagan's aid to the contras in communist-controlled Nicaragua, criticized Reagan's liberation of communist-controlled Grenada, opposed aid to the government of El Salvador that was fighting a communist-backed insurgency, fought against Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative - derisively naming it \"Star Wars\" - and reacted negatively when Reagan called the Soviet Union an \"evil empire.\" Reagan's policies and belligerent rhetoric, many on the Democratic left said, were bringing the world closer to World War III.\n\nThe Democratic left in Washington favored easing tensions with the USSR even though Soviet forces were killing Afghan children with bombs disguised as toys; even though a Soviet-backed assassin shot Pope John Paul II; even though Soviet fighter jets shot down a Korean commercial airliner, killing everyone on board including a Republican congressman; even though Soviet leaders continued to imprison dissidents in the Gulag and in psychiatric hospitals; even though the Soviet-backed regime in Poland cracked down on the Solidarity trade union movement.\n\nAs Marc Thiessen once pointed out, \"For decades, while the Soviet Union sowed tyranny across the globe, sent millions to rot in prisons, and threatened America with nuclear annihilation, Democrats were for détente and peaceful coexistence.\"\n\nIn his masterful two-volume The Age of Reagan , Steven Hayward recounts the Democratic left's reflexive opposition to anti-Soviet policies and rhetoric, all in the name of improving relations with the Soviet Union. Hayward noted that, for example, Democratic congressmen discussed with communist Nicaraguan leaders how best to undermine Reagan's policies in Central America (the NSA intercepted those calls). Connecticut liberal Democratic Sen. Christopher Dodd led the opposition to Reagan's tough anti-communist policies in the region.\n\nMeanwhile, Reagan's opponent in the 1984 election, Democratic Sen. Walter Mondale, blamed Reagan for the lack of progress in halting the arms race. Mondale met with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and claimed that there was an \"'opportunity for significant progress' in Washington-Moscow relations.\"\n\nReagan's \"evil empire\" speech produced scathing criticism from the pro-Democratic liberal press and the foreign policy establishment. Historian Henry Steele Commager called the speech \"the worst presidential speech in American history.\" The New Republic accused Reagan of \"contemplating holy war.\" New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis called the speech \"outrageous\" and primitive.\" Liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr, accused Reagan of \"inordinate self-righteousness.\" Liberal reporter Tom Wicker denounced the speech as dangerous and the result of Reagan's \"holy war mentality.\" Reagan's Secretary of State George Shultz noted that many of our European allies were \"alarmed\" by the speech.\n\nAfter the evil empire speech, liberal writer and future Democratic administration official Strobe Talbot did a big think piece in Time which was highly critical of Reagan's aggressive approach to the Soviet Union, blaming Reagan for the \"poisonous\" relationship with Moscow. Talbot urged Reagan to negotiate arms control agreements and tone down the anti-Soviet rhetoric.\n\nTalbot epitomized the foreign policy establishment's insistence on making deals with communist Russia in the interest of preserving general peace. It didn't matter to liberals and the foreign policy establishment that the Soviet Union repressed its own people, violated human rights, held an empire together with brute force, and whose ideology proclaimed world revolution.\n\nFast forward to 21st century international relations. A much-less powerful and much less globe-threatening Russia led by Vladimir Putin launched an aggressive war against Ukraine - a nation whose independence had never - never - been considered a vital national security interest of the United States. Putin's war has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths in Ukraine and among Russia's armed forces, and has devastated many Ukrainian cities and towns.\n\nAfter three years of deadly, inconclusive fighting, President Donald Trump wants to negotiate an end to the war. The outlines of a settlement involve Ukraine's loss of the Crimea and some of its eastern provinces, Ukraine remaining outside of the NATO alliance, and some form of European security guarantee to Ukraine without U.S. participation. Trump, like President Obama before him, recognizes that Russia has a greater interest in Ukraine than we do. Trump also recognizes that Putin's Russia poses less of a threat to American interests than did the USSR.\n\nLiberals, Democrats and the foreign policy establishment in the U.S., however, strongly oppose any negotiations with Putin's Russia. Democrats in Congress reportedly urged Ukraine's President Zelensky to reject any deal with the Trump administration, which they labeled as a \"fake\" peace agreement. Zelensky apparently followed their advice which resulted in the needlessly contentious Oval Office meeting at which Zelensky demanded U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\nLiberal Democrats and the foreign policy establishment, of course, blamed Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance. The same crowd that was more than willing to strike deals with Russia's communist leaders in the past in the interests of \"peaceful coexistence\" and \"détente,\" are loathe to engage in similar diplomacy with Putin.\n\nThe answer to the questions posed in the first paragraph in this article may be something as simple as Trump Derangement Syndrome - anything Trump is for, liberals, Democrats, and even establishment Republicans congenitally oppose. Putin, after all, is no more sinister than Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko, and Gorbachev were. Putin and those Soviet leaders possessed a nuclear arsenal that could destroy the United States, though Putin's arsenal is much smaller than were his Soviet predecessors' arsenals. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, a Soviet conventional assault to overrun Western Europe was plausible; Russia today can barely hold on to a few eastern provinces of Ukraine.\n\nGeopolitics makes strange bedfellows. The United States made deals with an autocratic Russian Czar in World War I, with a totalitarian monster (Josef Stalin) in Russia in World War II, and with the greatest mass murderer in world history (Mao Zedong) in the Cold War.

      "text": "How Goes It for President Putin? The rot introduced by Prigozhin continues to spread.\n\nWASHINGTON - Well, how are things going for Vladimir Putin? He has been showing a KGB sleuth's cunning at warfare for over a year now, and he has been doing it against an enemy who is outgunned and outnumbered. Oh yes, and by the way, that enemy is also winning the war. All Putin's forces have been able to win is the battle for Bakhmut , and Putin had to empty out a prison or two to do it. Of late, his finest soldiers have been convicts, and they generally take a bullet in the head to demonstrate their valor. The Russian casualty list has run to roughly 50,000 dead and God knows how many wounded.\n\nREAD MORE from R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr: What in the World Is Putin Thinking?\n\nI have been doubtful of Putin's chances from the start. You might recall that late in February of 2022 , before his 150,000-man army advanced against the Ukrainians, I wrote that \"[m]ilitary experts in the West say the Ukrainian defenders are no match for the Russians,\" who had at that point yet to fire a shot. I predicted that \"things in Ukraine are going to come out much differently than they look now.\" \"Now\" being late February 2022. The next month , after the Russian army had had a month in the field and its tanks were running out of gas, I wrote , \"Whether he [Putin] will win or not is in doubt.\" And I compared Putin's performance to Mussolini's and his brutality to that of Hitler. As the year progressed, he only got worse. (READ THE ARTICLE: Putin's War )\n\nHow did I know, or rather suspect, that the Russian army would perform so badly against the Ukrainian army? Well, it was not because I followed the lead of \"military experts in the West.\" I followed the lead of Milton Friedman, the free-market economist, who taught that corruption usually followed a nation whose economic system was saddled with the inefficiencies of statism. From top to bottom there are handouts and subsidies and all the graft that goes with it. Whether you are dealing with the military's logistics, the government's disorganization, or the private exchange of goods and services, everyone is in on the take eventually in a statist-run society. In this war the Russian army was hobbled by armor that ran out of gas, guns and artillery that had not been used for years, and leadership that was inept when it was not blatantly corrupt.\n\nThe rise of Yevgeny Prigozhin, until a few weeks ago head of the Wagner private militia outfit, is a perfect specimen of the weird mediocrity that has filled the ranks of Putin's government. Prigozhin, with Putin's blessing, rose from being a common prisoner, to a hot dog mongerer, to the official caterer for Putin's government. Thence he finally headed the vast private militia that is known as Wagner. Alas, he went too far. His troops rolled up the M-4 highway toward Moscow, which thanks to Putin's negligence was practically undefended. Had Prigozhin's militia continued up the M-4 highway, it is possible Prigozhin would be president of Russia today. But it appears that the former hot dog salesman lost his nerve, and where he will end up is anyone's guess.\n\nYet the rot introduced by Prigozhin and Putin is continuing to spread. Some weeks ago, I spoke of the rot that had spread to and infected the elites of Russian society. I was speaking of the billionaires and the government grandees. This past week there was evidence of turbulence at the top of the Russian military. One general was killed in Ukraine - Lt. Gen. Oleg Tsokov. Another simply disappeared - Gen. Sergey Surovikin. And another, Maj. Gen. Ivan Popov - one of the rare successes in the Russian ranks - delivered a four-minute recorded diatribe against his superiors. It went viral. He has been replaced.\n\nThere is almost no place in Putin's Russia that is immune to the corruption and incompetence of the present moment. Moreover, it is going to take a long time to cleanse Russia of it. Even the Orthodox Church is crippled by corruption. With the fall of the Soviet Union, one might have thought that finally the Russian church would be free of the costs of Godless communism. Yet now I am told that a church that for decades was under the rule of the KGB apparently has continued to be corrupted by the rule of Putin's thugs. For Mother Russia there is no place to hide.\n\nGlory to Ukraine!\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit... Read More\n\nIt's been a busy few weeks for Bernie Sanders, traveling...

Watch the conversation, at times a filibuster, here .\n\nHe seems more coherent than our president. At the same time, KGB agents, former and present - whatever the agency currently calls itself - can persuade even when they lie.\n\nPutin spins the Hitler-Stalin Pact, preposterously, as a reaction to Poland's betrayal of Russia. He claims the Poles collaborated with Hitler. \"The USSR, I have read some documents in the archives, behaved very honestly,\" he claimed. I went into this with an open mind, but he sounds like a Commie.\n\nHe damaged himself with sensible American right-wingers not eager to keep pouring money into Ukraine. He calls Ukraine an \"artificial state.\" Putin clearly regards Kiev, and parts of Lithuania, as Russian property. He seeks to redraw the map of Europe to what existed prior to not only the Second World War but the First World War. His cartographical grievances dates back 1,000 years or more.\n\nOne imagines everyone can curse the map in some way.

      "text": "Putin Isn't Going Away Any Time Soon Reports of his imminent downfall are greatly exaggerated.\n\n\"P rediction is difficult, especially about the future.\" That line is often misattributed to professional baseball player Yogi Berra, but it actually is a Danish proverb that was repeated by Niels Bohr , the scientist who figured out the structure of the atom. But no matter; it captures a fundamental feature of the human condition: While we can envision the future, we are not very good at predicting it.\n\nPredictions that Russian President Vladimir Putin is about to fall from power have been appearing for months. In March, an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal argued that \" Putin Has Ensured His Own Downfall .\" In June, an \"exiled Russian oligarch\" predicted Putin's imminent demise . In September, reports surfaces - and were later denied - that Putin had survived an assassination attempt . A few days ago, unnamed \"experts\" speculated that unnamed \"Kremlin insiders\" were \"jostling to replace Putin,\" and the Washington Post speculated about potential successors .\n\nUnfortunately, this is wishful thinking , a common fallacy that causes amateur gamblers and other inveterate optimists to think that just because they want something to happen, it is going to happen.\n\nThe other common error in human thinking that contributes to imagining Putin will just go away somehow is projecting our own nature onto others. We find it hard to get inside the heads of people from another culture with a different history and life experience than our own - so, for simplicity's sake, we tend to imagine that they are just like us.\n\nAdmittedly, if the leader of most Western democracies had led his or her country into a disastrous aggressive war, he or she might fall from power, at least in a parliamentary system, merely by losing a vote of confidence in a parliament in which his or her party controls a majority. Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson was recently removed from power in the U.K. for far lesser sins.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution does not make it that easy to remove a president . A solid majority of Americans disapprove of President Joe Biden's leadership (to use the term loosely), and yet it is unlikely that he can be removed before his term ends. Similarly, President George W. Bush led us into an ill-advised invasion of Iraq, with no repercussions to himself - a \"precedent\" some invoke as a justification for Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut the reasons that Putin is not going away any time soon go even deeper than constitutional structure. They lie in the czarist history of Russia, which has resulted in a collective inferiority complex of the Russian people as well as a concomitant willingness to engage in brutality against innocent civilians that is horrifying to most of us in the West.\n\nPerhaps the only option now is to return to \"containment,\" or, perhaps more accurately, ostracism.\n\nWe call people who do not empathize with the suffering of other human beings \" sociopaths .\" As uncomfortable as it is, we have got to deal with the fact that we are confronting a country of 144 million people that is armed with nuclear weapons in which much of the population has shown by their actions in Ukraine that they do not accept the fundamental human rights of other individuals to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These rights are enshrined in our founding documents and have inspired much of the world to agree to a rules-based international order since World War II. However, rights do not live on pieces of paper; they live in the hearts and minds of civilized human beings who have learned to respect the lives and autonomy of other individuals.\n\nFor the media elites who control thought in Russia today, life is about returning Russia to its historic glory, and, if tens of thousands of innocent people die in the process, well, that is no more a concern to them than swatting gnats . Unfortunately, we must reluctantly accept the fact that most of the population of Russia is going along with the line they are being fed.\n\nNot all of them feel that way, of course. A few dozen Russian local officials courageously called upon Putin to resign, and thousands have fled the country. But a large majority of Russians - 75 percent in some surveys - still support Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The main complaint that they hear is that it hasn't been going well, so they demand even more brutal measures , including missile attacks on civilian populations and even the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons. For all we can surmise, the population is either cheering or at least willing to go along with these atrocities.\n\nThe war crimes being committed in Ukraine are too widespread to be accidents or \"collateral damage\" and appear to be the intentional targeting of schools , apartment buildings , hospitals , kindergartens, and orphanages to terrorize the civilian population. There are even reports that Russian soldiers invading Ukraine said that they received orders to \"kill everyone we see,\" but the point is not merely that such orders were given but that they are being followed! I doubt that soldiers from civilized countries like Canada, or Switzerland, or Egypt would execute helpless civilians, including children and the elderly , but Russian soldiers have intentionally committed these crimes against humanity thousands of times in Ukraine.\n\nA lot of this is attributable to Russia's czarist history, in which the lives of the Russian people were \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\" (to borrow a phrase from English philosopher Thomas Hobbes ). But whatever the cause, the world denies the nature of the problem if it continues to assume that the Russian people are \"just like us\" and will somehow magically rise up to get rid of Putin. On the contrary, a hard-headed analysis by the Washington Post 's David Ignatius based on U.S. intelligence rightly predicts that the country's setbacks in Ukraine will likely only deepen Russia's collective sense of paranoia and victimhood, as it did Germany's after World War I. And if the Russian people do somehow get rid of Putin, he would probably be replaced by someone even more brutal - something that is hard to imagine.\n\nIt isn't an easy problem to deal with a large and powerful nation of people who are not living on the same planet as the rest of us - or, perhaps better said, are not living in the same century as we are but instead are back in the era in which warring tribes routinely invaded their neighbors, raped their women, stole their worldly goods, and tortured and murdered civilians. We tried to incorporate Russia into the Western world - a policy the Germans labeled with the sonorous phrase \" Wandel durch Handel ,\" which means \"change through commerce.\" It didn't work. Perhaps the only option now is to return to \"containment,\" or, perhaps more accurately, ostracism. If Russians can no longer travel abroad, or buy Western goods, or obtain fancy yachts and villas in London, maybe they will figure out that they are doing something wrong. But regardless of the solution - if there is one - we do ourselves no good by denying the nature of the problem by assuming that the Russian people are \"just like us\" but merely oppressed by an evil dictator and that, if we could only get rid of him, everything would be hunky dory.\n\nWe should begin to confront the evil that is Russia today by calling Putin a czar rather than a president, reminding ourselves that the Russian people are still living in a different world that we can hardly comprehend. Unfortunately, despite our fondest desires to imagine that evil Czar Putin will somehow be removed by deus ex machina , the Russian people are not about to rise up and replace this sociopath with someone with whom we can do business.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

Witkoff told Carlson that Trump \"was clearly touched\" by the portrait, which he described as \"beautiful.\"\n\nWitkoff met Putin after talks with Russian officials about trying to end the war in Ukraine. Ceasefire talks continued Monday in Saudi Arabia, where U.S. officials met their Russian counterparts, a day after meeting with Ukrainian negotiators.\n\nDuring his interview with Carlson, Witkoff described Putin's gift as \"gracious\" and recalled how Putin told him he had prayed for Trump last year when he heard the then-candidate for the U.S. presidency had been shot at a rally in Pennsylvania. \"He was praying for his friend,\" Witkoff said, recounting Putin's comments.\n\nIn 2018, Putin gave then-President Trump a soccer ball that the Secret Service had checked for listening devices before Trump gave it to his son - a precaution that hearkened back to a Soviet-era gift to a U.S. diplomat that turned out to be bugged.\n\nIn 1945, a carving of the Great Seal of the United States was given as a gift from Soviet school children to then-U.S. Ambassador Averell Harriman. It hung in his office for six years allowing the Soviet Union to eavesdrop on his conversations until the State Department discovered that it contained a covert listening device.\n\nIt was not immediately known if the portrait Putin gave to Trump had been examined for bugs. The White House hasn't commented on the portrait.\n\nTrump isn't the first sitting president to receive a gift from Putin. In 2021, Putin gave then-President Joe Biden a $12,000 lacquer writing box and pen when they met at a summit in Geneva, Switzerland. In 2013, he reportedly sent then-President Barack Obama porcelain plates and espresso cups .\n\nThis apparently isn't the first portrait of a U.S. leader Putin has sent, either. In 2014, the Russia president reportedly sent to George H.W. Bush a portrait of the former president on his 90th birthday.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

Then we work a ceasefire and ultimately we stop losing 2,000 people a week. Two thousand people a week or more are being killed in that war, and I want to stop it. I also want to stop massive payments that are necessary to be made by us. I also want Europe to pay the same as us because they weren't able to do that under Biden and Biden never asked that because Biden was a grossly incompetent president. We had two very good phone calls and I do believe a deal will be worked out so we can stop the bloodshed that's taking place over there.\"\n\nThe White House readout of Trump's call with Putin on Tuesday noted that both leaders expressed an interest in strengthening economic ties between the U.S. and Russia.\n\n\"The two leaders agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside,\" the White House readout read in part. \"This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.\"\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, though, the Russians have effectively seized an American-owned company called Glavproduct. The canned food maker, which is wholly owned by U.S. company Universal Beverage, was taken over by the Russians in the waning days of former President Joe Biden's administration. The American CEO of the company, Leonid Smirnov, has publicly asked for Trump to help fix this situation as part of the U.S.-led negotiations between the Russians and the Ukrainians to end the war in Ukraine. Secretary of State Marco Rubio previously told Breitbart News that fixing that situation would be \"part of\" the conversation down the road as part of the economic normalization between the U.S. and Russia in these negotiations. Trump, when asked about this in the interview with Breitbart News, said he personally had not heard about this issue but said he is sure Putin would be \"very generous\" in dealing with this and fixing the situation.\n\n\"I haven't heard about this. Nobody has complained about it to me. But if I heard, I'm sure President Putin would be very generous,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also said that, while it is not a goal or motive of the U.S. in opening up economically with Russia to split Russia off from China, that may be a result of these actions.\n\n\"That may be a consequence of it, but no, I think it's a good thing,\" Trump said. \"We should be dealing with Russia. They have the largest piece of land by far, bigger than China. They have 11 time zones. You can fly through 11 time zones from one side to the other. They have very valuable earth. Now, we're getting a deal with Ukraine on rare earth so at least we can say we got our money back and we can do something. We're in for $350 billion. Biden gave away money like he was just a dope, which he is-a real dope. Think of it: We're at $350 billion and Europe is at $100 billion, and that hundred is a loan. I exposed that too. The money the European nations put in is a loan. They are getting it back. We just gave them the $350 billion. So now we get our money back plus.\"\n\nWhen it comes to China in particular, Trump discussed the U.S. relationship with India as well with Breitbart News. Asked about his recent summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Trump said he has a \"very good relationship\" with India but that India has too many high tariffs on the United States.\n\n\"I have a very good relationship with India, but the only problem I have with India is they're one of the highest tariffing nations in the world,\" Trump said. \"I believe they're going to probably going to be lowering those tariffs substantially, but on April 2, we will be charging them the same tariffs they charge us.\"\n\nAsked about the India-Middle East-Europe-Economic Corridor (IMEC), a deal he signed the U.S. onto during Modi's visit to the U.S., Trump did not mention China in particular but said it was a \"group of wonderful nations\" banding together \"countering other countries that look to hurt us on trade.\"\n\n\"We have a powerful group of partners in trade,\" Trump said. \"Again, we can't let those partners treat us badly, however. We do better in many ways frankly with our foes than we do with our friends. The ones that wouldn't be as friendly to us in some cases treat us better than the ones that are supposed to be friendly, like the European Union, which treats us terribly on trade. India and everybody would think of them as an ally. I can say the same for others. But this is a group of wonderful nations that is countering other countries that look to hurt us on trade.\"\n\nMore from President Trump's exclusive interview with Breitbart News at the White House is forthcoming.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "War and Peace: Trump to Talk With Putin on Tuesday in Hopes of Ukraine Deal, Dividing 'Land, Power Plants'\n\nPresident Donald Trump confirmed that he is set to hold Ukraine war peace talks with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday this week, saying land and power plants are among the items on the agenda for how a post-war Ukraine will look.\n\nNegotiations over the future of the Ukraine War have been continuing behind closed doors between the United States of America and the Russian Federation, President Trump said, as he revealed that leader talks are scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nPresident Trump greeted journalists aboard Air Force One as he flew from Florida to Washington D.C. late Sunday night and opened with thoughts on the Ukraine War before taking questions. Summarising the advances in communications with Russia in recent days - which, until weeks ago, the two countries had been out of contact for years, following the Biden Presidency's freeze in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine - President Trump remarked: \"We learned a lot, we're doing pretty well I think with Russia. We'll see if we have something to announce maybe, by Tuesday.\"\n\nConfirming that a personal discussion with President Putin is going ahead this week, as earlier briefed, President Trump continued: \"I'll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday, a lot of work has been done over the weekend. We want to see if we can bring that war to an end. Maybe we can, maybe we can't, but I think we have a very good chance.\"\n\nPresident Trump also offered some specifics of what he anticipated in the discussion, saying there were ongoing talks on \"dividing up certain assets\", with \"a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia\".\n\nHe said: \"I think we'll be talking about land. There's a lot of land, it's a lot different than it was before the war as you know. We'll be talking about land, we'll be talking about power plants because that's a big question.\"\n\nWhile President Trump didn't specify which power plants he was referring to, it is all but certain the forthcoming discussions will be about the famous Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the largest in the world, which has six reactors producing a nameplate capacity of 5.7 megawatts.\n\nIn reality, the plant's reactors are largely in cold shutdown and have been for several years as the war rages around the plant. Russian forces have occupied Zaporizhzhia since March 2022, and it has been damaged several times over the course of the war, with both sides accusing each other of placing safety at risk with strikes.\n\nPresident Trump and President Putin are last known to have spoken on February 12th, and further personal discussions between the Presidents have been cited as a likely future outcome over the whole course of U.S.-Russian talks since the first meeting in Saudi Arabia on February 18th. It seemed possible that such a call- a step towards a potential in-person negotiation between the two men- could have taken place last week amid fresh talks , but it soon became apparent that it would be this week at the earliest.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday about the coming call, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff talked up the prospects of a productive discussion, saying, \" The two presidents are going to have a really good and positive discussion this week.\"\n\nNevertheless, news of Tuesday's discussion comes amid a backdrop of accusations from Ukraine and European powers accusing Russia of slow-walking a ceasefire in a bid to sabotage talks altogether. Ukraine's President Zelensky said last week that \"manipulative\" Putin sees it in his best interests to keep the war going and is consequently doing the minimum possible engagement with President Trump to keep talks going without finding a conclusion.\n\nRussia saying it agrees with the idea of peace in principle but saying it has reservations and demands to be met first is \"not good enough\", said Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Saturday. He announced that military leaders from consenting countries would be meeting in London on Thursday this week for their own talks in order to establish \"practical work to support a potential deal... strong and robust plans in place to swing in behind a peace deal and guarantee Ukraine's future security.\"\n\nThe scale of a mooted Western deployment to Ukraine has somewhat receded as the weeks have gone by, from a force of a million men theorised by President Zelensky as a security-guaranteeing peacekeeper force to just \"a few thousand\" now discussed by France's President Emmanuel Macron. The idea of any European troops in Ukraine as peacekeepers at all has been called an unacceptable escalation by Russia, but so close to an actual peace negotiation, it is, of course, unclear what such comments really are hard lines and which are bargaining chips to be haggled away.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

You know, every day, people are being killed.\"\n\nPutin's comments about being open to a ceasefire came during a press conference in Moscow, as Breitbart News noted :\n\n\"So the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,\" Putin told a news conference in Moscow, AP set out. \"But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.\"\n\nThe Russian leader noted the need to develop a mechanism to control possible breaches of the truce. Another issue, he said, is whether Ukraine could use the 30-day ceasefire to continue mobilization and rearmament.\n\n\"We agree with the proposals to halt the fighting, but we proceed from the assumption that the ceasefire should lead to lasting peace and remove the root causes of the crisis,\" Putin said.\n\nA reporter asked Trump at the top of Thursday's Oval Office gaggle \"what sort of agreement\" he hopes Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff leaves Moscow with.\n\n\"Well, we'd like to see a ceasefire from Russia. And we have, you know, not been working in the dark. We've been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost, and all of the other elements of a final agreement,\" Trump said.\n\n\"There's a power plant involved, you know, very big power plant involved. Who's going to get the power plant, and who's going to get this and that? And so, you know, it's not an easy process,\" he added. \"But phase one is the ceasefire.\"\n\nUkraine notably agreed to a potential ceasefire negotiated by the United States on Wednesday, contingent on Russia also accepting it.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Putin Offers 'Practical Cooperation' and 'Friendly' Relations to Syria's Jihadi Junta\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin sent a message to Syria's \"interim president\" Ahmed al-Sharaa on Thursday, offering \"practical cooperation\" and \"friendly\" relations to \"stabilize the situation in the country as soon as possible.\"\n\nSharaa is a former al-Qaeda lieutenant whose Syrian insurgent operation broke away from the international terrorist organization and rebranded itself as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a jihadi group dedicated to overthrowing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.\n\nHTS finally pulled that off in December after more than a decade of grueling civil war in Syria. One of the major reasons Assad suddenly fell, after seeming to survive the long internal conflict, was that his patrons in Russia and Iran were distracted and weakened by their wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nSharaa now rules Syria as the leader of a military junta. He has attempted to rehabilitate his image , dressing and speaking as a statesman instead of a guerrilla leader, and he has promised to run an inclusive government that will submit itself to elections in a few years.\n\nQuite a few powers in the West and Middle East are eager to give Sharaa the benefit of the doubt because they want a piece of Syrian reconstruction, and they hope a stable government could alleviate the massive humanitarian crisis in Syria. Even a sudden massacre two weeks ago of Alawites, the Shiite sect that birthed and supported the Assad dynasty, was not enough to make the Europeans give up on Sharaa.\n\nRussia wants a piece of the action in Syria, too, especially after having invested billions in the now-defunct Assad regime. The problem is that much of Sharaa's insurgent coalition detests the Russians for propping Assad up. Soon after HTS captured Damascus, it began sending strong signals that Russia would lose its strategically vital naval and air bases in Syria.\n\nThe Kremlin on Thursday said Putin's letter to Sharaa confirmed \"Russia's continuing readiness to develop practical cooperation with the Syrian leadership on the whole range of issues on the bilateral agenda in order to strengthen traditionally friendly Russian-Syrian relations.\"\n\nThat half-century of \"traditionally friendly\" relations was with the despised and brutal dynasty Sharaa and his allies spent almost 15 years attempting to overthrow, but Russia's new diplomatic line is that it always cared about the Syrian people, not just the Assad family.\n\nThe Kremlin hammered the \"friendly relations\" talking point in statements earlier this month, clearly signaling Sharaa that Moscow was ready to take his phone calls and cut profitable deals with his government.\n\nFor his part, Sharaa has been ambivalent about the fate of Russia's bases in Syria, but he had a friendly phone conversation with Putin in February and held the door open for further talks.\n\nThe recent unrest in Syria might have given Sharaa some reasons to reflect on Russia's long relationship with Assad. The massacre of Alawites began after squads of Assad loyalists reportedly attacked HTS fighters and their allies. Assad himself took refuge in Russia after fleeing Damascus in December, as did some of his top officers.\n\nOn Friday, the first crude oil tanker arrived in Syria since the fall of Assad. The tanker Aquatica is registered in Barbados but is managed out of Azerbaijan. Several other tankers are headed for Syria, and analysts say all of them could be connected through Russia, which could be holding up its end of a deal to supply oil to Syria in exchange for keeping its bases.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Russia Stalls on Ceasefire, Claims It Sent Trump 'Additional Signals'\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that President Vladimir Putin sent some \"additional signals\" to President Donald Trump concerning Trump's proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nPutin said on Thursday he is ready to accept the proposal in principle, but he demanded some modifications that Ukraine is unlikely to accept.\n\nPeskov said Putin's messages were passed along to Trump by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, who arrived in Moscow on Thursday for a meeting with Putin. Among Witkoff's objectives is setting up a phone call between Trump and Putin, something Peskov said could happen after Witkoff brings Putin's messages back to Washington.\n\n\"Additional information was provided to the Russian side. Through Witkoff, Putin also passed information and additional signals to Trump,\" Peskov said at a press conference on Friday, shortly after Witkoff left Moscow.\n\nPeskov said \"there are reasons to feel this cautious optimism\" about the Trump proposal, although \"a great deal\" of work needs to be done. He said \"both sides understand\" that a direct conversation between Trump and Putin is necessary. The last known direct conversation between the two leaders was almost exactly one month ago.\n\nPutin and Trump blasted some more signals at each other on Friday. Trump wrote a post on his preferred social media platform, Truth Social, in which he praised Witkoff's \"very good and productive discussions\" with Putin on Thursday.\n\n\"There is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"BUT, AT THIS VERY MOMENT, THOUSANDS OF UKRAINIAN TROOPS ARE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY THE RUSSIAN MILITARY, AND IN A VERY BAD AND VULNERABLE POSITION,\" Trump added, switching to all-caps for emphasis as he often does.\n\n\"I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!!!\" Trump said.\n\nPresident Trump was referring to the Ukrainian force in Kursk. Ukraine launched a surprise counter-invasion of Kursk in August 2024, embarrassing the Russian military and prompting Putin to call in reinforcements from his ally, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.\n\nThe Ukrainians held on in Kursk for over half a year, but they have recently suffered a string of setbacks , including the loss of the largest town in Kursk they had occupied. Putin suggested on Wednesday that not only is the Ukrainian force on the verge of being completely eliminated, but victorious Russian troops may push beyond the border to create a \"security zone\" of captured Ukrainian territory.\n\nPutin responded in a televised address to his Security Council on Friday, accusing the Ukrainian invaders of \"terrorism\" but suggesting they might receive lenient treatment - if they unconditionally surrender.\n\n\"I would like to emphasize that if they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and decent treatment in accordance with international law and the laws of the Russian Federation,\" Putin said.\n\n\"To effectively implement the appeal of the U.S. president, a corresponding order from the military-political leadership of Ukraine is needed for its military units to lay down their arms and surrender,\" he stressed.\n\nThe Ukrainian military insisted its forces in Kursk are not surrounded or on the brink of destruction, dismissing reports to the contrary as \"false and fabricated by the Russians.\" They undermined these denials somewhat by ordering mandatory evacuations in Sumy, the part of Ukraine that Russia would invade if its forces pushed across the border from Kursk.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday that Putin was merely \"doing everything possible to ensure that diplomacy fails.\"\n\n\"Putin cannot get out of this war, because then he will be left with nothing. That is why he is now doing everything possible to sabotage diplomacy, setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions from the very beginning, even before the cease-fire,\" Zelensky said.\n\nZelensky previously dismissed Putin's response to Trump's ceasefire overtures as \"very predictable\" and \"very manipulative.\"\n\n\"We do not set conditions that complicate anything. Russia does that. As we have always said, the only one who will drag things out, the only one who will be unconstructive is Russia,\" he said.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Two Hour Trump-Putin Ukraine Ceasefire Call Taking Place Tuesday Morning\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak to his Russian counterpart for two hours on Tuesday as they seek an answer to a potential ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump is believed to be in conversation with Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin at time of press in a telephone call given two hours of their scheduled days. Per a Kremlin spokesman, the call was due to last from 1300 GMT (0900 U.S. Eastern) up to 1500 (1100).\n\nUPDATE 1640 - The Trump-Putin Call has ended\n\nThe call between President Trump and President Putin has now finished and lasted over one and a half hours, broadcaster NBC News states . Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov at the Kremlin has said \"the call is over\".\n\nNow we wait on the post-call briefing.\n\nUPDATE 1600 - Call Ongoing\n\nWe have some small updates on the progress of the Trump-Putin call today from White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino. Per his writing, the call started an hour behind the Russia-claimed schedule at 1400 GMT (1000 U.S. Eastern) and was \"still in progress\" as of 1530 GMT (1130 U.S. Eastern).\n\nScavino said \"The call is going well\", although whether that means we get an agreement on a ceasefire today is anyone's guess at this point.\n\nThe original story continues below\n\nDmitry Peskov, spokesman for President Putin, recalled in advance of today's discussion that some discussions between the U.S. and Russia had already taken place, and consequently \"there is a certain understanding\". Yet, he said, \"there are many issues\" left needing further talk, which he said included \"bilateral relations and the Ukrainian settlement\".\n\nIn principle, all parties at the table in the Ukraine War ceasefire talks - Ukraine, its primary sponsor the U.S., and Russia - have previously stated they wish for peace, but generally with the caveat that it would have to be a peace on their own terms.\n\nThis position greatly slowed progress towards getting Ukraine to agree to take President Trump's proposed path to peace last month and led, as President Volodymyr Zelensky attempted to extract last-minute concessions from America, to an Oval Office bust-up. Now Ukraine appears to have agreed to go along with Trump, but Russia remains in that essential position that peace is preferable but it has to be Moscow's peace.\n\nIndeed, in the run-up to today's meeting President Putin expressed just this view, that he agrees with a ceasefire \"in principle, but there are nuances\". Ahead of today's talks, Moscow has briefed that it would see the United States recognising the Ukrainian region of Crimea as Russian territory as a \"good faith measure\", something which Ukraine itself and its European allies would see as outrageous.\n\nPresident Trump himself, who has expressed his determination to overcome these \"nuances\" to end the \"killing field\" of Ukraine confirmed a call would be taking place today over the weekend, when he said of the ongoing negotiations leading to this leader-to-leader talk \"we're doing pretty well I think with Russia\". Envoy Steve Witkoff said of the call: \"The two presidents are going to have a really good and positive discussion this week.\"\n\nThe President said part of the discussion would be about \"dividing up certain assets\", with \"a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia\". These assets included land and \"power plants\", he said, presumably meaning Ukraine's major fleet of nuclear reactors.\n\nThis story is developing, more follows.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

Putin made the comments just hours before U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff was scheduled to arrive in Russia to further negotiate the terms of the proposal.\n\n\"So the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,\" Putin said during the conference. \"But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.\" (RELATED: Trump Reportedly Directs Military To Draw Up Plans Increasing Panama Canal Troop Presence)\n\nThis photograph shows a fire following a strike on the outskirts of Odessa on March 11, 2025, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The U.S. also resumed their military and economic aid to Ukraine in the interim period.\n\nPutin stressed that more safeguards must be put in place to punish potential violations of the ceasefire, while adding that Ukraine could use the 30 days to rearm, according to the AP.\n\nThe war has raged on for three years, taking tens of thousands of Ukrainian and Russian lives. So far, the conflict has cost the U.S. over $170 billion in aid.\n\nInitially, peace negotiations headed by the U.S. went up in flames during a heated Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Just days after the incident, Zelenskyy apologized for the incident and reiterated his interest in peace.\n\nMoreover, Trump threatened to sanction and tariff Russia after they launched a massive attack on Ukrainian infrastructure Mar. 7, saying Russia must pursue a ceasefire and \"final settlement agreement.\"\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and \n\t\t\t\t\tjoining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n\t\t\t\t\tto marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n\t\t\t\t\tsenators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n\t\t\t\t\tto limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n\t\t\t\t\tindependence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n\t\t\t\t\thands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n\t\t\t\t\tOur original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n\t\t\t\t\tthem -- because we won't bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n\t\t\t\t\tour being, and we think she's worth saving from today's craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have \n\t\t\t\t\ttrained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n\t\t\t\t\tspectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There's a good chance they were trained at Daily \n\t\t\t\t\tCaller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n\t\t\t\t\tNewsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n\t\t\t\t\tfair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n\t\t\t\t\tto ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can't do it unless you - \n\t\t\t\t\tthe everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment - have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n\t\t\t\t\tcorporations and other leaders accountable.

      "text": "AP Withdraws Story Claiming Tulsi Gabbard Said Trump And Putin Were 'Very Good Friends'\n\n(Photo by SAJJAD HUSSAIN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) retracted a story Tuesday claiming that U.S. National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard publicly referred to President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin as \"very good friends.\"\n\nThe outlet withdrew its story titled, \"Gabbard Says Trump And Putin Are 'Very Good Friends' Focused On Strengthening Ties,\" before publishing a correction clarifying that Gabbard was referring to Trump's friendship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the AP announced .\n\n\"This story was updated on Mar. 17, 2025, to delete erroneous reporting that U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin 'are very good friends,'\" the AP wrote in an editor's note at the bottom of the story.\n\nA spokesperson for the AP told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the initial report was removed from their site because \"it did not meet [their] standards.\"\n\nAfter the initial story's removal, the AP published a corrected story with Gabbard telling NDTV on Monday that Trump is \"looking forward to success\" ahead of his upcoming call with the Russian president Tuesday afternoon. (RELATED: AP Deletes JD Vance Tweet After Fact Checkers Call Them Out)\n\n\"Under the previous administration, during which this war began, there was no effort, there was no effort at all towards peace. There was no effort to have direct dialogue with Putin and with Russia to try to bring about an end to this war. So already in a very short period of time, President Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any effort that has occurred by anyone, previously,\" Gabbard told India's NDTV. \"I'm sure that President Trump will have a very productive conversation with Putin, once again, rooted in his unwavering commitment to peace.\"\n\nMOSCOW, RUSSIA - FEBRUARY 21: (RUSSIA OUT) Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during the Forum of Future Technologies, February 21, 2025, in Moscow, Russia. Vladimir Putin announced his plans to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in the nearest future. (Photo by Contributor/Getty Images)\n\nThe updated piece then accurately pointed to Gabbard's statement about the relationship between Trump and Modi.\n\n\"With President Trump's leadership in the United States, of course Prime Minister Modi's longstanding leadership here in India, we have two leaders of our two great countries who are very good friends and who are very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests,\" Gabbard said.\n\nGabbard's spokesperson, Alexa Henning, said she contacted both the AP and intelligence and national security reporter David Klepper to demand a correction on the story. On her personal X account, she referred to the AP and the legacy media as \"maliciously incompetent and purposefully bias[ed].\"\n\n\"The AP is total trash,\" Henning said. \"DNI @TulsiGabbard was referring to PM Modi & President Trump and this is the headline they publish. This is why no one trusts the maliciously incompetent and purposefully bias media. If this isn't a clear example of pushing a solely political narrative, then nothing is.\"\n\nTrump announced in February that negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war were underway following a call with Putin. Ukraine agreed to a U.S.-proposed ceasefire deal that would last 30 days following a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, though the U.S. and Ukraine both await Russia's response.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He killed our people and he didn't exchange prisoners. We signed the exchange of prisoners. But he didn't do it. What kind of diplomacy, J.D., are you speaking about? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country,\" Vance said. \"Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media.\"\n\nAt one point, Trump told Zelenskyy, \"You're gambling with World War III.\"\n\nThe meeting resulted in Trump cancelling peace negotiations for the time being and kicking the world leader out of the White House, an administration official told the Daily Caller.\n\n\"This was set up to be like every other state visit.

Just again, to understand for our people, during the war, what you don't like, even sometimes hate? Surprises,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"It's understandable. Many terrible things this war brought to us. So we don't, we don't want any surprises. Yes, that's why we want to be very fair with our partners. I think this deal was prepared by teams. It was not simple during [the] weeks, and now it's ready.

Putin joked on Thursday that he hopes that Harris wins the November elections as he initially supported President Joe Biden - before he was \"removed\" from the race - and because \"she laughs so expressively,\" according to multiple reports.\n\n\"I said that our 'favorite,' if I may say so, was the incumbent President Mr. Biden. He was removed from the race, but he recommended that all his supporters support Ms. Harris. So we will do the same, we will support her,\" Putin said during an appearance at an economic forum in southeast Russia, multiple outlets reported .\n\nVLADIVOSTOK, RUSSIA - SEPTEMBER 5: (RUSSIA OUT) Russian President Vladimir Putin gestures during the plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum 2024, September 5, 2024, in Vladivostok, Russia. Putin is having a four-days trip to the regions of Eastern Russia and Mongolia. (Photo by Contributor/Getty Images)\n\n\"She laughs so expressively and infectiously that it means that everything is fine with her. And if everything is fine with her - then Trump has introduced so many restrictions and sanctions against Russia that no president has ever introduced before - and if everything is fine with Ms. Harris, then maybe she will refrain from such actions of this kind,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin previously claimed that he hoped Biden would win the November election, arguing that he was a \"more experienced, predictable person\" and \"old school\" politician.\n\nRussia, as in past elections, has become a hot point of contention between both Democrats and Republicans. The Biden administration's Department of Justice alleged Wednesday that Russia had been targeting American citizens to promote propaganda and spread disinformation about the election.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was accused of colluding with Russia to win the 2016 election, although no evidence was ever found to support that claim. Accusations that Trump had colluded with Russia were borne out of the Steele Dossier , an intelligence file sourced by an FBI informant, which was widely debunked after revelations that it was based on unreliable or false claims and put forward by an individual working for a political firm positioned against Trump.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Trump Threatens To Turn Screws On Russia If Battlefield 'Pounding' Of Ukraine Continues\n\n(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Donald Trump threatened Russia Friday with sanctions and widespread tariffs if Kremlin forces continue attacking Ukraine.\n\nTrump said on Truth Social Friday that he was \"strongly considering\" various tariffs and sanctions on Russia if a ceasefire and final peace agreement isn't reached with Ukraine. The war has raged on for three years, claiming tens of thousands of lives while costing the U.S. over $170 billion in aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely \"pounding\" Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED,\" Trump said in his post. \"To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!\" (RELATED: Vance Lays Out How Zelenskyy Could Salvage Relationship With US In First Interview Since Oval Office Blow Up)\n\nIn this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin chairs a Security Council meeting via videoconference at the Kremlin in Moscow on March 7, 2025. (Photo by MIKHAIL METZEL/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nRussia unleashed a massive bombardment of Ukrainian infrastructure Thursday night and Friday morning, totaling 67 missiles and 194 drones, the New York Times reported Friday. Ukraine scrambled to defend, but only managed to intercept a fraction of the incoming fire.\n\nMany corporate media outlets have accused Trump of bowing to Putin in his pursuit of peace between the two nations, with the Economist saying that Ukraine was \"being sold out\" by Trump and the New York Times saying Trump had \"turned toward the Kremlin\" and that Trump has sided \"favorably\" with Putin on the war.\n\nAdditionally, prominent neoconservative politicians joined the chorus of condemnation, including former Republican Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n\"M ark my words maga, you abandon Ukraine and you will make the Afghanistan withdrawal, and the failure to act in 2014, look like brilliant strategy,\" Kinzinger, now a CNN commentator, said on X. \"Trump will be seen as the worst president in history for foreign policy. A weak weak scared boy [sic].\"\n\nTrump unofficially kicked off peace talks with a phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the White House to sign a mineral deal as a step towards peace, but a dust-up with the president in the Oval Office left the deal unsigned.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the attack was a response to Ukraine's use of U.S.-supplied long-range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, which President Joe Biden authorized Nov. 17. The decision to allow the use of the missiles by Biden puzzled national security experts who cited enormous risks with little reward.\n\n\"Suffice it to say, this is a clear attempt to box in the incoming Trump administration into backing Ukraine without conditions or limits, and it's a total affront to the democratic transition of power,\" former CIA official Michael DiMino previously told the Daily Caller News Foundation in response to the move by Biden.\n\nThe strikes started late Wednesday night and lasted for nine hours, according to NBC. Officials told NBC this was the 11th attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

He previously served as the National Security Council's chief of staff and as national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nOn Nov. 7, Trump warned Putin not to escalate the conflict with Ukraine, reportedly reminding him of the sizable U.S. military presence in Europe, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministries did not immediately respond to the DCNF's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Putin Backs Trump Admin's Ceasefire Proposal In Principle\n\nThe Russian president signaled interest in an American negotiated peace, but has not yet committed to any terms.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has agreed in principle to the 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, although the exact details would have to be brokered with the United States.\n\n\"The idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,\" Putin told a news conference in Moscow. \"But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.\"\n\nThe announcement comes days after Ukraine offered a temporary truce at the urging of the United States. In February, the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia entered its 4th year, and President Donald Trump has made ending the conflict a priority of his administration.\n\nUkraine has been vocally skeptical of any deal with Putin, pointing to his history of reneging on previous agreements. For example, the 2014 Minsk Accords, which France and Germany negotiated to end hostilities in the Donbas region, an area in eastern Ukraine with a large Russian-speaking population that rebelled against the Ukrainian government after a pro-EU revolution ousted the previous Russian-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in February of that year.\n\nThis skepticism led to a brief but very public falling out with the United States after a contentious joint press conference saw Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelenskyy ejected from the Oval Office without signing a pre-negotiated minerals deal with the United States. The rift, and the subsequent suspension of American military aid and intelligence sharing, appears to have mended on Tuesday.\n\n\"Now is the time to begin a process toward lasting peace,\" a joint statement by American and Ukrainian diplomats read. \"The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.\"\n\nThe United States has applied considerable pressure on the Ukrainians to get them to the negotiating table. It has significant leverage over the embattled nation as its primary military supplier. Still, the Trump administration recently signaled that a similar pressure campaign could be used against Russia if they refused to accept the deal.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said peace was \"up to Russia now\" and hinted that he might ramp up economic sanctions against Russia if Putin did not accept the offered ceasefire.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified this stance on Thursday in an interview with CNBC, stating that America was \"willing to apply maximum pressure on both sides\" with sanctions of 'the highest scale' on Russia.\n\nMany observers have argued that Russia has little incentive to accept the ceasefire at the moment, as their forces are currently advancing across much of the Ukrainian front, and a 30-day pause could allow the Ukrainian troops to retrench and recuperate, thus breaking their current momentum.\n\n\"A 30-day temporary ceasefire. Well, what does it give us? It gives us nothing. It only gives the Ukrainians an opportunity to regroup, gain strength and, to continue the same thing,\" Yuri Ushakov told Russian media.\n\nOthers have made the opposite case - that Russia may use the pause to rearm and recuperate before a renewed offensive.\n\nHowever, some have argued that the glacial pace of the advance, the heavy cost of each square mile, and the economic benefits of loosened sanctions could incentivize Russia to accept a deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has made considerable gains in Kursk, a Russian territory that was invaded by Ukraine roughly 7 months ago and has been slowly taken back. On Wednesday, Putin told Russian media that he expected Russian forces \"to completely free the Kursk region from the enemy in the nearest future.\"\n\nThe announcement by the Russian President came hours after American Special Envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow on Thursday to continue peace negotiations.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Morning Brief: Trump And Putin Talk Terms, Deportations Continue, And The Lab Leak Gets More Proof\n\nNews you need to know on Tuesday, March 18th.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set today to discuss peace and \"dividing up assets\" with Ukraine. Trump pushes ahead with deporting violent gang members, despite legal efforts to bring them back to the United States. And new reports show both British and German intelligence believed COVID-19 was created in a lab, but chose to suppress those findings.\n\nIt's Tuesday, March 18, and this is news you need to know to start your day. If you'd rather listen to your news, today's edition of the Morning Wire podcast can be heard below:\n\n(Photo by Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images)\n\nTopline: President Donald Trump is set to hold a potentially pivotal phone call with Russia's Vladimir Putin today as the two sides move closer to a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration proposed a 30-day pause in the fighting to allow for formal peace negotiations to kick off. The Ukrainians accepted that deal, prompting the United States to renew weapons shipments to Kyiv, but the Russians were more hesitant to agree on a ceasefire. At the moment, it seems that Putin will only agree to the deal if he has assurances that the United States would pause new weapons shipments to Ukraine and that Ukraine would not be allowed to mobilize new forces during the 30 days.\n\nOver the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters that \"the Russians say 'We support a ceasefire, but ...' And then after the 'but,' they start coming with various details to delay the process.\" He says Putin is well aware that Western support for Ukraine is starting to dwindle and wants to drag out the ceasefire process to allow his forces to gain as much territory as possible ahead of negotiations, so he'll have more leverage.\n\nTo that point, Moscow has recently launched a counteroffensive in the Kursk region - a territory in Russia that had fallen into Ukrainian hands last summer after a surprise incursion. Putin claims thousands of Ukrainian troops there are currently surrounded - he called on them to \"lay down their arms and surrender\" in exchange for their lives. The longer a ceasefire is delayed, the more time Putin will have to close in on those troops. For that reason, among others, Zelensky is calling on Trump to exert pressure on Moscow to accept the ceasefire. Over the weekend, he issued a plea for \"maximum additional sanctions\" on Russia if they continue to stall - for his part, Trump said \"we can\" do that, but \"I hope it's not necessary.\"\n\nThe Terms : Putin has shown a clear willingness to continually throw Russians into the frontlines and is unlikely to end the war if it means coming back empty-handed. Specifically, he wants to formally retain control of Crimea and the Donbas region in Eastern Ukraine. Zelensky has insisted that he'll never cede land to Putin, but at this stage, it's all but guaranteed he'll have to agree to some land being lost in order to end the war.\n\nThe potential deployment of peacekeeping forces to Ukraine will likely be another point of contention in negotiations. Putin has made clear from day one that he will never agree to a deal that includes NATO membership for Ukraine - Europe and the United States seem to have conceded that point. As an alternative, Ukraine has pushed for European peacekeepers within its borders after the war. European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, have already agreed to provide boots on the ground, although it remains unclear if Putin will accept a European-backed security guarantee.\n\nEl Salvador Presidency / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nTopline: A showdown over a planeload of suspected Tren de Aragua gang members has pitted immigrant activists against Trump. The administration is moving forward with the deportation of more than 250 individuals despite legal moves from the ACLU.\n\nOn Friday night, President Trump signed an executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allowed suspected gang members in the country illegally to be deported without a judicial hearing. The signing wasn't promoted, but the media caught wind of it on Saturday morning. The ACLU quickly filed a lawsuit trying to stop the deportations - a court order issued by federal Judge James Boasberg temporarily barred the Trump administration from deporting illegals under the 18th-century statute. By Saturday afternoon, however, the planes were already in the air, having departed from Texas to El Salvador, where the deported were to be housed in a prison for gang members. The Trump administration claims that by the time Judge James Boasberg's order was issued, the flight was already outside United States airspace.\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan dismissed Judge Boasberg's order, saying he and Trump will not stop until America is safe. \"Every day, the men and women of ICE are going to be out there arresting criminal illegal aliens,\" Homan said. \"I don't care what the judges think. I don't care what the Left thinks. We're coming.\"\n\nThe Trump DOJ filed a response to Boasberg's order contesting the authority of a single judge to halt national policy efforts. \"Plaintiffs cannot use these proceedings to interfere with the President's national-security and foreign-affairs authority.\" One senior official told Axios that there were discussions in the administration about whether the planes needed to turn back, but after meeting with legal counsel, they decided they could proceed with the deportations.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday that \"if the Democrats want to argue in favor of turning a plane full of rapists, murderers, and gangsters back to the United States, that's a fight we are more than happy to take.\" Trump and his team are testing the limits of executive power and likely expect this to be settled by the Supreme Court.\n\nJudge Boasberg told the DOJ to provide details on the flights in a sworn declaration by noon ET today.\n\nThe Numbers: In the first 50 days of the Trump administration, ICE made more than 32,000 enforcement arrests, just a hair shy of the total number of arrests made in all of fiscal year 2024. Nearly half of those arrested were convicted criminals and about a third had pending criminal charges, meaning 75% of those arrested were accused or convicted criminals. Illegal border crossings also fell by 94% in February compared to the previous year, and illegal encounters at the Del Rio Sector declined by 99% since 2023.\n\n(Photo by Kobus Louw via Getty Images)\n\nTopline: We learned this week that the former head of the U.K.'s foreign intelligence agency told the British prime minister in early 2020 that COVID-19 escaped from the infamous Wuhan lab. The revelation follows reports out of Germany showing that its government allegedly had similar information, as did the United States and China.\n\nThis week, a memo sent by the former head of MI6 to then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed that as early as 2020, British intelligence believed that COVID was leaked from a Chinese lab and that the Chinese government was conducting an international disinformation campaign to avoid taking responsibility for an outbreak that would go on to kill millions of people.\n\nThe memo says, beyond a reasonable doubt, \"the Wuhan Institute of Virology retro-engineered a bat virus in January 2020. We surmise that this was done to align with COVID-19 to sustain the natural causation narrative.\"\n\nThe German Connection : A few days before the British announcement, two major newspapers in Germany revealed that the German foreign intelligence service, their version of the CIA, had also believed that there was an 80 to 90 percent chance that the coronavirus had leaked from a Chinese lab.\n\n\"The implications of this conspiracy - I think it's the correct word in this case - are pretty significant,\" independent journalist Michael Shellenberger told Morning Wire. \"It would suggest that the U.S., U.K., Chinese, and German governments all knew that the virus escaped from the lab, arguably as early as January, and we had reported that the U.S. intelligence community had known, in fact, the names of the first three people to be infected by the Covid virus, and that didn't come out.\"\n\nCongressional investigations found that the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where COVID-19 is thought to have originated, received funding for gain-of-function research on coronaviruses from the American National Institute of Health.\n\nShellenberger told Morning Wire that the memo \"obviously implicates a number of senior American officials, including Anthony Fauci, but it may have meant that our response to the virus may have been different had we known that it had come from a lab.\" Fauci was issued a preemptive pardon by former President Joe Biden shortly before President Trump took office. Trump has argued that Fauci's blanket pardon is \"void\" because it was signed with an autopen.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Putin rejected an unconditional ceasefire offered by American and Ukrainian negotiators earlier this month, but did accept an offer to restrict attacks on energy infrastructure in both countries. Further negotiations will be conducted in Saudi Arabia, and will include discussions on potentially expanding the partial ceasefire to include the Black Sea as an intermediate step to a full ceasefire.\n\n\"I had a positive, very substantive, and frank conversation with President of the United States Donald Trump,\" Zelensky said in a statement posted to X , the platform formerly known as Twitter. \"We believe that together with America, with President Trump, and under American leadership, lasting peace can be achieved this year.\"\n\nTrump also seemed optimistic about the ongoing peace talks, and said that he and Zelenskyy had a \"very good phone call\", a far cry from the explosive confrontation between the two leaders last month during a joint press conference in the Oval Office.\n\n\"Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs,\" Trump posted on Truth Social . \"We are very much on track, and I will ask Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, to give an accurate description of the points discussed.\"\n\nRubio and Waltz put out a joint statement shortly afterward, describing the conversation as \"fantastic\" and offering up additional details, including Ukrainian requests for additional air defense systems, prisoner exchanges, and the thousands of missing Ukrainian children allegedly abducted and taken into Russia.\n\nTrump and Zelensky also discussed Ukraine's energy supply, including its nuclear power plants. Trump proposed American investment in and ownership of parts of Ukraine's grid, apparently following a similar train of thought to the previously proposed minerals deal, which would have created an American economic interest in Ukraine and potentially put America contractors in the way of future Russian aggression.\n\nThe risk of killing American civilians or harming American interests could act as a deterrent in lieu of a traditional security guarantee. \"American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,\" the joint statement from Rubio and Waltz read.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Putin congratulated Trump on his electoral victory on Thursday, saying , \"His behavior at the moment of an attempt on his life left an impression on me. He turned out to be a brave man. ... He manifested himself in the very correct way, bravely as a man.\" He added that Trump's statements \"about the desire to restore relations with Russia, to help end the Ukrainian crisis, in my opinion, deserves attention at least.\"\n\nMATT WALSH'S 'AM I RACIST?' NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+\n\n\"Trump's initial calls with world leaders are not being conducted with the support of the State Department and U.S. government interpreters,\" the Post complained, adding, \"The Trump transition team has yet to sign an agreement with the General Services Administration, a standard procedure for presidential transitions. Trump and his aides are distrustful of career government officials following the leaked transcripts of presidential calls during his first term.\"\n\n\"President Trump won a historic election decisively and leaders from around the world know America will return to prominence on the world stage,\" Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, stated. \"That is why leaders have begun the process of developing stronger relationships with the 45th and 47th President because he represents global peace and stability.\"\n\n\"Trump talked during his campaign about how he sees everything through deals, that he can make a deal that will lead everyone to peace. At least he talks about peace, not about confrontation and the desire to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated, calling Trump \"less predictable\" than President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and adding that it was \"less predictable to what extent Trump will stick to the statements he made during the election campaign. Let's wait and see.\"\n\nIn September, speaking in North Carolina, Trump said of the Russia-Ukraine war, \"Any deal - the worst deal - would've been better than what we have now. If they made a bad deal it would've been much better. They would've given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years. ... What deal can we make? It's demolished.

We have offered our assistance to that investigation.\"\n\nRasim Musabayov, a member of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan, said on Friday that the evidence pointing to Russia shooting down the plane was overwhelming.\n\n\"If someone thinks that we are allies with Russia and therefore we would close our eyes on everything, then they are mistaken,\" he told The New York Times. \"There aren't that many countries that are on good terms with Russia now,\" he added. \"If Moscow doesn't make the right steps in this situation the list might get shorter.\"\n\nHe also demanded that Russia explain why the plane diverted out of Russian air space and was not allowed to land.\n\nSources familiar with the investigation told The Wall Street Journal that Russia not only refused to allow the plane to land on its soil, it intentionally jammed the plane's GPS.\n\nA local Azerbaijani publication said that the plane was redirected to land in the Kazakh city of Aktau.\n\n\"It can be assumed that this recommendation was given with one goal: to have the aircraft crash into the Caspian Sea, where all witnesses would perish and the aircraft would sink,\" the publication said.\n\nBecause the plane had been targeted with GPS jammers, it stopped sending radar information about its location, which would have made it difficult to find had it crashed in the Caspian Sea.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Trump Leads Russia, Ukraine To Agreements On Black Sea Ceasefire, Ban On Energy Facility Attacks\n\nThe agreements, while not a total ceasefire, are a major step toward a long-lasting peace deal.\n\nThe Trump administration has successfully pushed Russia and Ukraine to reach separate agreements with the United States on a truce that will ensure safe passage on the Black Sea, along with a ban on either country conducting strikes on energy facilities.\n\n\"The United States and Russia have agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea,\" the White House said in a statement .\n\nReuters reported that both countries have agreed to allow the United States to enforce the deals. Both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stressed that for the ceasefire to be successful, the United States needs to provide guarantees.\n\n\"If the Russians violate this, then I have a direct question for President Trump. If they violate, here is the evidence - we ask for sanctions, we ask for weapons, etc,\" Zelensky said at a press conference.\n\nSpeaking for the Russians, Lavrov said, \"We will need clear guarantees. And given the sad experience of agreements with just Kyiv, the guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelenskiy and his team to do one thing and not the other.\"\n\nThe agreements, while not a total ceasefire, are the biggest steps taken toward a long-lasting peace deal since Russia invaded Ukraine over three years ago. The separate agreements were mediated by U.S. officials in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, after President Donald Trump spoke to both Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.\n\nIn the agreement, the Trump administration promised to help Russia gain access to markets for agricultural exports after numerous countries hit the Russians with sanctions following the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine. The White House added that President Trump will continue \"working toward achieving a durable and lasting peace.\"\n\n\"The United States reiterated President Donald J. Trump's imperative that the killing on both sides of the Russia-Ukraine conflict must stop, as the necessary step toward achieving an enduring peace settlement,\" the White House added. \"To that end, the United States will continue facilitating negotiations between both sides to achieve a peaceful resolution, in line with the agreements made in Riyadh.\"\n\nSince taking office, Trump has made it one of his top foreign policy priorities to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Last month, Trump and Vice President JD Vance ripped Zelensky in the Oval Office on national TV. During the meeting, Trump told the Ukrainian leader, \"You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards. You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "website": "https://thefederalist.com",
      "text": "Critics Of Tucker Carlson's Putin Interview Misunderstand The Content And Context\n\nThe Putin interview has raised many questions - but here are a few answers.\n\nFor all of legacy media's efforts to discourage people from watching Tucker Carlson's historic interview of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the effect was, well, the Streisand effect , creating a fever pitch of audience interest.\n\nIf subsequent commentary is any indication, however, the interview, with Putin's lengthy monologue on history that seems arcane to Americans, his evident clarity of mind and even flashes of charm, and Carlson's own (admitted) confusion by the direction Putin took the discussion, has raised at least as many questions as it answered.\n\nHaving now listened to the interview multiple times, here's some background to contextualize Putin's remarks.\n\nWestern analysts of Russia - Reagan adviser Richard Pipes being a notable exception - have been spectacularly wrong for decades. Take, for example, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. It caught the State Department, the media, and everyone else completely flat-footed.\n\nWorse, they declared victory prematurely. Former New York Times Moscow Bureau Chief and Pulitzer Prize-winner Hedrick Smith captured the zeitgeist of the moment in his bestseller The New Russians . The dissolution of the Soviet Union was, he said, \"a modern enactment of one of the archetypal stories of human existence, that of the struggle from darkness to light, from poverty toward prosperity, from dictatorship toward democracy.\"\n\nSeems laughable now, doesn't it?\n\nBut this was a period of extraordinary, almost utopian, optimism. The Berlin Wall had come down only two years before the demise of the Soviet Union. An event, largely forgotten now, that seemed unthinkable. I recall about this same time buying a (pirated) CD of The Scorpions' song \"Wind of Change,\" which celebrated these events and spoke of Western brotherhood with Russia. Where did I buy it? In Red Square of all places.\n\nWho could have ever imagined that? Then a graduate student in Russian history, I didn't. Neither did the experts. The point is, when it comes to Russia, everyone is guessing. If this was true when analysts were honest, it is doubly so now that they are dishonest. In their telling of it, Putin was lying to Carlson. Was he lying when he said the Canadian Parliament gave a standing ovation to a former member of the Waffen-SS simply because he had killed Russians in World War II? Was he lying about Obama's CIA engineering a coup d'état of Ukraine's government in 2014? No, he wasn't.\n\nThe Western mind was shaped by the social and cultural forces of the Renaissance, Reformation, Enlightenment, and Scientific Revolution. Russia experienced none of these. As a consequence, Russian thinking is alien to Americans. Churchill was right: \"Russia is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.\"\n\nSo when Putin began the interview with a narrative of Russo-Ukrainian history and how the first Russian state was not founded in Moscow or St. Petersburg, but in Kiev - which is accepted as historical fact and key to his argument - it seemed, as Carlson himself put it, like a \"filibuster.\"\n\nTo Putin, however, this history matters. But to Americans who have little sense of their own history and even less of others', it was diversionary. That is because America was founded and built by people who were very consciously leaving their histories behind. We are a forward-looking people.\n\nNot Russians. Novelist Leon Uris wrote, \"In Ireland there is no future, only the past happening over and over again.\" The same might be said of Russia.\n\nI cannot overemphasize this point. A couple of weeks ago, I was in Cairo. Bring up 9/11 there - and I would caution you in doing so - and Muslims will go straight to the Crusades. (As did Osama bin Laden, by the way, in offering his justification for the attacks.) They see the whole of subsequent history as an accident. The point isn't whether they - or Putin - are right. The point is that they are both passionate believers in their own historical narratives.\n\nIn this, he is not wrong. If the founding of the Rurikid dynasty in the ninth century belongs to some misty, forgotten past in American minds, the past 30 years of U.S.-Russia relations certainly should not.\n\nThroughout the Cold War, the Soviets followed an unswerving commitment to Marxist dogma when it came to \"global revolution.\" This was a policy of expansionism . Those who grew up in this era will recall the documentaries to which we were all subjected throughout our education. Disney-like animation depicted, accurately, the red hammer and sickle flag of the USSR bleeding outward from Russia to other parts of the world.\n\nThis was George Kennan's \"domino theory,\" the idea that countries would fall to communism like dominoes until Russia was on our very doorstep. It seemed this was becoming a nightmarish reality when, in 1959, Cuba fell to Marxists and the Soviets attempted to put ballistic missiles there. JFK threatened nuclear war if Khrushchev forced the issue.\n\nPutin says in the interview that when the USSR self-destructed, it was the hope of Russians to be accepted into the community of Western nations, not as a belligerent as in times past, but as a partner. One might be skeptical of the claim, but I can confirm that at least at ground level this is true.\n\nWhen I was in Russia in the early and late '90s and again in the early 2000s, Russians greeted Americans excitedly. You've never experienced hospitality as the Russians offered it. They liked Americans and wanted very much to be liked by them. They weren't, as they saw it, the bad guys in a fluke Olympic hockey game or \"Rocky IV,\" but a free people, and they wanted to be treated as equals.\n\nBut now, in the years that followed the implosion of the USSR, U.S. policy toward Russia, which had heretofore been cautious and even respectful, became swaggeringly arrogant and aggressive. The U.S., via its NATO puppet, enacted a kind of domino theory in reverse, expanding that military alliance eastward to Russia's very border:\n\n1994: Sweden and Finland become partner states.\n\n1999: Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland are added.\n\n2004: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia are all added. The first three on this list are Russian border states.\n\n2008: Discussions with Ukraine begin, angering Russia.\n\nThis brings us to the pivot year and what Putin called \"The Main Thing.\" Russia's posture toward post-Soviet Ukraine has been that it must be free from Western meddling and preferably pro-Russian.\n\nBut in 2014, after many guarantees to Russia from the U.S. that Ukraine would remain an independent neutral state, Obama's CIA toppled a freely elected, but pro-Russian , Ukrainian government, replacing it with a pro-U.S. regime. This was followed by what was, for Russia, a final provocation: Ukraine was invited to join NATO.\n\nPutin responded by invading eastern Ukraine that same year in a preemptive effort to get the upper hand in what he regarded as the U.S.'s aim all along: to use Ukraine in a proxy war against Russia.\n\nWhen I was last in Moscow in 2017, I think, Russians remained friendly, but the enthusiasm of the first decade of the post-Soviet Era was gone. Replacing it was a cynicism about U.S. intentions and the promise that freedom would hold for them if only they would abandon communism. Now there was, unbelievable to the Western mind, a growing nostalgia for the iron-fisted days of Stalin.\n\nInsofar as this post-Soviet Era optimism and subsequent pessimism are concerned, my experiences in Ukraine in the early 2000s - and another six to seven visits over the next decade - mirrored those in Russia if for somewhat different reasons. Ukrainians saw America as a strategic ally, yes, but were finding democracy not to be the end-all they thought it would be. Freedom requires self-reliance, responsibility, a work ethic, and time consciousness - all things 75 years of socialism destroyed if ever they existed in Ukraine or Russia. (And I'm inclined to say they did not.)\n\nBy the time I was there doing research for my first book, The Grace Effect , which is, in a sense, a history of Ukraine, there was a growing desire among many Ukrainians, some 16 percent, to reunite with Russia. Sixteen percent isn't a majority, but it isn't nothing, and it reflected the ideological fractures within this historically unstable region. My own interpreter on one of these visits, a Ukrainian, talked incessantly of his admiration for Stalin. He was not an anomaly at that time.\n\nRussians, however, increasingly saw us as an aggressor. If you dared engage them on political questions - and it's hard not to on a Friday night in Moscow - they would reasonably ask: Why does NATO still exist? \"The Evil Empire,\" as Reagan called the Soviet Union, which constituted the very purpose for NATO's existence, was dead. The Warsaw Pact, its opposition, had been dissolved. So why, they wanted to know, did we maintain such military partnerships, and against whom was the alliance directed? (If such questions were asked over shots of vodka - and they always were - you were likely to see a very different side of the Russian character.)\n\nPutin made this point in the Carlson interview, saying that when he asked this question of then-President George W. Bush, he was told the alliance wasn't to guard against a Russian invasion of Europe, but to defend against a possible Iranian nuclear attack on the continent. Putin, who isn't a fool, rightly regarded this response as dishonest. (A cynic might say that the answer to why NATO still exists lies somewhere in Eisenhower's warning of the growing influence of a \"military-industrial complex.\")\n\nPutin recounted all of this history (and more) in a barely interrupted monologue without consulting a single note. His recounting of the ancient, complicated history of Russia and Ukraine is accurate to a point. But he downplayed Stalin's atrocities, saying: \"Stalin's time ... which as many claim saw numerous violations of human rights...\" It is much more than a claim. It is true.\n\nHe also used the fact that many Ukrainians share the Russian language and culture as a justification for the annexation of Ukraine. Hitler employed similar reasoning in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and elsewhere. It is the justification of conquerors. It also ignores Russia's policy, begun by the Tsars in the 19th century and continued by the Bolsheviks, of \"Russification.\" This policy outlawed Ukrainian language and culture and mandated they be replaced with Russian language and culture. (My own daughter, adopted from Ukraine and wholly Ukrainian, was taught Russian, not Ukrainian.)\n\nEven so, Putin came off as cool and reasonable throughout the interview. But make no mistake about it, he's ruthless. I remind you of the Kursk submariners, the Spetsnaz assault on a Moscow theater, and Chechnya. Putin, it is alleged, has arrested, imprisoned, and assassinated both journalists and rivals. He recognizes the criminality of the Biden administration because he's a criminal too. But there is this key difference between them: Putin is a Russian patriot who will do anything for Russia; Biden sold his soul and his country for personal gain.\n\nThe forever (proxy) war with Russia cannot be blamed on Biden nor even on Democrats alone. American hostility to Russia in the post-Soviet Era began with Clinton, was continued by George W. Bush, saw escalation with Obama, and was escalated still further by Biden.\n\nIgnore the lofty rhetoric of T-shirts and lapel pins. This war isn't about freedom, democracy, or human rights violations in Ukraine. That's a smokescreen. The Biden administration couldn't care less about the Ukrainian people. Nor are they troubled by Putin's tyranny and election rigging. After all, they are election-rigging tyrant wannabes. (Putin imprisoned his chief rival Alexei Navalny just as Democrats are trying to imprison Donald Trump, and Jan. 6 is about as Putin as it gets .)\n\nThe war on Putin is driven by two factors dear to the modern left. First, Putin opposes their aims in Ukraine. That country is not only a primary source of flesh for human traffickers, but the U.S. is using it for money laundering. Putin's opposition to the Biden administration isn't moral in nature any more than theirs is to him. Rather, this is a mafia turf war. He undoubtedly reasons that if anyone is going to exploit Ukraine, it will be Russia.\n\nSecond, Putin isn't a globalist. Some have argued he is. But Russian patriotism - or American or Italian or Irish or British patriotism - is incompatible with globalism, and Putin, who controls the largest land mass on the planet, is a patriot.\n\nI admire Carlson's courage given that the Biden administration did everything short of assassinating him to prevent this interview. Post-interview, he has been subjected to repulsive personal attacks for doing what any journalist with integrity would do. His position was impossible. On the one hand, he needed to appear tough; on the other, he needed to be fair - all while doing it in the Kremlin.\n\nIn the end, Carlson generally opted to get out of the way and let Putin speak, an approach foreign to a compromised media class that is sure we need to hear them more than the subject of the interview. Three years in the making, Carlson had no guarantees. A wrong move, a wrong question, and they might have Brittney Grinered him.\n\nBut he knew Putin wanted this interview. Why? Because, villain that he is, Putin calculated he had less to hide in Ukraine than does the Biden administration.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "In Protecting The KGB, Gorbachev Laid The Foundation For Putin's Gangster-State\n\nThe notorious KGB chairman Yuri Andropov recruited Mikhail Gorbachev, cultivated him, and placed him in the Kremlin leadership to ultimately take power. Once he led the Soviet Communist Party, Andropov's recruit protected and rewarded the Soviet secret police by making it off-limits to any truth-telling, accountability, or reform.\n\nGorbachev has died, but the KGB that he nurtured and protected lives on under an ungrateful Vladimir Putin.\n\nUntil the day he passed away at age 91, Gorbachev got an international pass for saving the core of Soviet power: the ever-watching secret police and its global spy and active measures networks.\n\nGorbachev didn't stand up for the KGB's victims. While he opened Soviet society, he protected the tormentors. He shielded the KGB from the \"openness\" of glasnost, keeping it unaccountable for decades of industrial-scale crimes. He insulated it from the reorganization of perestroika. Gorbachev even preserved the KGB's cult-like devotion to the Bolshevik Cheka. To this day, Russian intelligence and security officers still call themselves chekisti or chekists.\n\nHe kept the KGB's entire archives secret to save the chekists' reputation and prestige.\n\nThe internal repression and informant files? Gorbachev kept them secret and the networks operational. The international subversion files? All secret. The Soviet terror network files? Secret. Indeed, as the USSR was collapsing, Gorbachev promoted one of the architects of the Soviet terror network, Yevgeny Primakov, to run KGB foreign intelligence.\n\nHe knew the big names in Western business, politics, journalism, and culture who worked for the KGB or the Soviet Communist Party. He could have known all the names had he chosen too. He could have exposed them all. But he protected them. And they heap praise on him today.\n\nGorbachev could have un-done the KGB's ghoulish presence with the stroke of a pen. But he didn't do it.\n\nWhen, under perestroika, Gorbachev authorized the creation of joint ventures with foreign companies, he required a KGB officer to be assigned as a vice president of each enterprise. This undermined enduring economic reforms, subverted western companies, and built the foundation for the KGB gangster-state that would beget Putin.\n\nGorbachev made sure that glasnost and perestroika would keep the KGB on top. He never permitted lustration, the screening out of KGB assets from holding posts of public trust, the way the post-Communist Czechs and East Germans were doing. He did not permit the KGB's victims to see their files. He protected every last KGB informant.\n\nHe never truly sought to become part of the civilized world by ripping out the KGB's peerless global human intelligence networks, subversive political warfare penetrations and operations, and putting it all out on the table so such cancer could never spread again.\n\nIndeed, Gorbachev gave the KGB so much power that the chekists, under KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov, led the coup to overthrow him in August 1991.\n\nAnd when Gorbachev returned to the Kremlin, in a meeting with the presidents of the union republics of the USSR, he did nothing to punish the secret police. Instead, it was Boris Yeltsin who gleefully forced a reluctant Gorbachev to sign a decree dividing the KGB into separate parts. Gorbachev's handwriting on the decree, never meant for public view, is strained, as if under duress.\n\nEven so, the splitting up of the Soviet KGB kept the hated old chekist apparatus in place. Nothing was torn out by the roots. No perpetrators were investigated, let alone put on trial. Gorbachev held nobody accountable - and his fans in the West didn't hold him accountable, either.\n\nThe KGB's First Chief Directorate that did the foreign spying was simply renamed Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The chekisti Second Chief Directorate responsible for \"internal security\" changed its name to what is now called the Federal Security Service, the FSB.\n\nThe world today is confronting the results of Gorbachev's strategy to preserve the chekist legacy and the KGB itself, to protect all perpetrators and deny justice to its victims, and to merge KGB officers into the rising gangster state. Gorbachev paved the way for the rise of Vladimir Putin. He had thirty years to reconsider. Thirty years to expose. He never did.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "If It's 'Propaganda' That Zelensky Provoked Putin, The New York Times Is Guilty Of Spreading It\n\nIt's apparently pro-Putin to say anything besides 'I stand with Ukraine and Zelensky is hot,' but it's worth recounting what the Times said.\n\nTucker Carlson spouted more pro-Putin propaganda on his Fox News show this week, arguing that the \"collision\" between Ukraine and Russia was long coming and that it was provoked by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, with tacit approval from President Joe Biden.\n\nWait, I got that wrong. It wasn't this week, and it wasn't Tucker Carlson. It was The New York Times. My mistake!\n\nThe paper's Moscow bureau chief, Anton Troianovski, made that exact case in an episode of the Times' \"The Daily\" podcast on March 8 . It's apparently pro-Putin to say anything other than \"I stand with Ukraine and Zelensky is hot,\" but it's worth recounting what Troianovski said: that Russia was initially hopeful of a cooperative relationship with Zelensky, but after Biden was elected, the Ukrainian president felt encouraged to take a more antagonistic position on Putin.\n\nTroianovski said it was Ukraine's rejection of a Covid vaccine developed by Russia in 2020 that first indicated Zelensky was \"taking a pro-Western route and being skeptical, being cautious of getting too close to Russia.\" And thereafter, Zelensky \"became more outspoken\" about Ukraine joining NATO , a notion that has always been treated by Russia as a security threat.\n\nTroianovski said that then the transition from President Donald Trump, who was, at best, ambivalent toward Ukraine, to Biden, who had a heightened interest, created more tension. Biden, Troianovski said, \"comes in, of course, with a message of much greater support for Ukraine to take a path that brings it closer to Western institutions and takes it farther away from Russia.\"\n\nFor Zelensky, Biden's inauguration was a green light, the reporter said. And just so there's no mistake that these are the words of a high-level New York Times correspondent and not some Russia State television message I'm relaying on my own, here's what Troianovski said in full:\n\n\"So what happens is just days after Biden is inaugurated, Zelensky cracks down on a business tycoon in Ukraine named Viktor Medvedchuk. And that's important because Medvedchuk is basically the closest link remaining between Ukraine and the Kremlin. Putin is the godfather of Medvedchuk's daughter. Medvedchuk runs a political party that is fairly pro-Russian. He was running several TV channels that were pro-Russian, and early last year, Zelensky closes those TV channels, starts an investigation into Medvedchuk. Last May, Medvedchuk was put under house arrest under suspicion of treason. So Zelensky took all these steps that were very aggressive, and that was something that clearly annoyed Putin greatly and in retrospect was likely one of the factors that exacerbated the situation between Ukraine and Russia.\"\n\nWhen Zelensky closed down those TV channels just after Biden's inauguration, he added insult to injury by tweeting at the time, \"Ukraine strongly supports freedom of speech. Not propaganda financed by the aggressor country that undermines Ukraine on its way to the [European Union] and EuroAtlantic integration.\"\n\nTroianovski's colleague Michael Barbaro summarized. \"So Anton, you're saying the shift in the U.S. presidency from Trump to Biden represented to Zelensky that he had more Western support,\" Barbaro said, \"and that basically he had some backup if he wanted to cross Putin and so it's then that he starts taking more and more aggressive steps to move away from Russia.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Troianovski replied, \"and as [Zelensky's] presidency progressed, he found himself more and more on a collision course with Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nBlowing air in the face of a dog doesn't mean you deserve to get your nose bitten off, but it's a possibility easily avoided by keeping your mouth shut. Likewise, to acknowledge reality isn't to say Russia is justified in declaring war on Ukraine. But maybe it was a mistake for Zelensky, under the impression that Biden's America was eager to fight Ukraine's battles, to flex on Putin.\n\nAnd if the truth is considered pro-Russia propaganda, The New York Times has a lot to answer for.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Why Is Putin Talking About 'De-Nazifying' Ukraine?\n\nWhen Vladimir Putin speaks of de-Nazification, what he really means is to Russify - to return to the age of the Tsars circa the 1860s.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has proffered, as one of his rationales for invading Ukraine, the need to \"de-Nazify\" the nation. Russian propaganda, some people sympathetic to it, and others perhaps well-meaning, points to the Azov Battalion in Ukraine as proof of that nation's Nazi leanings.\n\nTo preface this discussion, it's important to put into context what Putin means by de-Nazification. Both the Nazis under Hitler and the Soviet Union, especially in the early years under Lenin, emphasized national identity.\n\nBecause the Soviet Union sought to be a global communist empire, it anticipated a host of Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs) for everybody: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and even Germany, Hungary, and the rest of Europe. Under this construct, the SSRs would be united in their international communist ideology, but unique in their national identity. In this, Lenin and later generations of Kremlin leaders, rightly surmised that the larger an empire is, the more leeway it must grant its provinces, at the risk of fomenting rebellion.\n\nIt was in this early time of the U.S.S.R.'s history that Ukraine saw a resurgence of its language, literature, and national identity after decades of Russification under the Tsars.\n\nThus, when Putin speaks of de-Nazification, what he really means is to Russify - to return to the age of the Tsars circa the 1860s, when Russia imposed a 40-year ban on the publication of books and newspapers in Ukrainian.\n\nPutin's insular view of what it means to be de-Nazified aside, there appear to be some actual armed neo-Nazis in Ukraine in the form of the Azov Battalion. What is the Azov Battalion and how did it come into being? Just as importantly, is it uniquely Ukrainian, or are there similar groups elsewhere?\n\nIn late 2013, as Ukraine's fourth president, the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych, approached his fourth year of a five-year term, political unrest - known as the Euromaidan protests - grew out of a public desire for closer integration with the European Union rather than Russia. By February 2014, Yanukovych had fled to Russia while Russia was invading Crimea and sending Russian officers to the Donbas Basin provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, in Ukraine's east.\n\nIn the chaos of 2014, the Ukrainian military, which had been left in disrepair and hobbled by corruption and cronyism, was wholly inadequate to the task of defending the nation. Crimea fell almost without a shot, while Donetsk and Luhansk were rapidly brought under de facto Russian control. Mariupol, the second-largest city in Donetsk with some 430,000 residents, was abandoned under pressure by Ukrainian government forces in May 2014.\n\nBut five weeks later, government forces, including the Azov Battalion, retook the city. Three months later, the Russian-backed separatists of the Donetsk People's Republic tried again to take Mariupol, and again, the Azov Battalion played a leading role in keeping the city under Ukrainian control.\n\nAt the time, the Azov Battalion's insignia and the ideology of its leadership and rank-and-file wer openly neo-Nazi. The unit was also accused of war crimes, including using torture on their Russian-backed enemy. When confronted with the similarity between the Azov Battalion's unit patch and that of the German Nazi 2nd SS Panzer Division, Azov officials denied the connection, claiming that their symbol is an abbreviation for the slogan \"National Idea.\" (In Ukrainian, the letters \"H\" and \"I\" are tilted to the right by 45 degrees.)\n\nChris Joyner , writing for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on March 4, quoted Prof. David Malet, an expert on transnational fighters with the School of Public Affairs at American University, who noted that as the Ukrainian military gained proficiency, it sought to tame the Azov Battalion and discourage foreign extremists from volunteering in Ukraine. Malet told Joyner, \"A lot of Russian propaganda has focused on Nazi ties, trying to paint all the volunteers in Ukraine as Nazis, when again it's probably been a pretty good mix of it on both sides.\"\n\nOf course, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish, as was the nation's previous prime minister , Volodymyr Groysman. This led Hans Jakob-Schindler, senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, to sarcastically note of Putin's claims of Ukraine as a Nazi state was, \" apparently, a very new kind of Nazi that only a Russian understands how that works .\"\n\nReinforcing Groysman's view, the 450-member Ukrainian parliament, or Rada, only has one member from a party accused of neo-Nazi leanings. Svoboda , founded in 1991 at the dissolution of the Soviet Union, recruited skinheads and employed neo-Nazi symbols in the 1990s, only to later moderate. It reached its apex in the 2012 election, winning 10 percent of the vote and 37 seats. In the 2019 election, Svoboda received only 2 percent of the vote.\n\nReturning to Malet, his contention that there's a \"good mix\" of neo-Nazi-like groups in both Ukraine and Russia is important for context.\n\nPutin has his own ultra-nationalist groups. For instance, in 2014, a Russian motorcycle gang with close Putin ties known as the \"Night Wolves,\" was used as the vanguard of the Crimea invasion - inaugurating a new era of so-called \"hybrid warfare.\" By streaming into Crimea, the Night Wolves showed that the Ukrainian central government was powerless. The gang's ideology is based on contempt for a decadent and rootless West with its leader Alexander Zaldostanov admitting that \" death to faggots \" might be an appropriate motto.\n\nIn some sense, the rise of nationalism has paced the rise of globalism and the subsequent disorienting displacements of work and dilution of culture. One reaction to this can be seen in the concurrent rise of neo-paganism.\n\nWhen I enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1983, I never saw pagan symbology. By the time I retired as a lieutenant colonel in the Army National Guard in 2007, it was noticeable, but not yet widespread. Interestingly, when I toured Folsom Prison in 2006 while a member of the California State Assembly, the prison chaplain told us the two fastest-growing faiths behind bars were Islam and Wicca, the latter being a revival of paganism.\n\nThere is a certain logic in this. Christianity is a global faith, making no distinction between people. Further, Christianity teaches forgiveness, to love one's enemy, and to turn the other cheek. In the context of the profession of arms - or the dangerous reality of being incarcerated - Christianity may be seen by some as weak, whereas paganism can appeal to a warrior ethos.\n\nInsofar as Ukraine and Putin's Nazi accusations against the nation, the question is whether actual Nazis with real animus towards the Jewish people and other minorities can gain a foothold and use their power to persecute people. This prospect appears vanishingly small, and, if Ukraine survives as an independent nation, even less so.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Has Putin Miscalculated His Ability To Take Ukraine Swiftly?\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine by the armed forces of Russia at Russian President Vladimir Putin's orders marks the first time since 1945 that Russia has engaged in a conventional war with a near-peer nation.\n\nUkraine isn't restive Warsaw Pact nations, it isn't Afghanistan, it isn't Chechnya, it isn't Georgia, and it isn't Crimea.\n\nThe conflict launched by Putin is on a far grander scale than the invasion of Crimea in 2014, launched as Ukraine's last pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovych, was driven from office in a popular uprising.\n\nPutin, by choosing to reach beyond the ethnic-Russian majority separatist provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas Basin, has decided to end the independent, Western-looking Ukrainian government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and install a pro-Putin quisling.\n\nAnd while the fog of war, some deliberate mis-and disinformation operations by the combatants, and the far-from-perfect filter of Western media leaves much unknown at this time, what is known is that Zelenskyy is still in power a day after the Russian offensive. Further, the Ukrainian military appears to be taking a toll on the Russians invading from three sides: south across the Pripyat Marshes from Russian satellite Belarus; west from Russia, including Donbas; and north from the Black Sea in the region of Odessa and Transnistria, a Russian client breakaway state in Moldavia.\n\nModern conventional war is extremely difficult to do well. Imagine being a conductor of an orchestra, all while the audience was lobbing soccer balls at you and your musicians as you perform J.S. Bach's Chaconne in D - that's modern warfare. Putin is attempting a highly complicated operation over large distances in the face of a determined foe. Further, he's doing so with an army largely composed of conscripts serving for only one year.\n\nSince Putin has decided to oust the Ukrainian government, this means that every day Zelenskyy remains in office is another day that adds to Ukrainian national confidence to resist - and another day that Putin looks to have miscalculated.\n\nAnd as the war drags on, there are five things that may happen beyond the war in Ukraine.\n\nFirst, Putin might expand the conflict even further-perhaps to the Baltic states.\n\nSecond, Finland and Sweden may seek to join NATO. We should let them.\n\nThird, China may come to Russia's aid in some form or view the conflict as an opportunity to attack Taiwan.\n\nFourth, volunteer units from Poland, the Baltic nations, and beyond, may seek to join the effort against Russia.\n\nAnd lastly, if the Zelenskyy government survives and maintains the support of its people, Putin's 22-year-reign will be in jeopardy.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Kremlin Drone Attack Is One More Reason To Stop The Russia-Ukraine War\n\nInstead of denying involvement and encouraging escalation, Biden needs to recognize that a missile strike on the capitol of a nuclear power is an invitation to World War III.\n\nFor Washington, it was just another day in the war that has become the primary focus of American foreign and defense policy. But May 3 brought another reminder of the potentially catastrophic nature of the open-ended U.S. commitment to Ukraine.\n\nAs The New York Times was forced to admit , the drone strike on the Kremlin, the historic building that is the center of power in Russia and where its authoritarian President Vladimir Putin works, was \"real.\" Many people witnessed the two explosions over the famous fortified complex that dates back to the 14th century and whose iconic walls and bell tower are more than 500 years old. But, according to the Times, \"the rest is hazy.\"\n\nLike much of the corporate media, the Times was eager to buttress Biden administration denials of involvement in the incident, despite the angry Russian claims that the United States had \"dictated\" strikes inside their country. And if the allegation is that the White House or Pentagon is directly responsible for shooting missiles at the capitol of a nuclear power, that's probably right. Surely, not even President Joe Biden would do something so patently insane as that.\n\nBut as the documents leaked from the Pentagon last month confirmed , U.S. intelligence is neck deep in Ukraine's war effort. Indeed, a year ago, the Times was already reporting that the American military was providing \"real time battlefield intelligence\" to the Ukrainians, including in efforts to help them kill Russian generals. And since we also already know that Ukraine is willing to operate inside Russia to assassinate figures associated with the Putin regime, it's not really that much of a reach for Moscow to link Washington to the strike on the Kremlin.\n\nNevertheless, outlets like the Times were seeking to muddy the waters about the incident by claiming that perhaps it was a false flag operation conducted by the Russians or the work of rogue operatives who could have been working for either side in the war.\n\nThat is possible. But, like the claims that were endlessly repeated by the administration and their media cheerleaders last year about the Russians blowing up their own gas pipeline in the Baltic, which were eventually quietly debunked , it's not terribly likely.\n\nAs much as Putin's flacks are doing everything to demonize the Ukrainians and impart a sense of alarm to the Russian people, the idea that he would go along with such a display of weakness is to betray complete ignorance about the mentality of his regime. The most reasonable explanation was that the Ukrainians were seeking to embarrass Putin on the eve of Moscow's annual military parade celebrating their victory in World War II.\n\nIf so, mission accomplished.\n\nYet, like the false alarms about Russia striking targets in Poland last year that turned out to be Ukrainian missiles that fell on a farm and killed two people, this is another wake-up call to Washington that it is playing with fire. At a time when the United States ought to be doing everything possible to end a war that has turned into a bloody stalemate that offers neither side a pathway to victory, Kyiv is escalating the conflict.\n\nTo note any of this is to invite accusations of peddling Russian propaganda from Bush-era Republicans who think the Cold War never ended and from liberal Democrats who, thanks to Kyiv's involvement in the efforts to impeach former President Donald Trump, have finally found a war they can love.\n\nPutin's invasion was illegal, brutal, and resulted in war crimes against innocent people. Yet one can acknowledge all that and still point out that, now that his chances of total victory are nonexistent, continuing a war that is being fought to reassert Ukrainian sovereignty over every inch of territory it controlled in 2014 has nothing to do with the national interests of the United States or the well-being of people in either of the countries that are doing the fighting.\n\nEven more to the point, the longer this madness continues, the more likely it is that something will happen that will potentially involve the U.S. in combat against Russia. Doing everything to prevent the start of a nuclear confrontation ought to be the priority of sane American leadership. But that's not what we're hearing from Washington.\n\nBiden and Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell agree that backing Ukraine \"to the hilt\" is the \"most important thing going on in the world.\" The GOP branch of the D.C. uniparty has lined up happily behind spending more than $100 billion in support of the Ukrainians. And there appears to be a bipartisan majority in favor of authorizing Biden to go on spending that much on a yearly basis for \"as long as it takes,\" for Ukraine to \"win\" the war. Yet no one in either party seems to be able to define what exactly victory over a nuclear power might be, short of fantasies about deposing Putin that might lead to an even worse outcome.\n\nThe Ukrainians won the sympathy of the world when they thwarted the Russian invasion of their country. But as the fighting in eastern Ukraine over areas with significant ethnic Russian population has devolved into trench warfare, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is getting more or less a blank check from Washington and NATO. The continuation of the war is both sides' fault, but the West should be moving to end the fighting. Another year of it will only lead to more casualties and raise the price of the country's reconstruction - which everyone knows will be paid by U.S. taxpayers - whenever the two sides get around to agreeing to the compromise that will end the war.\n\nInstead of doing that, Biden is not only doubling down but is also clearly not using the considerable leverage he has. Nor are the American forces in Ukraine that are helping direct Kyiv's intelligence efforts preventing Zelensky from engaging in actions like the Kremlin strike that might have unknowable and disastrous consequences.\n\nIf Biden and the Democrats in power won't do that, then it's up to the Republican congressional leadership to point out that they should. But, of course, they aren't, since it is only the populist wing of the party, for whom former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speak, that isn't compromised by pro-war policies.\n\nSooner or later, we'll find out more details about the Kremlin drone attack, and the odds are it won't be reassuring for those who worry about Biden's encouragement of Zelensky's recklessness. Americans will just have to pray that the next such mad escalation by the Ukrainians isn't the one that will spark a crisis that the Times and the administration won't be able to talk their way out of.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "What Must Putin And Xi Think Of U.S. Deep-State Shenanigans?\n\nAs the left-wing establishment weaponizes U.S. law enforcement, how might these actions be viewed in Beijing or Moscow?\n\nAs the left-wing establishment conducts the lawfare equivalent of carpet-bombing former President Donald Trump, aiming to render his presidential comeback aspirations burnt-out rubble by November 2024, it's an interesting exercise to understand how these actions might be viewed in Beijing or Moscow.\n\nIn the West, generally, politicians usually just win or lose elections. If they lose, they simply return to private life, free to try again.\n\nIn nations lacking rule of law and fair elections - whether autocracies such as Russia or totalitarian states like China - the practice of politics is more akin to the sort of royal jockeying of the medieval era. Machiavelli's The Prince is a manual on how to survive in this environment. \"Game of Thrones\" is an appropriate modern adaptation: poison, assassination, exile, disappearings, or official condemnation take the place of fair election contests.\n\nThus, Russian President Vladimir Putin and China's leader Xi Jinping would both see the effort to use the government's prosecutorial power against Trump as a standard tool in any dictator's toolkit. As Lavrentiy Beria, Joseph Stalin's secret police commissar said, \"Show me the man, and I'll show you the crime.\"\n\nBut while Putin and Xi surely recognize the form, they likely mock its sloppy and slow execution - Trump is still a free man and he's still running for president, an existential threat to the continuance of President Joe Biden's remaining in the White House. For dictators used to removing their would-be competitors from the chessboard, the fact that Trump is still standing is a sign of weakness.\n\nSimilarly, the growing trail of evidence being brought to the public linking Biden via his son Hunter to millions of dollars in foreign bribes from China, Ukrainian oligarchs, and Romania over five years would also be viewed as weakness. Dictators ruthlessly control information. America has its own struggles with corruption and official misdeeds, but nations ruled by dictators reap corruption on a vast scale, far exceeding our own. Practically speaking, Xi and Putin are among the world's top 10 wealthiest men. Corruption is so pervasive in China and Russia that most any rival can be credibly accused and convicted of corruption to remove them from power.\n\nAnd while federal law enforcement and intelligence officials worked to undermine Trump with false allegations of Russian collusion - still largely believed by substantial numbers of left-leaning Americans - the attempt was only partly successful in that it crippled some of Trump's capacity to act while president but failed to eject him from office.\n\nIn contrast, Putin, while serving in the weak office of prime minister in 1999 for the very unpopular outgoing president Boris Yeltsin, likely executed a series of \"terror\" bombings of apartment complexes, killing more than 200 Russians. The bombings were blamed on Muslim Chechen terrorists, allowing Putin to rebrand himself as a strong leader. After four bombs had already detonated in various cities, two residents of an apartment building in Ryazan reported a suspicious car in September 1999 . Local police didn't find the car, but they did find what appeared to be an improvised bomb and a detonator in the basement. The building was evacuated and the device removed only to have the successor to the KGB, the FSB, announce the next day that the bomb parts were part of a civil defense test. All the evidence was subsequently sealed up - move along, nothing to see here, citizen.\n\nOf course, Putin didn't much have to worry about a vigorous, independent press to put forward a counter-narrative. Since Putin's ascent to power in 1999, some 43 journalists or media workers have been killed in Russia, and at least 26 were murdered , many under circumstances that suggested they were running afoul of Putin. The last Russian journalist to be officially listed as murdered was killed in 2017 - it's almost as if Russian journalists now know the boundaries of acceptable reporting.\n\nWhile America is burdened with corporate media that skew left, tend to lazy acceptance of the official party line, and are profoundly uncurious, the truth does often get out into the public. For that, we can thank three things: the First Amendment, the democratization of information sharing via digital platforms and the proliferation of cable news outlets, and competitive pressures that often act to force legacy media to cover stories - albeit reluctantly.\n\nThis makes it difficult for the central government to conduct information operations that stick. Whether the official line on Covid-19, Hunter Biden's laptop, Biden family corruption, or Trump-Russia collusion, all of these stories, which were once the official line, have fallen apart to one degree or another.\n\nThat these official cover stories are imploding is a function of our system and culture, as lurching, slow, and imperfect as it seems. In each, our system of divided government with co-equal branches has a role - imagine the state of these stories if Republicans didn't win the U.S. House in 2022 - as well as our press freedoms and the new age of digital journalism.\n\nThe latter factor, by the way, is why China has invested so much in the Great Firewall of China, rapid-response online censoring, and the social credit system. It's all designed to insulate the Chinese Communist Party from any criticism.\n\nWhile Putin and Xi would view our relatively freewheeling exchange of information as a weakness, the opposite is true.\n\nIn Russia and China, the dictators hear what they want to hear. This reduces the opportunity for corrective feedback within a regime while extending the life of that regime, regardless of its effectiveness and responsiveness to the people's needs. In Putin's case, it led to a dangerous and mistaken view that Ukraine's government would collapse as soon as the lightning invasion was unleashed in February 2022. In Xi's case, it may lead to a fatal miscalculation on attacking Taiwan.\n\nIn America, we have yet to see the consequences for the official lies over Covid-19's origins and U.S. gain-of-function funding for the Wuhan virology lab, for official FBI and intelligence community coverups on behalf of President Biden and his extended family, and for the federal assault on Trump that started in 2016 and never stopped. But whether it be in the form of individuals being held to account or entire organizations being reformed, eliminated, or restructured, something will likely happen and America will be the stronger for it.\n\nBut government reform just doesn't happen spontaneously. It will take a concerted, disciplined effort, something that only Trump or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appear inclined to take on. The task will be Herculean - akin to cleaning the Augean stables. And, with Trump able to serve one term and DeSantis two, the trick is not to let the vital task of agency accountability become a tale of a day in the life of Sisyphus.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Three Undeniable Truths From Putin's Speech\n\nThe national media, for their own reasons, don't want you to hear what Vladimir Putin said about the war in Ukraine.\n\nOther than that Russian President Vladimir Putin declared an end to a nuclear arms treaty with the U.S. - no biggie! - you'll probably hear precisely nothing else from the press about what he had to say Tuesday during his lengthy address. That doesn't mean the rest of his speech was unimportant. It means the national media, for their own reasons, don't want you to hear it.\n\nBut you should hear it because when you remove the name \"Vladimir Putin\" from the equation, what he said during that 100-minute address to his nation was both indisputably true and rational, even if it deflates the media's incessant, eye-roll-worthy framing of the conflict in Ukraine as \"Putin's unprovoked war\" and \"a fight for democracy.\" (Gag.) Here are three examples:\n\n1. \"The U.S. has used Ukraine to prepare for a large war. They have publicly admitted that.\" This is, in fact, implicit if not official policy articulated by the Biden administration. The president himself declared early last year that Putin \"cannot remain in power,\" a threat of forced regime change if there ever was one. Biden kicked off the week by visiting the capital of Ukraine, a literal war zone with no U.S. military presence, as if to claim the conflict is as much ours as it is Ukraine's (and it is, given that we're footing about two-thirds of Ukraine's defense cost).\n\nEven Republicans in Congress are flirting with the ignition of global war. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said we should designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has declared that the \"defeat\" of Russia is \"the No. 1 priority for the United States right now.\" (So much for lifting up America's poor. They can wait, I guess.)\n\n2. \"The West is guilty of escalation.\" Since well before Russia invaded Ukraine, Washington has promoted the expansion of new member nations to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, an alliance that exists in its present form for the express purpose of intimidating Russia. What started out as a warning to the Soviet Union that the U.S. would defend its European allies against military aggression is now a vanity project for both of our political parties to look like heroes by further alienating the Kremlin from the rest of the developed world.\n\nAnd because Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, dared to ask that NATO countries pay more into the alliance, and otherwise showed no interest in expanding it for the sake of itself, that naturally led to his opponents reflexively adopting the exact opposite position : that NATO is indispensable and Ukraine is the closest thing we have to the Garden of Eden. And so, the Biden administration pushed for Ukraine's entry into NATO , even further encircling Russia with an alliance that Putin already had every reason to fear.\n\n3. \"They [the West] want to have a strategic defeat of Russia. ... It means they want to have no more, anything to do with Russia. They want to have a global resistance against Russia.\" What part of that contradicts anything the Biden administration, most of Congress, and virtually every former military official on cable news has said? They all say it.\n\nAssume that right now Russia were to retreat from Ukraine and declare a truce. Who's going to be the first to propose that the U.S. and Europe resume regular trade and cooperation to stabilize Russia's economy and its standing in the world? None of them will. They all expect a lasting minimizing of Russia, preferably without Putin in the picture.\n\nSay whatever you want about Putin, he's not irrational.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Fear Of Donald Trump Kept Putin From Invading Ukraine. Here's How Trump Pulled It Off\n\nTrump not only successfully deterred Russia from acting against Ukraine, he effectively deterred a lot of bad behavior across the planet.\n\nA recent Harvard-Harris poll found that 62 percent of Americans believe that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if Donald Trump were still in the Oval Office. As former senior intelligence officials under President Trump, we agree with that view.\n\nRussia invaded Georgia in 2008 when George W. Bush was president. Russia took Crimea in 2014 when Barack Obama was president. Russia has now invaded Ukraine with Joe Biden as president. However, when Donald Trump was president, Russia did not seize territory from any of its neighbors.\n\nDuring his four years in office, Trump not only successfully deterred Russia from acting against Ukraine, he effectively deterred a lot of bad behavior across the planet. He focused on ending America's foreign wars rather than launching new ones. At the same time, he brokered the Abraham Accords to expand peace in the Middle East.\n\nThe exercise of American power to deter adversaries is a complicated business. It involves a mix of military, economic, political, and diplomatic strategies and actions that together communicate the costs of threatening U.S. national interests.\n\nUltimately, the art of statecraft boils down to whether a president projects American strength that deters adversaries, or projects American weakness that emboldens our adversaries.\n\nSo how did Trump succeed in containing Putin while the Russian autocrat has run wild with others in the White House? Why was he so successful at spreading peace elsewhere? We believe the long answer begins with these ten ways that Donald Trump projected American strength and kept the bad guys in check:\n\nEach of these points are worthy of unpacking in-depth, but there are several that illustrate the dramatic difference in approach between Trump and Biden, starting with Afghanistan.\n\nWhen President Trump initiated the process of ending America's longest war, senior officials huddled in the Situation Room to discuss tactical challenges on the ground. The president reminded the group of America's humiliating withdrawal from Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War, and said we must do whatever it takes to leave in a safe, orderly, and dignified way. When military leaders bemoaned the costs and logistical challenges of bringing home our equipment, the president said that he did not care if it was a helicopter or a styrofoam cooler. If it had an American flag on it, it was either coming home or getting destroyed to keep it from falling into the hands of our enemies. He vowed that we would leave on our terms, or we would not leave at all.\n\nTragically, President Biden's approach - which included the decision to abandon the strategically important Bagram Air Base prior to the evacuation - cost the lives of 13 American servicemembers and led to the Taliban parading victoriously through Kabul with billions of dollars of American combat equipment. The administration's stunning incompetence - detailed in an official U.S. Army report - made the United States look weak and vulnerable on the world stage, and Putin was watching.\n\nThe world took notice when Trump ordered the killing of Iranian terrorist general Qassem Soleimani, who had operated with impunity throughout the Middle East until the U.S. military sent two Hellfire missiles through his vehicle. As a candidate for president, Biden released a statement condemning the righteous attack as a \"hugely escalatory move\" that brought us to \"the brink of a major conflict across the Middle East.\" This, of course, proved to not be the case, but it illustrated Biden's unwillingness to do what it takes to establish credible deterrence.\n\nThis principle of deterrence applies across the globe, which explains why the Chinese military has sent a record number of airplanes into Taiwan's air defense identification zone since Biden took office.\n\nTo the specific case at hand, Trump was much tougher on Russia than the media have led people to believe, while Biden has been far softer.\n\nTrump deployed such aggressive sanctions against Russia that President Obama's Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called them the toughest in history, and he withdrew from one-sided treaties that hamstrung the U.S. while Russia violated the terms.\n\nBiden has taken the opposite approach, appeasing Putin by handing him his top two geopolitical priorities on a silver platter. He unconditionally extended the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, allowing Russia to continue building tactical nuclear weapons while constraining our ability to modernize. And while Trump imposed sanctions to stop Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline in its tracks, construction was allowed to resume when Biden took office.\n\nPresident Trump understood the power of building American energy dominance. By slashing onerous regulations, Trump sparked an American energy boom that ensured we would never be reliant on any other nation to meet our energy needs. Geopolitically, America's increased export capacity reduced Putin's leverage over our European allies, who depend on Russia for 40 percent of their gas and more than a quarter of their oil.\n\nTrump approved the Keystone XL oil pipeline at home and shut down Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in Eastern Europe. Biden reversed both decisions, meaning he has been harder on America's energy producers than he has been on Russia's. To add insult to injury, as the Russian army pushed into Ukraine, Biden's climate envoy John Kerry hoped aloud that \"President Putin will help us to stay on track with respect to what we need to do for the climate.\"\n\nVladimir Putin's appetite for expansion did not wane during the four years Trump was in office, and the world was not just miraculously a safer place. Bad actors like Putin simply knew that they had to restrain themselves or deal with the consequences. In nearly every way possible, President Biden has weakened the United States and our allies and empowered Putin. As a result, Russia is on the march, even as the Ukrainian people have inspired the world with their courage and resilience. And in the wings, America's greatest threat - Xi Jinping's China - waits, and watches.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

He noted comments made by his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, \"Pete made a statement today saying that he thinks it's unlikely or impractical. I think probably that's true. I think long before President Putin, they said there's no way they'd allow that. This has been going on for many, many years. They've been saying that for a long time, that Ukraine cannot go into NATO, and I'm okay with that.\" Trump also referenced Hegseth's comments on Ukraine possibly returning to pre-2014 borders, saying that it's \"unlikely.\" This comes after Hegseth said at a meeting of Ukraine's military allies at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday that Ukraine returning to pre-2014 borders and NATO membership for the country were \"unrealistic.\" \"We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,\" Hegseth said, later adding, \"the United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\" per Reuters . Trump on Wednesday spoke with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on plans to end the war, with Trump saying that Zelensky wants \"peace\" and that Putin agreed to start negotiations.\n\nHe noted comments made by his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, \"Pete made a statement today saying that he thinks it's unlikely or impractical.
