      "text": "The US has a history of reparations -- but not for those who were enslaved\n\nIn the United States, reparations have long been discussed although substantial compensation has never been granted to the descendants of slaves. However, there is one group of people that has been compensated and it's not who many people would expect.\n\nIronically, white enslavers were actually compensated for the \"inconvenience\" of slavery ending. The Daily Beast recently explored former President Abraham Lincoln's Compensated Emancipation Act , which was a provision included with the abolition of slavery.\n\nThe publication reports that the bill \"abolished slavery in Washington, D.C., and gave enslavers $300 (or more than $8,000 in 2021 dollars) for the inconvenience of having the people they kept in bondage taken away.\"\n\nHowever, no compensation was provided for those who had spent endless years of their lives enslaved and working for free; an \"inconvenience\" that has had generational impacts on descendants of slaves for endless generations.\n\nPer The Daily Mail:\n\n\"The Black people who had been enslaved were offered no recompense for the years they spent laboring for free-though the legislation did offer them a bribe of just $100 to leave the country they had built on their backs for \"the republics of Hayti or Liberia, or such other country beyond the limits of the United States as the President may determine.\" There were few takers, but most of the 960 enslavers who applied for the reparations program got paid.\"\n\nSpeaking about the U.S. reparations policy, historian and author Carroll Gibbs highlighted key points about it during a previous conversation with the publication. She noted that although slavery was abolished, it did not lead to as many financial setbacks as some would have expected. In fact, some who invested in slavery still made substantial income after it was abolished.\n\n\"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young, the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber, the second largest,\" Gibbs said. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory. She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe, \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\""

      "text": "Why reparations may be one cure for what ails us\n\nRobin Rue Simmons had been very curious about the truth of American life as a young person. But it was only after she finished high school, left her native Evanston, Illinois, and returned as an adult - ready to buy a house in the historically Black neighborhood in which she grew up - that she delved deep into her city's history and fully understood the policies that had kept Black residents poor while enriching their white neighbors. Of course, this isn't the kind of history that's taught in school, even if today's students do sometimes learn unsavory truths about the American empire. Local history is different, perhaps because it can be especially uncomfortable to examine how that empire's economic plunder shaped our present-day communities. Yet experiencing such discomfort may be preferable to any alternative - and I write this as a white person.\n\nIn 2017, Simmons ran for Evanston City Council and won. She was interested in the idea of reparations and began studying a bill that has been sitting in Congress for decades. H.R. 40 , as it's called - the number refers to a broken promise of the post-Civil War era that formerly enslaved people should receive 40 acres and a mule - would establish a commission to examine the legacy of slavery and how restitution could be made. Federal reparations will be necessary to address this country's vast racial wealth gap that's the cumulative result of economically oppressive policies since the plantation era. Yet Simmons also knew that the federal government was hardly alone when it came to committing such injustices - and here she had a visionary idea.\n\n\"I thought, I'll start with one in my community,\" she told me by phone. Specifically, she would seek reparations for harms caused by her own city's twentieth-century housing policies , which effectively restricted Black residents to a single neighborhood known as the 5th Ward. As Evanston's Black population grew during the Great Migration - in which African Americans fled terror and oppression in the South - the 5th Ward became overcrowded, and the cost of housing ballooned. By 1940, when the Home Owners Loan Corporation of the Federal Loan Bank Board drew up a map denoting the \"risk\" of lending in certain places, it shaded the 5th Ward red. That nationwide practice, known as redlining , indicated that the area was ineligible for the sort of loans that would help white families build intergenerational wealth. Today, whites in Evanston on average enjoy property values twice that of their Black neighbors.\n\nBy 2019, Simmons had successfully put reparations on Evanston's City Council agenda and soon won widespread support for the idea. She then led the painstaking work of gathering community input about how such redress should be made. As a result, in early December, just weeks from now, the first reparations by a municipal government will be awarded to Black residents in acknowledgement of a long history of structural racism: housing grants of $25,000 to 16 Evanston families - money that can be put toward a down payment or used as mortgage assistance or for repairs on an existing home. This is just the beginning of reparations in Evanston, a small yet mighty step. Indeed, the truth is that imperial America isn't just a far-flung reality. It's as local as wherever you're reading this, which means the antidote to it can be local as well.\n\nAn Empire Rebranded\n\nA year after Simmons unveiled the idea of reparations to her City Council colleagues, two residents of Amherst, Massachusetts (where I live), noticed that Black Lives Matter signs had proliferated around town following the murder of George Floyd, and guessed that the public might finally be in the mood to pursue reparations here, as well. In Evanston, the initiative was a response to a specific set of housing policies. Why, though, would reparations be warranted in mostly white Amherst?\n\nThe answer, to use a term favored by genealogist Nicka Smith , was in the way this town had been, in essence, rebranded . Today Amherst is known for \"progressive\" politics and prosperity, but in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, white town leaders had systematically excluded African Americans from local housing and economic opportunities - even though, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the hard labor of enslaved people abducted from Africa had helped build the place. (Yes, there was slavery in Massachusetts .)\n\nThe town's rebranding was no accident. In at least one case, local historians falsified a town tax chart to exclude the valuation of human chattel, attempting to expunge slavery from the record. More generally, the hard truths of Amherst's history were whitewashed in favor of a pleasant story about virtuous European-Americans. In this way, its rebranding mirrored that of the nation. As of 2019, the median income for white families in Amherst was $108,500, more than twice that of Black families.\n\nNonetheless, over the past year, thanks to activists, the notion of redress for people of African descent found its way onto the local government agenda. (I participated in this effort as a researcher, examining town history and writing reports about what I found.) Last December, Amherst's town council passed a proclamation \"Affirming the Town of Amherst's Commitment to End Structural Racism and Achieve Racial Equity for Black Residents,\" and this spring, in a historic move whose implications have yet to be determined, the council voted in favor of establishing a reparations fund .\n\nIt's worth noting that the people who initially brought the idea of reparations to Amherst's nearly all-white council were themselves white. Meanwhile, a committee composed almost entirely of residents of color have been in ongoing negotiations with the same body in an effort to modify local policing practices to address concerns about basic physical safety.\n\n\"If You Have Come Here to Help Me, You Are Wasting Your Time\"\n\nFor years, I didn't understand this line: \"If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.\" Those words are from Lilla Watson , an Australian Aboriginal elder and activist, and I see now that they have everything to do with making reparations. But I always thought: I can't come to help you? Why not?\n\nIn the early 1970s, Watson was a leader in protests against colonialism and the Australian version of apartheid, a time when some white Australians did indeed approach Aboriginal people to ask how they could help. Watson and others felt frustrated because those folks wanted to be given the answers rather than doing the hard work of coming up with answers themselves. For me, it took about 37 years (I recently turned 38), but eventually I saw that an inclination to \"help\" can be a way for would-be helpers to feel invulnerable - a way of saying, \" I'm fine. It's these other people who need help.\" Well, let me say this now: I'm not fine.\n\nThe particular white culture in which I was born and raised is riddled with heart-splitting depression and, amid substantial affluence, a gripping fear of still not having enough. My father, who passed away suddenly when I was 20, used to only half-jokingly say, \"Money is how you keep score.\" Dad was also an avid community servant. But if a stubborn part of you believes money is the measure of life, even a great deal of community service won't be enough to make you feel whole. On my maternal side, my mom grew up in a house with a wall-sized case displaying trophies she and her siblings won - part of an unspoken family understanding that a way to earn love was to be very, very good at tennis.\n\nMy dad hardly invented the idea that money is life's scorecard, a belief at the heart of the European-American origin story and a powerful motivation for imperialist plunder, past and present. Today, in this age of billionaires , it's quintessentially American to link your value as a human being to your job title, salary, or net worth. No surprise, then, that such insecurity lives and seethes in me.\n\nMy own European ancestors came to America in poverty, fleeing persecution because they were Jewish. Keep in mind that Jews were not considered whites by many in this country until after World War II. Then, they were allowed to merge into the morphing concept of American whiteness in part thanks to public programs like the G.I. Bill and federal home loans granted to white people in Evanston and elsewhere (from both of which African Americans were largely excluded). In my own family, material success in America was first about survival, only later becoming a matter of affluence. Think of our story, in other words, as moving from poverty to imperialist scorekeeping in three generations.\n\nLately, though, I've noticed that giving away even modest sums of money brings me a sense of relief. Yet I still feel so resistant to doing so! As a European-American, I've thoroughly absorbed the idea that security comes from hoarding resources. The truth seems to be the opposite: such hoarding makes me feel dead inside.\n\nA Different Kind of Treasure\n\nThe city of Evanston is dedicating a new form of revenue, the sales tax on recreational marijuana, to funding its reparations program. And that's just the beginning of a long process, as significantly more resources will be needed to make meaningful redress to eligible families.\n\nRobin Rue Simmons is now in talks with several financial institutions about developing a new type of home loan (with low interest rates or other benefits) that could be part of reparative justice in Evanston and, ultimately, elsewhere. She points out that such institutions profited from anti-Black practices that contributed to today's racial wealth gap and she says she's optimistic that at least one bank \"will take the bold first step and be the example to their colleagues in the financial industry.\" She's right that this would represent a striking new direction for American capitalism. Or put another way, I'm not the only one who has to learn how to give money away.\n\nSome people cling to wealth far beyond what's necessary for material security for the same reason that my mom, as a child, learned to slay her opponents on a tennis court and win trophies she could take home to her parents. It's protection against the worst of all possible fates: being inadequate, worthless, unloved. In Brené Brown's bestseller Dare to Lead , which she penned as a resource for building more courageous institutional cultures, she writes: \"At the center of all our elaborate personal security measures and protection schemes lies the most precious treasure of the human experience: the heart.\"\n\nIt makes sense that an investigation of local harms and local repair possibilities comes down to that. After all, you can't get much more local than your own heart.\n\nRedressing the harms of yesterday and today requires opening not just coffers but also hearts, while letting go of strategies for defense and deflection. It requires realizing that what's imperial is also local. Little will happen, after all, until a great many of us actually begin to feel the pain of our collective history. Only in experiencing the fullness of what's wrong can we possibly discern the fullness of what's needed to make it right.\n\nSimmons has now founded a nonprofit called First Repair , to help bring the lessons of Evanston to other cities and towns. So many municipalities (including Amherst) have contacted her about the possibility of local reparations that she's lost count. And when it comes to H.R. 40, two years ago it had fewer than 70 cosponsors in the House of Representatives. Today, it has 194. This should be cause for optimism, however modest.\n\nIt was Martin Luther King, Jr., who famously said , \"We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" Yet the curvature of that arc is not a foregone conclusion. How slowly history moves (or doesn't) in the direction of justice depends on the hearts of ordinary people.\n\nCopyright 2021 Mattea Kramer\n\nFollow TomDispatch on Twitter and join us on Facebook .

      "text": "On reparations: The question isn't if -- but when and how\n\nWe will never achieve racial justice in America if this country does not examine the impact and legacy of slavery-and make strides toward achieving reparatory justice.\n\n-Jeffery Robinson, deputy legal director, ACLU\n\nFor nearly 250 years , enslaved Africans and their descendants toiled on the land and in the homes of White enslavers in the United States.\n\nThey planted, fed, weeded, mowed, and harvested crops that were not theirs; cared for and fed children they did not birth; and cleaned homes and tended lands they did not own.\n\nWe're all familiar with this uncomfortable but sanitized image of U.S. slavery.\n\nThe harsh reality is that too many of the more than 300,000 African men, women, and children who were brought to this land for the sole purpose of providing free labor-and their children and their children's children, and so on-were brutalized and terrorized to continue the cycle for centuries to come.\n\nIt's estimated that over 4 million Africans and their descendants free-labored under the legal institution of slavery-and not just in the South, but also in the North, East, and West.\n\nHaving no agency over their own bodies or minds-not to mention not owning land or having property- they were property . Many lived in the most inhumane conditions. They were beaten, raped, starved, and in some cases worked to death-literally. They were forced to breed children to increase the numbers of the enslaved. Their children were often stolen from them and sold away. Furthering the torment, many of the women were forced to nurse their enslavers' children, care for them, tend to them, raise them.\n\nIt is that 250 years of \"sun-up to sun-down\" menial free labor that this country was built upon. It is the 200-plus years of free labor that is the foundation of this country's wealth and the capitalist system that has prospered globally, exploiting us all.\n\nAnd it didn't end there.\n\nIf slavery is the foundation, then Black Codes and Jim Crow laws that followed emancipation are the walls; housing discrimination and redlining the roof, and mass incarceration the windows of the house America built.\n\nA house that is starting to crumble.\n\nThis year we observe the 400th anniversary of the first captive Africans brought to what is now the United States of America, and this month we observe Juneteenth , the celebration of freedom for all U.S. enslaved Black people.\n\nBut we will also observe another monumental moment in U.S. history.\n\nOn June 19, Juneteenth, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties will hold a slavery reparations hearing . It is the first of its kind in decades. And the first time ever the issue has garnered as much attention and support, including a declaration from the United Nations. The purpose of the hearing is \"to examine, through open and constructive discourse, the legacy of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, its continuing impact on the community and the path to restorative justice.\"\n\nWhile the topic of reparations has made its way to the forefront of mainstream discourse, this hearing is the result of centuries of work. The push for reparations did not just come into being with current presidential candidates purporting their support of some kind of reparations. It didn't just come about as a reaction to the divisive leadership of Donald Trump. And it didn't come into being, as some have reported, with the excellent reporting of Ta-Nehisi Coates' 2014 piece in The Atlantic, \" The Case for Reparations .\"\n\nIn the late 1800s to early 1900s, a formerly enslaved Black woman named Callie House, who was head of the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association, led a movement to secure reparations for formerly enslaved U.S. Blacks-specifically pensions to older freed men and women who'd worked without pay-to no avail.\n\nHouse was jailed for her efforts.\n\nOther movements for reparations to those enslaved, and later their descendants, would wax and wane with no success for the next 150 years. Although reparations were given to enslavers for loss of their \"property.\"\n\nIn 1989, former Congressman John Conyers introduced the first reparations legislation. Created with the help of N'Cobra (National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America), bill HR 40 would establish the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African American Act, designed to examine the institution of slavery, investigate its impact, and make recommendations for reparations to Congress. Every congressional year for almost 30 years until he was forced to resign in 2017, under allegations of sexual harassment, Conyers introduced this bill.\n\nThis year Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee sponsored the bill, and presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker is sponsoring its companion in the Senate, the only reparations bill ever to be introduced in the post-Reconstruction U.S. Senate. Booker along with Coates and actor-activist Danny Glover (honorary board member of YES! Magazine) will testify at the hearing.\n\nIt's important to know that as we listen to the testimonies-and even if some of us choose not to listen-that the purpose of this hearing (or the legislation, period) is not to determine whether reparations are warranted or should be dispersed.\n\nThe purpose is to convene a group of accountable specialists who can determine how reparations will be given.\n\nIn his article , Coates estimated the cost of reparations to be nearly a trillion dollars, paying out annually for the next 10 to 20 years the $34 billion estimated by researchers in the 1970s. A more recent tally given by University of Connecticut researcher Thomas Craemer puts the cost of reparations between $5.9 trillion and $14.2 trillion.\n\nIt's unlikely that checks will be cut and given to every American Descendant of Slavery. In fact, it's not practical nor expected, I would imagine.\n\nBut there are very practical implementations that could be made. To name a few: funds (or loans forgiven) for housing, education, health care, those institutions where descendants were systemically and systematically cut off or exploited. Funds (or loans forgiven) for Black farmers and growers. Coates described a \"claims system\" for Black veterans who were denied the benefits of the GI Bill.\n\nDirect intentional harm was done to those 388,000 Africans who made it to this land and to their millions of descendants. One hundred-fifty years of so-called freedom where intentional harm continues, contrary to what some like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell say , does not erase that.\n\nMcConnell and his ilk-those before him and his contemporaries-have benefited mightily from the free labor and continued oppression of Black people in this country. They all are just as responsible for the harm and wrongdoing as their ancestors.\n\nThere is a debt owed to the the American Descendants of Slavery.\n\nAnd it's time for the U.S. to pay up."

      "text": "A Digital Map Leads to Reparations for Black and Indigenous Farmers\n\nLast month, Dallas Robinson received an email from someone she didn't know, asking if she would be open to receiving a large sum of money-with no strings attached. For once, it wasn't spam. She hit reply.\n\nRobinson is a beginning farmer with experience in organic agriculture, and has had plans to establish the Harriet Tubman Freedom Farm on 10 acres of family land near her home in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Located in an area where the poverty rate hovers at nearly 20 percent, according to census data, and where both food insecurity and obesity rates are even higher , the farm will focus on serving the needs of the surrounding community by producing vegetables, herbs, and mushrooms.\n\nThe gift from the stranger arrived thanks to a new online map , the Black-Indigenous Farmers Reparations Map, a project to promote \"people-to-people\" reparations.\n\nRobinson's project was the first to be fully funded, says Leah Penniman of Soul Fire Farm, which created the map. Penniman credits Viviana Moreno, a farmer from Chicago, for suggesting the idea.\n\n\"This past summer at our Black and Latinx Farmers Immersion program, we were all talking about two farms given by White people to farmers of color as examples of reparations and restoration, and Viviana said we need more of this people-to-people giving,\" she says. Moreno's own Catatumbo Cooperative Farm is listed on the map, and as a fellow graduate of the program, Robinson was invited to list her farm. The map now includes more than 40 projects, which are all directly connected to farming organizations led by people of color.\n\nThe map's creators say they envision an equitable distribution of land and resources in the country. According to the nonprofit Urban Institute, the wealth of White families was seven times greater than that of Black families in 2016. Penniman cites data from the USDA Census, which show that about 95 percent of farms are operated by White farmers.\n\n\"This map will catalyze the voluntary transfer of land and resources to people of color as a means to rectify this injustice,\" she says.\n\nRobinson says that she's eager to connect with those who've contributed to her project.\n\n\"The person who wrote to me, Douglass DeCandia, mentioned hearing me speak at the keynote that Mark Bittman gave at the Young Farmers Conference and at the group dialogue that happened afterward,\" Robinson recalls, referring to the conference that was held in December. DeCandia wrote that he would be honored to support her project.\n\n\"I started crying,\" Robinson says. \"Then I wrote back and said, 'Yes, please,' and sent my information.\" Within days, she received a check for all that she had asked for in her listing.\n\nNow she wants to know more about what moved DeCandia to give. \"Because,\" she says, \"there are millions of people who don't understand that so many of us, especially young people, are struggling.\"\n\nDeCandia says it started with a question posed at the conference: \"How do you hold yourself accountable to communities of color and vulnerable communities?\"\n\nBoth Robinson and DeCandia were in the audience at the conference, at Stone Barns Center in New York, where chef and educator Nadine Nelson directed this question to Bittman, author and former New York Times food columnist. Noting that Bittman spoke often about racism and sexism in the food system, Nelson said she wanted to know what he was doing to hold himself personally accountable.\n\nAt first Bittman responded only with \"fair enough,\" then sat in silence until Nelson asked if he was going to answer, to which he replied that he didn't know what \"hold yourself accountable means.\"\n\nIt was after listening to this tense exchange that Robinson addressed the room: \"Your dismissal was hurtful. It was enraging,\" she said. \"Y'all don't listen to us.\" She also offered her support to Black people and other people of color in the audience.\n\n\"I really wanted to say to Black people: 'I got us.'\"\n\nRobinson explains that several White speakers, Bittman included, had been saying things like \"we're all friends here,\" \"we should be grateful to be here,\" ignoring the racial dynamic of what happened.\n\nBut, Robinson says, \"accountability means that we listen to each other. Friendship is about being able to have hard conversations together.\"\n\nNelson's question at Stone Barns has led to such conversations taking place with more urgency and resolve among communities of color and White people.\n\n\"Nadine putting her neck out like that and getting ignored led to about 30-40 White people coming together afterward and asking what they could do,\" Robinson says.\n\nTwo offshoot groups formed, with people of color meeting to discuss their frustrations and needs, and White people gathering to create a list of resources they could share, \"a reparations list.\"\n\n\"That was a powerful moment,\" DeCandia says. \"As a White, cisgendered, middle-class male, I've been asking myself how I'm actually holding myself accountable.\"\n\nSince the event, he says, he's started asking that question of others-at work, the farmers market, and at home. He and others in his community have also used video of the Nelson-Bittman exchange as a teaching tool.\n\nWhen a friend sent him the Black-Indigenous Farmers Reparations Map, it reignited the question he'd been asking himself.\n\n\"I opened the map, and the first project I saw was the Harriet Tubman Freedom Farm,\" he says.\n\nThe combination of the Stone Barns incident and the reparations map has given DeCandia a new framework for understanding accountability.\n\n\"I realized I have to start mobilizing in White communities, my family, my friends,\" he says, \"and doing that in direct accountability with folks who are most impacted, meeting stated needs rather than creating some idea in my head about who needs what and what needs to be done.\"\n\nSeveral articles have been published since the Stone Barns conference, and the National Black Food & Justice Alliance responded with a statement echoing the need for accountability.\n\nBittman apologized on Twitter, and Nelson says that he has also reached out to her personally.\n\nBut she would still like for him to respond to her question.\n\n\"He should also ask his contemporaries: Michael Pollan, Anna LappÃ©, Tom Colicchio, and others,\" Nelson says. \"He could do a roundtable, a podcast, whatever works. I want him to dig in and help present the responses.\"\n\nIn sum, Nelson wants Bittman to organize in his community among his peers.\n\nAs for herself, Nelson was inspired by what happened. She recently launched \" Stir the Pot ,\" a series of community cooking and conversation events. Hosted in collaboration with the New Haven Food Policy Council, each gathering uses an essay from Julia Turshen's Feed The Resistance as a starting point for conversation. Nelson sees it as a model other communities can borrow.\n\n\"This is an isolating field to be Black, young, and gay in,\" Robinson says, speaking of her farming experience. \"If you're a male farmer, you've got more people to identify with. If I want to find women or people of color to learn from or work for, it's harder.\"\n\nShe hopes that will change with her Harriet Tubman Freedom Farm, which she envisions as a place of cultural connection, drawing on what she describes as a transformative experience she had training at Soul Fire Farm.\n\n\"We learned about the agricultural geniuses that our ancestors were,\" she said. \"Farming is part of our culture.\"\n\nAs for Soul Fire Farm, they've just given the country at least one way to resolve a $6.4 trillion debt to Black America.\n\nIf Black people had been paid for their agricultural labor, rather than enslaved, today they would have at least that much in the bank. For those unfamiliar with reparations math, that's the lowest major estimate. It was originally made by Martin Luther King Jr., who calculated that $20 per week since the late 1700s for 4 million slaves would total $800 billion, about $6.4 trillion today.\n\nAlong with people-to-people reparations, Penniman says, creating equity in the food system will take social movements, better farm policies, and legislation like H.R. 40 , a bill introduced repeatedly by Rep. John Conyers since 1989 to research the impact of slavery and discrimination in order to \"recommend appropriate remedies.\" She says that the new map complements a larger effort coordinated by the National Black Food & Justice Alliance to promote reparations.\n\nSuch efforts will require answering difficult questions, but at least asking them acknowledges their importance.\n\n\"Because of Nadine's question,\" Robinson says, \"I was able to get all that I asked for, because of her belief in the importance of asking this question.\" She also gained something intangible, a sense of connection.\n\n\"We went through something together. We all got closer and got to experience some healing as Black people.\""

      "text": "Being free means getting climate reparations right. But not everyone is onboard\n\nThose who would have to pay the most are trying to hide what the climate crisis is costing the rest of us and ignoring the fact that social justice begins with a fair start in life.\n\nClimate change has already caused harm not only to mothers and children , but also to people of color , Indigenous and fenceline communities , and residents of the world's poorest nations . These groups have been disproportionately impacted by environmental crises that, for the most part, stem from the pollutive, extractive, and consumerist behaviors of rich nations .\n\nHow will they be compensated for this long-term and ongoing harm ? Wealthy nations will have to compensate less wealthy ones for the loss and damage, including effective reparation methods like direct payments to young women, mothers, and children through programs like Seeds for the Future family reforms. Family reformation is the key while compensating those affected.\n\nDirect family-based reparations reverse economic systems based on unsustainable population growth and inequity-those that create wealth by fundamentally externalizing costs to others . They do so by robbing women and children of resources that would give children an ecosocial fair start in life and instead use children to create growth . Those who would be paying back the wealth they owe are now doubling down, creating hysteria around an idea that reduced fertility rates and degrowth are themselves a crisis , with key targets like Elon Musk (whose wealth was created through such externalization) even suggesting that child-free people should not be allowed to vote .\n\nSuch direct obligations and payments move beyond the governments that created the crisis, beyond an unfair, anthropocentric system of top-down coercion, and instead towards bottom-up empowerment. This is less about population and more about power, and whether each individual; has equity-or influence-in their political system (focusing on the relations between humans, and not just counting them). It is about whether individuals matter politically. Compensation is equity, and equity is freedom. Creating humans for economies rather than democracies is the opposite.\n\nThe extreme concentration of wealth at the top of the economic pyramid was created by externalizing its environmental and other costs-on the poor, future generations, and nonhuman animals-argues Nobel laureate Steven Chu, who served as the Secretary of Energy in the Obama Administration. \"Increased economic prosperity and all economic models supported by governments and global competitors are based on having more young people, workers, than older people,\" Chu said in 2019. \"Two schemes come to mind. One is the pyramid scheme. The other is the Ponzi scheme.\"\n\nIn this case, \"justice for all\" means that the wealthy must pay for the damaging, externalized costs resulting from their acquisition of that wealth. But how do we ensure a fair process for calculating the costs, recovering the money, and getting it directly to young women, mothers, and children to counteract the effects of the crisis today? And what about tomorrow? The future can be protected through family planning entitlements that most effectively benefit the majority of people , including future generations. The decisions we make will impact the baseline for climate reparations (i.e., what exactly was lost and damaged) by billions, if not trillions , of dollars.\n\nWe must ensure that those who are least responsible for the climate crisis and economic inequality (i.e., future generations), do not suffer their greatest consequences. Otherwise, future generations will be the victims of a great injustice.\n\n\"The world needs a new model of how to generate a rising standard of living that's not dependent on a pyramid scheme,\" said Chu. We believe that the \" Fair Start Model \" is that model.\n\nThe Fair Start Model: Properly Addressing Population Ethics Means Achieving Equitable Opportunities for All\n\nPopulation ethics is a complex field that the United Nations and world governments must properly address if future generations are to live sustainably in a planetary ecosystem that is not damaged beyond repair. Having meaningful and effective discussions with policymakers includes setting standards that deal with the moral, ethical, and scientific considerations surrounding population size-relative to levels of consumption, growth, and the distribution of resources.\n\nMore than a third of Nobel Laureates are calling family policies and consumption-relative population the key driver of the crises we face today. Establishing population standards would reduce the overhaul of climate activities and begin the process of climate reparations from those who have benefitted the most from economic activities that have damaged climate conditions. These payments can fund optimal democratic and biodiverse communities, those envisioned by thought leaders like Sir Partha Dasgupta , where people are empowered.\n\nHuman rights are the rules that put limits on what governments can do so that people can live free, and the basic requirement for all rules is that they be fair. The fundamental problem is that the human right to have and raise children in conditions (including sustainable resources) that meet their needs-which is the first and overriding rule because it accounts for our creation and fundamental power relations-has been disconnected from that fairness requirement. Requiring fairness would have cost the wealthiest what it takes to invest in all children, and prevented the profits that come with explosive growth, This disconnect has benefitted a few at a great cost to many.\n\nIt is long past overdue to expose the truth and those who are hiding the truth, and urge them-and global policymakers-to change society's course toward child-centric planning and development that adheres to fairness, justice for all, and human rights.\n\nThe Fair Start Model is an approach that 1) aims to provide every individual with an equal opportunity to lead a fulfilling life, and 2) treats this obligation as the first and overriding human right. It treats reproductive justice and freedom as occurring within the larger context of societal freedom, which starts with ecosocial birth equity. If governance derives from the people, then constitutionalism-or the limitation and decentralization of power-starts with the creation of relations, not written documents.\n\nThe Fair Start Model is based on five key principles:\n\nThe Assumption Behind All Theories of Freedom\n\nJohn Rawls' theory of freedom starts with the assumption that we become free when our obligations-like following the letter of the law-are justified. The Fair Start Model suggests a flaw in such theories of political obligation and freedom that has blocked just such a process.\n\nThe first and overriding obligation, from which others (like laws) are derived, must be existential rather than practical because \" we are before we do .\" Former theories did not derive from this fundamental origination. Hence they never developed an objective and this justifying standard, like ecosocial fairness, for our existence-relational in nature -which is the form of justice that precedes before justifying our actions.\n\nIf we are truly concerned with how to be relatively self-determining and less controlled by others, and have the capacity for consent or choice, we would logically start with deontological population ethics , and a creation norm/first principle and obligation that looks to create groups akin to 0123...0, with 0 being non-polity/non-humanity or nature, and self-determination for each being offset equally as new persons enter, up until division or subdivision is required. Nations can subdivide through federalism into states and local jurisdictions. Some would argue that corporations and clubs, etc. are subdivisions, so if we imagine we need many nations for all to have a voice, subdivision complicates this, whereas, for example, Catalan seceding from Spain is just division.\n\nWe would have to invest enough in the birth and development conditions of each person to achieve this outcome-with power flowing from the bottom upward. In other words, absolute self-determination among political equals is inverse to population growth and relative to a nonhuman world.\n\nThis axiom can expose the fact that many individuals and groups-hiding behind \"private\" families and family planning-do not want political equality , but would rather exploit children as economic inputs than invest in their being born and raised in conditions likely to make them highly educated, resilient and politically confident citizens that who challenge concentrations of wealth and power. The Fair Start Model still reserves a private right to have children to would-be parents, but it would be more limited-like the right to speak freely is (we can't defame or incite violence, and we all get a turn, etc.), and be geared around birth equity. So there is still autonomy for the would-be parents but balanced against other interests.\n\nAs early as the middle of the 20th century, when international law was coming into true effect, family planning could have been determined by incentives and entitlements that ensured children's ecosocial birth and development conditions. That did not happen. Instead, that money went to the top of the economic pyramid .\n\nFamily policies could have been determined by the presence of incentivizing and equalizing resources. In fact, they were hidden behind the idea of privacy. The Fair Start Model argues that one's perspective on whether procreative decisions should be personal or interpersonal, private or public, should be influenced by a consideration of the climate.\n\nIs there a way to see this more simply? Who do you have to be-minimally-to exist in a social contract and hence be free because you are willingly part of an enterprise? You have to be-minimally-\"other-regarding\" enough to ensure that family planning, as well as birth and development conditions, is consistent with the Children's Rights Convention (particularly Articles 5, 6, 12, 13, 17, 19, 24, 26, 27, 28 31, 32, 34, 35, and 36)-interpreted as first requiring climate restoration via birth equity . This thinking aligns deference to majorities, with individual rights, by giving those rights to the future majority first and foremost as a fair start in life. To the extent that these things were in conflict and not aligned in the past, the opposition justified top-down governance (based on a lack of common trust) rather than relative self-governance.\n\nWhy should we trust one another if we accepted a system that was fundamentally unfair? The easiest way is to say that democracy and social contracts, or any form of consensual cooperation, require trust . It is hard to be trustful when you have not been treated fairly, and without a fair start in life, something which is now not part of how we are created.\n\nSome theories of political obligation , having to comply with the law, require that everyone who participates in a reasonably just, mutually beneficial cooperative practice- philosopher H.L.A. Hart's \"joint enterprise according to rules\"-has an obligation to bear a fair share of the burdens of the practice. Understandings of what constitutes \"fairness\" are where political theories frequently diverge. The contingent obligation may be, according to some , owed to the others who cooperate in the enterprise, for cooperation is what makes it possible for any individual to enjoy the benefits of the practice. Thus, the obligation is contingent on the capacity to participate, which is and should be contingent on the norms which account for our creation.\n\nThose norms would not crowd speakers out of getting meaningful time at the podium; rather, they would make sure we respect each other enough as equals to listen, and we would be surrounded by ecologies not already determined by others- like Exxon destroying our climate -so that very idea of \" relative self-determination\" makes sense. This is a claim that is driven home in the recent film Artifice Girl , a story about what we owe-in the act of creation-to AI that might develop a capacity for autonomy.\n\nIn other words, to properly assess costs and benefits, we have to first become groups of people capable of doing so in a way that is inclusive and reflective of the group constituents (the very thing implied by the preambles to constitutions and international covenants). Those who refuse to give children an ecosocial fair start in life as the first and overriding human right are opting to leave the resources there, undercut their claims, risk millions, and undercut U.S. national security .\n\nIt is better to use things like climate reparations to fund equity than to react to disempowerment in violent ways (and maybe because inequity is backed by legal systems that rely on and legitimize violence) , the way some have and will, hitting innocent victims rather than those who benefited from the disempowerment.\n\nDivided Perspectives: The Controversy Surrounding Climate Reparations\n\nClimate reparations (or climate justice) refer to the concept of compensating communities and countries that have been disproportionately affected by climate change and its impacts. The idea is rooted in the recognition that historical emissions and unsustainable practices of developed nations have contributed significantly to climate change, while vulnerable communities and countries that did little to contribute to the crisis bear the brunt of its consequences.\n\nWhile the concept of climate reparations has gained traction and support from various organizations and advocates, not everyone is on board .\n\nWe suggest several reasons for this divide:\n\nDespite the disagreements, it is essential to recognize the urgent need for action on climate change and the disproportionate impacts it has on vulnerable communities. While the specific mechanisms and approaches for climate reparations may vary, the overall goal is to ensure fairness, justice, and support for those who have been most affected.\n\nUltimately, finding common ground and fostering dialogue among stakeholders is crucial to developing effective climate justice frameworks and achieving a sustainable and just future for all. This is what the Fair Start Model does.\n\nLeveling the Playing Field: The Importance of Birth Equity in the Fair Start Model\n\nThe Fair Start Model advocates birth equity because the circumstances into which individuals are born can significantly impact their life outcomes. Birth equity refers to ensuring that all children-regardless of their background or socioeconomic status-have an equal opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential from the moment they are born.\n\nBy advocating for birth equity, the Fair Start Model addresses the disparities and inequities that exist among children and prevents every child from having a fair start in life.\n\nBirth equity aligns with the principles of social justice and equal opportunity. It recognizes that some individuals and communities face systemic disadvantages and barriers that hinder their ability to provide their children with optimal conditions for growth and development. By advocating policies and initiatives that promote birth equity, the Fair Start Model seeks to level the playing field and ensure that every child has a fair start in life.\n\nBy prioritizing birth equity, the Fair Start Model strives to create a society in which all children have access to essential resources and opportunities that support their physical, cognitive, and emotional development. That is why we support RAFUG's Seed for Future (Uganda) Project and seek to partner with the Golden Love and Hands of Hope Foundation on the Seeds for Africa (Nigeria) Project.\n\nUltimately, the Fair Start Model recognizes that birth equity is not just a matter of fairness, but also a crucial step toward building a more equitable and just society and helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing disparities early in life, the Fair Start Model seeks to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty, improve overall health outcomes, empower individuals to reach their full potential (regardless of their circumstances at birth) and help protect the climate world.\n\nQuestions to Identify Those Who Reject Equity\n\nWhat is your stance on the basic connection between children being born, and things like child welfare, the climate crisis, animal rights, or anything else you might claim to care about? Does your answer prohibit violations of children's rights?\n\nIn the answers given, we will be looking for an inversion related to growth, evidence of an intent to actually empower people as they enter the world, taking democracy seriously, and considering non-Eurocentric instances of democracy that might have been more inclusive than their later counterparts .\n\nIn the Fair Start Model, the best response to climate change starts with using an alternative version of social justice that does not use future generations to convert the nonhuman world into wealth for a few . This idea of justice does not ignore our day-to-day relations and how they are determined by our birth position but flows from a place of bottom-up vulnerability, not strength.\n\nWhile some inquiries into climate justice and social equity focus on the idea of population we can think of these matters as the relations between people as they are created. Humans are defined by their relations and obligations to others, and our birth position, in terms of nationality or class, largely defines our impact on the ecologies we all share and our disparate influence in our relations with one another.\n\nIf you are empowered at all-as part of the source of legitimate government and sovereignty-then the first question you ask is: \"Are children being born into the world because they will have fundamental power over me in every sense, politically from the governance, and daily in their impact (impact which largely depends on nationality and class, as cited above)?\" You will limit the power of others at the base, and not accept obligations to follow rules in a system that does not allow me to limit and consent to that power, so that you are objectively (mathematically) obligated, based on deriving back all the way to the most fundamental obligation. Free people will condition compliance with the law on that norm empowering them.\n\nBending from Growth to Justice and Relative Self-Determination\n\nThis gives us a formula (which qualifies at least as a provisional baseline for climate reparations) to determine, qualitatively, optimal population ranges, and the method to achieve them: Shift unjust concentrations of wealth and power, built by not having to pay the costs of ensuring birth and development conditions consistent with the Children's Rights Convention (CRC), towards funding all children with equal opportunities in life and a natural, biodiverse environment . The CRC is a standard because it tells us who, minimally, we should be. And the formula above applies to any grouping of people, from states to companies, to clubs, to spontaneous gatherings.\n\nFunding, resources, and incentives, should have been the factors in determining family planning behaviors for the last century or so, and had it been, we could have evaded climate disasters and other crises we face today. Instead, we lived under a system of growth economics that created many people raised in inequitable conditions for shopping malls , rather than investing in them as equal members of a town hall; i.e., creating consumers, not citizens. This is the fountainhead of what some call the economization of life .\n\nWhat are the practical ramifications of all of this? As \"climate loss and damage\" reparation formulas are assessed, we should correct this flaw and use true relative self-determination as the baseline-a move that could increase what wealthy countries owe by trillions of dollars . Moreover, correcting this mistake ensures that we can override current property rights to ensure that all children get enough of what they need in order to physically compromise legitimate democracies, capable of actually and fairly assigning property rights. That comes first. No theory of obligation to follow the law works unless it accounts for the creation of just power relations, and all power relations are fundamentally created at birth . Overconsumption (the power of wealth) relative to population size is the issue, rather than population alone.\n\nMoving wealth into family-based reparations catalyzes the trend that is already having the greatest impact on the climate crisis and our chance for a better future-women choosing smaller families or a child-free life. This is a sea-change in our species and how we relate to our ecologies, and despite the best attempts of those at the head of the economic pyramid to resist , this change is here and something we can accelerate.\n\nDo we need official governing processes like the United Nations, or Congress, to authorize this wealth transition? Thinking so commits the fallacy described above: that governmental authority derives from a prior obligation to ensure the capacity to participate. Many individuals are already disclaiming property rights to portions of their wealth in favor of family planning entitlements and will target concentrations of wealth and corrupt politicians to do the same . They should do so nonviolently, but be aware that acts of mass violence may very well arise from the same sense of disempowerment , and just be directed at the wrong targets rather than those who actually benefited from fundamental injustice.\n\nThe \"FamScam\"\n\nWhen this research was brought to wealthy funders in the animal rights space-who would have been obligated to help pay to correct the mistake and would have been potentially liable for years of greenwashing under the standard (the climate crisis means their claims of being green, sustainable, humane, eco-friendly, etc., were false)-they ignored it, then quietly backed the elimination of litigation that was designed to correct the mistake . They blocked the solution, for their own benefit, at a deadly cost to others.\n\nThey did this while many organizations- including the ones they were funding -were simply filling the public domain with fundraising noise designed around low-impact campaigns that did not threaten the fundamental power structure.\n\nTheir reaction mimics other concentrations of wealth and power- like the editor of the New York Times -who appear to want to further liberal values while quietly undoing them with family policy to maintain their position. A peremptory norm that would avert the birth of billions of people because we have new and expensive obligations to anyone born has ramifications for nonhumans that makes iconic animal rights battles, like Proposition 12 , look fairly irrelevant.\n\nHow can we possibly think we are protecting animals while ignoring the creation of humans who will harm them? Organizations avoid this issue because it is hard to navigate since they do not make the connections above, or because they don't really believe in justice and they can make money on low-impact and less risky campaigns instead by relying on donor ignorance.\n\nIt's bad enough to not do what one says, but skewing the baseline and process for climate reparations, by ignoring a right to nature and equal opportunity as the basis to judge what the climate crisis cost us , risks a grand injustice. Humans face the climate crisis because we did not recognize exactly who we should be-minimally, in order to be free. Future generations deserve a world in which that mistake is corrected, and those who benefited from the mistake must pay the amount they benefitted .\n\nOne concrete tactic to do this is through greenwashing litigation , challenging humane, environmental, ESG, DEIJ, and other value-based claims. Misleading claims in this area obfuscated the impacts companies, media, and nonprofits (some of which intentionally hid basic obligations that would have shown they were knowingly undoing their own claims) were having, forestalling reforms and risking millions of innocent lives. Suing the bad actors can bring forth the truth, and enable things like truly green certification systems, and family-based climate reparations. Using the Fair Start Model-and nurturing critical discourse about actually distributing power to constitute democracy -is one standard for this important and essential work. It requires climate restoration and biodiversity and accounts for empowering children to thrive by improving their birth and development conditions.\n\nIt demands these things as the first peremptory norm under international law, and can thus ensure a fundamental truth and reconciliation process for the climate crisis that actually compensates the victims directly. It may also reduce growing acts of mass shootings and other violence, which may be unfolding as many feel keenly disempowered .\n\nWe will also be outing those described above who were involved in hiding the research-including research that showed their own fundamental mistakes and liability -and moving the goalposts for what nature and freedom mean. Doing so skews the baseline for compensating future generations for the climate crisis by making it seem that the anthropocentric standard that caused the climate crisis is the only standard available. That skewing also hides the idea that truly free persons will make their obligation to follow the law on being empowered to control it, and with it, the influence others-like Exxon-have over them, and over their children.\n\nWe are urging those who care about basic justice to help make examples of those blocking these truths, publicly urging them to use their massive wealth- in dozens of effective ways -to bend the arc of who we are becoming towards being just and empowered people. If they do not believe in a coherent system of political obligation that accurately assesses costs and benefits , it's unclear why they should deserve its benefits and protections.\n\nThe Fair Start Movement is the story of-and solution for-this struggle.\n\nAuthor Bios :\n\nEsther Afolaranmi is a co-executive director at the Fair Start Movement and the founder of Golden Love and Hands of Hope Foundation, which works to strengthen vulnerable and underprivileged communities in Nigeria.\n\nMwesigye Robert is the founder of Rejoice Africa Foundation .\n\nCarter Dillard is the policy adviser for the Fair Start Movement .

      "text": "Ohio Republican launches Senate campaign by demanding reparations for white people\n\nA far-right Republican Ohio businessman this week announced he is running to unseat Democratic U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, and called for reparations for white people.\n\n\"We didn't really think of what were the people that came before us. We stand on the shoulders of giants,\" declared Bernie Moreno, as Heartland Signal reports (video below).\n\n\"We stand on the shoulders of people like John Adams, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, George Washington - this group of people that took on the largest empire in history. That said, 'No. We will not stand for this,'\" he declared, offered no specifics.\n\n\"That same group of people, later- white people - died to free Black people,\" said Moreno, who appears to already have the support of Donald Trump.\n\n\"It's never happened in human history before, but it happened here in America. That's not talked about in schools very much, is it? They make it sound like America is a racist, broken country. Name another country that did that, freed slaves, that died to do that.\"\n\n\"You know, when they talk about reparations, where are the reparations for the people in the North who died to save the lives of Black people? I know it's not politically correct to say that, but we gotta stop being politically correct. We gotta call it how it is.\"\n\nMoreno ran in 2022 but dropped out of the crowded race of MAGA candidates in a GOP primary won by venture capitalist and author J.D. Vance, who was strongly endorsed by Donald Trump. Moreno announced he was withdrawing from the race after meeting with Trump .\n\nA lengthy NAACP resolution makes the legitimate case for reparations for Black people.\n\n\"African Americans have been enslaved in the United States from 1619 to 1865 and people of African descent have been murdered, brutalized, made victims of genocide, sexually assaulted and economically depressed based on race in the United States from 1619 through the civil rights movement. Evidence of this systemic racism are still present today. The United States government must atone for the actions in the name of the United States government against Black people in the United States,\" it begins - hardly comparable to Moreno's claim - with much more in the document.\n\nWatch Moreno below or at this link :"

      "text": "Democrats in D.C. promised consequential racial justice reform- where is it?\n\nThe lesson of the 2020 U.S. election cycle was clear: Do not underestimate the influence of Black voters. At a time when the electoral process was characterized by voter suppression , Black voters in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin gave this country renewed hope by securing the presidency for President Joe Biden. Thanks to the Black voters who pushed Reverend Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff over the electoral edge in Georgia's runoff elections on January 5, Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. With Democrats in control of the executive and legislative branches, the promise of much-needed progressive change with respect to racial justice seemed to be on the brink of becoming reality.\n\nInstead, in the more than nine months since Democrats have helmed the federal government, all that has occurred in the name of racial justice is the recognition of Juneteenth as a federal holiday that marks the day slavery ended in the United States (June 19, 1865 - two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued).\n\nI do not mean to diminish the historical significance of \"Juneteenth National Independence Day\" as it is officially known or to disrespect the work of Black activists who have advocated for commemorating this important historical milestone for years. And as Republicans in state legislatures battle to keep discussions of racial inequality out of public schools, I applaud efforts to recognize Black history and culture. I also understand that Democrats are in a complicated position. Republicans have long shown hostility to racial justice issues, preferring instead to court white supremacists. The pressure to legislate for the benefit of Black voters has unfairly fallen exclusively on the shoulders of the Democratic Party, but that is the burden the party agreed to bear when it competed for support from the Black community.\n\nBlack voters supported national Democratic candidates in reliance on their promises. These candidates committed themselves to enacting consequential racial justice legislation. Where is it?\n\nThe tragic murder of George Floyd in 2020 inspired the largest mass protest in American history and brought police reform to the forefront of the national consciousness. Democrats had the opportunity to follow up the historic conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of Floyd with the introduction of aggressive police reform, but, instead, the Democratic Party squandered the moment by wasting time negotiating with Republicans who are more interested in creating a cultural boogeyman out of critical race theory than actually legislating. Although the House passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, any hope of police reform currently lies dormant in the Senate.\n\nRepublican-led state legislatures have passed a number of bills designed to limit the franchise in 2021 alone, an inevitability after the Supreme Court announced its decision in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013. The decision essentially castrated the Voting Rights Act, determining that the preclearance formula used to determine which jurisdictions must have their voting regimes approved by the federal government was unconstitutional.\n\nTexas has become synonymous with voter suppression recently. The state enacted a law on September 7 that, among other changes , eliminates 24-hour voting and drive-through voting, measures that are likely to most heavily burden voters of color. The law also provides poll watchers with new freedoms to monitor voters' activity, presenting ripe opportunities for racial profiling.\n\nState voter suppression, particularly in states with high populations of people of color, ahead of the 2022 midterms intensifies the urgency of enacting federal voting rights protections. Yet, efforts to legislate have stalled. The House passed the For the People Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021 earlier this year, but the Senate appears to be more invested in protecting the filibuster than in protecting the right to vote. Senate Democrats rallied support for alternative voting rights legislation, but progress on that legislation has since been thwarted by Senate Republicans. After months of exhortations from constituents, activists, and state officials, including Texas state Democrats who risked arrest and a pandemic to lobby senators, no progress has been made to push reforms to protect voting rights.\n\nSupport for reparations has increased in recent years. The 2020 Democratic presidential frontrunners suggested that they supported the idea of at least exploring how the country might go about distributing reparations to the descendants of enslaved Black Americans. Reparations programs have assumed various forms. Several Virginia colleges and universities will atone for slavery through economic and educational advancement opportunities. Evanston, Illinois, broke new ground in the implementation of reparations, inaugurating a $10 million fund for housing grants in March. The state of California and Los Angeles County have returned land to the descendants of a Black couple who were dispossessed of their property during the Jim Crow era. Against the backdrop of progress at the state and local level, precious little has occurred at the federal level. More than 30 years after it was first introduced, a bill to simply study reparations finally made its way out of the House Judiciary Committee only to languish in legislative limbo somewhere within the House.\n\nBut at least Democrats, and Republicans, in both houses of Congress could unite to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. Even this victory is hollow. Black Americans tend to be concentrated in the types of jobs in the food service and retail industries that are not required to observe federal holidays. Ironically, the day of rest, and hopefully reflection, afforded by Juneteenth could be largely enjoyed by the white Americans who work in government offices and professional offices.\n\nAlthough they expected deliverables, Black Americans have mostly experienced delays. The message to Black Americans is to wait. Wait for Congress to pass the infrastructure bill . Wait for Congress to negotiate to keep the federal government operative. Wait for the legislative chaos to die down. Wait for the Democrats to expand their majorities in Congress after the midterm elections. Wait for another state to introduce more egregiously restrictive voting rights laws. Wait for the racial wealth gap to widen. Wait for another Black American to die at the hands of the police. Wait for another global protest movement to develop that galvanizes public opinion in favor of police accountability.\n\nBlack activists have vocally demanded enhanced voter protections for years. Nearly 90 percent of Black Americans who participated in a 2020 Gallup panel voiced support for police reform. Meanwhile, 74 percent of Black Americans polled by AP-NORC in 2019 supported the implementation of a federal reparations program. These initiatives are not pet projects for Black Americans. They are vital public policy imperatives that Democrats were elected to achieve.\n\nAs 2021 comes to a close, congressional lawmakers will transition from governing mode to campaigning mode. Though President Biden and congressional Democrats deserve credit for guiding the country through the coronavirus pandemic, rejoining the Paris Agreement, and expanding child tax credits, all of which have racial justice components, their only specific legislative accomplishment on the racial justice front is the Juneteenth federal holiday. As symbolic as that holiday is, it is no substitute for safeguarding constitutional rights, protecting Black lives, and potentially minimizing the racial wealth gap. When congressional Democratic candidates appeal to Black voters for support during the 2022 election, they may find that the holiday similarly fails to motivate Black voters to head to the polls.\n\nEbony Slaughter-Johnson is a freelance writer and a writing fellow for Local Peace Economy , a project of the Independent Media Institute.

      "text": "Many wealthy members of Congress are descendants of rich slaveholders\n\nThe legacy of slavery in America remains a divisive issue, with sharp political divides.\n\nSome argue that slavery still contributes to modern economic inequalities . Others believe its effects have largely faded .\n\nOne way to measure the legacy of slavery is to determine whether the disproportionate riches of slaveholders have been passed down to their present-day descendants.\n\nConnecting the wealth of a slaveholder in the 1860s to today's economic conditions is not easy. Doing so requires unearthing data for a large number of people on slaveholder ancestry, current wealth and other factors such as age and education.\n\nBut in a new study, we tackled this challenge by focusing on one of the few groups of Americans for whom such information exists: members of Congress. We found that legislators who are descendants of slaveholders are significantly wealthier than members of Congress without slaveholder ancestry.\n\nIn 1860, one year before the Civil War, the market value of U.S. slaves was larger than that of all American railroads and factories.\n\nAt the time of emancipation in 1863, the estimated value of all enslaved people was roughly US$13 trillion in today's dollars. The lower Mississippi Valley had more millionaires , all of them slaveholders, than anywhere else in the country.\n\nSome post-Civil War historians have argued that emancipation permanently devastated slave-owning families.\n\nMore recently, however, historians discovered that, while the South fell behind the North economically immediately following emancipation, many elite slaveholders recovered financially within one or two generations.\n\nThey accomplished this by replacing slavery with sharecropping - a kind of indentured servitude that trapped Black farm workers in debt to white landowners - and enacting discriminatory Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation.\n\nUsing genealogist-verified historical data and financial data from annual congressional disclosures, we examined members of the 117th Congress , which was in session from January 2021 to January 2023.\n\nOf its 535 members, 100 were descendants of slaveholders, including Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell.\n\nLegislators whose ancestors were large slaveholders - defined in our study as owning 16 or more slaves- have a current median net worth five times larger than their peers whose ancestors were not slaveholders: $5.6 million vs. $1.1 million. These results remained largely the same after accounting for age, race and education.\n\nWealth creates many privileges - the means to start a business or pursue higher education. And intergenerational wealth transfers can allow these advantages to persist across generations.\n\nBecause members of Congress are a highly select group, our results may not apply to all Americans. However, the findings align with other studies on the transfers of wealth and privilege across generations in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nWealth, these studies find, often stays within rich families across multiple generations. Mechanisms for holding onto wealth include low estate taxes and access to elite social networks and schools. Easy entry into powerful jobs and political influence also play a part.\n\nBut members of Congress do not just inherit wealth and advantages.\n\nThey shape the lives of all Americans. They decide how to allocate federal funds, set tax rates and create regulations.\n\nThis power is significant. And for those whose families benefited from slavery, it can perpetuate economic policies that maintain wealth inequality.\n\nBeyond inherited wealth, the legacy of slavery endures in policies enacted by those in power - by legislators who may be less likely to prioritize reforms that challenge the status quo.\n\nCOVID-19 relief legislation, for example, helped reduce child poverty by more than 70% while bringing racial inequalities in child poverty to historic lows. Congress failed to renew the program in 2022, plunging 5 million more children into poverty , most of them Black and Latino.\n\nThe economic deprivation still experienced by Black Americans is the flip side of the privilege enjoyed by slaveowners' descendants. The median household wealth of white Americans today is six times higher than that of Black Americans - $285,000 versus $45,000.\n\nMeanwhile, federal agencies that enforce antidiscrimination laws remain underfunded. This limits their ability to address racial disparities.\n\nAs the enduring economic disparities rooted in slavery become clearer, a growing number of states and municipalities are weighing some form of practical and financial compensation for the descendants of enslaved people.\n\nYet surveys show that most Americans oppose such reparations for slavery.  Similarly, Congress has debated slavery reparations many times but never passed a bill.\n\nThere are, however, other ways to improve opportunities for historically disadvantaged populations that could gain bipartisan backing.\n\nA majority of Americans, both conservatives and liberal , support increased funding for environmental hazard screening, which assesses the potential impact of a proposed project. They also favor limits on rent increases, better public school funding and raising taxes on the wealthy .\n\nThese measures would help dismantle the structural barriers that perpetuate economic disparities. And the role of Congress here is central.\n\nMembers of Congress do not bear personal responsibility for their ancestors' actions. But they have an opportunity to address both the legacies of past injustices and today's inequalities.\n\nBy doing so, they can help create a future where ancestral history does not determine economic destiny.\n\nNeil K R Sehgal , PhD Student in Computer & Information Science, University of Pennsylvania and Ashwini Sehgal , Professor, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

(AP) - California plans to spend up to $12 million on reparations legislation under a budget signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom , marking a milestone in the state's efforts to atone for a legacy of racism and discrimination against Black Californians.\n\nThe reparations funding in the $297.9 billion budget Newsom signed over the weekend does not specify what programs the money would go toward. Lawmakers are not considering widespread direct payments to Black Californians this year.\n\nThe state Legislature is weighing proposals to issue a formal apology for California's role in perpetuating discrimination against Black residents, to create an agency to administer reparations programs, and to identify families whose property was unjustly seized through eminent domain.\n\nThe funding comes after federal reparations efforts have stalled for decades.\n\n\"We often say the budget is a reflection of our values and our priorities, so the fact that there's any money for reparations should be a reason for celebrating,\" said state Sen. Steven Bradford, a Los Angeles-area Democrat, noting he hoped the allocation would have been larger.\n\nNo state has gotten further along in its consideration of reparations proposals for Black residents than California, but some have made significant strides. Illinois and New York passed laws in recent years to study reparations proposals for African Americans. Florida passed a law in the 1990s creating a college scholarship fund for descendants of Black residents who were killed in a 1923 massacre initiated by a white mob.\n\nBut some opponents of reparations proposals being considered by lawmakers in California say taxpayers should not have to have to pay to address policies and practices from a long time ago.\n\n\"Slavery was a stain on our nation's history, but I don't believe it's fair to try to right the wrongs on the past at the expense of the people today who did nothing wrong,\" Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher said in a statement. \"More than a quarter of Californians are immigrants - how can we look at those people, who are struggling as it is, and say it's on them to make up for something that happened more than 150 years ago?\"\n\nSenate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire, a Democrat, said at an event Monday that \"the $12 million is not nearly enough\" but that lawmakers worked closely to secure the money during a tough budget year .\n\nIt could cost the state between $3 million and $5 million annually to run the reparations agency, according to an estimate reported by the Assembly Committee on Appropriations. The Legislature hasn't released an estimated cost to implement the eminent domain bill, but the Senate Appropriations Committee said it could cost the state hundreds of thousands of dollars to investigate claims by families who say their land was taken because of racially discriminatory motives.\n\nBradford introduced proposals to give property tax and housing assistance to descendants of enslaved Black people, but those were blocked in May by a key committee .\n\nKamilah Moore, who chaired a first-in-the-nation state reparations task force, was disappointed that lawmakers also did not introduce legislation this year to provide free tuition at public colleges for descendants of enslaved Black people, which the group recommended in its final report .\n\nBut Moore said it was still \"good news\" to see $12 million for reparations included in the budget as a starting point.\n\n\"It means that they're taking accountability and responsibility, and they're acknowledging the harms and the atrocities to this particular population,\" she said. \"That's a huge step that should not be overlooked.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story was first published on Jul. 1, 2024.

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth, File)\n\nLONDON (AP) - A debate about reparations for Britain's role in the slave trade overshadowed a summit in Samoa of the Commonwealth , many of whose member nations were once British colonies.\n\nBritain insists it will not pay to make amends for the historic wrong, but both King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed the issue indirectly at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting .\n\n\"None of us can change the past but we can commit with all our hearts to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right the inequalities that endure,\" Charles said.\n\nThe legacy of slavery is interwoven in some of Britain's richest and most revered institutions - from the Church of England to the insurance giant Lloyd's of London to the monarchy itself.\n\n\"Britain benefited from transatlantic enslavement,\" said Olivette Otele, professor of the legacies and memory of slavery at the School of African and Oriental Studies at University of London. \"The money and the money trail is there to prove it. So we need to have these conversations much more openly.\"\n\nIt's a discussion that has been going on for a long time.\n\nCharles, when he was Prince of Wales, spoke of the \"appalling atrocity of slavery, which forever stains our history\" during a visit to Barbados in 2021. At the Commonwealth summit two years ago in Rwanda, he spoke of his sorrow over slavery and its legacy for Indigenous communities and said it was a \"conversation whose time has come.\"\n\nHere's a look at why the issue is getting attention now.\n\nBritain got involved in the slave trade in the mid-1500s, following Portugal and Spain.\n\nJohn Hawkins, one of the most notable sailors and naval commanders of the 16th century, is considered one of the pioneers of the English slave trade triangle.\n\nGoods were traded in West Africa for captured slaves who were shipped across the Atlantic to work in British sugar and tobacco plantations in the Caribbean and the Americas. Goods produced in the so-called New World were transported back to England.\n\nIn 1672, the Royal African Company, established under King Charles II and run by his brother, Prince James (the future King James II), was given a monopoly on the slave trade.\n\nThe company trafficked 80,000 African men, women and children to slavery in the Americas and about 20,000 died on the journey before the monopoly ended in 1698 when any Englishman could trade slaves.\n\nAt its height, Britain was the world's biggest slave-trading nation and transported more than 3 million Africans across the Atlantic.\n\nAn abolitionist movement arose in England in the late 1700s, supported by Quakers, a few politicians and some former slaves.\n\nThe slave trade was not outlawed until 1807. Even then Parliament did not emancipate slaves in its territories until 1833.\n\n\"But it didn't go as planned,\" Otele said. \"Plantation owners, some of them absentee plantation owners because they lived in Britain, were extremely wealthy. Their ancestors had been trading for centuries so they resisted and put pressure on Parliament ... to pay them for the so-called loss of their property..\"\n\nThe 1837 Compensation Act led to 20 million pounds, 40% of the national budget at the time, being paid to plantation owners for the loss of their slaves. It took until 2015 for the Bank of England to pay off the debt from those payouts.\n\nThe movement demanding reparations goes back decades.\n\nThe U.K. has never formally apologized for its role in the trade. Studies estimate Britain would owe between hundreds of millions and trillions of dollars in compensation to descendants of slaves.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed deep sorrow in 2006 for Britain's role in the trade but stopped short of offering an apology or compensation for descendants of slaves. Activists said Blair's careful word choice reflected the government's fear of paying out huge reparations.\n\nIn 2013, the Caribbean trade bloc known as Caricom made a list of requests including that European governments formally apologize and create a repatriation program for those who wish to return to their homeland, which has not happened.\n\nOn Thursday, Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis said he wanted a \"frank\" discussion with Starmer about the matter and would seek mention of reparations in the leaders' final statement at the Samoa event. All three candidates to be the next Commonwealth Secretary-General - from Gambia, Ghana and Lesotho - have endorsed policies of reparatory justice for slavery.\n\nOther European nations, including the Netherlands , and some British institutions have started to own up to their role in the trade.\n\nThe Church of England last year announced a 100-million-pound ($130 million) fund last year for projects \"focused on improving opportunities for communities adversely impacted by historic slavery,\" though a church advisory panel said it should increase it to $1 billion.\n\nSome of the descendants of slave traders have made their own amends.\n\nA descendant of Scottish 19th-century sugar and coffee plantation owner John Gladstone - father of 19th-century British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone - apologized last year to Guyana for his great-great-great grandfather's role as an absentee slave owner in what was then British Guiana. He received 100,000 pounds in compensation for hundreds of slaves.\n\nAfter earlier insisting that the Samoa summit should avoid becoming mired in the past and \"very, very long endless discussions about reparations,\" Starmer acknowledged \"calls to face up to the harms and injustices of the past through reparatory justice.\"\n\nStarmer said the \"most effective way to maintain a spirit of respect and dignity is by working together to make sure the future is not in the shadow of the past, but is illuminated by it.\"\n\nJacqueline McKenzie - a partner at London law firm Leigh Day - working on the issue of reparations, said the issue of how to reckon with the legacy of the slave trade is \"complex.\"\n\n\"Reparations is not straightforward,\" she said. \"At the moment it's a discussion among the elites, and the people, the descendants of the enslaved ... aren't really part of the discussion.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jill Lawless contributed.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

From California to Washington, D.C., activists are joining revived reparations movements and pushing for formal government compensation for the lasting harm of slavery's legacy on subsequent generations, from access to housing and education to voting rights and employment.\n\nAdvocating for reparations is \"the right thing to do,\" said Iwataki, a resident of South Pasadena, California who is in her 70s. She cited cross-cultural solidarity that has built up over decades.\n\nBlack lawmakers such as the late California congressmen Mervyn Dymally and Ron Dellums played critical roles in winning the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which formalized the government's apology and redress payments.\n\nLast Sunday marked the 81st anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt signing an executive order that allowed the government to force an estimated 125,000 people - two-thirds of them U.S. citizens - from their homes and businesses, and incarcerate them in desolate, barbed-wire camps throughout the west.\n\n\"We want to help other communities win reparations, because it was so important to us,\" Iwataki said.\n\nAfter stalling for decades at the federal level, reparations for slavery has received new interest amid a national reckoning over the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. Amid nationwide protests that year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation that established a first-in-the-nation task force to address the topic of slave reparations.\n\nOther cities and counties have since followed, including Boston , St. Louis , and San Francisco, where an advisory committee issued a draft recommendation last year proposing a lump-sum payment of $5 million apiece for eligible individuals.\n\nIn December, the National Nikkei Reparations Coalition, alongside more than 70 other Japanese American and Asian American organizations, submitted a letter calling on the Biden administration to establish a presidential commission.\n\nJapanese American activists in California are studying the landmark report issued by California's task force - and plan to reach out to college students, churches and other community groups to raise awareness about why Black reparations is needed - and how it intersects with their own struggle.\n\nReparations critics say that monetary compensation and other forms of atonement are not necessary when no one alive today was enslaved or a slave owner, overlooking the inequities today impacting later generations of Black Americans.\n\nRetired teacher Kathy Masaoka of Los Angeles, who testified in 1981 for Japanese American redress and in 2021 in favor of federal reparations legislation, says they are just beginning to educate their own community about Black history and anti-Black prejudice.\n\nShe said that starting conversations in her community is \"undoing a lot of ideas that people have\" about American history and the case for reparations, said Masaoka, 74.\n\nSan Francisco attorney Don Tamaki, who is Japanese, is the only person appointed to California's nine-member task force who is not Black.\n\nAt meetings, he shared how critical it was for organizers to arrange for former detainees to tell their stories to national media outlets. Redress advocates had to make hard decisions though, such as agreeing to legislation that denied reparations to an estimated 2,000 Latin Americans of Japanese descent who were also incarcerated.\n\nThere is no equivalence to the experiences of the Japanese American and Black American communities, Tamaki said, but there are similar lessons, such as the need for a massive public education campaign.\n\nOnly 30% of U.S. adults surveyed by the Pew Research Center in 2021 supported reparations for slavery, 77% of whom were Black Americans. Support among Latinos and Asians was 39% and 33%, respectively, and white Americans had the lowest rate of support, at 18%.\n\nSome advocates said that the idea of reparations for the World War II incarceration camps was once considered outlandish. But many young, third-generation Japanese Americans were inspired to mobilize from civil rights and ethnic pride movements, including the Black Panther Party and the Brown Berets, who promoted Chicano rights.\n\nSome advocates were outraged by - and threatened to boycott - hearings set up by a 1980 federal commission on Japanese internment, called it a delaying tactic. But the testimonies that came out of public hearings the following year served as a turning point.\n\nFor the first time, many survivors shared stories that even their families didn't know, educating not only the younger generation but the broader American public.\n\n\"There was not a dry eye in the house at those hearings,\" said Iwataki, who worked with the National Coalition for Redress/Reparations to arrange transportation to the hearings, as well as meals and translators, for former detainees.\n\nMany young Japanese Americans went from frustration with their grandparents and parents for not fighting back to understanding how vulnerable they were, said Ron Wakabayashi, who was then national director of the Japanese American Citizens League. The average age of second-generation Japanese Americans who were incarcerated in the camps was only 18, he said.\n\n\"Probably the more important thing that we got out of that was the generational healing, and the restoration of our identity,\" said Wakabayashi, 78.\n\nThe commission found no military necessity for the camps, saying the detentions stemmed broadly from \"race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership,\" according to a report issued in 1983.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, providing living survivors with a formal apology and $20,000 each for the \"grave injustice\" done to them. It would cost the U.S. government about $1.6 billion.\n\nThroughout the process, activists said, the Congressional Black Caucus remained a steadfast supporter of reparations. Then-Rep. Dymally authored a reparations bill in 1982 and later, provided his staff and office support so that advocates could lobby other members of Congress.\n\nAnother California congressman, Rep. Dellums, delivered a searing speech on the House floor of being a 6-year-old boy watching as his best friend, a Japanese American boy of the same age, was taken away to the camps.\n\nA year after Reagan signed Japanese reparations into law, the late Congressman John Conyers introduced a bill to consider slavery reparations, named after the promise of 40 acres and a mule that the U.S. initially made to freed slaves. The bill has gone nowhere.\n\nDreisen Heath, an advocate for Black reparations, plans to travel from her home in the Washington, D.C. area to California in coming months to join artist and writer traci kato-kiriyama, whose parents were incarcerated as children, in leading workshops and educational forums.\n\nThey hope to engage young Japanese American and Black American students in the current movement.\n\n\"Nothing ever worthwhile in this country has ever happened without intergenerational, multiracial (coalition) building,\" said Heath. \"I see the Japanese American community, and by extension the Asian American community, indispensable to realizing reparations for Black people.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Tran Nguyen)\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - California lawmakers this week passed some of the nation's most ambitious legislation aimed at atoning for a legacy of racist policies that drove disparities for Black people, from housing to education to health.\n\nNone of the bills would provide widespread direct payments to African Americans. The state Legislature instead approved proposals allowing for the return of land or compensation to families whose property was unjustly seized by the government, and issuing a formal apology for laws and practices that have harmed Black people.\n\nBut lawmakers left out two bills that would have created a fund and an agency to carry out the measures, considered key components of the efforts to take action. California Legislative Black Caucus Chair Assemblymember Lori Wilson said Saturday that the Black Caucus pulled the bills, adding the proposals need more work.\n\n\"We knew from the very beginning that it was an uphill battle. ... And we also knew from the very beginning that it would be a multiyear effort,\" Wilson told reporters.\n\nSen. Steven Bradford, who authored the measures, said the bills didn't move forward out of fear Gov. Gavin Newsom would veto them.\n\n\"We're at the finish line, and we, as the Black Caucus, owe it to the descendants of chattel slavery, to Black Californians and Black Americans, to move this legislation forward,\" Bradford said, urging his colleague to reconsider Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe Democratic governor hasn't weighed in on most of the bills, but he signed a $297.9 billion budget in June that included up to $12 million for reparations legislation . However the budget did not specify what proposals the money would be used for, and his administration has signaled its opposition to some of them. Newsom has until Sept. 30 to decide whether to sign the bills that passed into law.\n\nDemocratic Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer, who is Black, called his bill to issue a formal apology for discrimination \"a labor of love.\" His uncle was part of a group of African American students who in the 1950s were escorted by federal troops past an angry white mob into Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, three years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that school segregation was unconstitutional. The students became known as the \" Little Rock Nine .\"\n\n\"I think my grandmother, my grandfather, would be extremely proud for what we are going to do today,\" Jones-Sawyer said ahead of the vote on the legislation that was passed. \"Because that is why they struggled in 1957, so that I'd be able to - and we'd be able to - move forward our people.\"\n\nNewsom approved a law in 2020 creating a first-in-the-nation task force to study reparations proposals. New York state and Illinois have since followed suit with similar legislation. The California group released a final report last year with more than 100 recommendations for lawmakers.\n\nNewsom signed a law last month requiring school districts that receive state funding for a career education program to collect data on the performance of participating students by race and gender. The legislation, part of a reparations package backed by the California Legislative Black Caucus, aims to help address gaps in student outcomes.\n\nThe state Senate overwhelmingly approved the bill on the return of land or compensation to families whose property was taken unfairly through racially discriminatory means using eminent domain.\n\nThe topic garnered renewed attention in California when Los Angeles-area officials returned a beachfront property in 2022 to a Black couple decades after it was seized from their ancestors.\n\nThe Newsom administration's Department of Finance opposes the bill. The agency says the cost to implement it is unknown but could \"range from hundreds of thousands of dollars to low millions of dollars annually, depending on the workload required to accept, review, and investigate applications.\"\n\nIt's not immediately clear how the initiative would be enacted even if Newsom signs it into law, after lawmakers dropped the measure to create an agency to implement it. That proposal would have formed a genealogy office to help Black Californians research their family lineage and verify their eligibility for any reparations that become law.\n\nCalifornia would accept responsibility and formally apologize for its role in perpetuating segregation, economic disparities and discrimination against Black Americans under another bill the Legislature approved.\n\nThe legislation requires the secretary of state to send a final copy of the apology to the state archives, where it could be viewed by the public.\n\nThe apology would say that the state \"affirms its role in protecting the descendants of enslaved people and all Black Californians as well as their civil, political, and sociocultural rights.\"\n\nThe two failed proposals would have created an agency to implement reparations programs if they are passed in California.\n\nIt could have cost the state between $3 million and $5 million annually to run the reparations agency, according to the California Government Operations Agency.\n\nAnother proposal would have established a fund for reparations programs that become law in California. The money would have been used to address state policies that have harmed Californians descended from enslaved Black people or free Black people living in the U.S. before the end of the 19th century.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Trân Nguyễn contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAustin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Jack Vasconcelos, who created the school's parade theme, said he decided to honor Cândido because violence reminiscent of slavery continues to occur. (AP Photo/Bruna Prado, File)\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - The executive manager for institutional relations at a Brazilian state bank took the microphone before roughly 150 people at a forum on slavery's legacy in his country, which kidnapped more Africans for forced labor than any other nation.\n\n\"Today's Bank of Brazil asks Black people for forgiveness,\" André Machado said to the mostly Black audience at the Portela samba school in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\"Directly or indirectly, all of Brazilian society should apologize to Black people for that sad moment in our history,\" he said, reading a statement to audience members who sat watching from plastic chairs, their eyes fixed upon him.\n\nBrazil - where more than half the population self-identifies as Black or biracial - has long resisted reckoning with its past. That reluctance has started loosening.\n\nPublic prosecutors have begun probing Bank of Brazil, Latin America's second-largest financial institution by assets, with $380 billion , for its historical links to the slave trade. Their investigation could yield a recommendation, an agreement or filing of legal action, and they invited Bank of Brazil to start a dialogue with Black people at the Portela school in the working-class Madureira neighborhood.\n\nGhyslaine Almeida e Cunha, a spiritual leader of the Afro-Brazilian religion Umbanda, traveled from the Amazonian city of Belem for what she called \"an historic moment.\" She welcomed the apology and announcement of measures, though the bank stopped short of pledging compensation.\n\n\"I came to say - on Portela's sacred soil - that, yes, we do want reparations,\" said Cunha.\n\nBrazil enslaved more people from Africa than any other country; nearly 5 million kidnapped Africans disembarked in Brazil, more than 12 times the number taken to mainland North America, according to estimates from the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade database. Brazil was the last country in the Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery, in 1888.\n\nValongo Wharf in Rio, which UNESCO calls \"the most important physical trace of the arrival of African slaves on the American continent,\" was only excavated in 2011.\n\nDiscrimination remains, and Black and biracial Brazilians are more likely to be poor, imprisoned and die violently. Fewer than a third of managerial positions are held by those groups, and they comprise one quarter of representatives in Brazil's Lower House of Congress.\n\nOn Dec. 7, a Senate committee heard experts arguing that Brazil needs to prioritize compensation. And when Carnival kicks off next week, a samba school parading before tens of thousands of spectators and millions more TV viewers will present the story of a Black man whose family is seeking reparations.\n\nBrazil's nascent clamor for reparations joins existing movements abroad. In the U.S., New York , California and Illinois have established task forces on the issue. In November, the African Union partnered with Caribbean countries to form a \"united front\" to persuade European nations to pay for \"historical mass crimes\". Institutions such as Harvard University and the Bank of England have been confronting their historical ties to the slave trade, although neither has endorsed direct financial reparations.\n\nAnd in 2021, President Joe Biden expressed support for a federal commission to study a national plan for reparations for Black Americans, but he has not supported any of the efforts at the state level.\n\nSuch discussions in the U.S. inspired Brazilian nonprofit Educafro to sue the federal government in May 2022, Irapuã Santana, the lawyer who filed the suit, told The Associated Press. The organization, which fights for better access to education for Black and biracial Brazilians, is demanding an apology and a fund to combat racism, among other measures.\n\nBrazil long projected itself as a inclusive democracy that had left racism behind. Only in recent decades has there been a concerted effort to publicly debunk that myth. The country has so far mostly dealt with slavery's legacy through affirmative action, particularly its 2012 law obliging public universities to reserve a certain number of spaces for Black people.\n\nBut many on the right argue the past is irrelevant, and deny that any compensation is due. They are likely to fight any widespread push for reparations.\n\n\"What debt? I have never enslaved anyone in my life,\" Jair Bolsonaro said in a TV interview in 2018, months before he won the presidency. The former leader and current standard-bearer for the right has questioned the basis for quotas, saying Black and white people should be treated equally. In October, his son proposed ending race-based quotas, and almost one-third of senators supported the measure.\n\nAdvocates for further atonement disagree.\n\n\"Faced with the horror of 350 years of slavery, quotas are insufficient. We need to expand the discussion on reparations,\" said lawyer Humberto Adami, president of the Racial Equality Commission of the Brazilian Lawyers Institute.\n\nThat demands for reparations are for the first time being heard in public, prominent places is partly a reflection of the political climate ushered in by leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , who took office in January 2023. Last year, prosecutors started investigating Bank of Brazil, which is cooperating.\n\nA woman raises her fist while holding a sign with a visage of then former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva during a Black Women's March in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, July 31, 2022. (AP Photo/Bruna Prado, File)\n\nIts largest shareholder at one point was José Bernardino de Sá, a slave trader responsible for transporting around 19,000 Africans to Brazil, according to historical research that sparked prosecutors' investigation. João Henrique Ulrich, who in 1842 was caught running a slave barracks in Angola's capital, was a bank director for almost a decade.\n\nBeyond individual ties, the institution allowed clients to declare enslaved Black people as financial assets to guarantee loans that built the economy - one example of how \"slavery is central to Brazil's formation,\" said Thiago Campos Pessoa, one of the historians.\n\nBank of Brazil President Tarciana Medeiros speaks during her swearing-in ceremony, backdropped by a screen that shows family members watching from the audience, in Brasilia, Brazil, Jan. 16, 2023. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva appointed Medeiros to lead the bank, and she is its first-ever Black president. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres, File)\n\nIn addition to apologizing, Bank of Brazil announced measures to facilitate jobs for Black people and said it \"works intensely to confront structural racism .\"\n\nBank of Brazil declined a request for an interview, instead referring AP to its Nov. 18 statement read at Portela and its recent initiative to finance projects benefiting Black women.\n\nLula appointed Tarciana Medeiros to lead the bank, and she is its first-ever Black president. He has pledged to further racial equality, and created the country's first ministry dedicated to the issue.\n\nThe family of João Cândido, who served in the navy two decades after Brazil abolished slavery, hope a more receptive executive branch will finally hear their pleas.\n\nAfter witnessing a sailor's flogging, Cândido led a revolt against regular whipping by officers in 1910. He and fellow mutineers were tortured, and only two survived - including Cândido. Kicked out of the navy, he and his family missed out on pension benefits and promotions, then he fell into poverty, according to prosecutor Julio Araujo, who also leads the Bank of Brazil probe.\n\nCândido's family is demanding compensation from the federal government. They also want him inducted into the nation's official pantheon of heroes, Adalberto Cândido, 85, the sailor's only living son, said in an interview in Sao Joao de Meriti, on Rio's outskirts.\n\nReparations \"would make a difference because we are a modest family. We've always earned the minimum wage, which in this country is a joke,\" said Cândido, who started working at 14. He spoke in front of Cândido's last home, where a colorful mural depicts his story.\n\nThat story will take center stage in one of the top Carnival parades . In the warehouse where samba school Paraiso do Tuiuti is constructing its giant floats and fashioning gold-sequined sailor costumes, references to slavery abound - such as a print of French painter Jean-Baptiste Debret's depiction of a slave being whipped.\n\nCarnival costume details featuring Joao Candido, a black sailor who led a revolt against regular whippings by naval officers in 1910, lay inside the Paraíso do Tuiuti Samba school at the Samba City complex in Rio de Janeiro, Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2024.

He cited a Black delivery man's whipping with a dog leash by a white woman in Rio last year.\n\nThat delivery man will perform as Cândido during the parade, which aims to help society remember slavery - one form of reparation, Vasconcelos said.\n\n\"But we also need to fight for tangible reparations, not just contributing to memory,\" Vasconcelos added. ___\n\nAP writer Terry Tang contributed from Phoenix.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nAssemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer, D-Los Angeles, speaks about a package of reparations legislation at a press conference at the state Capitol on Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2024. (AP Photo/Sophie Austin)\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Black lawmakers in California on Wednesday introduced a package of reparations legislation, calling it a starting point to atone for the state's legacy of discrimination.\n\nThe California Legislative Black Caucus introduced the package of more than a dozen proposals months after a first-in-the nation reparations task force sent a report, two years in the making, to lawmakers recommending how the state should apologize and offer redress to Black Californians. The package doesn't include widespread direct cash payments to Black families.\n\n\"We are witnessing the effects of the longstanding institution of slavery and how that impacts our communities,\" Democratic Assemblymember Mike Gipson said at a press conference at the state Capitol.\n\nThe proposals must now garner political support as the state faces a massive budget deficit. Reparations advocates were quick to criticize the package's exclusion of widespread compensation. Other critics said many of the proposals fall outside of the scope of reparations, and some say they would be too costly to implement.\n\nHere are some of the ideas:\n\nA bill by Sen. Steven Bradford, a Los Angeles-area Democrat who was a task force member, would create an agency known as the California American Freedmen Affairs Agency to administer reparations programs and help Black families research their family lineage. Lawmakers have not yet released an estimate for how much this would cost.\n\nCalifornia voters passed an initiative in 1996 to ban the consideration of race, color, sex and nationality in public employment, education and contracting decisions. Voters again decided to uphold that law in 2020.\n\nOne of the reparations proposals would allow the governor to approve exceptions to that law in order to address poverty and improve educational outcomes for African Americans and other groups. It would need to pass both houses of the Legislature by a two-thirds vote before heading to voters.\n\nBradford introduced a bill for the state to compensate families whose property was seized through eminent domain as a result of racism and discrimination. Bradford did not offer details Wednesday on how the state would determine whether property was seized due to racist motives. The proposal comes after Los Angeles County in 2022 returned a beachfront property to the descendants of its Black owners decades after local officials seized it from them.\n\nUnder one proposal, the state would formally acknowledge California's legacy of slavery and discrimination and require lawmakers to create a formal apology. In 2019, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a formal apology for the state's historical mistreatment of Native Americans.\n\nThe package includes a proposed amendment to the state constitution to ban involuntary servitude . The goal is to prevent inmates from being forced to work while being paid wages that are often less than $1 an hour. Several other states have already passed similar proposals .\n\nNewsom's administration opposed a previous version of the proposed amendment, citing the cost to taxpayers if the state had to start paying inmates the minimum wage. It failed to pass the state Senate in 2022 .\n\nThe re-introduced proposal by Black Caucus Chair Lori Wilson, a Democratic assemblymember representing part of Solano County, passed the Assembly last year and is now being weighed by the Senate.\n\nThe reparations package does not include widespread payments to descendants of Black people who were living in the United States by the end of the 19th century, which the reparations task force recommended. Lawmakers may introduce direct compensation in future years, Wilson said. They will first have to contend with the budget deficit and would have to build a coalition of support among other lawmakers.\n\n___ Austin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Supervisors in San Francisco formally apologized Tuesday to African Americans and their descendants for the city's role in perpetuating racism and discrimination, with several stating that this was just the start of reparations for Black residents and not the end.\n\nThe vote was unanimous with all 11 board members signed on as sponsors of the resolution.\n\n\"This historic resolution apologizes on behalf of San Francisco to the African American community and their descendants for decades of systemic and structural discrimination, targeted acts of violence, atrocities,\" said Supervisor Shamann Walton, \"as well as committing to the rectification and redress of past policies and misdeeds.\"\n\nSan Francisco joins another major U.S. city, Boston , in issuing an apology. Nine states have formally apologized for slavery, according to the resolution.\n\n\"We have much more work to do but this apology most certainly is an important step,\" said Walton, the only Black member of the board and chief proponent of the resolution.\n\nIt is the first reparations recommendation of more than 100 proposals made by a city committee to win approval. The African American Reparations Advisory Committee also proposed that every eligible Black adult receive a $5 million lump-sum cash payment and a guaranteed income of nearly $100,000 a year to remedy San Francisco's deep racial wealth gap.\n\nBut there has been no action on those and other proposals, and some supervisors Tuesday took a dig at public safety measures on next week's March 5 city ballot that they say would harm Black residents.\n\nSupervisor Dean Preston represents the historically Black Fillmore neighborhood, which was razed in the last century and resulted in the displacement of residents. He said that some leaders who back the apology still want to build \"unaffordable housing for mostly wealthy, white people\" on public land.\n\nHe also referenced two measures backed by Mayor London Breed, who is Black, including one to screen welfare recipients for drug addiction and another to give more powers to the police department.\n\n\"People want an apology,\" he said. \"But they also want a commitment not to repeat harms.\"\n\nThe mayor has also said she believes reparations should be handled at the national level, and facing a budget crunch, her administration eliminated $4 million for a proposed reparations office in cuts this year.\n\nThe resolution contains findings, including property redlining, the razing of the Fillmore neighborhood in the name of urban renewal, and intentional policies and practices by the city that robbed Black residents of opportunities to build generational wealth.\n\nBlack people, for example, make up 38% of San Francisco's homeless population despite being less than 6% of the general population, according to a 2022 federal count. There are about 46,000 Black residents in San Francisco.\n\nIn 2020, California became the first state in the nation to create a task force on reparations. The state committee, which dissolved in 2023, also offered numerous policy recommendations , including methodologies to calculate cash payments to descendants of enslaved people.\n\nBut reparations bills introduced by the California Legislative Black Caucus this year also leave out financial redress, although the package includes proposals to compensate people whose land the government seized through eminent domain, create a state reparations agency, ban forced prison labor and issue an apology.\n\nReparations advocates are urging San Francisco to move faster in adopting changes made by the city reparations committee, including policies to improve education, employment and housing options for Black people.\n\nCheryl Thornton, a city employee who is Black, said that an apology alone does little to address current problems, such as shorter lifespans for Black people.\n\n\"That's why reparations is important in health care,\" she said. \"And it's just because of the lack of healthy food, the lack of access to medical care and the lack of access to quality education.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Biden backs studying reparations as Congress considers bill\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden's White House is giving its support to studying reparations for Black Americans, boosting Democratic lawmakers who are renewing efforts to create a commission on the issue amid the stark racial disparities highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA House panel heard testimony Wednesday on legislation that would create a commission to examine the history of slavery in the U.S. as well as the discriminatory government policies that affected former slaves and their descendants. The commission would recommend ways to educate the American public of its findings and suggest appropriate remedies, including financial payments from the government to compensate descendants of slaves for years of unpaid labor by their ancestors.\n\nBiden backs the idea of studying the issue, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday, though she stopped short of saying he would sign the bill if it clears Congress.\n\n\"He certainly would support a study of reparations,\" Psaki said at the White House briefing. \"He understands we don't need a study to take action right now on systemic racism, so he wants to take actions within his own government in the meantime.\"\n\nBiden captured the Democratic presidential nomination and ultimately the White House with the strong support of Black voters. As he campaigned against the backdrop of the biggest reckoning on racism in a generation in the wake of George Floyd's killing, Biden backed the idea of studying reparations for the descendants of slaves. But now, as he tries to win congressional support for other agenda items including a massive coronavirus relief package, he faces a choice of how aggressively to push the idea.\n\nEven with Democrats controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House, passing a reparations bill could prove difficult. The proposal has languished in Congress for more than three decades, winning fresh attention in 2019 only after Democrats won control of the House.\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who has 173 co-sponsors for her bill, said the descendants of slaves continue to suffer from the legacy of that brutal system and the enduring racial inequality it spawned, pointing to COVID-19 as an example. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that Black people are nearly three times as likely to be hospitalized because of COVID-19 as white people and nearly twice as likely to die from the illness. She offered up her bill as a way to bring the country together.\n\n\"The government sanctioned slavery,\" Jackson Lee said. \"And that is what we need, a reckoning, a healing reparative justice.\"\n\nBut polling has found long-standing resistance in the U.S. to reparations to descendants of slaves, divided along racial lines. Only 29% of Americans voiced support for paying cash reparations, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll taken in the fall of 2019. Most Black Americans favored reparations, 74%, compared with 15% of white Americans.\n\nRep. Burgess Owens, a first-term Republican from Utah, argued against a reparations commission. He noted that his great-great-grandfather arrived in America in the belly of a slave ship but went on to escape slavery through the Underground Railroad and become a successful entrepreneur. He criticized the \"redistribution of wealth\" as a failed government policy.\n\n\"Though it is impractical and a nonstarter for the United States government to pay reparations, it is also unfair and heartless to give Black Americans the hope that this is a reality,\" Owens said.\n\nJackson Lee's bill calls for the commission to examine the practice of slavery as well as forms of discrimination that federal and state governments inflicted on former slaves and their descendants. The commission would then recommend ways to educate the American public of its findings and appropriate remedies.\n\nKamm Howard, the co-chair of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, called the commission long overdue and said that \"many years have been wasted, many lives lost,\" since the legislation was first introduced by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in 1989.\n\n\"The goal here is restoration. Where would we as a people be if it were not for 246 years of stolen labor and accompanying horrors, if not for the multiple periods of multibillion-dollar plunder post-enslavement?\" Howard said. \"We must be made whole.\"\n\nLarry Elder, a Black conservative talk radio host, said that African Americans have made tremendous progress economically and socially, noting that Barack Obama was elected twice to the presidency. He claimed that racism has never been less of a significant problem in America than it is now and that reparations would represent one of the greatest transfers of wealth in history. \"Figuring out who owes what is going to be a hell of an achievement,\" Elder said.\n\nFormer NFL star Herschel Walker also spoke in opposition to the commission, saying reparations would create separation and division.\n\n\"I feel it continues to let us know we're still African American rather than just American,\" Walker said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Josh Boak and Padmananda Rama contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Payments of $5 million to every eligible Black adult, the elimination of personal debt and tax burdens, guaranteed annual incomes of at least $97,000 for 250 years and homes in San Francisco for just $1 a family.\n\nThese were some of the more than 100 recommendations made by a city-appointed reparations committee tasked with the thorny question of how to atone for centuries of slavery and systemic racism. And the San Francisco Board of Supervisors hearing the report for the first time Tuesday voiced enthusiastic support for the ideas listed, with some saying money should not stop the city from doing the right thing.\n\nSeveral supervisors said they were surprised to hear pushback from politically liberal San Franciscans apparently unaware that the legacy of slavery and racist policies continues to keep Black Americans on the bottom rungs of health, education and economic prosperity, and overrepresented in prisons and homeless populations.\n\n\"Those of my constituents who lost their minds about this proposal, it's not something we're doing or we would do for other people. It's something we would do for our future, for everybody's collective future,\" said Supervisor Rafael Mandelman, whose district includes the heavily LGBTQ Castro neighborhood.\n\nThe draft reparations plan, released in December, is unmatched nationwide in its specificity and breadth. The committee hasn't done an analysis of the cost of the proposals, but critics have slammed the plan as financially and politically impossible. An estimate from Stanford University's Hoover Institution, which leans conservative, has said it would cost each non-Black family in the city at least $600,000.\n\nTuesday's unanimous expressions of support for reparations by the board do not mean all the recommendations will ultimately be adopted, as the body can vote to approve, reject or change any or all of them. A final committee report is due in June.\n\nSome supervisors have said previously that the city can't afford any major reparations payments right now given its deep deficit amid a tech industry downturn .\n\nTinisch Hollins, vice-chair of the African American Reparations Advisory Committee, alluded to those comments, and several people who lined up to speak reminded the board they would be watching closely what the supervisors do next.\n\n\"I don't need to impress upon you the fact that we are setting a national precedent here in San Francisco,\" Hollins said. \"What we are asking for and what we're demanding for is a real commitment to what we need to move things forward.\"\n\nThe idea of paying compensation for slavery has gained traction across cities and universities. In 2020, California became the first state to form a reparations task force and is still struggling to put a price tag on what is owed .\n\nThe idea has not been taken up at the federal level .\n\nIn San Francisco, Black residents once made up more than 13% of the city's population, but more than 50 years later, they account for less than 6% of the city's residents - and 38% of its homeless population. The Fillmore District once thrived with Black-owned night clubs and shops until government redevelopment in the 1960s forced out residents.\n\nFewer than 50,000 Black people still live in the city , and it's not clear how many would be eligible. Possible criteria include having lived in the city during certain time periods and descending from someone \"incarcerated for the failed War on Drugs.\"\n\nCritics say the payouts make no sense in a state and city that never enslaved Black people. Opponents generally say taxpayers who were never slave owners should not have to pay money to people who were not enslaved.\n\nAdvocates say that view ignores a wealth of data and historical evidence showing that long after U.S. slavery officially ended in 1865, government policies and practices worked to imprison Black people at higher rates, deny access to home and business loans and restrict where they could work and live.\n\nJustin Hansford, a professor at Howard University School of Law, says no municipal reparations plan will have enough money to right the wrongs of slavery, but he appreciates any attempts to \"genuinely, legitimately, authentically\" make things right. And that includes cash, he said.\n\n\"If you're going to try to say you're sorry, you have to speak in the language that people understand, and money is that language,\" he said.\n\nJohn Dennis, chair of the San Francisco Republican Party, does not support reparations although he says he'd support a serious conversation on the topic. He doesn't consider the board's discussion of $5 million payments to be one.\n\n\"This conversation we're having in San Francisco is completely unserious. They just threw a number up, there's no analysis,\" Dennis said. \"It seems ridiculous, and it also seems that this is the one city where it could possibly pass.\"\n\nThe board created the 15-member reparations committee in late 2020, months after California Gov. Gavin Newsom approved a statewide task force amid national turmoil after a white Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd, a Black man.\n\nThe committee continues to deliberate recommendations, including monetary compensation , and its report is due to the Legislature on July 1. At that point it will be up to lawmakers to draft and pass legislation.\n\nThe state panel made the controversial decision in March to limit reparations to descendants of Black people who were in the country in the 19th century. Some reparations advocates said that approach does not take into account the harms that Black immigrants suffer.\n\nUnder San Francisco's draft recommendation , a person would have to be at least 18 years old and have identified as \"Black/African American\" in public documents for at least 10 years. Eligible people must also meet two of eight other criteria, though the list may change.\n\nThose criteria include being born in or migrating to San Francisco between 1940 and 1996 and living in the city for least 13 years; being displaced from the city by urban renewal between 1954 and 1973, or the descendant of someone who was; attending the city's public schools before they were fully desegregated; or being a descendant of an enslaved person.\n\nThe Chicago suburb of Evanston became the first U.S. city to fund reparations . The city gave money to qualifying people for home repairs, down payments and interest or late penalties due on property. In December, the Boston City Council approved of a reparations study task force.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct what critics said about California's plan to limit reparations to descendants of slaves. Some reparations advocates said that approach does not take into account the harms that Black immigrants suffer.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times via AP, Pool, File)\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - The California Senate advanced a set of ambitious reparations proposals Tuesday, including legislation that would create an agency to help Black families research their family lineage and confirm their eligibility for any future restitution passed by the state.\n\nLawmakers also passed bills to create a fund for reparations programs and compensate Black families for property that the government unjustly seized from them using eminent domain. The proposals now head to the state Assembly.\n\nState Sen. Steven Bradford, a Los Angeles-area Democrat, said California \"bears great responsibility\" to atone for injustices against Black Californians.\n\n\"If you can inherit generational wealth, you can inherit generational debt,\" Bradford said. \"Reparations is a debt that's owed to descendants of slavery.\"\n\nThe proposals, which passed largely along party lines, are part of a slate of bills inspired by recommendations from a first-in-the-nation task force that spent two years studying how the state could atone for its legacy of racism and discrimination against African Americans. Lawmakers did not introduce a proposal this year to provide widespread payments to descendants of enslaved Black people, which has frustrated many reparations advocates.\n\nIn the U.S. Congress, a bill to study reparations for African Americans that was first introduced in the 1980s has stalled. Illinois and New York state passed laws recently to study reparations, but no other state has gotten further along than California in its consideration of reparations proposals for Black Americans.\n\nCalifornia state Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican representing the Sacramento suburbs, said he supports \"the principle\" of the eminent domain bill, but he doesn't think taxpayers across the state should have to pay families for land that was seized by local governments.\n\n\"That seems to me to be a bit of an injustice in and of itself,\" Niello said.\n\nThe votes come on the last week for lawmakers to pass bills in their house of origin, and days after a key committee blocked legislation that would have given property tax and housing assistance to descendants of enslaved people. The state Assembly advanced a bill last week that would make California formally apologize for its legacy of discrimination against Black Californians. In 2019, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a formal apology for the state's history of violence against and mistreatment of Native Americans.\n\nSome opponents of reparations say lawmakers are overpromising on what they can deliver to Black Californians as the state faces a multibillion-dollar budget deficit.\n\n\"It seems to me like they're putting, number one, the cart before the horse,\" said Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli, who represents part of Riverside County in Southern California. \"They're setting up these agencies and frameworks to dispense reparations without actually passing any reparations.\"\n\nIt could cost the state up to $1 million annually to run the agency, according to an estimate by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The committee didn't release cost estimates for implementing the eminent domain and reparations fund bills. But the group says it could cost the state hundreds of thousands of dollars to investigate claims by families who say their land was taken because of racially discriminatory motives.\n\nChris Lodgson, an organizer with reparations-advocacy group the Coalition for a Just and Equitable California, said ahead of the votes that they would be \"a first step\" toward passing more far-reaching reparations laws in California.\n\n\"This is a historic day,\" Lodgson said.\n\n___\n\nAustin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

      "text": "The Case for Reparations\n\nTwo hundred fifty years of slavery. Ninety years of Jim Crow. Sixty years of separate but equal. Thirty-five years of racist housing policy. Until we reckon with our compounding moral debts, America will never be whole.\n\nEditor's note: On February 1, 2023, the College Board announced its finalized curriculum for an AP African American Studies course. It has removed work-present in the pilot program-by writers such as bell hooks, Kimberlé Crenshaw, and Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of this article.\n\nWe've gathered dozens of the most important pieces from our archives on race and racism in America. Find the collection here .\n\nAnd if thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee. And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty: thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith t he LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him. And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing today.\n\n- Deuteronomy 15: 12-15\n\nBesides the crime which consists in violating the law, and varying from the right rule of reason, whereby a man so far becomes degenerate, and declares himself to quit the principles of human nature, and to be a noxious creature, there is commonly injury done to some person or other, and some other man receives damage by his transgression: in which case he who hath received any damage, has, besides the right of punishment common to him with other men, a particular right to seek reparation.\n\n- John Locke, \"Second Treatise\"\n\nBy our unpaid labor and suffering, we have earned the right to the soil, many times over and over, and now we are determined to have it.\n\n- Anonymous, 1861\n\nC lyde Ross was born in 1923, the seventh of 13 children, near Clarksdale, Mississippi, the home of the blues. Ross's parents owned and farmed a 40-acre tract of land, flush with cows, hogs, and mules. Ross's mother would drive to Clarksdale to do her shopping in a horse and buggy, in which she invested all the pride one might place in a Cadillac. The family owned another horse, with a red coat, which they gave to Clyde. The Ross family wanted for little, save that which all black families in the Deep South then desperately desired-the protection of the law.\n\nIn the 1920s, Jim Crow Mississippi was, in all facets of society, a kleptocracy. The majority of the people in the state were perpetually robbed of the vote-a hijacking engineered through the trickery of the poll tax and the muscle of the lynch mob. Between 1882 and 1968, more black people were lynched in Mississippi than in any other state. \"You and I know what's the best way to keep the nigger from voting,\" blustered Theodore Bilbo, a Mississippi senator and a proud Klansman. \"You do it the night before the election.\"\n\nThe state's regime partnered robbery of the franchise with robbery of the purse. Many of Mississippi's black farmers lived in debt peonage, under the sway of cotton kings who were at once their landlords, their employers, and their primary merchants. Tools and necessities were advanced against the return on the crop, which was determined by the employer. When farmers were deemed to be in debt-and they often were-the negative balance was then carried over to the next season. A man or woman who protested this arrangement did so at the risk of grave injury or death. Refusing to work meant arrest under vagrancy laws and forced labor under the state's penal system.\n\nWell into the 20th century, black people spoke of their flight from Mississippi in much the same manner as their runagate ancestors had. In her 2010 book, The Warmth of Other Suns , Isabel Wilkerson tells the story of Eddie Earvin, a spinach picker who fled Mississippi in 1963, after being made to work at gunpoint. \"You didn't talk about it or tell nobody,\" Earvin said. \"You had to sneak away.\"\n\nWhen Clyde Ross was still a child, Mississippi authorities claimed his father owed $3,000 in back taxes. The elder Ross could not read. He did not have a lawyer. He did not know anyone at the local courthouse. He could not expect the police to be impartial. Effectively, the Ross family had no way to contest the claim and no protection under the law. The authorities seized the land. They seized the buggy. They took the cows, hogs, and mules. And so for the upkeep of separate but equal, the entire Ross family was reduced to sharecropping.\n\nThis was hardly unusual. In 2001, the Associated Press published a three-part investigation into the theft of black-owned land stretching back to the antebellum period. The series documented some 406 victims and 24,000 acres of land valued at tens of millions of dollars. The land was taken through means ranging from legal chicanery to terrorism. \"Some of the land taken from black families has become a country club in Virginia,\" the AP reported, as well as \"oil fields in Mississippi\" and \"a baseball spring training facility in Florida.\"\n\nClyde Ross was a smart child. His teacher thought he should attend a more challenging school. There was very little support for educating black people in Mississippi. But Julius Rosenwald, a part owner of Sears, Roebuck, had begun an ambitious effort to build schools for black children throughout the South. Ross's teacher believed he should attend the local Rosenwald school. It was too far for Ross to walk and get back in time to work in the fields. Local white children had a school bus. Clyde Ross did not, and thus lost the chance to better his education.\n\nThen, when Ross was 10 years old, a group of white men demanded his only childhood possession-the horse with the red coat. \"You can't have this horse. We want it,\" one of the white men said. They gave Ross's father $17.\n\n\"I did everything for that horse,\" Ross told me. \"Everything. And they took him. Put him on the racetrack. I never did know what happened to him after that, but I know they didn't bring him back. So that's just one of my losses.\"\n\nThe losses mounted. As sharecroppers, the Ross family saw their wages treated as the landlord's slush fund. Landowners were supposed to split the profits from the cotton fields with sharecroppers. But bales would often disappear during the count, or the split might be altered on a whim. If cotton was selling for 50 cents a pound, the Ross family might get 15 cents, or only five. One year Ross's mother promised to buy him a $7 suit for a summer program at their church. She ordered the suit by mail. But that year Ross's family was paid only five cents a pound for cotton. The mailman arrived with the suit. The Rosses could not pay. The suit was sent back. Clyde Ross did not go to the church program.\n\nreporter's notebook Elegant Racism \"If you sought to advantage one group of Americans and disadvantage another, you could scarcely choose a more graceful method than housing discrimination.\" Read more\n\nIt was in these early years that Ross began to understand himself as an American-he did not live under the blind decree of justice, but under the heel of a regime that elevated armed robbery to a governing principle. He thought about fighting. \"Just be quiet,\" his father told him. \"Because they'll come and kill us all.\"\n\nClyde Ross grew. He was drafted into the Army. The draft officials offered him an exemption if he stayed home and worked. He preferred to take his chances with war. He was stationed in California. He found that he could go into stores without being bothered. He could walk the streets without being harassed. He could go into a restaurant and receive service.\n\nRoss was shipped off to Guam. He fought in World War II to save the world from tyranny. But when he returned to Clarksdale, he found that tyranny had followed him home. This was 1947, eight years before Mississippi lynched Emmett Till and tossed his broken body into the Tallahatchie River. The Great Migration, a mass exodus of 6 million African Americans that spanned most of the 20th century, was now in its second wave. The black pilgrims did not journey north simply seeking better wages and work, or bright lights and big adventures. They were fleeing the acquisitive warlords of the South. They were seeking the protection of the law.\n\nClyde Ross was among them. He came to Chicago in 1947 and took a job as a taster at Campbell's Soup. He made a stable wage. He married. He had children. His paycheck was his own. No Klansmen stripped him of the vote. When he walked down the street, he did not have to move because a white man was walking past. He did not have to take off his hat or avert his gaze. His journey from peonage to full citizenship seemed near-complete. Only one item was missing-a home, that final badge of entry into the sacred order of the American middle class of the Eisenhower years.\n\nIn 1961, Ross and his wife bought a house in North Lawndale, a bustling community on Chicago's West Side. North Lawndale had long been a predominantly Jewish neighborhood, but a handful of middle-class African Americans had lived there starting in the '40s. The community was anchored by the sprawling Sears, Roebuck headquarters. North Lawndale's Jewish People's Institute actively encouraged blacks to move into the neighborhood, seeking to make it a \"pilot community for interracial living.\" In the battle for integration then being fought around the country, North Lawndale seemed to offer promising terrain. But out in the tall grass, highwaymen, nefarious as any Clarksdale kleptocrat, were lying in wait.\n\nThree months after Clyde Ross moved into his house, the boiler blew out. This would normally be a homeowner's responsibility, but in fact, Ross was not really a homeowner. His payments were made to the seller, not the bank. And Ross had not signed a normal mortgage. He'd bought \"on contract\": a predatory agreement that combined all the responsibilities of homeownership with all the disadvantages of renting-while offering the benefits of neither. Ross had bought his house for $27,500. The seller, not the previous homeowner but a new kind of middleman, had bought it for only $12,000 six months before selling it to Ross. In a contract sale, the seller kept the deed until the contract was paid in full-and, unlike with a normal mortgage, Ross would acquire no equity in the meantime. If he missed a single payment, he would immediately forfeit his $1,000 down payment, all his monthly payments, and the property itself.\n\nThe men who peddled contracts in North Lawndale would sell homes at inflated prices and then evict families who could not pay-taking their down payment and their monthly installments as profit. Then they'd bring in another black family, rinse, and repeat. \"He loads them up with payments they can't meet,\" an office secretary told The Chicago Daily News of her boss, the speculator Lou Fushanis, in 1963. \"Then he takes the property away from them. He's sold some of the buildings three or four times.\"\n\nRoss had tried to get a legitimate mortgage in another neighborhood, but was told by a loan officer that there was no financing available. The truth was that there was no financing for people like Clyde Ross. From the 1930s through the 1960s, black people across the country were largely cut out of the legitimate home-mortgage market through means both legal and extralegal. Chicago whites employed every measure, from \"restrictive covenants\" to bombings, to keep their neighborhoods segregated.\n\nTheir efforts were buttressed by the federal government. In 1934, Congress created the Federal Housing Administration. The FHA insured private mortgages, causing a drop in interest rates and a decline in the size of the down payment required to buy a house. But an insured mortgage was not a possibility for Clyde Ross. The FHA had adopted a system of maps that rated neighborhoods according to their perceived stability. On the maps, green areas, rated \"A,\" indicated \"in demand\" neighborhoods that, as one appraiser put it, lacked \"a single foreigner or Negro.\" These neighborhoods were considered excellent prospects for insurance. Neighborhoods where black people lived were rated \"D\" and were usually considered ineligible for FHA backing. They were colored in red. Neither the percentage of black people living there nor their social class mattered. Black people were viewed as a contagion. Redlining went beyond FHA-backed loans and spread to the entire mortgage industry, which was already rife with racism, excluding black people from most legitimate means of obtaining a mortgage.\n\n\"A government offering such bounty to builders and lenders could have required compliance with a nondiscrimination policy,\" Charles Abrams, the urban-studies expert who helped create the New York City Housing Authority, wrote in 1955. \"Instead, the FHA adopted a racial policy that could well have been culled from the Nuremberg laws.\"\n\nThe devastating effects are cogently outlined by Melvin L. Oliver and Thomas M. Shapiro in their 1995 book, Black Wealth/White Wealth :\n\nIn Chicago and across the country, whites looking to achieve the American dream could rely on a legitimate credit system backed by the government. Blacks were herded into the sights of unscrupulous lenders who took them for money and for sport. \"It was like people who like to go out and shoot lions in Africa. It was the same thrill,\" a housing attorney told the historian Beryl Satter in her 2009 book, Family Properties . \"The thrill of the chase and the kill.\"\n\nreporter's notebook The American Case Against a Black Middle Class \"When a black family in Chicago saves up enough to move out of the crowded slums into Cicero, the neighborhood riots.\" Read more\n\nThe kill was profitable. At the time of his death, Lou Fushanis owned more than 600 properties, many of them in North Lawndale, and his estate was estimated to be worth $3 million. He'd made much of this money by exploiting the frustrated hopes of black migrants like Clyde Ross. During this period, according to one estimate, 85 percent of all black home buyers who bought in Chicago bought on contract. \"If anybody who is well established in this business in Chicago doesn't earn $100,000 a year,\" a contract seller told The Saturday Evening Post in 1962, \"he is loafing.\"\n\nContract sellers became rich. North Lawndale became a ghetto.\n\nClyde Ross still lives there. He still owns his home. He is 91, and the emblems of survival are all around him-awards for service in his community, pictures of his children in cap and gown. But when I asked him about his home in North Lawndale, I heard only anarchy.\n\n\"We were ashamed. We did not want anyone to know that we were that ignorant,\" Ross told me. He was sitting at his dining-room table. His glasses were as thick as his Clarksdale drawl. \"I'd come out of Mississippi where there was one mess, and come up here and got in another mess. So how dumb am I? I didn't want anyone to know how dumb I was.\n\n\"When I found myself caught up in it, I said, 'How? I just left this mess. I just left no laws. And no regard. And then I come here and get cheated wide open.' I would probably want to do some harm to some people, you know, if I had been violent like some of us. I thought, 'Man, I got caught up in this stuff. I can't even take care of my kids.' I didn't have enough for my kids. You could fall through the cracks easy fighting these white people. And no law.\"\n\nBut fight Clyde Ross did. In 1968 he joined the newly formed Contract Buyers League -a collection of black homeowners on Chicago's South and West Sides, all of whom had been locked into the same system of predation. There was Howell Collins, whose contract called for him to pay $25,500 for a house that a speculator had bought for $14,500. There was Ruth Wells, who'd managed to pay out half her contract, expecting a mortgage, only to suddenly see an insurance bill materialize out of thin air-a requirement the seller had added without Wells's knowledge. Contract sellers used every tool at their disposal to pilfer from their clients. They scared white residents into selling low. They lied about properties' compliance with building codes, then left the buyer responsible when city inspectors arrived. They presented themselves as real-estate brokers, when in fact they were the owners. They guided their clients to lawyers who were in on the scheme.\n\nThe Contract Buyers League fought back. Members-who would eventually number more than 500-went out to the posh suburbs where the speculators lived and embarrassed them by knocking on their neighbors' doors and informing them of the details of the contract-lending trade. They refused to pay their installments, instead holding monthly payments in an escrow account. Then they brought a suit against the contract sellers, accusing them of buying properties and reselling in such a manner \"to reap from members of the Negro race large and unjust profits.\"\n\nIn return for the \"deprivations of their rights and privileges under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments,\" the league demanded \"prayers for relief\"-payback of all moneys paid on contracts and all moneys paid for structural improvement of properties, at 6 percent interest minus a \"fair, non-discriminatory\" rental price for time of occupation. Moreover, the league asked the court to adjudge that the defendants had \"acted willfully and maliciously and that malice is the gist of this action.\"\n\nRoss and the Contract Buyers League were no longer appealing to the government simply for equality. They were no longer fleeing in hopes of a better deal elsewhere. They were charging society with a crime against their community. They wanted the crime publicly ruled as such. They wanted the crime's executors declared to be offensive to society. And they wanted restitution for the great injury brought upon them by said offenders. In 1968, Clyde Ross and the Contract Buyers League were no longer simply seeking the protection of the law. They were seeking reparations.\n\nA ccording to the most-recent statistics , North Lawndale is now on the wrong end of virtually every socioeconomic indicator. In 1930 its population was 112,000. Today it is 36,000. The halcyon talk of \"interracial living\" is dead. The neighborhood is 92 percent black. Its homicide rate is 45 per 100,000-triple the rate of the city as a whole. The infant-mortality rate is 14 per 1,000-more than twice the national average. Forty-three percent of the people in North Lawndale live below the poverty line-double Chicago's overall rate. Forty-five percent of all households are on food stamps-nearly three times the rate of the city at large. Sears, Roebuck left the neighborhood in 1987, taking 1,800 jobs with it. Kids in North Lawndale need not be confused about their prospects: Cook County's Juvenile Temporary Detention Center sits directly adjacent to the neighborhood.\n\nNorth Lawndale is an extreme portrait of the trends that ail black Chicago. Such is the magnitude of these ailments that it can be said that blacks and whites do not inhabit the same city. The average per capita income of Chicago's white neighborhoods is almost three times that of its black neighborhoods. When the Harvard sociologist Robert J. Sampson examined incarceration rates in Chicago in his 2012 book, Great American City , he found that a black neighborhood with one of the highest incarceration rates (West Garfield Park) had a rate more than 40 times as high as the white neighborhood with the highest rate (Clearing). \"This is a staggering differential, even for community-level comparisons,\" Sampson writes. \"A difference of kind, not degree.\"\n\nIn other words, Chicago's impoverished black neighborhoods-characterized by high unemployment and households headed by single parents-are not simply poor; they are \"ecologically distinct.\" This \"is not simply the same thing as low economic status,\" writes Sampson. \"In this pattern Chicago is not alone.\"\n\nThe lives of black Americans are better than they were half a century ago. The humiliation of Whites Only signs are gone. Rates of black poverty have decreased. Black teen-pregnancy rates are at record lows-and the gap between black and white teen-pregnancy rates has shrunk significantly. But such progress rests on a shaky foundation, and fault lines are everywhere. The income gap between black and white households is roughly the same today as it was in 1970. Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at New York University, studied children born from 1955 through 1970 and found that 4 percent of whites and 62 percent of blacks across America had been raised in poor neighborhoods. A generation later, the same study showed, virtually nothing had changed. And whereas whites born into affluent neighborhoods tended to remain in affluent neighborhoods, blacks tended to fall out of them.\n\nThis is not surprising. Black families, regardless of income, are significantly less wealthy than white families. The Pew Research Center estimates that white households are worth roughly 20 times as much as black households, and that whereas only 15 percent of whites have zero or negative wealth, more than a third of blacks do. Effectively, the black family in America is working without a safety net. When financial calamity strikes-a medical emergency, divorce, job loss-the fall is precipitous.\n\nAnd just as black families of all incomes remain handicapped by a lack of wealth, so too do they remain handicapped by their restricted choice of neighborhood. Black people with upper-middle-class incomes do not generally live in upper-middle-class neighborhoods. Sharkey's research shows that black families making $100,000 typically live in the kinds of neighborhoods inhabited by white families making $30,000. \"Blacks and whites inhabit such different neighborhoods,\" Sharkey writes, \"that it is not possible to compare the economic outcomes of black and white children.\"\n\nThe implications are chilling. As a rule, poor black people do not work their way out of the ghetto-and those who do often face the horror of watching their children and grandchildren tumble back .\n\nEven seeming evidence of progress withers under harsh light. In 2012, the Manhattan Institute cheerily noted that segregation had declined since the 1960s. And yet African Americans still remained-by far-the most segregated ethnic group in the country.\n\nWith segregation, with the isolation of the injured and the robbed, comes the concentration of disadvantage. An unsegregated America might see poverty, and all its effects, spread across the country with no particular bias toward skin color. Instead, the concentration of poverty has been paired with a concentration of melanin. The resulting conflagration has been devastating.\n\nOne thread of thinking in the African American community holds that these depressing numbers partially stem from cultural pathologies that can be altered through individual grit and exceptionally good behavior. (In 2011, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, responding to violence among young black males, put the blame on the family: \"Too many men making too many babies they don't want to take care of, and then we end up dealing with your children.\" Nutter turned to those presumably fatherless babies: \"Pull your pants up and buy a belt, because no one wants to see your underwear or the crack of your butt.\") The thread is as old as black politics itself. It is also wrong. The kind of trenchant racism to which black people have persistently been subjected can never be defeated by making its victims more respectable. The essence of American racism is disrespect. And in the wake of the grim numbers, we see the grim inheritance.\n\nThe Contract Buyers League's suit brought by Clyde Ross and his allies took direct aim at this inheritance. The suit was rooted in Chicago's long history of segregation, which had created two housing markets-one legitimate and backed by the government, the other lawless and patrolled by predators. The suit dragged on until 1976, when the league lost a jury trial. Securing the equal protection of the law proved hard; securing reparations proved impossible. If there were any doubts about the mood of the jury, the foreman removed them by saying, when asked about the verdict, that he hoped it would help end \"the mess Earl Warren made with Brown v. Board of Education and all that nonsense.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court seems to share that sentiment. The past two decades have witnessed a rollback of the progressive legislation of the 1960s. Liberals have found themselves on the defensive. In 2008, when Barack Obama was a candidate for president, he was asked whether his daughters-Malia and Sasha-should benefit from affirmative action. He answered in the negative.\n\nThe exchange rested upon an erroneous comparison of the average American white family and the exceptional first family. In the contest of upward mobility, Barack and Michelle Obama have won. But they've won by being twice as good-and enduring twice as much. Malia and Sasha Obama enjoy privileges beyond the average white child's dreams. But that comparison is incomplete. The more telling question is how they compare with Jenna and Barbara Bush-the products of many generations of privilege, not just one. Whatever the Obama children achieve, it will be evidence of their family's singular perseverance, not of broad equality.\n\nIn 1783 , the freedwoman Belinda Royall petitioned the commonwealth of Massachusetts for reparations. Belinda had been born in modern-day Ghana. She was kidnapped as a child and sold into slavery. She endured the Middle Passage and 50 years of enslavement at the hands of Isaac Royall and his son. But the junior Royall, a British loyalist, fled the country during the Revolution. Belinda, now free after half a century of labor, beseeched the nascent Massachusetts legislature:\n\nBelinda Royall was granted a pension of 15 pounds and 12 shillings, to be paid out of the estate of Isaac Royall-one of the earliest successful attempts to petition for reparations. At the time, black people in America had endured more than 150 years of enslavement, and the idea that they might be owed something in return was, if not the national consensus, at least not outrageous.\n\n\"A heavy account lies against us as a civil society for oppressions committed against people who did not injure us,\" wrote the Quaker John Woolman in 1769, \"and that if the particular case of many individuals were fairly stated, it would appear that there was considerable due to them.\"\n\nAs the historian Roy E. Finkenbine has documented, at the dawn of this country, black reparations were actively considered and often effected. Quakers in New York, New England, and Baltimore went so far as to make \"membership contingent upon compensating one's former slaves.\" In 1782, the Quaker Robert Pleasants emancipated his 78 slaves, granted them 350 acres, and later built a school on their property and provided for their education. \"The doing of this justice to the injured Africans,\" wrote Pleasants, \"would be an acceptable offering to him who 'Rules in the kingdom of men.' \"\n\nEdward Coles, a protégé of Thomas Jefferson who became a slaveholder through inheritance, took many of his slaves north and granted them a plot of land in Illinois. John Randolph, a cousin of Jefferson's, willed that all his slaves be emancipated upon his death, and that all those older than 40 be given 10 acres of land. \"I give and bequeath to all my slaves their freedom,\" Randolph wrote, \"heartily regretting that I have been the owner of one.\"\n\nIn his book Forever Free , Eric Foner recounts the story of a disgruntled planter reprimanding a freedman loafing on the job:\n\nIn the 20th century, the cause of reparations was taken up by a diverse cast that included the Confederate veteran Walter R. Vaughan, who believed that reparations would be a stimulus for the South; the black activist Callie House; black-nationalist leaders like \"Queen Mother\" Audley Moore; and the civil-rights activist James Forman. The movement coalesced in 1987 under an umbrella organization called the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America ( N'COBRA ). The NAACP endorsed reparations in 1993. Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a professor at Harvard Law School, has pursued reparations claims in court.\n\nBut while the people advocating reparations have changed over time, the response from the country has remained virtually the same. \"They have been taught to labor,\" the Chicago Tribune editorialized in 1891. \"They have been taught Christian civilization, and to speak the noble English language instead of some African gibberish. The account is square with the ex‐slaves.\"\n\nNot exactly. Having been enslaved for 250 years, black people were not left to their own devices. They were terrorized. In the Deep South, a second slavery ruled. In the North, legislatures, mayors, civic associations, banks, and citizens all colluded to pin black people into ghettos, where they were overcrowded, overcharged, and undereducated. Businesses discriminated against them, awarding them the worst jobs and the worst wages. Police brutalized them in the streets. And the notion that black lives, black bodies, and black wealth were rightful targets remained deeply rooted in the broader society. Now we have half-stepped away from our long centuries of despoilment, promising, \"Never again.\" But still we are haunted. It is as though we have run up a credit-card bill and, having pledged to charge no more, remain befuddled that the balance does not disappear. The effects of that balance, interest accruing daily, are all around us.\n\nBroach the topic of reparations today and a barrage of questions inevitably follows: Who will be paid? How much will they be paid? Who will pay? But if the practicalities, not the justice, of reparations are the true sticking point, there has for some time been the beginnings of a solution. For the past 25 years, Congressman John Conyers Jr., who represents the Detroit area, has marked every session of Congress by introducing a bill calling for a congressional study of slavery and its lingering effects as well as recommendations for \"appropriate remedies.\"\n\nA country curious about how reparations might actually work has an easy solution in Conyers's bill, now called HR 40, the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act. We would support this bill, submit the question to study, and then assess the possible solutions. But we are not interested.\n\nreporter's notebook What We Should Be Asking About Reparations \"Any contemplation of compensated emancipation must grapple with how several counties, and some states in the South, would react to finding themselves suddenly outnumbered by free black people.\" Read more\n\n\"It's because it's black folks making the claim,\" Nkechi Taifa, who helped found N'COBRA , says. \"People who talk about reparations are considered left lunatics. But all we are talking about is studying [reparations]. As John Conyers has said, we study everything. We study the water, the air. We can't even study the issue? This bill does not authorize one red cent to anyone.\"\n\nThat HR 40 has never-under either Democrats or Republicans-made it to the House floor suggests our concerns are rooted not in the impracticality of reparations but in something more existential. If we conclude that the conditions in North Lawndale and black America are not inexplicable but are instead precisely what you'd expect of a community that for centuries has lived in America's crosshairs, then what are we to make of the world's oldest democracy?\n\nOne cannot escape the question by hand-waving at the past, disavowing the acts of one's ancestors, nor by citing a recent date of ancestral immigration. The last slaveholder has been dead for a very long time. The last soldier to endure Valley Forge has been dead much longer. To proudly claim the veteran and disown the slaveholder is patriotism à la carte. A nation outlives its generations. We were not there when Washington crossed the Delaware, but Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze's rendering has meaning to us. We were not there when Woodrow Wilson took us into World War I, but we are still paying out the pensions. If Thomas Jefferson's genius matters, then so does his taking of Sally Hemings's body. If George Washington crossing the Delaware matters, so must his ruthless pursuit of the runagate Oney Judge.\n\nIn 1909, President William Howard Taft told the country that \"intelligent\" white southerners were ready to see blacks as \"useful members of the community.\" A week later Joseph Gordon, a black man, was lynched outside Greenwood, Mississippi. The high point of the lynching era has passed. But the memories of those robbed of their lives still live on in the lingering effects. Indeed, in America there is a strange and powerful belief that if you stab a black person 10 times, the bleeding stops and the healing begins the moment the assailant drops the knife. We believe white dominance to be a fact of the inert past, a delinquent debt that can be made to disappear if only we don't look.\n\nThere has always been another way. \"It is in vain to alledge, that our ancestors brought them hither, and not we,\" Yale President Timothy Dwight said in 1810.\n\nA merica begins in black plunder and white democracy , two features that are not contradictory but complementary. \"The men who came together to found the independent United States, dedicated to freedom and equality, either held slaves or were willing to join hands with those who did,\" the historian Edmund S. Morgan wrote. \"None of them felt entirely comfortable about the fact, but neither did they feel responsible for it. Most of them had inherited both their slaves and their attachment to freedom from an earlier generation, and they knew the two were not unconnected.\"\n\nWhen enslaved Africans, plundered of their bodies, plundered of their families, and plundered of their labor, were brought to the colony of Virginia in 1619, they did not initially endure the naked racism that would engulf their progeny. Some of them were freed. Some of them intermarried. Still others escaped with the white indentured servants who had suffered as they had. Some even rebelled together, allying under Nathaniel Bacon to torch Jamestown in 1676.\n\nOne hundred years later, the idea of slaves and poor whites joining forces would shock the senses, but in the early days of the English colonies, the two groups had much in common. English visitors to Virginia found that its masters \"abuse their servantes with intollerable oppression and hard usage.\" White servants were flogged, tricked into serving beyond their contracts, and traded in much the same manner as slaves.\n\nThis \"hard usage\" originated in a simple fact of the New World-land was boundless but cheap labor was limited. As life spans increased in the colony, the Virginia planters found in the enslaved Africans an even more efficient source of cheap labor. Whereas indentured servants were still legal subjects of the English crown and thus entitled to certain protections, African slaves entered the colonies as aliens. Exempted from the protections of the crown, they became early America's indispensable working class-fit for maximum exploitation, capable of only minimal resistance.\n\nFor the next 250 years, American law worked to reduce black people to a class of untouchables and raise all white men to the level of citizens. In 1650, Virginia mandated that \"all persons except Negroes\" were to carry arms. In 1664, Maryland mandated that any Englishwoman who married a slave must live as a slave of her husband's master. In 1705, the Virginia assembly passed a law allowing for the dismemberment of unruly slaves-but forbidding masters from whipping \"a Christian white servant naked, without an order from a justice of the peace.\" In that same law, the colony mandated that \"all horses, cattle, and hogs, now belonging, or that hereafter shall belong to any slave\" be seized and sold off by the local church, the profits used to support \"the poor of the said parish.\" At that time, there would have still been people alive who could remember blacks and whites joining to burn down Jamestown only 29 years before. But at the beginning of the 18th century, two primary classes were enshrined in America.\n\n\"The two great divisions of society are not the rich and poor, but white and black,\" John C. Calhoun, South Carolina's senior senator, declared on the Senate floor in 1848. \"And all the former, the poor as well as the rich, belong to the upper class, and are respected and treated as equals.\"\n\nIn 1860, the majority of people living in South Carolina and Mississippi, almost half of those living in Georgia, and about one-third of all Southerners were on the wrong side of Calhoun's line. The state with the largest number of enslaved Americans was Virginia, where in certain counties some 70 percent of all people labored in chains. Nearly one-fourth of all white Southerners owned slaves, and upon their backs the economic basis of America-and much of the Atlantic world-was erected. In the seven cotton states, one-third of all white income was derived from slavery. By 1840, cotton produced by slave labor constituted 59 percent of the country's exports. The web of this slave society extended north to the looms of New England, and across the Atlantic to Great Britain, where it powered a great economic transformation and altered the trajectory of world history. \"Whoever says Industrial Revolution,\" wrote the historian Eric J. Hobsbawm, \"says cotton.\"\n\nThe wealth accorded America by slavery was not just in what the slaves pulled from the land but in the slaves themselves. \"In 1860, slaves as an asset were worth more than all of America's manufacturing, all of the railroads, all of the productive capacity of the United States put together,\" the Yale historian David W. Blight has noted. \"Slaves were the single largest, by far, financial asset of property in the entire American economy.\" The sale of these slaves-\"in whose bodies that money congealed,\" writes Walter Johnson, a Harvard historian-generated even more ancillary wealth. Loans were taken out for purchase, to be repaid with interest. Insurance policies were drafted against the untimely death of a slave and the loss of potential profits. Slave sales were taxed and notarized. The vending of the black body and the sundering of the black family became an economy unto themselves, estimated to have brought in tens of millions of dollars to antebellum America. In 1860 there were more millionaires per capita in the Mississippi Valley than anywhere else in the country.\n\nBeneath the cold numbers lay lives divided. \"I had a constant dread that Mrs. Moore, her mistress, would be in want of money and sell my dear wife,\" a freedman wrote, reflecting on his time in slavery. \"We constantly dreaded a final separation. Our affection for each was very strong, and this made us always apprehensive of a cruel parting.\"\n\nForced partings were common in the antebellum South. A slave in some parts of the region stood a 30 percent chance of being sold in his or her lifetime. Twenty-five percent of interstate trades destroyed a first marriage and half of them destroyed a nuclear family.\n\nWhen the wife and children of Henry Brown, a slave in Richmond, Virginia, were to be sold away, Brown searched for a white master who might buy his wife and children to keep the family together. He failed:\n\nIn a time when telecommunications were primitive and blacks lacked freedom of movement, the parting of black families was a kind of murder. Here we find the roots of American wealth and democracy-in the for-profit destruction of the most important asset available to any people, the family. The destruction was not incidental to America's rise; it facilitated that rise. By erecting a slave society, America created the economic foundation for its great experiment in democracy. The labor strife that seeded Bacon's rebellion was suppressed. America's indispensable working class existed as property beyond the realm of politics, leaving white Americans free to trumpet their love of freedom and democratic values. Assessing antebellum democracy in Virginia, a visitor from England observed that the state's natives \"can profess an unbounded love of liberty and of democracy in consequence of the mass of the people, who in other countries might become mobs, being there nearly altogether composed of their own Negro slaves.\"\n\nThe consequences of 250 years of enslavement, of war upon black families and black people, were profound. Like homeownership today, slave ownership was aspirational, attracting not just those who owned slaves but those who wished to. Much as homeowners today might discuss the addition of a patio or the painting of a living room, slaveholders traded tips on the best methods for breeding workers, exacting labor, and doling out punishment. Just as a homeowner today might subscribe to a magazine like This Old House , slaveholders had journals such as De Bow's Review , which recommended the best practices for wringing profits from slaves. By the dawn of the Civil War, the enslavement of black America was thought to be so foundational to the country that those who sought to end it were branded heretics worthy of death. Imagine what would happen if a president today came out in favor of taking all American homes from their owners: the reaction might well be violent.\n\n\"This country was formed for the white , not for the black man,\" John Wilkes Booth wrote, before killing Abraham Lincoln. \"And looking upon African slavery from the same standpoint held by those noble framers of our Constitution, I for one have ever considered it one of the greatest blessings (both for themselves and us) that God ever bestowed upon a favored nation.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, Radical Republicans attempted to reconstruct the country upon something resembling universal equality-but they were beaten back by a campaign of \"Redemption,\" led by White Liners, Red Shirts, and Klansmen bent on upholding a society \"formed for the white , not for the black man.\" A wave of terrorism roiled the South. In his massive history Reconstruction , Eric Foner recounts incidents of black people being attacked for not removing their hats; for refusing to hand over a whiskey flask; for disobeying church procedures; for \"using insolent language\"; for disputing labor contracts; for refusing to be \"tied like a slave.\" Sometimes the attacks were intended simply to \"thin out the niggers a little.\"\n\nTerrorism carried the day. Federal troops withdrew from the South in 1877. The dream of Reconstruction died. For the next century, political violence was visited upon blacks wantonly, with special treatment meted out toward black people of ambition. Black schools and churches were burned to the ground. Black voters and the political candidates who attempted to rally them were intimidated, and some were murdered. At the end of World War I, black veterans returning to their homes were assaulted for daring to wear the American uniform. The demobilization of soldiers after the war, which put white and black veterans into competition for scarce jobs, produced the Red Summer of 1919: a succession of racist pogroms against dozens of cities ranging from Longview, Texas, to Chicago to Washington, D.C. Organized white violence against blacks continued into the 1920s-in 1921 a white mob leveled Tulsa's \"Black Wall Street,\" and in 1923 another one razed the black town of Rosewood, Florida-and virtually no one was punished.\n\nThe work of mobs was a rabid and violent rendition of prejudices that extended even into the upper reaches of American government. The New Deal is today remembered as a model for what progressive government should do-cast a broad social safety net that protects the poor and the afflicted while building the middle class. When progressives wish to express their disappointment with Barack Obama, they point to the accomplishments of Franklin Roosevelt. But these progressives rarely note that Roosevelt's New Deal, much like the democracy that produced it, rested on the foundation of Jim Crow.\n\n\"The Jim Crow South,\" writes Ira Katznelson, a history and political-science professor at Columbia, \"was the one collaborator America's democracy could not do without.\" The marks of that collaboration are all over the New Deal. The omnibus programs passed under the Social Security Act in 1935 were crafted in such a way as to protect the southern way of life. Old-age insurance (Social Security proper) and unemployment insurance excluded farmworkers and domestics-jobs heavily occupied by blacks. When President Roosevelt signed Social Security into law in 1935, 65 percent of African Americans nationally and between 70 and 80 percent in the South were ineligible. The NAACP protested, calling the new American safety net \"a sieve with holes just big enough for the majority of Negroes to fall through.\"\n\nThe oft-celebrated G.I. Bill similarly failed black Americans, by mirroring the broader country's insistence on a racist housing policy. Though ostensibly color-blind, Title III of the bill, which aimed to give veterans access to low-interest home loans, left black veterans to tangle with white officials at their local Veterans Administration as well as with the same banks that had, for years, refused to grant mortgages to blacks. The historian Kathleen J. Frydl observes in her 2009 book, The GI Bill , that so many blacks were disqualified from receiving Title III benefits \"that it is more accurate simply to say that blacks could not use this particular title.\"\n\nIn Cold War America, homeownership was seen as a means of instilling patriotism, and as a civilizing and anti-radical force. \"No man who owns his own house and lot can be a Communist,\" claimed William Levitt, who pioneered the modern suburb with the development of the various Levittowns, his famous planned communities. \"He has too much to do.\"\n\nBut the Levittowns were, with Levitt's willing acquiescence, segregated throughout their early years. Daisy and Bill Myers, the first black family to move into Levittown, Pennsylvania, were greeted with protests and a burning cross. A neighbor who opposed the family said that Bill Myers was \"probably a nice guy, but every time I look at him I see $2,000 drop off the value of my house.\"\n\nThe neighbor had good reason to be afraid. Bill and Daisy Myers were from the other side of John C. Calhoun's dual society. If they moved next door, housing policy almost guaranteed that their neighbors' property values would decline.\n\nWhereas shortly before the New Deal, a typical mortgage required a large down payment and full repayment within about 10 years, the creation of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation in 1933 and then the Federal Housing Administration the following year allowed banks to offer loans requiring no more than 10 percent down, amortized over 20 to 30 years. \"Without federal intervention in the housing market, massive suburbanization would have been impossible,\" writes Thomas J. Sugrue, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania. \"In 1930, only 30 percent of Americans owned their own homes; by 1960, more than 60 percent were home owners. Home ownership became an emblem of American citizenship.\"\n\nThat emblem was not to be awarded to blacks. The American real-estate industry believed segregation to be a moral principle. As late as 1950, the National Association of Real Estate Boards' code of ethics warned that \"a Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood ... any race or nationality, or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values.\" A 1943 brochure specified that such potential undesirables might include madams, bootleggers, gangsters-and \"a colored man of means who was giving his children a college education and thought they were entitled to live among whites.\"\n\nThe federal government concurred. It was the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, not a private trade association, that pioneered the practice of redlining, selectively granting loans and insisting that any property it insured be covered by a restrictive covenant-a clause in the deed forbidding the sale of the property to anyone other than whites. Millions of dollars flowed from tax coffers into segregated white neighborhoods.\n\n\"For perhaps the first time, the federal government embraced the discriminatory attitudes of the marketplace,\" the historian Kenneth T. Jackson wrote in his 1985 book, Crabgrass Frontier , a history of suburbanization. \"Previously, prejudices were personalized and individualized; FHA exhorted segregation and enshrined it as public policy. Whole areas of cities were declared ineligible for loan guarantees.\" Redlining was not officially outlawed until 1968, by the Fair Housing Act. By then the damage was done-and reports of redlining by banks have continued.\n\nThe federal government is premised on equal fealty from all its citizens, who in return are to receive equal treatment. But as late as the mid-20th century, this bargain was not granted to black people, who repeatedly paid a higher price for citizenship and received less in return. Plunder had been the essential feature of slavery, of the society described by Calhoun. But practically a full century after the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, the plunder-quiet, systemic, submerged-continued even amidst the aims and achievements of New Deal liberals.\n\nToday Chicago is one of the most segregated cities in the country, a fact that reflects assiduous planning. In the effort to uphold white supremacy at every level down to the neighborhood, Chicago-a city founded by the black fur trader Jean Baptiste Point du Sable-has long been a pioneer. The efforts began in earnest in 1917, when the Chicago Real Estate Board, horrified by the influx of southern blacks, lobbied to zone the entire city by race. But after the Supreme Court ruled against explicit racial zoning that year, the city was forced to pursue its agenda by more-discreet means.\n\nLike the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, the Federal Housing Administration initially insisted on restrictive covenants, which helped bar blacks and other ethnic undesirables from receiving federally backed home loans. By the 1940s, Chicago led the nation in the use of these restrictive covenants, and about half of all residential neighborhoods in the city were effectively off-limits to blacks.\n\nIt is common today to become misty-eyed about the old black ghetto, where doctors and lawyers lived next door to meatpackers and steelworkers, who themselves lived next door to prostitutes and the unemployed. This segregationist nostalgia ignores the actual conditions endured by the people living there-vermin and arson, for instance-and ignores the fact that the old ghetto was premised on denying black people privileges enjoyed by white Americans.\n\nIn 1948, when the Supreme Court ruled that restrictive covenants, while permissible, were not enforceable by judicial action, Chicago had other weapons at the ready. The Illinois state legislature had already given Chicago's city council the right to approve-and thus to veto-any public housing in the city's wards. This came in handy in 1949, when a new federal housing act sent millions of tax dollars into Chicago and other cities around the country. Beginning in 1950, site selection for public housing proceeded entirely on the grounds of segregation. By the 1960s, the city had created with its vast housing projects what the historian Arnold R. Hirsch calls a \"second ghetto,\" one larger than the old Black Belt but just as impermeable. More than 98 percent of all the family public-housing units built in Chicago between 1950 and the mid‐1960s were built in all-black neighborhoods.\n\nGovernmental embrace of segregation was driven by the virulent racism of Chicago's white citizens. White neighborhoods vulnerable to black encroachment formed block associations for the sole purpose of enforcing segregation. They lobbied fellow whites not to sell. They lobbied those blacks who did manage to buy to sell back. In 1949, a group of Englewood Catholics formed block associations intended to \"keep up the neighborhood.\" Translation: keep black people out. And when civic engagement was not enough, when government failed, when private banks could no longer hold the line, Chicago turned to an old tool in the American repertoire-racial violence. \"The pattern of terrorism is easily discernible,\" concluded a Chicago civic group in the 1940s. \"It is at the seams of the black ghetto in all directions.\" On July 1 and 2 of 1946, a mob of thousands assembled in Chicago's Park Manor neighborhood, hoping to eject a black doctor who'd recently moved in. The mob pelted the house with rocks and set the garage on fire. The doctor moved away.\n\nIn 1947, after a few black veterans moved into the Fernwood section of Chicago, three nights of rioting broke out; gangs of whites yanked blacks off streetcars and beat them. Two years later, when a union meeting attended by blacks in Englewood triggered rumors that a home was being \"sold to niggers,\" blacks (and whites thought to be sympathetic to them) were beaten in the streets. In 1951, thousands of whites in Cicero, 20 minutes or so west of downtown Chicago, attacked an apartment building that housed a single black family, throwing bricks and firebombs through the windows and setting the apartment on fire. A Cook County grand jury declined to charge the rioters-and instead indicted the family's NAACP attorney, the apartment's white owner, and the owner's attorney and rental agent, charging them with conspiring to lower property values. Two years after that, whites picketed and planted explosives in South Deering, about 30 minutes from downtown Chicago, to force blacks out.\n\nWhen terrorism ultimately failed, white homeowners simply fled the neighborhood. The traditional terminology, white flight , implies a kind of natural expression of preference. In fact, white flight was a triumph of social engineering, orchestrated by the shared racist presumptions of America's public and private sectors. For should any nonracist white families decide that integration might not be so bad as a matter of principle or practicality, they still had to contend with the hard facts of American housing policy: When the mid-20th-century white homeowner claimed that the presence of a Bill and Daisy Myers decreased his property value, he was not merely engaging in racist dogma-he was accurately observing the impact of federal policy on market prices. Redlining destroyed the possibility of investment wherever black people lived.\n\nSpeculators in North Lawndale , and at the edge of the black ghettos, knew there was money to be made off white panic. They resorted to \"block-busting\"-spooking whites into selling cheap before the neighborhood became black. They would hire a black woman to walk up and down the street with a stroller. Or they'd hire someone to call a number in the neighborhood looking for \"Johnny Mae.\" Then they'd cajole whites into selling at low prices, informing them that the more blacks who moved in, the more the value of their homes would decline, so better to sell now. With these white-fled homes in hand, speculators then turned to the masses of black people who had streamed northward as part of the Great Migration, or who were desperate to escape the ghettos: the speculators would take the houses they'd just bought cheap through block-busting and sell them to blacks on contract.\n\nTo keep up with his payments and keep his heat on, Clyde Ross took a second job at the post office and then a third job delivering pizza. His wife took a job working at Marshall Field. He had to take some of his children out of private school. He was not able to be at home to supervise his children or help them with their homework. Money and time that Ross wanted to give his children went instead to enrich white speculators.\n\n\"The problem was the money,\" Ross told me. \"Without the money, you can't move. You can't educate your kids. You can't give them the right kind of food. Can't make the house look good. They think this neighborhood is where they supposed to be. It changes their outlook. My kids were going to the best schools in this neighborhood, and I couldn't keep them in there.\"\n\nMattie Lewis came to Chicago from her native Alabama in the mid-'40s, when she was 21, persuaded by a friend who told her she could get a job as a hairdresser. Instead she was hired by Western Electric, where she worked for 41 years. I met Lewis in the home of her neighbor Ethel Weatherspoon. Both had owned homes in North Lawndale for more than 50 years. Both had bought their houses on contract. Both had been active with Clyde Ross in the Contract Buyers League's effort to garner restitution from contract sellers who'd operated in North Lawndale, banks who'd backed the scheme, and even the Federal Housing Administration. We were joined by Jack Macnamara, who'd been an organizing force in the Contract Buyers League when it was founded, in 1968. Our gathering had the feel of a reunion, because the writer James Alan McPherson had profiled the Contract Buyers League for The Atlantic back in 1972.\n\nWeatherspoon bought her home in 1957. \"Most of the whites started moving out,\" she told me. \"'The blacks are coming. The blacks are coming.' They actually said that. They had signs up: Don't sell to blacks .\"\n\nBefore moving to North Lawndale, Lewis and her husband tried moving to Cicero after seeing a house advertised for sale there. \"Sorry, I just sold it today,\" the Realtor told Lewis's husband. \"I told him, 'You know they don't want you in Cicero,' \" Lewis recalls. \" 'They ain't going to let nobody black in Cicero.' \"\n\nIn 1958, the couple bought a home in North Lawndale on contract. They were not blind to the unfairness. But Lewis, born in the teeth of Jim Crow, considered American piracy-black people keep on making it, white people keep on taking it-a fact of nature. \"All I wanted was a house. And that was the only way I could get it. They weren't giving black people loans at that time,\" she said. \"We thought, 'This is the way it is. We going to do it till we die, and they ain't never going to accept us. That's just the way it is.'\n\n\"The only way you were going to buy a home was to do it the way they wanted,\" she continued. \"And I was determined to get me a house. If everybody else can have one, I want one too. I had worked for white people in the South. And I saw how these white people were living in the North and I thought, 'One day I'm going to live just like them.' I wanted cabinets and all these things these other people have.\"\n\nWhenever she visited white co-workers at their homes, she saw the difference. \"I could see we were just getting ripped off,\" she said. \"I would see things and I would say, 'I'd like to do this at my house.' And they would say, 'Do it,' but I would think, 'I can't, because it costs us so much more.' \"\n\nI asked Lewis and Weatherspoon how they kept up on payments.\n\n\"You paid it and kept working,\" Lewis said of the contract. \"When that payment came up, you knew you had to pay it.\"\n\n\"You cut down on the light bill. Cut down on your food bill,\" Weatherspoon interjected.\n\n\"You cut down on things for your child, that was the main thing,\" said Lewis. \"My oldest wanted to be an artist and my other wanted to be a dancer and my other wanted to take music.\"\n\nLewis and Weatherspoon, like Ross, were able to keep their homes. The suit did not win them any remuneration. But it forced contract sellers to the table, where they allowed some members of the Contract Buyers League to move into regular mortgages or simply take over their houses outright. By then they'd been bilked for thousands. In talking with Lewis and Weatherspoon, I was seeing only part of the picture-the tiny minority who'd managed to hold on to their homes. But for all our exceptional ones, for every Barack and Michelle Obama, for every Ethel Weatherspoon or Clyde Ross, for every black survivor, there are so many thousands gone.\n\n\"A lot of people fell by the way,\" Lewis told me. \"One woman asked me if I would keep all her china. She said, 'They ain't going to set you out.' \"\n\nOn a recent spring afternoon in North Lawndale, I visited Billy Lamar Brooks Sr. Brooks has been an activist since his youth in the Black Panther Party, when he aided the Contract Buyers League. I met him in his office at the Better Boys Foundation, a staple of North Lawndale whose mission is to direct local kids off the streets and into jobs and college. Brooks's work is personal. On June 14, 1991, his 19-year-old son, Billy Jr., was shot and killed. \"These guys tried to stick him up,\" Brooks told me. \"I suspect he could have been involved in some things ... He's always on my mind. Every day.\"\n\nBrooks was not raised in the streets, though in such a neighborhood it is impossible to avoid the influence. \"I was in church three or four times a week. That's where the girls were,\" he said, laughing. \"The stark reality is still there. There's no shield from life. You got to go to school. I lived here. I went to Marshall High School. Over here were the Egyptian Cobras. Over there were the Vice Lords.\"\n\nBrooks has since moved away from Chicago's West Side. But he is still working in North Lawndale. If \"you got a nice house, you live in a nice neighborhood, then you are less prone to violence, because your space is not deprived,\" Brooks said. \"You got a security point. You don't need no protection.\" But if \"you grow up in a place like this, housing sucks. When they tore down the projects here, they left the high-rises and came to the neighborhood with that gang mentality. You don't have nothing, so you going to take something, even if it's not real. You don't have no street, but in your mind it's yours.\"\n\nWe walked over to a window behind his desk. A group of young black men were hanging out in front of a giant mural memorializing two black men: In Lovin Memory Quentin aka \"Q ,\" July 18, 1974 ❤ March 2, 2012 . The name and face of the other man had been spray-painted over by a rival group. The men drank beer. Occasionally a car would cruise past, slow to a crawl, then stop. One of the men would approach the car and make an exchange, then the car would drive off. Brooks had known all of these young men as boys.\n\n\"That's their corner,\" he said.\n\nWe watched another car roll through, pause briefly, then drive off. \"No respect, no shame,\" Brooks said. \"That's what they do. From that alley to that corner. They don't go no farther than that. See the big brother there? He almost died a couple of years ago. The one drinking the beer back there ... I know all of them. And the reason they feel safe here is cause of this building, and because they too chickenshit to go anywhere. But that's their mentality. That's their block.\"\n\nBrooks showed me a picture of a Little League team he had coached. He went down the row of kids, pointing out which ones were in jail, which ones were dead, and which ones were doing all right. And then he pointed out his son-\"That's my boy, Billy,\" Brooks said. Then he wondered aloud if keeping his son with him while working in North Lawndale had hastened his death. \"It's a definite connection, because he was part of what I did here. And I think maybe I shouldn't have exposed him. But then, I had to,\" he said, \"because I wanted him with me.\"\n\nFrom the White House on down, the myth holds that fatherhood is the great antidote to all that ails black people. But Billy Brooks Jr. had a father. Trayvon Martin had a father. Jordan Davis had a father. Adhering to middle-class norms has never shielded black people from plunder. Adhering to middle-class norms is what made Ethel Weatherspoon a lucrative target for rapacious speculators. Contract sellers did not target the very poor. They targeted black people who had worked hard enough to save a down payment and dreamed of the emblem of American citizenship-homeownership. It was not a tangle of pathology that put a target on Clyde Ross's back. It was not a culture of poverty that singled out Mattie Lewis for \"the thrill of the chase and the kill.\" Some black people always will be twice as good. But they generally find white predation to be thrice as fast.\n\nLiberals today mostly view racism not as an active, distinct evil but as a relative of white poverty and inequality. They ignore the long tradition of this country actively punishing black success-and the elevation of that punishment, in the mid-20th century, to federal policy. President Lyndon Johnson may have noted in his historic civil-rights speech at Howard University in 1965 that \"Negro poverty is not white poverty.\" But his advisers and their successors were, and still are, loath to craft any policy that recognizes the difference.\n\nAfter his speech, Johnson convened a group of civil-rights leaders, including the esteemed A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin, to address the \"ancient brutality.\" In a strategy paper, they agreed with the president that \"Negro poverty is a special, and particularly destructive, form of American poverty.\" But when it came to specifically addressing the \"particularly destructive,\" Rustin's group demurred, preferring to advance programs that addressed \"all the poor, black and white.\"\n\nreporter's notebook White Racism vs. White Resentment \"The idea that Affirmative Action justifies white resentment may be the greatest argument made for reparations-like ever.\" Read more\n\nThe urge to use the moral force of the black struggle to address broader inequalities originates in both compassion and pragmatism. But it makes for ambiguous policy. Affirmative action's precise aims, for instance, have always proved elusive. Is it meant to make amends for the crimes heaped upon black people? Not according to the Supreme Court. In its 1978 ruling in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , the Court rejected \"societal discrimination\" as \"an amorphous concept of injury that may be ageless in its reach into the past.\" Is affirmative action meant to increase \"diversity\"? If so, it only tangentially relates to the specific problems of black people-the problem of what America has taken from them over several centuries.\n\nThis confusion about affirmative action's aims, along with our inability to face up to the particular history of white-imposed black disadvantage, dates back to the policy's origins. \"There is no fixed and firm definition of affirmative action,\" an appointee in Johnson's Department of Labor declared. \"Affirmative action is anything that you have to do to get results. But this does not necessarily include preferential treatment.\"\n\nYet America was built on the preferential treatment of white people-395 years of it. Vaguely endorsing a cuddly, feel-good diversity does very little to redress this.\n\nToday, progressives are loath to invoke white supremacy as an explanation for anything. On a practical level, the hesitation comes from the dim view the Supreme Court has taken of the reforms of the 1960s. The Voting Rights Act has been gutted. The Fair Housing Act might well be next. Affirmative action is on its last legs. In substituting a broad class struggle for an anti-racist struggle, progressives hope to assemble a coalition by changing the subject.\n\nThe politics of racial evasion are seductive. But the record is mixed. Aid to Families With Dependent Children was originally written largely to exclude blacks-yet by the 1990s it was perceived as a giveaway to blacks. The Affordable Care Act makes no mention of race, but this did not keep Rush Limbaugh from denouncing it as reparations. Moreover, the act's expansion of Medicaid was effectively made optional, meaning that many poor blacks in the former Confederate states do not benefit from it. The Affordable Care Act, like Social Security, will eventually expand its reach to those left out; in the meantime, black people will be injured.\n\n\"All that it would take to sink a new WPA program would be some skillfully packaged footage of black men leaning on shovels smoking cigarettes,\" the sociologist Douglas S. Massey writes. \"Papering over the issue of race makes for bad social theory, bad research, and bad public policy.\" To ignore the fact that one of the oldest republics in the world was erected on a foundation of white supremacy, to pretend that the problems of a dual society are the same as the problems of unregulated capitalism, is to cover the sin of national plunder with the sin of national lying. The lie ignores the fact that reducing American poverty and ending white supremacy are not the same. The lie ignores the fact that closing the \"achievement gap\" will do nothing to close the \"injury gap,\" in which black college graduates still suffer higher unemployment rates than white college graduates, and black job applicants without criminal records enjoy roughly the same chance of getting hired as white applicants with criminal records.\n\nChicago, like the country at large, embraced policies that placed black America's most energetic, ambitious, and thrifty countrymen beyond the pale of society and marked them as rightful targets for legal theft. The effects reverberate beyond the families who were robbed to the community that beholds the spectacle. Don't just picture Clyde Ross working three jobs so he could hold on to his home. Think of his North Lawndale neighbors-their children, their nephews and nieces-and consider how watching this affects them. Imagine yourself as a young black child watching your elders play by all the rules only to have their possessions tossed out in the street and to have their most sacred possession-their home-taken from them.\n\nThe message the young black boy receives from his country, Billy Brooks says, is \" 'You ain't shit. You not no good. The only thing you are worth is working for us. You will never own anything. You not going to get an education. We are sending your ass to the penitentiary.' They're telling you no matter how hard you struggle, no matter what you put down, you ain't shit. 'We're going to take what you got. You will never own anything, nigger.' \"\n\nW hen Clyde Ross was a child , his older brother Winter had a seizure. He was picked up by the authorities and delivered to Parchman Farm, a 20,000-acre state prison in the Mississippi Delta region.\n\n\"He was a gentle person,\" Clyde Ross says of his brother. \"You know, he was good to everybody. And he started having spells, and he couldn't control himself. And they had him picked up, because they thought he was dangerous.\"\n\nBuilt at the turn of the century, Parchman was supposed to be a progressive and reformist response to the problem of \"Negro crime.\" In fact it was the gulag of Mississippi, an object of terror to African Americans in the Delta. In the early years of the 20th century, Mississippi Governor James K. Vardaman used to amuse himself by releasing black convicts into the surrounding wilderness and hunting them down with bloodhounds. \"Throughout the American South,\" writes David M. Oshinsky in his book Worse Than Slavery , \"Parchman Farm is synonymous with punishment and brutality, as well it should be ... Parchman is the quintessential penal farm, the closest thing to slavery that survived the Civil War.\"\n\nWhen the Ross family went to retrieve Winter, the authorities told them that Winter had died. When the Ross family asked for his body, the authorities at Parchman said they had buried him. The family never saw Winter's body.\n\nAnd this was just one of their losses.\n\nScholars have long discussed methods by which America might make reparations to those on whose labor and exclusion the country was built. In the 1970s, the Yale Law professor Boris Bittker argued in The Case for Black Reparations that a rough price tag for reparations could be determined by multiplying the number of African Americans in the population by the difference in white and black per capita income. That number-$34 billion in 1973, when Bittker wrote his book-could be added to a reparations program each year for a decade or two. Today Charles Ogletree, the Harvard Law School professor, argues for something broader: a program of job training and public works that takes racial justice as its mission but includes the poor of all races.\n\nPerhaps no statistic better illustrates the enduring legacy of our country's shameful history of treating black people as sub-citizens, sub-Americans, and sub-humans than the wealth gap. Reparations would seek to close this chasm. But as surely as the creation of the wealth gap required the cooperation of every aspect of the society, bridging it will require the same.\n\nPerhaps after a serious discussion and debate-the kind that HR 40 proposes-we may find that the country can never fully repay African Americans. But we stand to discover much about ourselves in such a discussion-and that is perhaps what scares us. The idea of reparations is frightening not simply because we might lack the ability to pay. The idea of reparations threatens something much deeper-America's heritage, history, and standing in the world.\n\nT he early American economy was built on slave labor. The Capitol and the White House were built by slaves. President James K. Polk traded slaves from the Oval Office. The laments about \"black pathology,\" the criticism of black family structures by pundits and intellectuals, ring hollow in a country whose existence was predicated on the torture of black fathers, on the rape of black mothers, on the sale of black children. An honest assessment of America's relationship to the black family reveals the country to be not its nurturer but its destroyer.\n\nAnd this destruction did not end with slavery. Discriminatory laws joined the equal burden of citizenship to unequal distribution of its bounty. These laws reached their apex in the mid-20th century, when the federal government-through housing policies-engineered the wealth gap, which remains with us to this day. When we think of white supremacy, we picture Colored Only signs, but we should picture pirate flags.\n\nOn some level, we have always grasped this.\n\n\"Negro poverty is not white poverty,\" President Johnson said in his historic civil-rights speech.\n\nWe invoke the words of Jefferson and Lincoln because they say something about our legacy and our traditions. We do this because we recognize our links to the past-at least when they flatter us. But black history does not flatter American democracy; it chastens it. The popular mocking of reparations as a harebrained scheme authored by wild-eyed lefties and intellectually unserious black nationalists is fear masquerading as laughter. Black nationalists have always perceived something unmentionable about America that integrationists dare not acknowledge-that white supremacy is not merely the work of hotheaded demagogues, or a matter of false consciousness, but a force so fundamental to America that it is difficult to imagine the country without it.\n\nAnd so we must imagine a new country. Reparations-by which I mean the full acceptance of our collective biography and its consequences-is the price we must pay to see ourselves squarely. The recovering alcoholic may well have to live with his illness for the rest of his life. But at least he is not living a drunken lie. Reparations beckons us to reject the intoxication of hubris and see America as it is-the work of fallible humans.\n\nWon't reparations divide us? Not any more than we are already divided. The wealth gap merely puts a number on something we feel but cannot say-that American prosperity was ill-gotten and selective in its distribution. What is needed is an airing of family secrets, a settling with old ghosts. What is needed is a healing of the American psyche and the banishment of white guilt.\n\nWhat I'm talking about is more than recompense for past injustices-more than a handout, a payoff, hush money, or a reluctant bribe. What I'm talking about is a national reckoning that would lead to spiritual renewal. Reparations would mean the end of scarfing hot dogs on the Fourth of July while denying the facts of our heritage. Reparations would mean the end of yelling \"patriotism\" while waving a Confederate flag. Reparations would mean a revolution of the American consciousness, a reconciling of our self-image as the great democratizer with the facts of our history.\n\nW e are not the first to be summoned to such a challenge.\n\nIn 1952, when West Germany began the process of making amends for the Holocaust, it did so under conditions that should be instructive to us. Resistance was violent. Very few Germans believed that Jews were entitled to anything. Only 5 percent of West Germans surveyed reported feeling guilty about the Holocaust, and only 29 percent believed that Jews were owed restitution from the German people.\n\nreporter's notebook The Auschwitz All Around Us \"It's very hard to accept white supremacy as a structure erected by actual people, as a choice, as an interest, as opposed to a momentary bout of insanity.\" Read more\n\n\"The rest,\" the historian Tony Judt wrote in his 2005 book, Postwar , \"were divided between those (some two-fifths of respondents) who thought that only people 'who really committed something' were responsible and should pay, and those (21 percent) who thought 'that the Jews themselves were partly responsible for what happened to them during the Third Reich.' \"\n\nGermany's unwillingness to squarely face its history went beyond polls. Movies that suggested a societal responsibility for the Holocaust beyond Hitler were banned. \"The German soldier fought bravely and honorably for his homeland,\" claimed President Eisenhower, endorsing the Teutonic national myth. Judt wrote, \"Throughout the fifties West German officialdom encouraged a comfortable view of the German past in which the Wehrmacht was heroic, while Nazis were in a minority and properly punished.\"\n\nKonrad Adenauer, the postwar German chancellor, was in favor of reparations, but his own party was divided, and he was able to get an agreement passed only with the votes of the Social Democratic opposition.\n\nAmong the Jews of Israel, reparations provoked violent and venomous reactions ranging from denunciation to assassination plots. On January 7, 1952, as the Knesset-the Israeli parliament-convened to discuss the prospect of a reparations agreement with West Germany, Menachem Begin, the future prime minister of Israel, stood in front of a large crowd, inveighing against the country that had plundered the lives, labor, and property of his people. Begin claimed that all Germans were Nazis and guilty of murder. His condemnations then spread to his own young state. He urged the crowd to stop paying taxes and claimed that the nascent Israeli nation characterized the fight over whether or not to accept reparations as a \"war to the death.\" When alerted that the police watching the gathering were carrying tear gas, allegedly of German manufacture, Begin yelled, \"The same gases that asphyxiated our parents!\"\n\nBegin then led the crowd in an oath to never forget the victims of the Shoah, lest \"my right hand lose its cunning\" and \"my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.\" He took the crowd through the streets toward the Knesset. From the rooftops, police repelled the crowd with tear gas and smoke bombs. But the wind shifted, and the gas blew back toward the Knesset, billowing through windows shattered by rocks. In the chaos, Begin and Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion exchanged insults. Two hundred civilians and 140 police officers were wounded. Nearly 400 people were arrested. Knesset business was halted.\n\nBegin then addressed the chamber with a fiery speech condemning the actions the legislature was about to take. \"Today you arrested hundreds,\" he said. \"Tomorrow you may arrest thousands. No matter, they will go, they will sit in prison. We will sit there with them. If necessary, we will be killed with them. But there will be no 'reparations' from Germany.\"\n\nSurvivors of the Holocaust feared laundering the reputation of Germany with money, and mortgaging the memory of their dead. Beyond that, there was a taste for revenge. \"My soul would be at rest if I knew there would be 6 million German dead to match the 6 million Jews,\" said Meir Dworzecki, who'd survived the concentration camps of Estonia.\n\nBen-Gurion countered this sentiment, not by repudiating vengeance but with cold calculation: \"If I could take German property without sitting down with them for even a minute but go in with jeeps and machine guns to the warehouses and take it, I would do that-if, for instance, we had the ability to send a hundred divisions and tell them, 'Take it.' But we can't do that.\"\n\nThe reparations conversation set off a wave of bomb attempts by Israeli militants. One was aimed at the foreign ministry in Tel Aviv. Another was aimed at Chancellor Adenauer himself. And one was aimed at the port of Haifa, where the goods bought with reparations money were arriving. West Germany ultimately agreed to pay Israel 3.45 billion deutsche marks, or more than $7 billion in today's dollars. Individual reparations claims followed-for psychological trauma, for offense to Jewish honor, for halting law careers, for life insurance, for time spent in concentration camps. Seventeen percent of funds went toward purchasing ships. \"By the end of 1961, these reparations vessels constituted two-thirds of the Israeli merchant fleet,\" writes the Israeli historian Tom Segev in his book The Seventh Million . \"From 1953 to 1963, the reparations money funded about a third of the total investment in Israel's electrical system, which tripled its capacity, and nearly half the total investment in the railways.\"\n\nIsrael's GNP tripled during the 12 years of the agreement. The Bank of Israel attributed 15 percent of this growth, along with 45,000 jobs, to investments made with reparations money. But Segev argues that the impact went far beyond that. Reparations \"had indisputable psychological and political importance,\" he writes.\n\nReparations could not make up for the murder perpetrated by the Nazis. But they did launch Germany's reckoning with itself, and perhaps provided a road map for how a great civilization might make itself worthy of the name.\n\nAssessing the reparations agreement, David Ben-Gurion said:\n\nSomething more than moral pressure calls America to reparations. We cannot escape our history. All of our solutions to the great problems of health care, education, housing, and economic inequality are troubled by what must go unspoken. \"The reason black people are so far behind now is not because of now,\" Clyde Ross told me. \"It's because of then.\" In the early 2000s, Charles Ogletree went to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to meet with the survivors of the 1921 race riot that had devastated \"Black Wall Street.\" The past was not the past to them. \"It was amazing seeing these black women and men who were crippled, blind, in wheelchairs,\" Ogletree told me. \"I had no idea who they were and why they wanted to see me. They said, 'We want you to represent us in this lawsuit.' \"\n\nA commission authorized by the Oklahoma legislature produced a report affirming that the riot, the knowledge of which had been suppressed for years, had happened. But the lawsuit ultimately failed, in 2004. Similar suits pushed against corporations such as Aetna (which insured slaves) and Lehman Brothers (whose co-founding partner owned them) also have thus far failed. These results are dispiriting, but the crime with which reparations activists charge the country implicates more than just a few towns or corporations. The crime indicts the American people themselves, at every level, and in nearly every configuration. A crime that implicates the entire American people deserves its hearing in the legislative body that represents them.\n\nJohn Conyers's HR 40 is the vehicle for that hearing. No one can know what would come out of such a debate. Perhaps no number can fully capture the multi-century plunder of black people in America. Perhaps the number is so large that it can't be imagined, let alone calculated and dispensed. But I believe that wrestling publicly with these questions matters as much as-if not more than-the specific answers that might be produced. An America that asks what it owes its most vulnerable citizens is improved and humane. An America that looks away is ignoring not just the sins of the past but the sins of the present and the certain sins of the future. More important than any single check cut to any African American, the payment of reparations would represent America's maturation out of the childhood myth of its innocence into a wisdom worthy of its founders.\n\nI n 2010, Jacob S. Rugh, then a doctoral candidate at Princeton, and the sociologist Douglas S. Massey published a study of the recent foreclosure crisis. Among its drivers, they found an old foe: segregation. Black home buyers-even after controlling for factors like creditworthiness-were still more likely than white home buyers to be steered toward subprime loans. Decades of racist housing policies by the American government, along with decades of racist housing practices by American businesses, had conspired to concentrate African Americans in the same neighborhoods. As in North Lawndale half a century earlier, these neighborhoods were filled with people who had been cut off from mainstream financial institutions. When subprime lenders went looking for prey, they found black people waiting like ducks in a pen.\n\n\"High levels of segregation create a natural market for subprime lending,\" Rugh and Massey write, \"and cause riskier mortgages, and thus foreclosures, to accumulate disproportionately in racially segregated cities' minority neighborhoods.\"\n\nPlunder in the past made plunder in the present efficient. The banks of America understood this. In 2005, Wells Fargo promoted a series of Wealth Building Strategies seminars. Dubbing itself \"the nation's leading originator of home loans to ethnic minority customers,\" the bank enrolled black public figures in an ostensible effort to educate blacks on building \"generational wealth.\" But the \"wealth building\" seminars were a front for wealth theft. In 2010, the Justice Department filed a discrimination suit against Wells Fargo alleging that the bank had shunted blacks into predatory loans regardless of their creditworthiness. This was not magic or coincidence or misfortune. It was racism reifying itself. According to The New York Times , affidavits found loan officers referring to their black customers as \"mud people\" and to their subprime products as \"ghetto loans.\"\n\n\"We just went right after them,\" Beth Jacobson, a former Wells Fargo loan officer, told The Times . \"Wells Fargo mortgage had an emerging-markets unit that specifically targeted black churches because it figured church leaders had a lot of influence and could convince congregants to take out subprime loans.\"\n\nIn 2011, Bank of America agreed to pay $355 million to settle charges of discrimination against its Countrywide unit. The following year, Wells Fargo settled its discrimination suit for more than $175 million. But the damage had been done. In 2009, half the properties in Baltimore whose owners had been granted loans by Wells Fargo between 2005 and 2008 were vacant; 71 percent of these properties were in predominantly black neighborhoods.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "Affirmative Action Shouldn't Be About Diversity\n\nIt should be about reparations-not about the supposedly unique perspectives that minorities would offer white students.\n\nI was a 16-year-old student at the Bronx High School of Science, scribbling Concrete Blonde lyrics at my desk, when my English teacher abruptly called on me, without a heads-up or any preparation, to explain my thoughts on the word nigger in Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn .\n\nTruth be told, I didn't have an opinion, at least not a sophisticated, nuanced one, because I was a teenager reading Twain for the first time. I was there to learn like everyone else. But suddenly, as one of two black students in the class, I was expected to enhance the learning experiences of my mostly white counterparts. I'll never forget the terrifying and confusing feeling of going from a part of the classroom to a classroom accessory.\n\nBronx Science is one of the three original specialized high schools run by the New York City Department of Education. These schools are required by state law to admit students based solely on the uniform Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. As I grew up and succeeded in this cut-throat, supposedly merit-based space, part of me feared any association with affirmative-action programs. I'd earned my way into Bronx Science, and I worried that anyone who didn't understand how the system worked would assume I'd been given a leg up.\n\nAs an adult, I don't oppose affirmative action-quite the contrary-but I support only certain justifications for it. Affirmative action should be implemented as part of a broader reparations program; the point should be justice, not \"diversity.\"\n\nCaitlin Flanagan: The dueling deities of Harvard\n\nI remember hearing a lot about the evils of affirmative action as a high-school student in the 1990s, and more than a few of my classmates figured I would all but automatically gain admission to every college I applied to. They were presumably reading stories about how the University of Michigan, in 1998, began using a 150-point scale to rank applicants, with 100 points needed to guarantee admission. The university gave underrepresented ethnic groups an automatic 20 points on this scale. Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher, both white residents of Michigan, claimed to have been harmed by this system in their applications to the university.\n\nTheir complaint eventually reached the Supreme Court in Gratz v. Bollinger in 2003. The majority opinion held that the University of Michigan's use of racial preferences in undergraduate admissions violated both the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (President Lyndon Johnson's legislation that originally advanced affirmative action). The Court did, however, rely on precedent to accept the argument that diversity can constitute a compelling state interest.\n\nThat precedent was the 1978 case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke . Allan Bakke, a white male, had been rejected two years in a row by the University of California at Davis medical school, which had reserved 16 out of 100 places for qualified minorities.\n\nFour justices defended the use of racial quotas to remedy the burdens placed on minorities by past racial injustice. As Justice Harry Blackmun wrote, \"In order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently.\"\n\nBut in his majority opinion, Justice Lewis Powell ruled that while UC could use race as a factor in admissions, quotas were impermissible. He argued, moreover, that attaining a diverse student body was the only real interest asserted by the university that survived legal scrutiny. Powell, quoting an unrelated case, emphasized that the \"'nation's future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure' to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this nation of many peoples.\"\n\nIn its reasoning, the Court suggested that the point of affirmative action was to foster a more varied classroom environment for \"leaders,\" thus shifting the intended beneficiary of the program from the historically discriminated against to the nation that had discriminated against them. And who are these \"leaders\"? The future, Powell implied, perhaps without realizing it, depends on white students' exposure to the supposedly unique ideas and mores that qualified minorities should offer.\n\nWhile the push for diverse representation in society is important, it has no place in the legislation of affirmative action. Besides not addressing the actual issues-discrimination and inequality-this ideology creates \"otherness.\" It breeds the singling out of people who haven't traditionally held positions of power, people who are often seen as either inferior or astonishingly exceptional, and therefore spectacle. This ideology demands wisdom from an ignorant 16-year-old that, rightly, the state should offer.\n\nAffirmative action should be about reparations and leveling a playing field that was legally imbalanced for hundreds of years and not about the re-centering of whiteness while, yet again, demanding free (intellectual) labor from the historically disenfranchised.\n\nRead: The problem with how higher education treats diversity\n\nAffirmative action, whatever the rationale, has also never been the only, or even the most important, advantage in college admissions. Luke Harris, a Vassar professor, and Kimberlé Crenshaw, a professor at Columbia University and UCLA-both critical-race-theory pioneers-have noted that what got lost in the University of Michigan fight was that students were also awarded 10 points for attending elite high schools, eight points for taking a certain number of AP courses, and four points for being legacies. That's 22 points that certain affluent and middle-class students had built in that poor, first-generation college students had little or no access to. This structure rewarded students who already benefited from living in upscale neighborhoods, who had successful parents or parents who, at the very least, knew how to succeed in \"the system,\" and who continued to benefit from the affirmative action of not descending from people who for generations were banned from reading, buying property, and living in safe neighborhoods with decent schools.\n\nSomehow, advantages of this sort are often invisible to the general public. And if they're made visible, the most coddled people in American society tend to get their feelings hurt-and insist on their self-worth. This dynamic explains the theater of defensiveness that played before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2018, as then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who attended one of the most expensive prep schools in the nation and who is the son of a lobbyist and judge, sneered, \"I got into Yale Law School. That's the No. 1 law school in the country. I had no connections there. I got there by busting my tail in college.\" Kavanaugh's grandfather Everett Edward Kavanaugh went to Yale as an undergraduate. If Kavanaugh truly does believe that he is an island of his own merits, his lack of historical knowledge and his lack of awareness of his own privilege are terrifying for any judge, let alone a Supreme Court justice who could soon preside over affirmative-action cases.\n\nRead: The weakening definition of \"diversity\"\n\nI'm not the only person who's skeptical of the diversity rationale. Lee Bollinger, current president of Columbia University-and whose name was attached to Gratz v. Bollinger as then president of the University of Michigan-sees both its advantages and pitfalls. When I interviewed him for my graduate thesis just weeks before he presided over my 2013 Columbia commencement ceremony, he said his legal team presented the more society-appeasing argument somewhat instrumentally. \"We needed to win a major legal battle in the context of trying to win the hearts and minds of people about the issue,\" he recalled.\n\nAlthough he believes diversity is an important part of education, he doesn't think it should be the sole permissible legal basis for an affirmative-action program. Referring to the 1978 Bakke case that struck down racial quotas, Bollinger said, \"On the legal side, Bakke made it clear that you couldn't use past discrimination as a rationale. I felt that was wrong and still feel that's wrong.\" When making the case for affirmative action, he prefers to start the conversation by talking about Brown v. Board of Education as opposed to Bakke . \"I'm increasingly worried that there is a historical amnesia under way,\" he said.\n\nAmnesia, defensiveness, and a lack of focus on any one issue as many of us scramble to address the current, nonstop assault on progressive values. What's the practical solution? I'd rather publicly dissect Twain than pretend I can solve an almost insurmountable problem I didn't create; I just know that not having a proper conversation about the purpose of affirmative action is dangerous. And there have been ideas percolating around restorative justice and reparations for a long time.\n\nIn 2013, Britain, France, and the Netherlands were sued by 14 Caribbean countries demanding what could be hundreds of billions of pounds in reparations for slavery. I read the documentation and thought, Yes, let's at least talk about how those European countries flourished, in part, because of brutality and slavery. Let's start there instead of a lopsided debate about how EU countries should or shouldn't be benevolent enough to give the refugee descendants of the countries they pillaged legal status and a chance to succeed. That sort of acknowledgment, on both sides of the Atlantic, would be a start."

      "text": "There Is No Middle Ground on Reparations\n\nAmericans who oppose reparations care more about responding to political expediency than about the emergency of inequality.\n\nOn December 1, 1862-a month before he issued the Emancipation Proclamation-President Abraham Lincoln wrote to Congress. He was not yet the Great Emancipator. Instead, he proposed to become the Great Compensator.\n\nLincoln proposed a Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: the most expansive and expensive slavery-reparations plan ever put forth by a U.S. president. \"Every State wherein slavery now exists shall abolish the same therein at any time or times before\" January 1, 1900, and slaveholders \"shall receive compensation from the United States\" for emancipating the enslaved.\n\nLincoln stressed to his fellow citizens that \" we cannot escape history.\" Pursuing gradual emancipation, and compensating the enslavers for their lost labor and wealth-and not the enslaved for their lost labor and wealth-would repair a broken America once and for all. \"Other means may succeed,\" he said in closing; \"this could not fail.\"\n\nIndeed, Lincoln's proposal did not fail to escape history. His politically expedient plan made and portended history, projecting a middle ground for Americans to stand between permanent slavery and inequality, and immediate emancipation and equality.\n\nToday, many Americans who oppose reparations, including a slight majority of Democrats, stand on this middle ground. These Americans self-identify as \"not racist,\" but do nothing in the face of the racial wealth gap that grows as white people are compensated by past and present racist policies. Or they support small-scale solutions that barely keep up with this growth. Or they support class-based solutions that are bound to partially fail in solving this class- and race-based problem. Or they oppose reparations because they've consumed the racist idea that black people will waste the \"handouts,\" that the reparations bill will be too expensive, or that black America is not too big to fail.\n\nAmericans who prefer gradual approaches that do not radically disrupt inequality and who label their approaches \"plain, peaceful, generous, just,\" to use Lincoln's words , carelessly ignore or understate the complex, violent, stingy, and unjust damage wrought by inequality. These Americans care more about responding to political expediency than about the emergency of inequality, care more about repairing alienated white Americans than about repairing pillaged black coffers, and claim to be horrified by slavery and \"not racist\" but end up, knowingly or unknowingly, compensating the white beneficiaries of slavery and racism.\n\nThese Americans claim they oppose racism and reparations. They support the drive for economic equality between the races at the same time they are pumping the brakes on the only foreseeable policy that can dramatically close the growing racial wealth gap. Only an expansive and expensive compensation policy for the descendants of the enslaved and relegated of the scale Lincoln proposed for the enslavers and subsidized could prevent the racial wealth gap from compounding and being passed onto another generation.\n\nThe reparations debate returned to Capitol Hill this week for the first time in more than a decade. Ta-Nehisi Coates and Danny Glover testified on Wednesday in a hearing before the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties. Is this hearing, and the fact that some Democratic presidential candidates are endorsing reparations, the beginning of the reckoning? Is the United States finally beginning to acknowledge the economic damage that state-sanctioned racist policies have wrought since slavery? Is the United States finally beginning the process of eradicating those policies and repairing their damage?\n\nFor every $100 of wealth that white families hold , black families hold just $5. One in four black households has zero or negative wealth, in contrast to one in 10 white households. White households make up 96 percent of the top 1 percent, while black households constitute 2 percent of that highest wealth bracket.\n\nThe racial wealth gap will not repair itself. And it is growing.\n\nFrom 1983 to 2013, the wealth of the median black household declined 75 percent as the wealth of the median white household increased 14 percent. By 2020, black people are projected to lose an additional 18 percent of wealth, and white households will own 86 times as much wealth as their black counterparts. By 2053, the median black household is projected to flatline at $0. Generally speaking, black people are facing economic death.\n\nState-sanctioned racist policies, which have opened, sustained, and broadened the racial wealth gap, have often been ironically framed as reparative for white people. Wealthy-white victimhood has been the creed of racist history since long before Donald Trump vowed to repair America's greatness from the tyranny of the first black president. The Founding Fathers identified only themselves as the victims of tyranny. Slaveholders cast themselves as under siege by abolitionists, runaways, and especially revolting captives. Confederates fought the so-called War of Northern Aggression. Whites described civil- and voting-rights bills and judgments as \"made to operate in favor of the colored and against the white race,\" to quote President Andrew Johnson's reasoning for vetoing the first Civil Rights Act in 1866. Klansmen and lynchers said they were fighting against black debauchery. Whites complained they were subjected to affirmative action, welfare queens, the Central Park Five, reverse discrimination, race cards, and roving and ravishing migrants and immigrants.\n\nThroughout this alternative history, white people were collectively accumulating, compounding, and passing down wealth from selling black bodies; exploiting no-wage or low-wage black labor; stealing black assets, from the days of whitecapping to the foreclosure era; seizing opportunities, such as the New Deal or GI Bill, that were denied to black people; utilizing family wealth to start businesses; owning government-subsidized homes in government-subsidized white suburbs or gentrified neighborhoods; and cashing in on Reagan-, Bush-, and Trump-era tax cuts for the already wealthy.\n\nRacist policies have historically compensated people for their whiteness and extracted wealth from people because of their blackness. But Americans occupying the middle ground do not attack these policies like they attack reparations. They support (what they don't call) reparations for white people at the same time they oppose reparations for black people.\n\nWhen the so-called not-racists express their opposition to reparations, I do not quarrel with them over their reasoning. I do not point out the history of white compensation to repair damages that hardly existed. I do not point out their middle ground. I ask a simple question: How does the United States close the growing racial wealth gap without reparations?\n\nNearly all Americans claim to be not-racist, but the so-called not-racists are usually not up to supporting a policy that can create racial equity.\n\nReparations is not my litmus test for presidential candidates. But it is a litmus test for whether a person is being a racist or anti-racist when it comes to one of the most damaging racial inequities of our time, of all American time-the racial wealth gap. To oppose reparations is to be racist. To support reparations is to be anti-racist. The middle ground is racist ground. It is occupied by people passively doing nothing in the face of racial inequity, or actively supporting policies that reproduce racial inequity. The anti-racist approach requires standing up for the policies, like reparations, that can create racial equity.\n\nTake Lincoln's compensation plan in 1862. He considered it a \"compromise among friends.\" Opposition to his planned Emancipation Proclamation had been mounting like casualties from the Civil War. In the November 1862 midterm elections, Democrats gained 34 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives shouting at Republicans like Lincoln: We are warring for reunion with our Southern brethren, not for emancipation. Lincoln shuddered and related. In the summer of 1862, he had publicly declared : \"My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery.\"\n\nLincoln's reparations plan went nowhere. He signed the Emancipation Proclamation as scheduled, on January 1, 1863, as \"a necessary war measure\" to save the Union. But when slavery reemerged in another form after the Civil War, when former slaveholders received a different manner of compensation from Jim Crow, when a civil war had to be fought each time black people proclaimed they should be the ones receiving reparations, it renewed the questions Lincoln answered with his plans to compensate the slaveholders. These questions still divide Americans today. Who is being damaged? Who is being compensated and repaired?\n\nThe slaveholder still-or will it finally be the enslaved?"

      "text": "The Impossibility of Reparations\n\nConsidering the single most important question about racial restitution: How would it work?\n\nThe United States government launched its reparations program to African Americans in autumn of 1969. Originally known as \"the Philadelphia plan,\" the program set quotas for black employment in construction trades. Over the next decades, such quotas would spread from industry to industry, and would expand into higher education and public contracting.\n\nThe plan is usually credited to the Nixon administration. Sometimes it's even described as a secret scheme to split the Democratic base. The history is more prosaic. The plan originated under the Johnson administration, following President Lyndon Johnson's pledge in his 1965 Howard University speech to seek racial equality as a result, not merely as a theory.\n\nIn this month's Atlantic , Ta-Nehisi Coates makes an eloquent case for restitution to black Americans, not only for wrongs done before 1865, but as much or more for wrongs done in the century of segregation that followed. Yet this powerful essay explicitly disavows any consideration of the single most important question about the restitution he has in mind: How would it work?\n\nThe affirmative action experience since 1969 offers some insights into what is likely to happen next:\n\n1) The program will expand to additional groups.\n\nWithin only a very few months of the implementation of the Philadelphia plan, preferences of various kinds were extended to women, Hispanics, and other groups. With any program of reparations, likewise, other claimants will come forward. If African Americans are due payment for slavery and subjugation, what about Native Americans, who lost a whole continent? What about Mexican-Americans, who were deprived by the Mexican-American war of the right to migrate into half their former country? Japanese Americans, interned during World War II? Chinese Americans, the victims of coolie labor and the Oriental Exclusion Acts? Members of these groups may concede that they were not maltreated in the same way as African Americans-and may not be entitled to exactly the same consideration. But if black Americans are entitled to almost a trillion dollars in compensation (Coates suggests a figure of $34 billion a year \"for a decade or two\") surely these other maltreated groups must be entitled at least to something?\n\nCoates's essay is built on an unstated assumption that America's racial composition is essentially binary, a white majority that inflicts inequality; a black minority that suffers inequality. Others enter into his imagination only at the hazy edges: \"One cannot escape the question by hand-waving at the past, disavowing the acts of one's ancestors, nor by citing a recent date of ancestral immigration ... A nation outlives its generations.\"\n\nBut the \"others\" are now 25 percent of the nation and rising fast. Does the Fujianese delivery man pedaling through the brownstones of Fort Greene owe a debt to the people whose food he carries? How much? The reparations idea-so long politically outlandish-has become thinkable today because of the gathering power of the Obama political coalition. But nothing would blow that coalition apart faster than the internal redistribution Coates contemplates from some constituencies to others. And if the idea is that the newest arrivals to America will be persuaded to accept paying reparations as a cost of immigration-or that new Americans can be cajoled to pay a symbolic something because the bulk of the burden will be carried by the dwindling white majority (a majority that already feels ever more culturally insecure and economically beset)-well, that's a prescript for an even more dangerous political explosion.\n\n2) The question of who qualifies will become ever more contested and embittered.\n\nUnder today's racial preference rules, a nephew of the King of Spain or the daughter of the chairman of the biggest bank in Chile would both qualify for Hispanic preferences if they resided in the United States. Harvard can (and does) meet its African American diversity requirements with the children of recent African immigrants, whose families never experienced slavery or segregation in this country.\n\nThe problem of \"who qualifies?\" is explosive enough with hiring and admissions preferences. As the benefits at stake expand to the vast dimensions urged by Coates, the question will become more explosive yet. Does a mixed-race person qualify? How mixed? What about recent immigrants from Africa or the West Indies? What about future immigrants? What about illegal immigrants from Africa who subsequently gain legalization-would amnesty come with a check attached?\n\n3) Side effects will be large and unexpected.\n\nAffirmative action characterizes some parts of the American economy more strongly than others, and in particular the public sector more than the private sector. This pervading fact has shaped the growth of the black middle class. Black Americans are 30 percent more likely than non-blacks to work in the public sector , where they earn higher wages relative to white Americans than they do in private employment. This strategy brought security to many black families in the years between 1970 and 2008.\n\nBut the strategy came at a cost.\n\nFirst, the strategy tethered black economic advancement to the growth of government. That growth has become ever more fiercely contested in recent years. Since 2008, it has abruptly halted and reversed.\n\nSecond, the strategy detoured talented people away from the higher risks and rewards of the private sector, and especially from entrepreneurship. Black Americans are less than half as likely as white to own their own businesses.\n\nA reparations plan is likely to prove even more distorting.\n\nIf paid to individuals as an income stream, reparations would dis-incentivize work.\n\nIf paid to individuals as a lump sum, reparations would expose one of America's least financially sophisticated populations to predatory practices that would make subprime lending seem socially responsible by contrast.\n\nIf paid to institutions or collective entities ... well, let's look at that under another header.\n\n4) The program will work severe inequities.\n\nAffirmative action's quirks and injustices are notorious. But they will be nothing compared to the strange consequences of a reparations program. Not all black people are poor. Not all non-black people are rich. Does Oprah have a housecleaner? Who changes the diapers of Beyonce's baby? Who files Herman J. Russell's taxes? Will their wages be taxed and the proceeds redirected to their employers?\n\nWithin the target population, will all receive the same? Same per person, or same per family? Or will there be adjustment for need? How will need be measured? Will convicted criminals be eligible? If not, the program will exclude perhaps 1 million African Americans. If yes, the program would potentially tax victims of rape and families of the murdered for the benefit of their assailants.\n\nAnd if reparations were somehow delivered communally and collectively, disparities of wealth and power and political influence within black America will become even more urgent. Simply put, when government spends money on complex programs, the people who provide the service usually end up with much more sway over the spending than the spending's intended beneficiaries. The poorer the beneficiaries, the more powerfully this rule holds-and it has held strongest of all in programs intended to aid the black poor. The District of Columbia public schools have excelled at delivering stable jobs to their unionized employees. They have failed their students.\n\n5) The legitimacy of the project will rapidly fade.\n\nAffirmative action ranks among the least popular thing that U.S. governments do. When surveyed, white Americans crushingly reject race preferences, Hispanic Americans object by a margin of two to one, and black Americans are almost evenly divided, with only the slightest plurality in favor .\n\nNow imagine how Americans will feel when what is redistributed by racial calculus is not university admissions or workplace promotions but actual, foldable cash.\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates anticipates this trouble by suggesting that reparations might be paid not to individuals but collectively to African Americans as a group. He favorably cites the example of German reparations to the state of Israel after World War II.\n\nBut the state of Israel was a sovereign, elected by a democratic process. Few in the Jewish world doubted that Israel could and did act for the Jewish people as a whole. Black Americans, however, do not have a state of their own. If reparations are deemed some kind of collective debt to black Americans as a group, rather than to black Americans as individuals, then the question will arise: Who decides how this money will be distributed? Some kind of National Endowment for Black America? Chosen how? Accountable to whom?\n\nThe Harvard Law professor Charles Ogletree suggests widening the concept of reparations even further, into a national \"program of job training and public works that takes racial justice as its mission but includes the poor of all races.\" In that case, reparations would cease to be a new program but would become instead a new argument in favor of the preexisting policy preferences of the left wing of the Democratic party. Earlier in his article, Coates quotes with seeming disdain the radio host Rush Limbaugh's disparagement of the Affordable Care Act as a form of \"reparations.\" But aren't Limbaugh and Ogletree more or less in agreement here?\n\nCoates dismisses all these questions and so many others. He suggests the country first enact Rep. John Conyers' Reparations Bill and then open a discussion about how reparations would work. But committing yourself to a solution before you have any idea whether such a solution is workable-or, rather, in defiance of pretty strong reasons that your solution is utterly unworkable-is not a responsible reaction to America's racial dilemmas.\n\nInstead, we'll be all too likely to repeat once more the sad pattern of so many civil-rights initiatives: the bold announcement, the raised hopes, the unexpected difficulties, the suppression of open discussion of those difficulties, the ossifying of the project into bureaucracy, the realization of failure, the discovery of the political impossibility of reforming or repairing the failure.\n\n* * *\n\nIn his Lincoln Memorial address of 1963, Martin Luther King spoke of the words of the Declaration of Independence as \"promissory note\" on which the nation had defaulted. He meant this as a metaphor, not a financial analysis. Coates has taken him literally. King understood, however, that the wrongs of which he spoke could not be redressed with money (or money alone), and that is even more true today than in 1963.\n\nA real-world example :\n\nYoung black Americans spend on average 4.5 hours more per day with electronic media (notably television, video games, and other forms of online entertainment) than do their white counterparts, for a total in excess of 13 hours. While all young people spend a lot of time in front of screens, black youth watch far and away the most television: almost 3.5 hours per day, or an hour and a quarter more than young white people. Almost 80 percent of black youth say they \"usually\" eat meals in front of a TV.\n\nThe disparity is growing wider, not narrowing, as more forms of electronic media become available. The disparity shrinks, but does not disappear, with education and income. The best predictor of how much TV a child will watch is not whether he or she lives in a single or two-parent family. It is not family income or wealth. It is race: Even the most advantaged black youth spend 90 minutes more per day with electronic media than do their white contemporaries. It won't surprise you to hear that heavy use of electronic media correlates with all kinds of bad outcomes, from obesity to poor school performance . (Across all races, only about 16-20 minutes per day of screen time is connected to schoolwork.)\n\nIt's not difficult to draw a chain of causation from the exploitation so stirringly described by Coates to the TV-dependence of black youth in the 2010s. In this case, however, detailing the cause does not reveal the remedy. To realize their full potential, those kids must watch less TV. No plausible government program can shut down their devices for them. That decision-like almost every decision that leads to self- and collective improvement-must come from within families and within individuals.\n\nThe great white lie America tells itself is that the passage of civil-rights laws in the 1960s and '70s lifted the burden of the racial past. But racial subjugation imposed over 350 years could not and was not alleviated over a single generation. Today's white Americans inherit financial assets and human capital accumulated over a long span of time-and very possibly by robbing or cheating victims of color.\n\nIn refuting that lie, however, Coates advances an error that also does harm: that black Americans can build their future by debunking white Americans' illusions about their past. It does not work that way. Racism may have turned the TV set on. Anti-racism won't turn the TV set off.\n\nThe government of the United States could trace the genealogy of every white family and send a massive bill to the descendants of every slaveholder and every slumlord who did business from 1619 through 1968. It could redistribute that money in a princely lump sum. But that money won't change unhealthy dietary patterns, or enhance language skills, or teach the habits on which thriving communities are built.\n\nGermany and Israel may not be historically exact precedent for Coates's plan. The more exact precedent may be the sudden surge of oil wealth into the Middle East after 1973. Nations that had always felt themselves cheated of their due suddenly saw their incomes triple and quadruple. Yet the nations did not progress. The wealth of nations is built on their human capital-and the oil income not only failed to enrich them, but oftentimes incentivized behavior that left (or will leave) those nations in many ways worse off than before.\n\nThe human qualities that advance a community and a nation were defiantly acquired by black Americans themselves under conditions of horrifying adversity. Their development has accelerated as equality has come nearer to view.\n\nDisparities remain, of course. Coates challenges all Americans to remember where those disparities came from-and to think hard what is owed to those on the wrong end of them.\n\nWhat I'm talking about is more than recompense for past injustices-more than a handout, a payoff, hush money, or a reluctant bribe. What I'm talking about is a national reckoning that would lead to spiritual renewal. Reparations would mean the end of scarfing hot dogs on the Fourth of July while denying the facts of our heritage. Reparations would mean the end of yelling \"patriotism\" while waving a Confederate flag. Reparations would mean a revolution of the American consciousness, a reconciling of our self-image as the great democratizer with the facts of our history.\n\nIf reparations means remembrance and repentance for the wrongs of the past, then let's have reparations. Americans tell a too-flattering version of their national story. They treat slavery as ancillary rather than essential. They forget that the work of slaves paid this country's import bill from the 17th century until 1860. They do not acknowledge that the \"freedom\" championed by slaveholding Founding Fathers, including the author of the Declaration of Independence, included the freedom to own other human beings as property. They can no longer notice how slavery is stitched into every line of the Constitution and was supported by every single early national institution. The self-reckoning we see in Germany and other European countries does not come easily to Americans-and is still outright rejected by many.\n\nIf reparations means intensifying the nation's commitment to equal opportunity for all its people-and most especially for the descendants of those once enslaved-then (again) let's have reparations. Better schools, more jobs, some form of universal health coverage, an immigration policy that does not exert endless downward pressure on the wages of America's least skilled workers, improved nutrition especially in early childhood, higher taxes on alcohol, more effective and less punitive enforcement of drug laws-there's a program of group betterment awaiting the right advocates at the right time.\n\nBut if reparations means what most Americans reasonably interpret it to mean-cash flowing from some Americans to others in race-conscious ways meant to redress the racial wrongs of the past-then it's a disastrous idea for all groups in society.\n\nAnd if, when you advocate reparations, you aren't sure which of the above things it does mean, then your advocacy should be postponed until you are.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

      "text": "What Reparations Actually Bought\n\nThe U.S. government's redress program for Japanese Americans showed that the money matters. But it's not the only thing that matters.\n\nI n 1990, the U.S . government began mailing out envelopes, each containing a presidential letter of apology and a $20,000 check from the Treasury, to more than 82,000 Japanese Americans who, during World War II, were robbed of their homes, jobs, and rights, and incarcerated in camps. This effort, which took a decade to complete, remains a rare attempt to make reparations to a group of Americans harmed by force of law. We know how some recipients used their payment: The actor George Takei donated his redress check to the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. A former incarceree named Mae Kanazawa Hara told an interviewer in 2004 that she bought an organ for her church in Madison, Wisconsin. Nikki Nojima Louis, a playwright, told me earlier this year that she used the money to pay for living expenses while pursuing her doctorate in creative writing at Florida State University. She was 65 when she decided to go back to school, and the money enabled her to move across the country from her Seattle home.\n\nBut many stories could be lost to history. My family received reparations. My grandfather, Melvin, was 6 when he was imprisoned in Tule Lake, California. As long as I've known about the redress effort, I've wondered how he felt about getting a check in the mail decades after the war. No one in my family knows how he used the money. Because he died shortly after I was born, I never had a chance to ask.\n\nTo my knowledge, no one has rigorously studied how families spent individual payments, each worth $45,000 in current dollars. Densho, a nonprofit specializing in archival history of Japanese American incarceration, and the Japanese American National Museum confirmed my suspicions. When I first started researching what the redress effort did for former incarcerees, the question seemed almost impudent, because whose business was it but theirs what they did with the money?\n\nStill, I thought, following that money could help answer a basic question: What did reparations mean for the recipients? When I began my reporting, I expected former incarcerees and their descendants to speak positively about the redress movement. What surprised me was how intimate the experience turned out to be for so many. They didn't just get a check in the mail; they got some of their dignity and agency back. Also striking was how interviewee after interviewee portrayed the monetary payments as only one part-though an important one-of a broader effort at healing.\n\nFrom the June 2014 issue: The case for reparations\n\nThe significance of reparations becomes all the more important as cities, states, and some federal lawmakers grapple with whether and how to make amends to other victims of official discrimination-most notably Black Americans. Although discussions of compensation have existed since the end of the Civil War, they have only grown in intensity and urgency in recent years, especially after this magazine published Ta-Nehisi Coates's \" The Case for Reparations \" in 2014. In my home state, California, a task force has spent the past three years studying what restitution for Black residents would look like. The task force will deliver its final recommendations -which reportedly include direct monetary payments and a formal apology to descendants of enslaved people-to the state legislature by July 1.\n\nIn 1998, as redress for Japanese American incarcerees was winding to a close, the University of Hawaii law professor Eric Yamamoto wrote, \"In every African American reparations publication, in every legal argument, in almost every discussion, the topic of Japanese American redress surfaces. Sometimes as legal precedent. Sometimes as moral compass. Sometimes as political guide.\" Long after it ended, the Japanese American-redress program illustrates how honest attempts at atonement for unjust losses cascade across the decades.\n\nI n February 1942, following the attacks on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the incarceration of more than 125,000 Japanese Americans mostly on the West Coast. In the most famous challenge to the legality of Roosevelt's order, Fred Korematsu, an Oakland man who had refused to report for incarceration, appealed his conviction for defying military orders. The Supreme Court upheld Korematsu's conviction in its now notorious decision Korematsu v. United States. Families like mine were forced to abandon everything, taking only what they could carry.\n\nAfter the war, many former incarcerees, weighed down with guilt and shame, refused to speak about their experience. But as their children-many of them third-generation Japanese Americans-came of age during the civil-rights movement, calls for restitution and apology grew within the community. In 1980, Congress passed legislation establishing a commission to study the issue and recommend appropriate remedies. After hearing testimony from more than 500 Japanese Americans-many of whom were speaking of their incarceration for the first time-the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians concluded that \"race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership\" had been the primary motivators for the incarceration. The CWRIC also recommended that $20,000 be paid to each survivor of the camps.\n\nAt the same time, new evidence emerged showing that the government had suppressed information and lied about Japanese Americans being security threats. In the 1980s, lawyers reopened the Korematsu case and two similar challenges to E.O. 9066. All three convictions were vacated. By 1988, when reparations legislation was making its way through Congress, the legal proceedings and the CWRIC's findings provided the momentum and public evidence for Japanese Americans to make the case for reparations. The 1988 Civil Liberties Act authorized reparations checks to all Japanese American incarcerees who were alive the day the act was signed into law. (If a recipient was deceased at the time of payment, the money went to their immediate family). The Department of Justice established a special body, the Office of Redress Administration, to contact and verify eligible recipients. The CLA also provided for a formal government apology and a fund to educate the public about the incarceration: safeguards against such history repeating itself.\n\nRead: Two Boy Scouts met in an internment camp, and grew up to work in Congress\n\nEver since, reparations advocates have invoked Japanese American redress as a precedent that can be replicated for other groups. Dreisen Heath, a reparations advocate and former researcher at Human Rights Watch, told me Japanese American redress proves that \"it is possible for the U.S. government to not only acknowledge and formally apologize and state its culpability for a crime, but also provide some type of compensation.\" In 1989, then-Representative John Conyers introduced H.R. 40, a bill to establish a commission to study reparations for Black Americans. Proponents have reintroduced the bill again and again.\n\nIn 2021, as the House Judiciary Committee prepared to vote for the first time on H.R. 40, the Japanese American social-justice organization Tsuru for Solidarity submitted to the panel more than 300 letters written by former incarcerees and their descendants. The letters described how the reparations process helped Japanese Americans, psychologically and materially, in ways that stretched across generations. (In addition to drawing on that rich source of information for this story, I also interviewed family friends, members of the Japanese American church that I grew up in, and other former incarcerees and their children.)\n\nIn one of the letters, the daughter of an incarceree tells how the $20,000, invested in her family's home equity and compounded over time, ultimately enabled her to attend Yale. \"The redress money my family received has always been a tailwind at my back, making each step of the way a tiny bit easier,\" she wrote. Just as her family was able to build generational equity, she hoped that Black Americans, too, would have \"the choice to invest in education, homeownership, or whatever else they know will benefit their families, and, through the additional choices that wealth provides, to be a little more free.\"\n\nT he redress effort for World War II incarcerees has shaped California's task force in highly personal ways. Lisa Holder, an attorney who sits on the task force, first saw the idea of reparations become concrete through her best friend in high school, whose Japanese American father received a payment. The only non-Black member of the task force is the civil-rights lawyer Don Tamaki, whose parents were both incarcerated. Tamaki, like many other people I interviewed, acknowledges that incarcerees have different histories and experiences from the victims of slavery and Jim Crow-\"there's no equivalence between what Japanese Americans suffered and what Black people have gone through,\" he told me-but he also sees some parallels that might inform the reparations debate.\n\nTamaki's life, like that of many Japanese Americans, has been shaped by his family's incarceration. As a young lawyer, he worked on the legal team that reopened Korematsu . Tamaki is now 72. In January, he and I met at the Shops at Tanforan, a mall built atop the land where his parents, Minoru and Iyo, were incarcerated. Next to the mall, a newly opened memorial plaza honors the nearly 8,000 people of Japanese descent who lived there in 1942. Neither Don nor I had previously visited the memorial, which happens to be near my hometown. In middle school, I bought a dress for a dance party at the mall's JCPenney.\n\nIn 1942, Tanforan was an equestrian racetrack. After Roosevelt issued his internment order, horse stalls were hastily converted into living quarters. Minoru, who was in his last year of pharmacy school, couldn't attend his commencement ceremony, because he was incarcerated. The university instead rolled up the diploma in a tube addressed to Barrack 80, Apt. 5, Tanforan Assembly Centre, San Bruno, California. \"The diploma represents the promise of America,\" he told me. \"And the mailing tube which wraps around this promise-the diploma-constrains and restricts it.\" Don still has both.\n\nWhen the checks arrived in the mail in the '90s, the Tamakis gathered at Don's house. His parents spent one check on a brown Mazda MPV, which they would use while babysitting their grandkids. They put the other check into savings. \"They didn't do anything extravagant,\" Don told me.\n\nTo talk about reparations is to talk about loss: of property and of personhood. In 1983, the CWRIC estimated Japanese American incarcerees' economic losses at $6 billion, approximately $18 billion today. But those figures don't capture the dreams, opportunities, and dignity that were taken from people during the war. Surviving incarcerees still feel those losses deeply.\n\nRead: What my grandmother learned in her World War II internment camp\n\nMary Tamura, 99, was a resident of Terminal Island off the coast of Los Angeles. \"It was like living in Japan,\" she told me. Along with the island's 3,000 other Japanese American residents, she celebrated Japanese holidays; learned the art of flower arranging, ikebana; and wore kimonos. Then, on December 7, 1941, shortly after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the FBI rounded up men and community leaders, including Tamura's father. Two months later, Terminal Island residents were ordered to leave within 48 hours. Tamura, who once dreamed of teaching, instead joined the U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps. On Terminal Island, Japanese homes and businesses were razed.\n\nLily Shibuya was born in 1938 in San Juan Bautista, California. After the war, her family moved to Mountain View, where they grew carnations. Shibuya's older siblings couldn't afford to go to college and instead started working immediately after they were released from one of the camps. Her husband's family members, also flower growers, were able to preserve their farmland but lost the chrysanthemum varieties they had cultivated.\n\nShibuya told me that with her reparations check, she bought a funerary niche for herself, paid for her daughter's wedding, and covered travel expenses to attend her son's medical-school graduation. Tamura used part of her redress money for a vacation to Europe with her husband. The other funds went toward cosmetic eyelid surgery. \"It was just for beauty's sake-vanity,\" Tamura told me.\n\nMany recipients felt moved to use the $20,000 payments altruistically. In a 2004 interview with Densho, the then-91-year-old Mae Kanazawa Hara-who'd given an organ to her church-recalled her reaction to receiving reparations: \"I was kind of stunned. I said, 'By golly, I've never had a check that amount.' I thought, Oh, this money is very special .\" Some recipients gave their check to their children or grandchildren, feeling that it should go toward future generations.\n\nThe notion that recipients should use their money for noble purposes runs deep in the discussion about reparations. It helps explain why some reparations proposals end up looking more like public-policy initiatives than the unrestricted monetary payments that Japanese Americans received. For example, a 2021 initiative in Evanston, Illinois, began providing $25,000 in home repairs or down-payment assistance to Black residents and their descendants who experienced housing discrimination in the city from 1919 to 1969. Florida provides free tuition to state universities for the descendants of Black families in the town of Rosewood who were victimized during a 1923 massacre. But if the goal of reparations is to help restore dignity and opportunity, then the recipients need autonomy. Only they can decide how best to spend those funds. (Perhaps recognizing this, Evanston's city council voted earlier this year to provide direct cash payments of $25,000.)\n\nIbram X. Kendi: There is no middle ground on reparations\n\nNot every Japanese American whom I interviewed deemed the reparations effort helpful or sincere. When I arrived at Mary Murakami's home in Bethesda, Maryland, the 96-year-old invited me to sit at her dining-room table, where she had laid out several documents in preparation for my visit: her yearbook from the high school she graduated from while incarcerated; a map of the barracks where she lived in Topaz, Utah; a movie poster-size copy of Executive Order 9066, found by her son-in-law at an antique shop.\n\nShe first saw the order nailed to a telephone pole in San Francisco's Japantown as a high schooler, more than 80 years ago. A rumor had been circulating in Japantown that children might be separated from their parents. Her mother and father gave each child a photo of themselves, so the children would remember who their parents were. They also revealed a family secret: Atop the highest shelf in one of their closets sat an iron box. The children had never asked about it, and it was too heavy for any of them to remove, Murakami recalled. Inside the box was an urn containing the ashes of her father's first wife, the mother of Murakami's oldest sister, Lily.\n\nThe government had told them to take only what they could carry. The ashes of a dead woman would have to be left behind. Murakami and her father buried the box in a cemetery outside the city. With no time or money to prepare a proper tombstone, they stuck a homemade wooden marker in the ground. Then they returned home to resume packing. They sold all their furniture-enough to fill seven rooms-for $50.\n\nMurakami's family, like the Tamakis, went to Tanforan, and then to Topaz. \"The most upsetting thing about camp was the family unity breaking down,\" Murakami told me. \"As camp life went on, we didn't eat with our parents most of the time.\" Not that she did much eating-she recalls the food as inedible, save for the plain peanut-and-apple-butter sandwiches. Today, Murakami will not eat apple butter or allow it in her house.\n\nAfter the war, she did her best to move forward. She graduated from UC Berkeley, where she met her husband, Raymond. They moved to Washington, D.C., so that he could attend dental school at Howard University-a historically Black school that she and her husband knew would admit Japanese Americans.\n\nAbsent from the documents that Murakami saved is the presidential letter of apology. \"Both Ray and I threw it away,\" she told me. \"We thought it came too late.\" After the war ended, each incarceree was given $25 and a one-way ticket to leave the camps. For Murakami, money and an apology would have meant something when her family was struggling to resume the life that they had been forced to abruptly put on pause-not more than 40 years later. She and her husband gave some of their reparations to their children. Raymond donated his remaining funds to building the Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism in Washington, D.C., and Mary deposited hers in a retirement fund .\n\nA $20,000 check could not reestablish lost flower fields, nor could it resurrect a formerly proud and vibrant community. Still, the money, coupled with an official apology, helped alleviate the psychological anguish that many incarcerees endured. Lorraine Bannai, who worked on Fred Korematsu's legal team alongside Don Tamaki, almost never talked with her parents about the incarceration. Yet, after receiving reparations, her mother confided that she had lived under a cloud of guilt for decades, and it had finally been lifted. \"My reaction was: 'You weren't guilty of anything. How could you think that?'\" Bannai told me. \"But on reflection, of course she would think that. She was put behind barbed wire and imprisoned.\"\n\nYamamoto, the law professor in Hawaii, stresses that the aims of reparations are not simply to compensate victims but to repair and heal their relationship with society at large. Kenniss Henry, a national co-chair of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, told me that her own view of reparations has evolved over time. She sees value in processes such as community hearings and reports documenting a state's history of harm. \"It is necessary to have some form of direct payment, but reparations represent more than just a check,\" she said.\n\nThe Los Angeles community organizer Miya Iwataki, who worked toward Japanese American redress as a congressional staffer in the 1980s and now advocates for reparations for Black Californians, sees the checks and apology to World War II incarcerees as essential parts of a larger reconciliation. In 2011, Iwataki accompanied her father, Kuwashi, to Washington, D.C., to receive a Congressional Gold Medal for his World War II military service. Throughout their trip, he was greeted by strangers who knew of Kuwashi's unit: the all-Japanese 100th Battalion of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, known for being the most decorated unit of its size and length of service. As the Iwatakis settled into their seats on the return flight, Kuwashi told Miya, \"This is the first time I really felt like an American.\"\n\nF or decades, former incarcerees have kept memories alive, and now that task falls to their descendants. Pilgrimages to former incarceration sites have resumed since the height of the pandemic, and new memorials, like the one at the Tanforan mall, continue to crop up. \"The legacy of Japanese American incarceration and redress has yet to be written,\" Yamamoto told me.\n\nIn January, my mom and I drove to Los Angeles for an appointment at the Japanese American National Museum. We were there to see the Ireichō, or the sacred book of names. The memorial arose out of another previously unanswered question: How many Japanese Americans in total were incarcerated during the war? For three years, the Ireichō 's creator, Duncan Ryūken Williams, worked with volunteers and researchers to compile the first comprehensive list, with 125,284 names printed on 1,000 pages.\n\nI was stunned at the book's size, and even more moved by the memorial's design. On the walls hung wood panels with the names of each incarceration camp written in Japanese and English, along with a glass vial of soil from each site. My mom and I were invited to stamp a blue dot next to the names of our family members, as a physical marker of remembrance. When the museum docent flipped to my grandfather, Melvin, I was reminded that I'll never be able to ask him what he experienced as a child. I'll never learn what he thought when, in his 50s, he opened his apology letter. The only additional detail that I learned about him while reporting this article was that, according to my grandmother, he mistakenly listed the $20,000 as income on his tax return.\n\nBut through my conversations with surviving incarcerees, many of whose names also appear in the Ireichō , I could see how a combination of symbolic and material reparations-money, an apology, and public-education efforts-was essential to a multigenerational healing process. For Melvin, a third-generation Japanese American, this might have looked like receiving the check. For me, in the fifth generation, placing a stamp next to his name helped me honor him and see his life as part of a much larger story. The project of making amends for Japanese American incarceration didn't end with the distribution of redress checks and an apology. It might not even finish within one lifetime, but each generation still strives to move closer.\n\nPhoto-illustration sources: Buyenlarge / Getty; Corbis / Getty; Dorothea Lange / U.S. War Relocation Authority / Getty; History / Universal Images Group / Getty; Library of Congress; Stephen Osman / Getty; Bancroft Library / UC Berkeley"

      "text": "What Do 2020 Candidates Mean When They Say 'Reparations'?\n\nEven highly informed commentators lack a shared understanding of what the word means.\n\nEarlier this year, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, and other Democratic presidential aspirants began speaking positively about reparations, in contrast to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, who opposed the policy.\n\nJust 26 percent of voters favor reparations in polls .\n\nIn the telling of The New York Times , this shift is due to the fact that \"grass-roots organizers and many liberal voters of all races are now pushing elected officials to go further on policies of racial equality, regardless of any political calculations.\" While that is likely a factor, I suspect something else is going on too: When average Americans hear reparations , they still think of \"the idea that some form of compensatory payment needs to be made to the American descendants of slaves,\" to quote from the definition of the term on Wikipedia.\n\nBut among some influential Democratic constituencies-educated, left-of-center Brooklyn, for example- reparations is understood differently, as illustrated by a roundtable on the subject broadcast last month by a Brooklyn TV station. It's worth watching, regardless of whether you love or hate the idea of reparations, because it clarifies the degree to which Americans discussing the subject can talk past one another or mistake how much disagreement actually exists, fueling everything from mild confusion to needless polarization.\n\n\"Give me your working definition of reparations ,\" the moderator, Brian Vines, began.\n\nChief Dwaine Perry of the Ramapough-Lunaape Nation kicked things off.\n\n\"Perhaps the most important thing that reparations can do is present history and knowledge as it really occurred, not as a paradigm to abuse and manipulate,\" he said. \"Reparation, I think, has to start with the integrity of true history.\"\n\nThe columnist Noah Millman spoke next.\n\nFor him, reparations means \"an attempt to reconcile with the past between communities where one has suffered at the hands of the other,\" he said. \"Whether that is in the form of monetary or whatever, it is an intra-communal agreement, effectively, that what we are doing now is settling a long-standing grievance.\"\n\nL. Joy Williams, the president of the NAACP's Brooklyn chapter, began by affirming that reparations should begin with truth-telling about American history. \"We're still uncovering stories and places of what harm was done, and that is part of reparations,\" she said. \"Following that is how do we repair ... How do we repay?\" That need not always take the form of a check, she emphasized. And lastly, there's a \"commitment\" to never repeat the injustice again.\n\nLater, she clarified that the state needn't be the primary actor. \"If you're relying on American government to come and chart out a process for reparations, we'll be waiting for 400 more damn years for that to happen,\" she said. \"The overall process we're talking about starts with telling the truth ... That can come from professors researching. That can come from elected officials uncovering documents. That can come from a Ta-Nehisi Coates writing ... That doesn't have to happen from the government, and I don't think it should.\"\n\nThe Reverend Mark Thompson, a member of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, rooted his definition in repair and government assistance:\n\nFor many of us, reparations means spiritual repair, cultural repair, repair through the means of education, health, economics, society, all of those things together. So it's obviously more than individual checks, but helping to build institutions so that at least African Americans can catch up with white Americans.\n\nWhite Americans had help through the Homestead Act-which didn't include us-housing loans, FHA, that helped build the suburbs. Social Security did not include us ... So there were all these helping hands. And we, as African Americans, not to exclude the indigenous people, none of us can catch up because some others got a head start ... We have to talk about slavery's vestiges because as soon as slavery was over, we had the Jim Crow era ... And now we live in an era where we have modern-day lynchings by law enforcement, a racist criminal-justice system ... the toll grows higher and higher.\n\nColeman Hughes, the freelance opinion journalist and Columbia University undergraduate, asserted that reparations is \"something of a misnomer because the wrongs of history are generally too deep to actually be completely compensated.\" What reparations should mean, he said, is \"a full-hearted recognition that a wrong was committed, that something happened that should not have happened--and more than that, it's an apology that feels more sincere because you're attaching something tangible to it, because words are very cheap.\"\n\nAnd the Columbia University professor Katherine Franke, the author of a book on reparations, called them \"a tool and an opportunity for us to recover a kind of history ... but to not relegate it only to history, but make it part of our national memory.\" After the Civil War, America should have given recently enslaved people \"the material resources to be free and full citizens,\" she argued. \"We also needed to use those resources to recognize the terror, the rape, the family separation, the humiliation of being enslaved. So reparations are backward-looking in terms of recognizing the fundamental soul-killing nature of slavery, but forward-looking in terms of creating the very possibility for people to be free.\"\n\nAmong these six, \"reparations\" always involves a truthful reckoning with history. Beyond that, it might refer to a government-run program to repair historic injustice or to specifically nongovernmental probes into historic injustices, to a onetime attempt to settle a communal grievance or an open-ended process of discovery, repair, and compensation with no foreseeable conclusion. And it might or might not involve direct payment to descendants of slaves.\n\nWhen it comes to reparations as most Americans understand the term, I'm a skeptic for reasons I explain in \" The Benefits of Redressing Racism With Race Neutral Remedies \" and \" Why Bernie Sanders Is Right to Oppose Reparations .\" But if asked in that Brooklyn auditorium whether I favored reparations, I'd have required a three-minute sidebar defining terms before I felt able to answer.\n\nUnder some definitions, I'd have said yes; under others, no.\n\nFor growing parts of the left, \"Do you support reparations?\" is not necessarily a question about the wisdom, justice, or feasibility of compensation given to descendants of slaves. A person might reject cutting checks on any one of those grounds and nevertheless affirm that, yes, she does support reparations, understanding herself to be saying, \"I recognize the historic injustices done to blacks in the American slave trade and Jim Crow, and favor affirmative steps to repair them.\"\n\nI certainly favor historical scholarship and an unsparingly accurate account of the injustices done to indigenous people and African Americans. I favor attempts \"to reconcile with the past between communities where one has suffered at the hands of the other.\" I favor \"a full-hearted recognition that a wrong was committed, that something happened that should not have happened,\" as well as a commitment to never repeat the injustice. I certainly agree that our historical reckoning must encompass Jim Crow, not just slavery. I want every American to enjoy the opportunity to be a free and full citizen. And I favor settling long-standing grievances between groups where that is possible.\n\nSo do I support reparations-even though I also believe that redressing recent ills, like redlining, should compensate anyone directly victimized, not just African Americans, and that the neediest among us, regardless of race, have a greater claim to common resources than a wealthy descendant of enslaved people?\n\nDefinitional murkiness doesn't matter much in a Brooklyn auditorium, a small community where participants can explore nuances in conversation.\n\nBut it does matter in the context of a presidential campaign in which candidates must convey their beliefs and intentions to hundreds of millions of Americans. And the complications go beyond simply defining reparations in different ways, to the way candidates will choose to express themselves. Take two possible formulations:\n\nThose formulations are substantively identical. They could manifest as identical policies. But they are arguably symbolically different. For some on the left, a primary candidate who uses formulation A is superior to one who uses B, even though that candidate will likely face a tougher time with voters in a general election while delivering exactly the same policy measures if ultimately elected.\n\nThe roundtable discussion touched on the issue of rhetorical framing. Millman, the columnist, told Williams, the NAACP chapter president:\n\nIt sounds to me--and forgive me if I'm wrong--that we have a little bit of disagreement about what the word should mean. You have a very expansive conception of what reparations is, particularly that it is an open-ended process, because there's always going to be more to learn ... that reparations is a way of thinking about social justice generally that focuses on the sources within society that caused the situation that we see today ... the harms that have continued down into the present either in terms of continuing to happen or continuing to have ripple effects from things that were done in the past. I'm curious, if that's what you're saying, why you think from a political perspective that's the right way to frame things, in terms of getting what you want accomplished?\n\nIn reply, Williams made a strong case against reparations as a onetime event. Cutting a check \"doesn't address a criminal-justice system ... doesn't address housing policy that's still on the books to this day ... doesn't address all of those connections.\"\n\nIf criminal-justice reform, housing reform, and many other policies poll much better than 26 percent, why bundle them together under the umbrella of reparations?\n\nHughes, the Columbia student, raised the question a different way:\n\nI fear that we're talking around the main issue ... When people hear reparations , which is this very controversial topic, I don't think they're thinking, Oh, they mean criminal-justice reform . Oh, they mean repairing society. What they're thinking, and what the public meaning right now in America is, is programs or benefits or a check or a deeper program that is allocated to descendants of slaves and not to other people. And I think that's the crucial variable that makes it, for most people who hear that term, controversial.\n\nHe added that he doesn't think Americans who say they're against reparations think of themselves as opposing criminal-justice reform or against ending structural racism. \"I fear,\" he said, \"that we're talking around the most controversial part.\"\n\nThompson disagreed, retorting, \"I think what happens is, a lot of these talking heads, people on television, don't know anything about reparations.\" While that may be true, it doesn't change the fact that six highly informed commentators at a reparations event in Brooklyn had different understandings of the word-different not only from the general public, but also from one another.\n\nWilliams responded to the challenge by arguing that it is not marginalized people's job to convince society of their rights and humanity:\n\nWhether it's reparations or any kind of work on behalf of marginalized people, there has to be some kind of PR thing that has to happen to make people be more accepting of your humanity and your dignity and the rights you deserve being in this country. I always call BS on that. I don't need to make you feel better about what I'm rightfully entitled to. So there's a different kind of organizing model, negotiating from a position of power. I'm not going to ask for anything that you're giving me out of charity. I'm fighting for something that I deserve and that I am owed ... I'm asking for the money and land and support and resources that marginalized people--I'm not interested, even as a strategist, in trying to massage people's ego or package it differently in order to get what a human deserves in terms of rights and responsibilities.\n\nBut I don't think eschewing the term reparations is mere PR. As Perry put it at one point in the roundtable:\n\nI think a missing element in all of this is that we need to have or somehow come to a decisive understanding and focus of where we're going. Otherwise it's going to become an intellectual exercise ... It's going to ebb and flow, and before long, no one's even going to know what you're talking about. So I think, maybe, perhaps not this forum at this moment, but we do need to convene, sit down, and say what are we talking about.\n\nCount me as a proponent of rhetorical clarity, too, and a skeptic of those who employ the term in ways that the vast majority of listeners are unlikely to understand.\n\nThat clarity is lacking right now. So if you hear the word, take caution before reacting. Even if you've always opposed reparations, understand that you may well support many of the things that some of your fellow Americans actually propose. And if you favor reparations, understand that some of what you deem imperative may be perfectly fine with some of the people who insist they disagree with you.\n\nImprecision is getting in the way of a healthy debate."

      "text": "Would MLK Support Reparations Today?\n\nThat's a tricky question, and it was prompted by this reader:\n\nI wanted to chime in on the spat between Bernie Sanders and Ta-Nehisi Coates regarding Bernie's rejection of reparations . TNC deeply feels that the economic system America has today was deliberately built not just on the backs of slaves, but also on the backs of African-Americans who lived in the days of Jim Crow laws and even since the major civil rights victories of the '60s. I find it hard to disagree with this thesis based on the comprehensive evidence he marshaled in his landmark article making the case for reparations .\n\nWho else agreed with TNC that the U.S. economy was engineered for the benefit of rich white people at the expense of African-Americans? A couple of years ago, TNC shared a video [embedded above] where Martin Luther King, Jr. fiercely critiqued the government for rejecting grants of land to African-Americans while officially opening up land in the Midwest to white farmers, funding land grant colleges for their education, and providing subsidies and other funding to prop up their farms. It's difficult to argue that MLK didn't believe African-Americans deserved reparations regardless of whether they were the descendants of slaves.\n\nBut MLK wasn't necessarily just in favor of race-based reparations . In his 1967 book Where We Go From Here , MLK focused on poverty and explicitly argued against focusing on the plight of African-Americans to the expense of others in poverty:\n\nIn the treatment of poverty nationally, one fact stands out: There are twice as many white poor as Negro poor in the United States. Therefore I will not dwell on the experiences of poverty that derive from racial discrimination, but will discuss the poverty that affects white and Negro alike.\n\nHe goes on to unequivocally state his support for a different kind of policy, an ongoing form of reparations to the poor regardless of their race:\n\nI am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective -- the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.\n\nOur nation's adjustment to a new mode of thinking will be facilitated if we realize that for nearly forty years two groups in our society have already been enjoying a guaranteed income. Indeed, it is a symptom of our confused social values that these two groups turn out to be the richest and the poorest. The wealthy who own securities have always had an assured income; and their polar opposite, the relief client, has been guaranteed an income, however miniscule, through welfare benefits.\n\nThe contemporary tendency in our society is to base our distribution on scarcity, which has vanished, and to compress our abundance into the overfed mouths of the middle and upper classes until they gag with superfluity. If democracy is to have breadth of meaning, it is necessary to adjust this inequity. It is not only moral, but it is also intelligent. We are wasting and degrading human life by clinging to archaic thinking.\n\nThe curse of poverty has no justification in our age. It is socially as cruel and blind as the practice of cannibalism at the dawn of civilization, when men ate each other because they had not yet learned to take food from the soil or to consume the abundant animal life around them. The time has come for us to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty.\n\nIt's difficult to argue that Sanders is in disagreement with MLK that we need to abolish poverty. The Vermont senator even said as much in response to a question on a Reddit AMA a couple of years ago:\n\nThere is no question that when we have today more people living in poverty than at any time in American history and when millions of families are struggling day by day just to keep their heads above water, we need to move aggressively to protect the dignity and well being of the least among us. Tragically, with cuts in food stamps, unemployment compensation and other important benefits, we are moving in exactly the wrong direction. There are a number of ways by which we can make sure that every man, woman and child in our country has at least a minimum standard of living and [unconditional basic income] is certainly something that must be explored.\n\nWords are cheap. Action matters.\n\nIn that Ta-Nehisi post the reader referred to, he linked to a New York Times essay written by Michael Eric Dyson in 2000. The most relevant passage to this discussion:\n\nIf conservatives were to read and listen to King carefully, they would not only find little basis in King's writings to justify their assaults in his name, but they would be brought up short by his vision of racial compensation and racial reparation, a vision far more radical than most current views of affirmative action. King wrote in Why We Can't Wait that few \"people consider the fact that, in addition to being enslaved for two centuries,\" that black folk were also robbed of wages for toil. It is worth quoting King at length:\n\nNo amount of gold could provide an adequate compensation for the exploitation and humiliation of the Negro in America down through the centuries. Not all the wealth of this affluent society could meet the bill. Yet a price can be placed on unpaid wages. The ancient common law has always provided a remedy for the appropriation of the labor of one human being by another. This law should be made to apply for American Negroes. The payment should be in the form of a massive program by the government of special, compensatory measures which could be regarded as a settlement in accordance with the accepted practice of common law. Such measures would certainly be less expensive than any computation based on two centuries of unpaid wages and accumulated interest. I am proposing, therefore, that, just as we granted a GI Bill of Rights to war veterans, America launch a broad-based and gigantic Bill of Rights for the Disadvantaged, our veterans of the long siege of denial.\n\nKing ingeniously anticipated objections to programs of racial compensation on the grounds they discriminated against poor whites who were equally disadvantaged. He knew that conservatives would manipulate racial solidarity through an insincere display of new-found concern for poor whites that pitted their interests against those of blacks. King claimed that \"millions of [the] white poor\" would benefit from the bill. Although he believed that the \"moral justification for special measures for Negroes is rooted in the robberies inherent in the institution of slavery,\" many poor whites, he argued, were \"the derivative victims\" of slavery. He conceded that poor whites are \"chained by the weight of discrimination\" even if its \"badge of degradation does not mark them.\"\n\nKing understood how many poor whites failed to understand the class dimensions of their exploitation by elite whites who appealed to vicious identity politics to obscure their actions. King held that discrimination was in ways \"more evil for [poor whites], because it has confused so many by prejudice that they have supported their own oppressors.\" Hence, it was only just that a Bill of Rights for the Disadvantaged, intent on \"raising the Negro from backwardness,\" would also rescue \"a large stratum of the forgotten white poor.\" For King, compensatory measures that were truly just - that is, took race into account while also considering class - had the best chance of bringing healing to our nation's minorities and to the white poor. It was never one or the other; both were a moral priority for King.\n\nAny history scholars out there want to chime in? Drop us an email. On a related note, a reader points to one of Dr. King's most famous associates:\n\nI was looking into the role that Bernie Sanders played in Jesse Jackson's win in the 1988 Vermont primary, and it turns out Jackson's platform that year included reparations to descendants of black slaves. I wasn't able to find any of Sanders' statements from that time on reparations , but it would at least seem that he is not so hostile to the idea as Mr. Coates (whose work I greatly respect and enjoy) would seem to suggest."

      "text": "Jesse Jackson on Reparations: 'We Are Due a Different Kind of Recognition'\n\nThirty years ago, the reverend made reparations for slavery core to his presidential campaigns. Now he's watching as the House grapples with a proposal to study their feasibility.\n\nJesse Jackson ran for president in 1984 with a lot of ideas and a little support, the second black candidate, after Shirley Chisholm in the 1970s, to organize a national campaign for the presidency. His presence in the race was a nuisance to Democrats at the time who worried that his policy proposals were too left-leaning. But the \"Rainbow Coalition\" he cobbled together-an assortment of minority groups, black and brown people, farmers and poor factory workers, the LGBTQ community and white progressives-compelled them to deal with his ideas.\n\n\"Merely by being black and forcing other candidates to consider his very real potential to garner black votes, which they need, Jackson has had an impact,\" the journalist Ronald Smothers wrote in a New York Times profile at the time . An aide for Walter Mondale, the eventual Democratic nominee, went a step further, telling Smothers, \"Jackson's being in the race gets more information on things such as South Africa, affirmative action and black colleges into Mondale's briefing books.\"\n\nBut in both his 1984 and his 1988 campaigns, Jackson was also pushing for something more tangible, and sweeping, than affirmative action: He was calling for reparations. Advocates had tried, with varied success, to attract broad political support for the idea since slavery was abolished more than a century before, and Jackson wanted to return it to the fore of American politics by placing it front and center in a presidential race.\n\nRead: The case for reparations\n\nThirty-five years after his 1984 race, reparations is now top of mind on the campaign trail, and under discussion in the halls of Congress. Today, on Capitol Hill, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties will hold a hearing on H.R. 40, a bill-reintroduced in congressional session after congressional session for the past three decades-that aims to create a committee to study and develop proposals for reparations. The panel will feature Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, a candidate for the 2020 presidential nomination; the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose 2014 work \"The Case for Reparations\" in The Atlantic reignited the national conversation on the issue; the actor Danny Glover; the economist Julianne Malveaux; and others. The bill has been supported by several Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Booker, who feel newly comfortable talking about reparations as an issue worthy of serious examination.\n\nOn the eve of the hearing, I spoke with Jackson about why he made reparations a plank in his presidential campaigns, the significance of the attention the issue is receiving now, and whether he has hope that reparations will ever be paid for slavery.\n\nOur conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAdam Harris: Take me back to 1984. It's six years after Justice Lewis Powell and the Supreme Court uphold a limited form of affirmative action, and your campaign makes addressing historical inequities a central plank. How did reparations become an issue in your campaign?\n\nJesse Jackson: Well, first of all, we had been freed without being made equal. There's historical continuity between blacks being amassed in prison after 246 years of legal slavery. When there was a contest about it [in Dred Scott v. Sandford ], the Supreme Court ruled that blacks had no rights. [After emancipation and the Civil War] those who had been slave masters became segregation masters. They took our freedom away from us; they began to lock up blacks by the thousands to do prison labor, farm labor-the whole range. They just put us back in slavery.\n\nWe finally, in 1954, broke the backbone-legally-of that system [with the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision], but we were never-there was never repair for damage done. Two hundred and forty-six years of slavery, then legal Jim Crow and [nearly] 5,000 lynchings without a conviction. And even today, discrimination by extension of that system has not completely ended.\n\nSo we had been fighting for repair. We fought against the barbarism for our freedom; now we're fighting for our equality. We are the foundation of American society-not the bottom, the foundation. When the Declaration of Independence came, we had been enslaved for 157 years. We made cotton king. We are due a different kind of recognition.\n\nHarris: And so the campaign idea just grew out of that history?\n\nJackson: The history of it, and its consistency. If you don't deal with the damage, you can't provide repair for damage. Slavery was damage. You couldn't go to school; you couldn't marry; you couldn't own property. We were not mobile. We were enslaved while building the strongest economy in the world. The reason why the South wanted to break away in 1861 is because Southerners had become addicted to slavery. They were willing to create a whole new country, selling cotton and tobacco and rice to Britain and France. Lincoln knew if that happened, the nation would dissolve. To save the Union, he had to end slavery. When we were freed, we joined the Union army-Lincoln saved us, we saved Lincoln.\n\nThat's the big turning point in American history, period.\n\nHarris: And so, fast-forwarding to now: As a House subcommittee has its hearing on reparations, how might that history affect it?\n\nJackson: I talked to [the Texas representative and H.R. 40 sponsor] Sheila Jackson Lee today, and I wish I had been a part of the testimony. Because what frightens me is that when people say \"reparations\" without [referencing] the [historical] predicate, it's often confused as us wanting something for nothing. Whereas precedes therefore . Slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation is the whereas . If the whereas is there, the therefore is logical.\n\nThe sugar industry, the cotton industry was built on importing Africans. That's a lot of wealth created there. We have to make the case for the whereas -and the therefore becomes much easier, you know? Whereas I am sick; therefore, I need more medicine.\n\nHarris: In terms of the traction reparations has gotten over time, there have been peaks and valleys. With some of the 2020 candidates now supporting reparations, does anything feel different about the conversation?\n\nJackson: As you become more assertive at the polls, and [assume] more power, everything you recommend must be taken more seriously. People who have power are heard more clearly. We made a senator, against odds, in the red state of Alabama. We returned the Congress to Democrats. Our vote, or non-vote, will determine the next president.\n\nThere is now a different level of hearing about the same proposition. What [Jackson Lee's] bill calls for is the study of the cost. We don't know what the conclusion is yet-how much or what form it will take-but I know it's substantial.\n\nHarris: Do you personally have hope that there will be payment for that legacy of slavery?\n\nJackson: The truth of slavery-that Africans subsidized America's wealth-that truth will not go away. It's buried right now, but as each generation becomes much more serious, it will be grappled with."

      "text": "The Struggle Against Poverty Needs to Be a Collective Fight\n\nThe focus should be on transforming the oligarchy, not on lifting up any one segment of society.\n\nJuneteenth-the annual celebration of when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom-brought two hearings this year on Capitol Hill. The first was widely covered. The House Judiciary Committee looked at H.R. 40 , a proposal to create a commission to study reparations for slavery and subsequent discrimination. Witnesses debated the utility and justice of pursuing financial reparations to right some of the wrongs that, past and present, have kept black people economically disadvantaged in the United States.\n\nAt the same time, the House Budget Committee held a hearing on poverty in America, which drew a fraction of the media coverage. In that hearing, the economic disadvantages facing African Americans were only part of the story-because less than one-quarter of Americans living in poverty are black.\n\nSlavery, and the systemic racism that has disadvantaged blacks in its aftermath, cannot be forgiven or forgotten. But reparations are not the answer. We cannot fix these injustices by emulating the my-race-first policies that birthed it. While the suffering of blacks hits close to home for me, it also pains me to see someone of another race or ethnicity degraded by the way our country forces poor people to live.\n\nWhen blacks demand that our poverty be alleviated, it's simply a matter of one race prioritizing its path to living well, when we should be fighting for everyone to live well. Prioritizing the economic needs of those who share my ethnicity, while so many others are suffering along with us, is morally wrong. The struggle against poverty needs to be a collective fight.\n\n\"We are tired of the racialization of poverty, the partisanism of poverty,\" William Barber II, a Protestant minister who is a co-leader of the Poor People's Campaign , told the members of the Budget Committee. More whites live in poverty than people of any other ethnic or racial group; a higher percentage of Native Americans live in poverty than members of any other ethnicity. Poverty isn't a black problem, but an American problem, Barber told the committee, just as he had told the nine Democratic presidential candidates who spoke to the Moral Action Congress convened by the Poor People's Campaign in Washington, D.C., earlier that week.\n\nThe Poor People's Campaign holds that it is a moral failure in a nation this rich, one that can afford to offer everyone a decent standard of living, that poor people cannot access adequate health care, food, water, or homes.\n\nIf I agreed with some scholars and pundits that this nation's prevailing system is white supremacy, I'd say that African Americans have learned its lessons well enough to mimic its logic. But the prevailing system in the United States isn't white supremacy, but rather, economic oligarchy. And too much of the discussion of racism adopts the language of oligarchy, offering economic ascension as an antidote.\n\nWhile racial inequality is sometimes quantified in other ways-by the composition of the prison population, levels of education, or health-it is most often quantified by dollars, and how many one has. In 2018, the Equality of Opportunity Project released the results of a multiyear study of economic mobility. Most of its findings were about economic opportunity. People homed in on its statistics about black boys , who had much less of a chance of rising to a different economic tier than the one into which they were born, or of staying rich, than white boys. Less was said about Native Americans, who, the study's statistics showed, were about as poor as blacks, or about Asian Americans, who had a better chance to rise economically than whites.\n\nReparations are often presented in terms that are meaningful within an oligarchic system: A long history of racist practices has created economic inequality between blacks and whites. Of this, there is no doubt. But this is not the racial wealth gap; it is merely a racial wealth gap. One goal of reparations is to close this gap. But that adopts the logic of oligarchy, instead of challenging it. More black people reaching higher wealth tiers, and then living in the cocoon those tiers provide? That's not something I am willing to fight for.\n\nDuring the hearing on poverty, numerous committee members recounted their humble origins. Representative Bill Johnson of Ohio told of going to 13 different schools in 12 years while his mother worked three jobs-picking cotton and tobacco, and doing anything she could. Jason Smith of Missouri talked about his grandparents' home, a farm on which he worked that never acquired indoor plumbing. It was hard not to hear in these rags-to-Congress narratives an implicit critique-that, with hard work, any poor person could rise as they had done. But if escaping poverty's degradations is linked to desire and ability, what does it mean for those who don't possess the capacity to acquire the skills to obtain well-paid work? How should they have to live?\n\nBarber and Liz Theoharis, the other co-leader of the Poor People's Campaign, presented a \" moral budget \" to the committee. It aimed to show that the alleviation of poverty and its degradations is not only a moral demand, but that these goals make good economic sense.\n\nTheoharis and Barber resurrected Martin Luther King Jr.'s Poor People's Campaign in 2018, on the 50th anniversary of the march of the multiracial movement that King was gathering to lead to Washington. He was assassinated first, and Ralph Abernathy stepped in to take his place. Without King, the Poor People's Campaign never really took off, and eventually faded away.\n\nBarber and Theoharis relaunched it because the situation King sought to address persists : Poor people are still systematically degraded. With the Poor People's Campaign, King aimed less at white supremacy than at the oligarchy. The principle behind the movement remains the same as it was in 1968. People of all races who oppose this system of inequality and suffering, and the demonization of the poor, must act as a single force.\n\nTheoharis and Barber often remind their listeners that King was moving toward a more expansive multiracial movement when he died. King was focused on the oligarchic class-or \"Bourbon class,\" as he called it-and its promotion of a strategic form of divide and conquer, pitting poor blacks against poor whites. Howard University's E. Franklin Frazier had written about this strategy in his popular book, Black Bourgeoisie , a decade earlier, in 1957. Other scholars before and since have pointed to the post-slavery origins of voter suppression in service of what the wealthy, white, land-owning class publicly called white supremacy. But they had a dual aim, ensuring that poor whites were not part of the supreme.\n\nThis is not to argue for an equivalence of historical suffering between whites and blacks, but to emphasize that white supremacy in the U.S. is a strategy, not a system. The system is an economic oligarchy, and racism is an extremely effective tactic for perpetuating it. And the debate over reparations confuses the system with just one of the tactics that sustains it.\n\nWould we be speaking of reparations if people of all incomes could live decent, healthy lives, and if we moved away from quantifying success primarily by income? Reparations would address the financial ramifications of the racism that stymies blacks from \"winning,\" and knocks those blacks who have won back down. But they would not right the wrong of a supremacist society that is designed to create a class of winners and a mass of losers, and to do so, in part, by isolating aspirants from those they leave behind.\n\nI switched away from the H.R. 40 hearings to focus on the debate over the more encompassing wrong. The focus should be on transforming the oligarchy, not on lifting up any one segment of society.\n\nReparations are a sideshow. We are living in the now, in which millions of people of all races and ethnicities are forced into degradation, ill health, and despair in this rich nation. Overturning that system is a goal that is not out of reach for a people who had the intellectual, political, and social will to survive slavery and beat back Jim Crow."

      "text": "Everyone Wants to Talk About Reparations. But for How Long?\n\nThe issue makes the occasional blip in the national conversation. Yet in communities that have been fighting inequality for generations, it is more like the steady thumping of a drum.\n\nC allie House was born into slavery in Tennessee in 1861, the year Confederate soldiers attacked Union soldiers at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, and launched a war that vibrates through American history. Her exact birth date, as was the case with many people who were enslaved, was not officially recorded. As the Union army blazed through Tennessee in 1862 and 1863, her family was among those who fled slavery along with the Union's wave. She would have been about 4 years old when General William T. Sherman, the famed Union general, issued Special Field Order No. 15 , which redistributed about 400,000 acres of land to recently freed black families in 40-acre blocks. It was the origin of 40 acres and a mule , and an early example of what reparations for slavery could look like.\n\nSherman's order was quickly overturned. After President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, his successor, Andrew Johnson, signed a proclamation that returned land to the planters and slaveholders who originally owned it. And those black families were left with little to nothing for the 246 years of legally sanctioned slavery. But just as the long tail of racial discrimination did not end with slavery, black people, like Callie House, did not stop fighting for what they saw as recompense for justice denied.\n\nToday, Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee, the chair of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties, invoked part of this history as the panel held a hearing on H.R. 40, a bill that would create a commission to study and examine reparations proposals. \"Slavery was our nation's original sin,\" Cohen said. \"Our Constitution protected it, embodying various compromises that gave disproportionate power to slave states.\" Enacting the bill, he added, would be \"an important step in finding effective, long-term solutions to these problems, ones that can trace their origins to our nation's shameful history of slavery and antiblack racism.\"\n\nThe hearing, held on Juneteenth, a day celebrating the emancipation of black people-the day, in 1865, when black people in Texas found out they were free-was the first held on reparations in more than a decade. Some Democratic presidential candidates are already urging Congress to pass H.R. 40, ushering the debate into the 2020 campaign. In impassioned remarks, Representative Karen Bass of California framed the task bluntly: \"At what point in this country can we have a conversation about race? We cannot get past it until we have the conversation, and the conversation begins with the commission.\"\n\nThe energy pulsing around the issue of reparations is fresh. But is it sustainable?\n\nP revious attempts to secure reparations-or, at the very least, figure out how much is owed for state-sanctioned discrimination against black people in America-are well documented. In the late 19th century, Callie House, by then a widow and a mother of five, was supporting her family by working as a washerwoman. But she was also launching a movement.\n\nThrough her organization, the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association, House inspired former enslaved people to demand payment for their work. They had performed years of labor, and were barred from voting, marrying, and arguing for their rights in a court of law-and, she implored them, they needed to be compensated.\n\nMary Frances Berry, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania, tells House's story in her 2005 book, My Face Is Black Is True . House's group wanted to send a petition to the federal government demanding it pay black people a pension for the work they had done during slavery. And if the government denied the request, at least there would be a written record of as many people as they could find who had been enslaved and should be paid.\n\n\"The organization demanded that Congress give reparation,\" Berry told me in a recent interview, and according to the intelligence arm of the federal government at the time, \"they had at least 300,000 dues-paying members.\" It's unclear, of course, whether the government inflated that figure to make the group appear more menacing, Berry told me, but it was-genuinely-significant in size, and many white Americans were afraid of it.\n\n\"There were all kinds of letters written to the [Bureau of Pensions] from white people who lived in local communities, demanding that the government stop\" the organization, Berry told me. According to the letters, House's group was telling black people they were going to be paid reparations, \"and when the government doesn't give them anything, we're going to have hell to pay, because they're going to be mad,\" Berry summarized.\n\nThe bureau saw some truth to the letters, concluding, as Berry writes in her book, that the organization was \"running the Negros wild\" with its movement; and they sent agents to go to its meetings. If the black people were plotting a revolution, it should be rooted out, the thinking went. What the agents found was that the group was not doing anything more than signing up formerly enslaved black people for their petition. The people would sign their name, note what plantation they had been on, and say how old they were. But the federal government intervened anyway, issuing an order that said House's group couldn't send its flyers through the mail.\n\nRead: Ta-Nehisi Coates's testimony on reparations\n\nIn a letter to the Bureau of Pensions, House protested. She had gone to one of the schools the Freedmen's Bureau had set up during Reconstruction, and learned about the Constitution. The founding document gave people the right to petition the government, she argued. But the government still arrested her: It was fraud, officials said, for her to be distributing these documents when she knew the government wouldn't acquiesce to the demand.\n\nThe push for reparations didn't stop with House in prison. Nor did it stop after she died. Black people kept fighting with consistency, but with movements blunted. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, in his landmark 1968 decision in the case of Bakke v. the University of California Board of Regents, upheld the limited use of race in college admissions, but made it clear that affirmative action was not about repair for a history of slavery. He made another pointed declaration about reparations as well: \"The clock of our liberties, however, cannot be turned back to 1868,\" when the Fourteenth Amendment, and its critical equal-protection clause, was ratified, he wrote in his opinion. \"It is far too late,\" he said, \"to argue that the guarantee of equal protection to all persons permits the recognition of special wards entitled to a degree of protection greater than that accorded others.\" Further, he opined , \"there is a measure of inequity in forcing innocent persons ... to bear the burdens of redressing grievances not of their making.\"\n\nPowell's argument has withstood the test of time. Today, during remarks at the hearing, Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the ranking member of the subcommittee, struck a similar chord. \"Putting aside the injustice of monetary reparations from current taxpayers for the sins of a small subset of Americans from many generations ago ... the fair distribution of reparations would be nearly impossible once one considers the complexity of the American struggle to abolish slavery,\" he said. \"There are tens of millions of today's non-African Americans who are descended from people who arrived in the country, of course, after slavery ended, and therefore they can't be held responsible for its legacy.\"\n\nBut H.R. 40, as Berry told me, isn't about white people paying physical checks to black people. It's about studying the effects of slavery and Jim Crow, and finding out who, if anyone, should pay and how. Supporters of reparations believe the institutions that benefited from slavery and Jim Crow should pay-the colleges, the legacy businesses, and, yes, the federal government. As Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose 2014 Atlantic cover story, \"The Case for Reparations,\" thrust the issue back into the national spotlight, put it while testifying today, \"the federal government should pay [reparations] because the federal government was deeply complicit\" in creating inequality.\n\nA great lie among opponents of reparations is that people who suffered under slavery did not fervently, and consistently, seek what they believed was due to them, Berry told me. Reparations register in the national conversation as blips over time, but in communities that have been fighting inequality, they ring as a steady thumping of a drum.\n\nJ esse Jackson campaigned for president in part on reparations in the 1980s. \"There is now a different level of hearing about the same proposition,\" he told me in a recent interview-that descendants of slavery and the people who languished under the Jim Crow regime should be compensated. It's on the lips of Democratic presidential candidates in town halls, on television, and in key voting states such as South Carolina , places where more than 150 years ago, the promise of 40 acres and a mule seemed real. And it's also a topic of conversation among reparations' opponents, such as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who, yesterday, stated he doesn't \"think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for which none of us living are responsible, is a good idea.\"\n\nDuring his testimony, Coates rebutted McConnell's claim. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" he said. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\"\n\nCallie House was jailed for seeking reparations. Affirmative action faced sharp opposition starting nearly the moment President John F. Kennedy signed an executive order on the matter in 1961, declaring that government contractors \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\" Within two decades, it was limited as a form of repair for the past. Momentum can be stymied if another force is pushing harder against it.\n\nAs Christina Greer, a political-science professor at Fordham University, told me, reparations will not likely stay at the forefront of the presidential conversation as Democrats move from the primary to the general election. Their attention will turn to immigration or the economy or jobs instead. But, for now, reparations have the nation's ear.\n\nBerry hesitated when I asked whether she thought reparations would ever come about. \"Unless black people mount a mass movement to put pressure on to do it, I don't think it will happen,\" she said, after a pause. \"It's not going to happen in quiet lounges and dinners and among people talking in Congress.

      "text": "Reckoning with Reparations on Martin Luther King Day\n\nAs we observe Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, we must reflect and act upon an unfulfilled promise.\n\nIn 1968, Dr. King proclaimed, \"[W]hen we come to Washington in this campaign, we are coming to get our check.\" This was no metaphorical check but a stark reminder of the debts owed, the reparations for centuries of racial injustice that remain unsettled.\n\nFor over four centuries, America has wrestled with the sin of slavery -a cancer that, despite being abolished, has metastasized into systemic racism , overtly and insidiously affecting the lives of millions of Black Americans . Slavery may have ended, on paper, with the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStill, its legacy persists, in its wake a trail of suffering and inequity that spans every sector of society from education to the prison industrial complex, from the entertainment and health-care industries to all the socioeconomic disparities that haunt our society.\n\nThe Middle Passage was more than an Atlantic Ocean route; it was a journey into a life of subhuman bondage, dehumanization, and brutality for countless Black people. Enslaved, owned, and exploited African Americans were forced to lay the foundations of an economy from which they would never reap the benefits. Today, we inherit their contributions alongside the moral imperative to right history's wrongs.\n\nYet, as we grapple with the idea of reparations, we find ourselves at a moral and political crossroads fraught with questions of practicality and justice. Who is to be paid, and from where should the funds come? Can any monetary sum ever truly compensate for the atrocities of slavery and its continued consequences?\n\nThe reparations journey is frequently diminished and misconstrued as a mere financial, pecuniary demand. However, reparations are about more than money. Reparations demand acknowledgment, truth, systemic transformation, and genuine equity, which together represent seven forms:\n\n1. Political Reparations: Provisions that restore, recognize, increase, and amplify the voices, representation, and influence of Black Americans in the political arena.\n\n2. Intellectual reparations: Provisions affording Black Americans cultural and intellectual contributions, intentional artistic protections, ownership, due credit, and recognition.\n\n3. Legal Reparations: Racial equity and restorative justice authorized and enshrined in laws and policies.\n\n4. Economic Reparations: Monetary compensation, financial assistance through subsidies, guaranteed basic income, debt relief, assistance, and restitution.\n\n5. Social Reparations: Restoring and rebuilding the social contract to eradicate racism and recognize the dignity of all individuals through education and public awareness.\n\n6. Spatial Reparations: Preventing and correcting the geographical imbalances created by systemic residential segregation and forced displacement.\n\n7. Spiritual Reparations: Recognizing and restoring the spiritual and indigenous African cosmologies, beliefs, and practices that were suppressed or destroyed.\n\nAs a nation, we must harness the same resolve that spurred the civil rights movement to create a commission dedicated to the study and development of reparation proposals, as outlined in the bill H.R. 40 (Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act), and push further for the creation of Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation (TRHT) commissions.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration has an unprecedented opportunity to lead America into a new era where Dr. King's reparative justice demand is finally satisfied. By addressing historical grievances with truth, compassion, love, and courage, America can pave the way for a more prosperous and inclusive future removed from the patterns of pain, trauma, and inequity bequeathed the nation by slavery.\n\nLet this Martin Luther King, Jr. Day mark a loving remembrance of what was and a steadfast, optimistic commitment to what could be. Let us continue in our pursuit of reparations, for the road to a just and equitable society requires us to settle the debts of the past to secure the promise of our children's tomorrow.\n\nThe truth is our compass; may it guide us to a place where the dream of equity and dignity for all becomes the lived experience of every American.\n\nGot a tip?

The pool grew to more than 4 million by the Civil War and their bodies made America great.\n\nAmerica became an economic powerhouse from the institution of slavery, according to authors Sven Beckert and Seth Rockman in Slavery's Capitalism: A New History of American Economic Development . )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.amazon.com/Slaverys-Capitalism-American-Economic-Development/dp/1538404389__;!!LsXw!SASLzKCMkHUw6dLYYTFt848hNxmbfv_Saa4G0pAMqsidISrfV0ovU5vGIHT_uOoI93RiNQ25f2L2kcs4Tj5Ojk9_rVxui9o4UQ$\">Slavery's Capitalism: A New History of American Economic Development . Africans were the primary assets of national wealth as commodities for work, sale, rent, and childbirth. They helped to build the industries of agriculture, shipping, manufacturing, railroads, publishing, finance, and insurance.\n\nAmong the early claims for restitution was for 400,000 acres of coastal land between South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The region was awarded in reparation to emancipated Blacks in January 1865, under Special Field Order No. 15 by the Union Army Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman.\n\nThe order specified that \"The islands from Charleston, south, the abandoned rice fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the St. John's River , Florida, are reserved and set apart for the settlement of the negroes now made free by the acts of war and the proclamation of the President of the United States.\"\n\nThe reparations were reversed with the assassination of President Lincoln in April 1865, and Black settlers were either evicted or reduced to peonage with the return of white supremacy governments.\n\nAnother early claim was for state and federal pensions on behalf of the freedmen. In 1899, for example, The National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association called on Congress to allocate pensions to the aged class. The appeal was ignored.\n\nIn addition to slavery, people have initiated claims for restitution for the unjust enrichment from Jim Crow )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://jimcrowmuseum.ferris.edu/what.htm__;!!LsXw!SASLzKCMkHUw6dLYYTFt848hNxmbfv_Saa4G0pAMqsidISrfV0ovU5vGIHT_uOoI93RiNQ25f2L2kcs4Tj5Ojk9_rVytuabe-w$\">Jim Crow , the laws and practices of racial subjugation. The loss of wages, farmland, family wealth, and markets for business stretched nearly a century from the close of the Civil War to the 1960s.

Certainly, the debt has grown since then?\n\nThe agenda should also seek new ways to gain access to the resources-educational, employment, and contracting-of the upper-tier schools, most of which were enriched under slavery and Jim Crow.

The community probably will gain more from an agenda that directs investments to HBCUs and programs at community colleges and urban public colleges that serve large numbers of Black students.\n\nBeyond the question of financial wholeness, the demand for reparations for slavery and Jim Crow has cultural merit as well. Randall Robinson, in \" The Debt : What America Owes to Blacks ,\" argued that the debate helps America better understand the divergent pathways of race in the country's history.

      "text": "No One Ever Made the Case for Reparations Better Than Reagan\n\nToday, as Californians consider a reparations package that could reach $800 billion to pay for the harm the state has done to its African-American population on matters ranging from over-policing to housing discrimination , there's a pro-reparations argument that needs to be revived. It's that made by Ronald Reagan 35 years ago.\n\nWith California's Task Force to Study and Develop Reparations Proposals for African Americans getting ready to submit a draft of its report to the state legislature by late June, Reagan's argument has become more relevant than ever. \"For here we right a wrong,\" Reagan declared in 1988, as his second term as president was nearing its end. Reagan spoke these words to mark his signing of a bill designed to provide restitution for the World War II internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry.\n\nAt a time when those making the case for reparations are accused of being woke , we forget the heartfelt case for payments combining restitution and reparations that Reagan made without fearing he would lose his credentials as a political conservative.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe decision to remove Japanese Americans from their homes during World War II reflected long standing anti-Asian prejudices. The Roosevelt administration contended that Japanese Americans posed a danger to the country in case of a Japanese attack on America's West Coast. But there was no comparable treatment of German Americans or Italian Americans despite the United States also being at war with Germany and Italy.\n\nReagan's speech is one that few want to recall because of the racism it calls attention to, but the speech is a lesson in how to deal with history we would like to have back. At the speech's core lies Reagan's belief that, while we cannot undo the wrongs of the past, we can mitigate their continuing impact.\n\nIn his address to the nation in 1988, Reagan managed to apologize for government wrongdoing and argue that his apology left America stronger. \"So what is most important in this bill has less to do with property than with honor,\" Reagan declared. \"We reaffirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law.\"\n\nThe timing of Reagan's speech is noteworthy. It came decades before the Supreme Court in 2018 explicitly repudiated the Roosevelt-era Supreme Court's 1944 Korematsu decision sanctioning the wartime internment of Japanese Americans. In words that echo Reagan's, Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. described Korematsu as \"morally repugnant\" and \"gravely wrong the day it was decided.\"\n\nPrior to 2018 the strongest legal dissent from the Korematsu decision was the \"confession of error \" that the Justice Department issued in 2011 when it acknowledged the misleading role the Solicitor General had played in 1944 in defending the internment of Japanese Americans.\n\nReagan began his 1988 speech by describing the cruelty of the internment that the government was now seeking to redress. He spoke of thousands of Americans of Japanese ancestry being removed from their homes and placed in makeshift internment camps solely because of their race.\n\nThe rush to internment began on February 19, 1942, 73 days after the United States entered World War II when President Franklin Roosevelt issued Order 9066. The order came with so little planning that for a time Japanese-American families were interned in the horse stables at Santa Anita race track . In his address Reagan believed it was important not to sugarcoat the emotional and economic impact of internment.\n\nThe redress for Japanese Americans interned during World War II has meant tax-free payments of $20,000 to more than 82,000 claimants as a result of the 1988 act. The total amounts to over $1.6 billion.\n\nReagan was not put off by the cost of restitution, which in fact falls short of the amount of money lost by the men and women interned in the 1940s when put in current dollars . At the heart of Reagan's speech was his belief that \"no payment can make up for those lost years.\"\n\nThirteen years after Ronald Reagan's White House speech, the National Japanese-American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II opened in Washington on June 29, 2001. Unlike the memorials on the National Mall, the National Japanese-American Memorial does not immediately draw attention to itself. The memorial sits just north of the Capitol on a small triangle of land at the intersection of New Jersey Avenue and D Street.\n\nThe 33,000 square-foot park and plaza that hold the memorial invite contemplation. Designed by Washington, D.C. architect Davis Buckley, the memorial, like Reagan's speech, makes a point of being direct and elegiac about the injustices it addresses. On one of its walls are the names of the 10 internment camps where Japanese Americans were held during World War II, and at the center of the memorial is a bronze sculpture, \"The Golden Cranes,\" by Nina Akamu, whose grandfather died in an internment camp. Her sculpture consists of two cranes struggling to break free of the barbed wire that entangles them.\n\nRonald Reagan was not able to attend the opening of the Japanese-American Memorial, but he is present there. Words from his 1988 speech are inscribed on the edge of the memorial pool.\n\nReagan concluded his speech by recalling the time he attended a 1945 medal ceremony in Orange County, California, at which World War II General Joe Stillwell honored a Japanese-American military hero of the war in Europe with a posthumous Distinguished Service Cross. Reagan's role at the 1945 medal ceremony, like that of the other celebrities there, was a minor one, but decades later, he saw his presence at the ceremony worth addressing.\n\nIn doing so, Reagan was not just personalizing his speech. He was making clear a lesson in continuity that is easy to forget: the burden of righting a historic wrong sanctioned by the government does not simply fall on those responsible for the wrong at the time it was committed. It falls on a state or nation owning up to its past.\n\nNicolaus Mills is author of Like a Holy Crusade: Mississippi 1964-The Turning of the Civil Rights Movement in America.

It was important to her,\" Cohen told the Sunday Times of spending time at Balmoral. \"She loved hosting everybody for summer, allocating the rooms and checking them herself.\" The queen's love of speed behind the wheel could unnerve some of those in the passenger seat. \"She was gutsy. She would drive her cars fast around Balmoral.\"\n\nCohen was speaking as King Charles prepared to head Down Under (and Samoa) on a trip this coming week. It was revealed that cancer-hit Charles was traveling with two doctors (as well as having a supply of his own blood in case he needs a transfusion), and would have medical support in Australia and Samoa.\n\nQueen Elizabeth visits the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute at the University of Edinburgh, as part of her traditional trip to Scotland for Holyrood Week, in Edinburgh, Scotland, Britain July 1, 2021.\n\nCohen worked for the queen for 18 years, working first in the Buckingham Palace press office, then as the queen's communications secretary, before becoming her assistant private secretary. She did three Australian tours with the queen in 2002, 2006 and 2011.\n\nWhile a former courtier described Cohen and the queen's bond as \"unique,\" Cohen modestly describes it as bond \"very respectful. There were no favorites. I felt my job was to make her life as easy as possible.\"\n\n\"It always struck me that in a world of celebrity, where we had all sorts of celebrities coming into the palace, the queen was the antithesis of celebrity,\" Cohen said. \"She was the maestro. She understood this was her role. She took it very seriously and performed it to perfection. But she knew it was separate to her as a person. She was never intoxicated by the allure, never showed off, was never tempted to preen. I loved that so much about her, because she had no ego.\"\n\n\"The queen was an incredible boss,\" Cohen said who \"went out of her way\" to accommodate Cohen's family (she has three children), with housing them when Cohen traveled between the queen's properties, and personally addressed Christmas gift tags.\n\nQueen Elizabeth ll and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh arrive in an open carriage on Ladies Day at Royal Ascot on June 16, 2011 in Ascot, United Kingdom.\n\n\"Some mornings I'd be getting the cereal for breakfast, and the kids would go, 'Mum! The Queen just rode past on her horse,'\" Cohen said, recalling their times at Balmoral. \"Other times they'd bump into her on their bicycles. The kids loved swimming in the rock pools.

      "text": "Donald Glover's 'Atlanta' Makes the Case for Reparations\n\nAtlanta has slowly but surely been approaching the level of comedic sharpness and formal innovativeness we witnessed in seasons one and two. This week's singular standalone episode is a potent reminder of what the series is capable of at its most incisive. Likewise, \"Big Payback,\" written by Francesca Sloane and directed by Hiro Murai, imagines what reparations would look like on an individual level as opposed to the government payouts currently being proposed, with little movement, in American electoral politics. Told from the perspective of a white man named Marshall Johnson, played by MVP of the National Treasure franchise Justin Bartha, this alternative reality makes for one of the most hysterical and surprisingly emotional episodes of Atlanta so far, and a worthwhile excursion from the show's central plot.\n\nWhen we first meet Marshall, he's in line at Starbucks looking at a package of shortbread cookies. In front of him is a Black man who's accused by a white cashier of cutting the line for reasons we can only assume are racially motivated. Marshall shrugs off the encounter, purchases his coffee, and goes back to his car where he discovers the unpurchased cookies in his pocket and proceeds to eat them as if he's starring in a commercial for white privilege. After Marshall pulls off, we see an old Ford Taurus with an obscured driver begin to follow him. So begins the \"payback.\"\n\nThe next time we see Marshall, he's dropping off his daughter Katie (Scarlett Blum), who he splits time with between his estranged wife (Dahlia Legault) at school. He hears a story on the radio about a Black man who was just granted the ability to claim profits from Tesla after learning that one of the early investor's relatives owned his family during slavery in a landmark lawsuit. As the anchor explains how this case could have ripple effects across the world, he has a brief look of distress-very similar to when many of us initially heard of the coronavirus but thought it would only be as bad as the swine flu-before turning off the radio and heading to work.\n\nOnce he arrives at his office job, where the mysterious car is parked outside, we realize that the impact of the lawsuit has seemingly already begun when Marshall and his predominantly white co-workers are told that the company is making budget cuts. One of his co-workers (Madison Hatfield) tells him that she thinks the company's being sued with the same clause from the Tesla case and encourages him to check his family ancestry, so he isn't next. Meanwhile, a group of Black co-workers are high-fiving and chatting gleefully on one side of the office. Again, Marshall shrugs off all these warning signs, including persistent calls from an unknown number and a white woman crying hysterically in the parking lot, and goes about his day.\n\nOn the way to pick up his daughter from school, he hears Black deejays on a radio station joking that there are \"no more apologies, just apolo-G's,\" which I think might be a more potent slogan for reparations than Black Twitter's current rallying cry \"open your purse.\" When his daughter gets in the car, she asks whether or not their family is racist after a presumably Black classmate said they were and asks if they owned slaves. Marshall replies no, and earnestly notes that their ancestors were enslaved during the Byzantine Empire.\n\nWhen they get back home, an attorney shows up to hand Marshall papers claiming that Marshall's great-great grandfather enslaved the relatives of a woman named Sheniqua (Melissa Youngblood) and, therefore, owes her money. Sheniqua pops up behind him and begins inspecting and snapping photos of her soon-to-be home. It's just the beginning of her \"harassment,\" as Marshall calls it, which includes later showing up outside of his job with a megaphone and demanding her money immediately and blasting him on Instagram. It was personally delightful for me watching Sheniqua assert herself on Marshall's property throughout the episode without waiting for the legal process to go through.\n\nWhen Marshall arrives at work again, his white colleagues are discussing the wave of  restitution lawsuits like it's the COVID-19 pandemic, asking each other if they got their \"results\" back-referring, of course, to 23AndMe. One woman unfortunately finds out that she's \"100% Nordic\" while another boasts that she's \"69% Ashkenazi Jew.\" Realizing his unavoidable fate, Marshall decides to get advice from one of his Black coworkers, who looks like he's waiting on some settlement money. The coworker tells Marshall that the only thing he can do is admit he's wrong and give Sheniqua as much money as possible.\n\nAfter discovering that Sheniqua and her family have settled in his home and his estranged wife, who now identifies as Peruvian, wants to officially get divorced to protect her finances, Marshall shacks up in a hotel where he has a long, Holly Hunter-in- Broadcast News sob.\n\nHe then goes down to the lobby and starts to complain to a man named E (played by Tobias Segal, who played another or possibly the same random white man in the season premiere) sitting near him about his predicament. When Marshall asserts that it isn't fair, the man tells him a story about how his father would also tell him that his grandfather \"built everything [he] had from the ground up\" before learning he had \"a lot of help\" and \"a lot of kids.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's only right,\" he shrugs.\n\n\"E, we don't deserve this,\" Marshall replies incredulously.\n\n\"Well, what do they deserve?\"\n\nHe then segues into an eloquent monologue about how white people \"treat slavery like it's a mystery\" and \"something to investigate if [they] chose to.\" When he says that \"confession is not absolution,\" it brings to mind the large swaths of well-meaning, liberal-minded white people who thought their long-winded admissions of guilt about systemic racism and acceptance of white privilege on Instagram during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests made a material difference in the lives of Black people. E then explains that slavery is something Sheniqua and other Black people experience tangibly every day.\n\nBefore disappearing into the lobby, he assures Marshall that he and his family are \"gonna be okay\" because \"the curse has been lifted.\" This is the sort of abating message  every white person wants to hear amid any effort to amend racism (that they can essentially walk away unscathed). Likewise, any sort of solace Marshall may have received during that conversation is undone when a man, who may or may not be E,   shoots himself in the head and falls into the pool. As Marshall stares outside at the grisly image, a Black waiter casually utters, \"There's where I came from\" and walks away.\n\nA few years into the future, we meet Marshall waiting tables at a restaurant. There's a large number of white people working in the kitchen, who we can assume are dealing with the same circumstances as Marshall. There also are still some people of color as well. Not only has Marshall given Sheniqua a large sum of his money, but he's apparently indebted to her and her family for the rest of his life, notifying his boss that he owes 15% of his wages to \"restitution taxes.\" Enough time has seemingly passed that Marshall is comfortable saying this out loud and even looks chipper as he begins work. E is ultimately right that Marshall is \"okay\" in the sense that he's simply taken on the low-paying positions that many Black people have no option but to work in and find ways to survive doing. Most notably, he still has an irrevocable supply of white privilege to work himself back up the professional ladder.\n\nAll in all, this week's Atlanta succeeds as a delightfully funny piece of speculative fiction (depending on who's watching) and a biting critique of the vain attempts to rectify the destruction of slavery by institutions and individuals, making for one of the best post-BLM episodes of television, so far. One can only assume there's more to come.\n\nkyndall.cunningham@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Why Boston Activists Want White Churches to Pay Reparations\n\nRace and Identity Reporter\n\nReligious leaders in Boston have rallied together to demand reparations for Black Americans, including a call for $15 billion from city authorities and white churches to help bridge the equity gap and tell a story of enslaved people in the northeast \"that is rarely talked about.\"\n\nIn February 2023, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu appointed members who would be part of the city's Reparations Task Force . However, last month the task force said it would not complete its work by the end of the year as originally planned and that an action plan is now expected \"sometime in 2025.\"\n\nBoston is one of a number of U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Detroit, and St. Louis, that is working to identify local ties to slavery and whether reparations are appropriate.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArlington Street Church Rev. John Gibbons, a white community minister who leads a multi-ethnic congregation, says many people consider Boston to be \"the Deep North,\" a play on the racist ideologies of the Deep South.\n\n\"In New England, we don't think of New England and the North as a place of slavery, and it did take a different form than it did in the South,\" he told The Daily Beast. \"But we're uncovering more and more evidence of the ways in which all of the prominent families in the founding of Boston were most frequently engaged in slavery.\n\nThe Arlington Street Church through early-morning rain and fog.\n\n\"We've had truly segregated housing. We have virtually exclusively Black neighborhoods, virtually exclusively white neighborhoods and suburbs, and this was done deliberately through the real estate practices of blockbusting and redlining where Black families were given loans but only if they would buy in particular neighborhoods. This has had a devastating effect,\" Gibbons said. \"There are deep roots of racism in the North, and in Boston in particular.\"\n\nBoston People's Reparations Commission Co-Director Edwin Sumpter, who shares the role with Heather Cook, said that Black Americans have given so much to the country but still suffer from the effects of enslavement and its aftermath with poor \"housing, crime, joblessness, over policing, all the policing, health, environmental.\"\n\n\"They ought to be willing to give back to those communities that have been so hurt by the fact that for the 300 years or so in the United States, Black people really got a low stock in terms of realizing the quote-unquote 'American Dream.' For so many years for us, it was an American nightmare,\" Sumpter said. \"Even after slavery ended in 1863, 1865, it was still another 100 years before the Civil Rights Bill was signed.\"\n\nHe added that progress will be made when the Black community isn't the last group to the table to discuss reparations.\n\n\"We're the ones who reparations are going to impact. Without depending on the city to keep our community involved or engaged or educated on reparations... we just want to make sure that there's some consistency going on... to whatever conclusion this all comes to.\"\n\nIn 2022, Boston established that there would be a Reparations Task Force to study the \"legacy of slavery in the city and its impact on descendants today,\" according to the group's website. But local leaders say the research is taking too long to show results.\n\n\"From my point of view... there needs to be more pressure for action and for moving forward and considering economic reparations in a variety of ways,\" Gibbons said.\n\nGibbons says his social justice group, the New Democracy Coalition, helped push for the Boston City Council's 2022 apology for the city's involvement in the enslavement of Black people and the creation of a reparations task force.\n\nHe said the group has been working directly with the Boston People's Reparations Commission-a band of local Black activists who partner with other progressive groups throughout the city-and its appeal for reparations.\n\n\"We have demanded $15 billion, and usually we say $15 billion is not enough,\" he said.\n\n\"[The $15 billion] is a way of saying that the damage done by slavery has been incalculable over the generations, not just to those who were enslaved, but to the cascade and generations that have been harmed by white supremacy, by racist housing, real estate, employment, education, health practices,\" Gibbons explained. \"We particularly are directing this demand to the financial institutions of Boston and to the white churches and, most especially, to the legacy white churches-by which, I mean the churches that were part of the founding of Boston. Really the economy, the structure, the culture of Boston was founded on the institution of slavery.\"\n\nIn an interview with local news outlet BCAM TV in Massachusetts last month, Boston People's Reparations Commission Co-Director Heather Cook said the city's official task force needed to have more of a working relationship with its constituents.\n\n\"Because there was that gap, we saw that there was a need for there to be the [Boston People's Reparations] Commission,\" Cook said. \"The Boston People's Reparations Commission was created by the people for the people. We're very appreciative of the fact that the city has joined our meetings, is interested in what the community has to say, and truly wants to partner, and that's what the conversation is right now.\"\n\nLate last month, Boston People's Reparations Commission President Rev. Kevin Peterson, who also works with the New Democracy Coalition, called on older church denominations that have predominantly white congregations to join its mission to repair Boston's Black community-monetarily, emotionally, and historically.\n\n\"We call sincerely and with a heart filled with faith and Christian love for our white churches to join us and not be silent around this issue of racism and slavery and commit to reparations,\" Peterson said, according to the Boston Globe . \"We point to them in Christian love to publicly atone for the sins of slavery and we ask them to publicly commit to a process of reparations where they will extend their great wealth-tens of millions of dollars among some of those churches-into the Black community.\"\n\nThe leaders of some churches, a number of which have been around since the 17th and 18th centuries, feel they have an obligation to make the public aware of Boston's history.\n\nOld South Church, Boston.\n\nRev. John Edgerton of Old South Church explained that his church maintained archives of previous members, and in turn, created a memorial to enslaved congregants.\n\n\"We're a very old institution that has been here since 1669,\" Edgerton told The Daily Beast. \"During that period of time, slavery was legal in the colony [of] Massachusetts. We know that those institutions-and institutions of white supremacy in general-are things that are bound up in our history.\"\n\nEdgerton said the Old South Church of Boston had a duty to do historical research considering its legacy.\n\n\"We're in a really good position to do that historical research. That is both an opportunity, and also I feel like it's a responsibility that we have as an institution.\"\n\nRev. Kenneth Young, associate director of the Massachusetts Council of Churches told The Daily Beast the history of enslaved Black people of Boston and its trajectory into the marginalization of the Black community is not a common topic in the city.\n\n\"Not only is it rarely talked about, you think about churches that played a role in that,\" he said. \"Culturally, Boston, particularly, is a place you go to experience a progressive culture... And now the underbelly of it is like, 'How did we manage to get all of this?' Well, some of it happened through enslaving people like they did in the South.\"\n\nTrinity Church in Boston's Copley Square.\n\nRev. Morgan Allen of Boston's Trinity Church said while his church did not directly enslave people according to its records that have been found, he recognized that its members were probably patrons of various industries that profited from enslaved Black labor.\n\n\"Trinity's commitment to repair looks not only to our community's past, but into our present and future,\" Allen wrote in an email. \"Trinity launched and continues to support a separately incorporated, non-profit, Trinity Boston Connects )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://trinityconnects.org/?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0bzKuYGrhQMVFGBHAR0XSwFLEAAYASAAEgKnxfD_BwE__;!!LsXw!VwNWz4ozylHFBcYYmckRHh9RNlWp4xAxyRZGxIIEUhbDst-P3Q1h61lLh1gDribmTTTrIgkZIaNlx82e0vcXuIPmpF0L2PGwH_M$\">Trinity Boston Connects (TBC), which heals the traumatic impact of systemic racism on youth of color in the City of Boston.\n\n\"There has never been a time when Trinity Church was not a multi-racial community. From our founding in 1733, church registers testify to baptisms, marriages, and burials of people of color. Records identify some Black persons as 'free,' while we also expect that before Massachusetts abolished slavery in 1783, some were likely the enslaved servants of white parishioners,\" Allen wrote. \"In the nearly 300-year history of Trinity Church, our parishioners remained-and remain-entangled in structures and systems of racism, even while we continually seek justice.\"\n\nSumpter said that Black Americans were treated like \"less than second-class citizens\" until the Civil Rights Movement and that the only way for the country to prosper is if everyone operates collectively to uplift the community as a whole.\n\n\"African Americans in the 21st century... are in positions because of what African Americans in the 16th and 17th and 18th century had to endure,\" Sumpter said, explaining that he doesn't want the Black community to be in the dark as the City of Boston's Reparations Task Force \"sits on their hands\" and ultimately decides what to do.\n\n\"When this whole reparations situation moves forward, we just want to make sure the community moves forward with it.\"\n\nFor Gibbons, he says the \"issues are too important to be given to a study commission\" without any action.\n\n\"We can't get [progress] until there is some means of addressing the damage, truly genocidal damage that was caused to Black Bostonians and Black Americans,\" Gibbons said. \"I feel these issues are too important to be left to the Black community to be responsible for white institutions. White people need to acknowledge our complicity over the generations. And sure, it means research and understanding the history.\"\n\nMayor Wu says she hopes to begin implementing the task force's recommendations, once they are made, by the summer of 2026, to mark the 250th anniversary of America's founding, reported local outlet WBUR .\n\nCommunications for the City of Boston's Reparations Task Force did not respond to The Daily Beast's requests for comment for this article.\n\nRace and Identity Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "There's a Long  History of Reparations-for White Enslavers\n\nOn the heels of the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, Haiti's interim government has pleaded for international help -and while it has not included reparations in those appeals, they are long overdue. In fact, the issue of reparations can't be extracted from Haiti's condition today .\n\nBritain, the United States, France-nations that were once key players in the transatlantic slave trade and have now firmly declared a refusal to even seriously consider reparations-not only once advocated for cash restitution, but actually made compensatory payments.\n\nBut those reparations weren't paid to the Black people who'd been forced to endure the brutality of slavery or their descendants. Instead, that money was paid to the white folks who did the enslaving .\n\nFrance led the way. In the late 1700s, France's cruel colonial exploits in Saint Domingue-today known as Haiti-were making the European country more money than any of its other Caribbean occupations. The tiny island nation \" exported 60 percent of all the coffee and 40 percent of all the sugar consumed in Europe,\" a level of profiteering achieved by quite literally working enslaved Black people to death. Most of those stolen from Africa and transported to Haiti would die before their 22nd birthdays because of the inhumane horrors to which they were subjected. The human lives taken by these massacres of forced labor were replenished by the French with roughly 40,000 new people taken from Africa each year.\n\nWhen the French Revolution kicked off in 1787, its purported ideals of liberté, égalité, fraternité were embraced by enslaved Black folks in Haiti, who in 1791 organized to secure their freedom and overthrow France's slaveocracy. Just over 12 years later, the Haitian Revolution succeeded in establishing the nation as the first Black-led republic in the world. But any opportunity for the newly independent country to truly prosper and thrive was squashed by France. In 1825, surrounded by French war boats threatening invasion and the reimposition of slavery, Haiti was forced into an agreement to pay some 150 million francs -with interest, no less-in reparations to French enslavers angry over the loss of their human and terrestrial \"properties.\" The debt was reduced to 90 million francs a few years later, but the demand was far too much for a new country just finding its footing. At the turn of the century, Haiti was giving France a staggering \"80 percent of its national budget\" to settle a debt pocketed by \"more than 7,900 former slave owners and their descendants\" that would only be settled in 1947. The payments left Haiti in financial ruin, setting it up for the cycle of instability, corruption, exploitation and intervention that has troubled its existence.\n\nThe United States under President Thomas Jefferson aided France in its nefarious effort by cutting off funds to Haiti , a strategy pursued to ensure that its own system of Black chattel slavery wouldn't come under threat. Haiti wouldn't be recognized as an independent nation by the U.S. government for six decades, until the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, who also instituted a program of reparations that served to enrich white enslavers at home.\n\nIn 1862, Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act , a bill which abolished slavery in Washington, D.C., and gave enslavers $300 (or more than $8,000 in 2021 dollars) for the inconvenience of having the people they kept in bondage taken away. The Black people who had been enslaved were offered no recompense for the years they spent laboring for free-though the legislation did offer them a bribe of just $100 to leave the country they had built on their backs for \"the republics of Hayti or Liberia, or such other country beyond the limits of the United States as the President may determine.\" There were few takers, but most of the 960 enslavers who applied for the reparations program got paid.\n\n\"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young, the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber, the second largest,\" historian and author Carroll Gibbs told me last year when we spoke about the U.S. reparations policy. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory. She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe, \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" All told, the U.S. Department of Treasury paid out the equivalent of $23 million in 2020 dollars to white enslavers in D.C.\n\nIn 1833, when Britain passed the Slavery Abolition Act across most of its colonies, it passed along handouts of 20 million pounds -that's 2.4 billion pounds in today's money-or roughly 40 percent of its national budget at the time to white enslavers. (Or, to quote the law, \"Persons at present entitled to the Services of the Slaves to be manumitted and set free by virtue of this Act for the Loss of such Services.\") Much of that money was borrowed, and not paid back until 2015 , incredibly. The Legacies of British Slave-ownership Project undertaken by University College London has been able to connect payments to more than 46,000 enslavers across the British Empire -and to note their descendants, including former Prime Minister David Cameron .\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell-whose family enslaved at least 14 Black folks before the Civil War -two years ago dismissed reparations by stating that American slavery was \"something that happened\" long ago, as if two-and-a-half centuries of Black enslavement and lasting anti-Blackness have had no impact on America's economic, social, and political policy. David Brooks once wrote that the problems Haiti faces are attributable to everything from its \"voodoo religion\" to Haitians' \"progress-resistant\" culture, and Bloomberg recently suggested Haiti is \" ungovernable ,\" without once mentioning the outsized debt that bankrupted the country in its early days  and left it vulnerable and boneless in the world. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2014 brushed off Caribbean demands for reparations as \"not the answer,\" claiming those nations and the U.K. should instead \"focus on the shared global challenges that face our countries in the twenty-first century\"-which read a lot like an effort to untether the future from a past in which the colonizers profited steeply off the colonized.\n\nReparations for Black slavery were paid and popular when they gave yet more currency to white global supremacy and power. The idea of slavery reparations only become controversial when the proposed recipients were the actual Black folks who were enslaved and their descendants.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Katt Williams Takes on Reparations and Hunter Biden in Live Netflix Special\n\nINGLEWOOD, California-Given a live global platform Saturday night by Netflix , Katt Williams closed out an electric hour of comedy punctuated by multiple audio/visual cues with a call for the United States to pay out reparations for enslaving generations of Black Americans, and citing our eager willingness to fund other nations such as Ukraine right now as proof of concept.\n\n\"It is now time for Black people in America to get paid reparations for everything that them and their ancestors have been through in American history,\" Williams declared in front of 6,000 in attendance at YouTube Theater in Inglewood, California, plus upward of millions more watching live on Netflix. \"Why now, Katt? Thanks for asking, white friends. I'll tell you why now. And understand white friends, I don't speak for all Black people. But I do speak for all n-rs. And you are not supposed to know the difference.\"\n\nWilliams continued: \"The time is now. And understand, white friends. I know you're thinking, no seriously, Katt, why now? I'll tell you why. And these are the facts. We just gave $100 billion to the Ukraine. And God bless the Ukrainians. But off the record? We don't know them n--rs like that! You could've gave that money to Black people. The fuck? We done gave them all that money. The truth is they over there getting their ass whooped over there. You coulda gave that money to the Black people of Los Angeles, and they'd have went over there and whooped their ass in two weeks. Look. It looks like reparations is for Black people. But it's not. It's for you, white friend. It's for you. It's going to help us, but it's for you. Sure, every Black person going to wake up with $20 million in the bank. So the fuck what? It's for you, white friends. You think American been great before? Wait til we got a country full of rich n-rs. This fitting to be the greatest country in the world, bitch!\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe comedian also hoped to persuade more conservative white Americans to support reparations by appealing to their baser instincts.\n\n\"White friend, don't you want to get slavery behind you? You never had a slave in your motherfucking life. Get this past you. You pay them reparations, racism is dead. Get it past you, white friends,\" Williams concluded. \"Here's what they won't tell you, white friends. You pay them reparations, you can say n-r any time you want to, do you hear me?\"\n\nKatt Williams: Woke Foke , just the second stand-up special streamed live globally by Netflix after last year's Chris Rock: Selective Outrage , was one of the centerpiece events of the second-ever Netflix Is a Joke Fest, happening through the first 12 days and nights of May across Los Angeles. Williams had several comedians warm up the audience in the two hours leading up to livestream, and he opened by expressing his gratitude at how far he'd come since his early years. \"It was '99 and the 2000s and I was in this Inglewood at the Hollywood Park Casino for $100 a week, and God brought me 24 Kobe years later, bam ! Live. Right here in motherfucking Inglewood. God really is the greatest.\"\n\nPart of what drew Netflix to picking Williams for their next live special was his three-hour performance on retired footballer Shannon Sharpe's Club Shay Shay podcast, which has racked up more than 68 million views since premiering Jan. 3 on YouTube. The comedian made sure to shout that out early in his hour, too: \"I tried to be incog-Negro but thanks to Shannon Sharpe's loudmouth ass, the gig is up. Everybody knows I'll tell. But I don't do no snitching! Y'all know my job. In my spare time I infiltrate the Illuminati. Look for their secrets. Run back. Tell y'all. And they'd kill me if they could, but I'm too fast, and the Lord keep blessing me.\"\n\nAlthough Williams did name-check many entertainers and politicians in the hour-among them, Nick Cannon, Robert De Niro, Jamie Foxx, Da Brat, Trick Daddy, Tory Lanez, Lizzo, Sharon Osbourne, P. Diddy, Wayne Brady, Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis-none of it rose to quite the same salacious level as the fires he stoked in January.\n\nFor example, lampooning the FBI's non-investigation into a bag of cocaine found inside the White House, Williams showed a giant photo of a baggie labeled \"Hunter's Blow\" to suggest the true culprit, then added: \"Hunter on crack. Joe asleep. The only person really working at the White house behind the scenes is Joe Biden's German Shepherd named Commander.\" He then showed a photo of the president with his pooch, while joking about how many Secret Service agents Commander Biden had bitten.\n\nAnd while Williams did take a crack at the trend of celebrities abusing Ozempic to lose weight, his zinger that \"They said Oprah took so much that Gayle lost 12 pounds\" had nowhere near as much sting as Mo'Nique's almost 20 minutes of barbs had for Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King , none of which were broadcast or streamed outside of the venue.\n\n\"I'm too god damn old to be scared of these motherfuckers!\" Mo'Nique exclaimed after calling out both Winfrey and Tyler Perry, reigniting her feud with both of them that had dated back to her work with them on her Oscar-winning portrayal in the 2009 film, Precious . \"And people keep saying: 'Mo'Nique, why do you keep fucking with Oprah Winfrey?' Because she fucked with me. That bitch rung my doorbell. I didn't ring her motherfucking doorbell. That raggedy stank-ass bitch rang my motherfucking doorbell, and I answered that bitch.\"\n\nMo'Nique performs at \"Katt Williams: Woke Foke\" for Netflix is a Joke Festival.\n\nMo'Nique went on to describe Winfrey as a woman who \"crossed the goddamn track to Whiteville\" who needs \"a good piece of Black dick\" to be brought back to her racial senses. After asking for potential volunteers from the audience, Mo'Nique clarified, \"now if you fuck Oprah you must fuck Gayle. It's a package.\" But mentioning King only served to launch the comedian into a rant alleging that King smells, hoping audiences would \"hashtag that\" as \"#StaleGayleWashYourTail.\"\n\n\"And you're looking at me, like, Mo'Nique, that is mean. No bitch, it is the motherfucking truth, and I will say it out loud so she will wash her ass moving forward and don't nobody else have to experience that stinky shit. Y'all heard Snoop Doog. Funky dog head bitch!\"\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Steve Bannon Escalates MAGA Civil War With Call for 'Reparations' Over H-1B Visas\n\nMedia Reporter\n\nSteve Bannon escalated the MAGA civil war Monday by calling for 'reparations' for Americans for losing out to immigrants on H-1B visas-who should themselves, he said, be deported.\n\nBannon repeatedly railed against the program-and billionaire Elon Musk, who backs the visas-on Monday's War Room, asking guests including conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer and former-Democrat-turned-MAGA-backer Allison Huynh whether Musk understood the visas were a \" scam .\"\n\nH-1B visas, which allow U.S. companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers for specialty jobs, were signed into law as part of the Immigration Act of 1990 by President George H.W. Bush, a Republican. President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he supported the program.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut they have become a lightning rod for the anti-immigration wing of MAGA, who claim they allow employers, especially tech companies, to import cheap labor wholesale and undercut American workers. Bannon this weekend used the issue to attack both Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who until now had been MAGA heroes for their \"department of government efficiency.\" Musk attempted to calm the war on Sunday, saying the program should be reformed.\n\nThe MAGA civil war continues🍿 Steve Bannon refers to Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and David Sacks as \"sociopathic overlords in Silicon Valley\" pic.twitter.com/fyb1D4XayE\n\nBut far from taking a laurel branch from the world's richest man, Bannon stepped up his rhetoric on Monday's show and argued that all H1-B immigrants should be expelled as part of Trump's mass deportation plans.\n\n\"The workers that are here on H-1B visas should be deported at the same time we're deporting the 15 million illegal aliens Biden brought across the border to suppress wages to low-income workers,\" Bannon said. \"American workers should be hired immediately to fill those gaps, and then we should start the discussions on reparations, on what they knowingly did to American tech workers.\"\n\nReparations for descendants of those forced into slavery have been frequently discussed in recent years in the U.S.-and opposed by Republicans particularly-but calls for 'reparations' for U.S. citizens who have allegedly lost out to legal immigrants are new.\n\nBannon and Loomer aimed much of their fire at Musk, a prominent Trump backer during the campaign who spent hundreds of millions of dollars to boost his reelection. Musk strongly backed the visas last week after Loomer criticized an incoming Trump appointee, launching a tit-for-tat with conservatives over the issue and telling one to \"f--- yourself\" over their opposition. Loomer, who Musk said was \"trolling for attention,\" claimed she was suspended from X for 12 hours and her account was demonetized over her stance on the issue and criticism of Musk.\n\n\"Why is [Musk] afraid of Laura Loomer?\" Bannon asked on Monday.\n\n\"I think that a lot of people have a hard time speaking truth to power and are afraid of taking on billionaires,\" Loomer said. She claimed that Trump's advisers are hesitant to criticize Musk because they're \"dependent\" on monetization checks from the platform.\n\n\"They realize that their input to President Trump is being overshadowed by the richest man in the world who has these ulterior motives,\" Loomer said. \"Does he really support MAGA and the America First agenda or is he trying to push this neo-reactionary political movement so we can establish a monarchy and have multi-polarity?\"\n\nBannon had previously hailed Musk for supporting Trump throughout the 2024 election and said on Monday he wasn't singling him out, but he said that wealthy types like Musk and David Sacks \"are just coming to the party.\"\n\n\"They've got their own set of beliefs and their own set of economics,\" Bannon said. \"That's not MAGA economics, that's not America First economics, and it's certainly not American systems first.\"\n\nMedia Reporter\n\ncorbin.bolies@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

While some of this is being done by city and state commissions tasked with studying reparations, others are attempting to address systemic racism at the local and personal level, as detailed in the film. \"It's pretty incredible, the pace in which we see reparations moving,\" says filmmaker Yoruba Richen, who is hopeful that this work will eventually push the federal government into action. We also hear from Lotte Lieb Dula, a descendant of an enslaver in the Mississippi Delta, and Randy Quarterman, whose ancestor Zeike Quarterman was held in bondage, about how they are addressing the legacy of slavery in their personal lives.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nWe look now at the growing movement in support of reparations in the United States for Black descendants of people who were enslaved. The state of New York recently joined California to establish a commission to study reparations and racial justice. More work is being done at the local and personal level, which is the focus of a new documentary premiering this week on PBS , The Cost of Inheritance , an America ReFramed special. This is the trailer.\n\nLOTTE LIEB DULA : Cornelius, age 8, $500.\n\nNARRATOR : A discovery brings strangers together.\n\nSARAH EISNER : Seeing those names, it humanized it for me.\n\nRANDY QUARTERMAN : Every time I say I'm the fifth generation of Zeike Quarterman, an enslaved man, part of me dies.\n\nNARRATOR : On a journey across the years.\n\nPATT GUNN : Field Article No. 15: 40 acres, a mule and $200. Abraham Lincoln is assassinated. The enslaved got nothing.\n\nSHAWN ROCHESTER : Congress passes the Homestead Act, Social Security, the GI Bill, the FHA .\n\nREV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Now, when we come to Washington, we are coming to get our check.\n\nGEORGE FLOYD : Mom, I love you. I can't breathe!\n\nNARRATOR : Connected by a common cause.\n\nLOTTE LIEB DULA : Harm happens locally, so repair has to happen locally. Do the work. Look at your own history. What was your family's role?\n\nNARRATOR : Seeking justice and peace.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we're joined by some of the people featured in The Cost of Inheritance . In Savannah, Georgia, Randy Quarterman is a fifth-generation descendant of Zeike Quarterman, who was enslaved by George Adam Keller. Randy co-founded The Reparation Project alongside Sarah Eisner, a fifth-generation descendant of Keller. In Denver, Lotte Lieb Dula is with us, a descendant of William Hayes Paxton, who was an enslaver in the Mississippi Delta. She's with Reparations for Slavery. And in New York, we're joined by Yoruba Richen, the award-winning director of this documentary.\n\nYoruba, before we play some clips, yes, let's start with you. Talk about this movement for reparations, that's hardly hitting the corporate media radar but is happening all over the country, both at state level, city level and personally, like the ones you document in this film.\n\nYORUBA RICHEN : Absolutely. Good morning, Amy. Thank you for having us.\n\nIt's pretty incredible, the pace in which we see reparations moving, everything from studying state commissions, like the one New York just passed - we're actually now the third state; Illinois has one, as well - to cities all across the country who are looking into how to move forward on reparations for descendants of enslaved folks, and these personal stories. You know, as we were making this film over the past two years - past three years, we could hardly keep up with all of the different things we were hearing about, and even since the film has been completed. So, it's a far cry from where we have come. I mean, I remember, you know, growing up in the '80s. You talk about reparations, you were considered fringe. You were considered, you know, a crazy person.\n\nSo, you know, this movement has been ongoing, as the film shows. Since the end of slavery, Black people have been fighting for reparations, and it continues to be a long struggle. But what we show in The Cost of Inheritance is that there is - that it's actually happening, and it's happening on a personal level and on these local levels, which will hopefully give rise to and more momentum for it to happen on a federal level.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Randy Quarterman, your family is linked to Sarah Eisner's family through slavery. You're a fifth-generation descendant of someone who was enslaved by George Adam Keller. After she contacted you, you founded The Reparations Project to save the Quartermans' family lands in Monteith and Port Wentworth, Georgia, after it faced various legal challenges. Could you talk about the relationship you formed with Sarah?\n\nRANDY QUARTERMAN : Yes. Good morning.\n\nThe relationship I formed with Sarah was an eye-opening one for me, being born in Japan and raised in Japan 'til I was 13 and then coming here, not knowing anything about my Black history or anything like that, to learn about our heirs' property and an acre of it being taken by eminent domain, and also learning about the 90% of land - Black land loss that happened in the South itself. So, Sarah opened that door for me to really engage and really understand the history of my African American people, my Black people, and also understanding the dynamics of my own family that was lost.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, I want to go to a clip from The Cost of Inheritance that features you, Randy, as well as the woman who contacted you, Sarah Eisner.\n\nSARAH EISNER : In 2019, I was speaking with my cousin Bill, who lives in the Savannah area. Bill said, \"The Quarterman family still own this plot of 10 acres of land that George Adam Keller gave Zeike Quarterman in the 1800s.\"\n\nROY QUARTERMAN : When we found out the land was given to Zeike, he came alive again to us.\n\nPASTOR : If you got anything on your heart right now, this is the time. Hallelujah!\n\nRANDY QUARTERMAN : August 2019, I had an email from Sarah acknowledging who her family was and if I was a descendant of Zeike Quarterman, who was enslaved by George Adam Keller. I was just, like, taken off track a little bit.\n\nSARAH EISNER : I was definitely nervous and scared.\n\nRANDY QUARTERMAN : My question was: What are they doing here? What's going on?\n\nSARAH EISNER : I remember thinking, \"What have I done? What if they yell at me?\" If they do, they do. They have every right to be angry.\n\nRANDY QUARTERMAN : I consulted with Patt Gunn, somebody that was doing this type of work and understanding it.\n\nPATT GUNN : And so you're standing in a sacred ground. This is a slave-holding bin, we believe.\n\nRANDY QUARTERMAN : She told me, said, \"Hey, you know, your ancestors is on your back. It's a special moment for you. You need to engage.\"\n\nSee, like, one -\n\nSARAH EISNER : Yeah.\n\nRANDY QUARTERMAN : - two, three, four. And it's staggered into corners, like where a house would be right here.\n\nFor me and my family, we know this is heirs' property, land that's passed down through family generations that has no will to say this person owns the land.\n\nIt should have been Zeike's house. This probably, there was a house structure that was - they lived at.\n\nBut the land is not in our possession. A court-appointed lawyer became the executor of our property.\n\nSee, it's like old bricks from back then.\n\nAnd then Sarah was like, \"Hey, I really want to get you some help to try to clear this title.\"\n\nSARAH EISNER : I thought this is so obviously a case of reparations, because of America's first attempt at reparations right in that area.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And I want to go to another clip from The Cost of Inheritance that features our other guest, Lotte Lieb Dula.\n\nLOTTE LIEB DULA : I've looked at my own family history, and I've documented three different governors that were likely involved in creating the laws of slavery. When I found out that Briayna had studied political science, that whole area, I thought, \"Well, that matches the harm that I need to unwind.\"\n\nFor white people, one of the most important things to know is this is not a gift. I am repaying a debt.\n\nBRIAYNA CUFFIE : I started working with Lotte. I've learned things about my grandmother. I've learned about - a lot about my great-grandparents, down to the personality traits and even some of the ways I stand when I take pictures. It is very creepy to see someone, you know, who's born in the 1870s have the same pose when she took pictures.\n\nLOTTE LIEB DULA : Bri and I teach a class in reparative genealogy. We really cater to white people who have a family background of enslavement, and we give them an idea of what steps you would take to begin to do repair work. One of the first steps, understand the genesis of the racial wealth gap.\n\nSHAWN ROCHESTER : You've got Black people today in America that own about 2% of U.S. wealth. After all of this time, about 2%. How did we get here?\n\nLOTTE LIEB DULA : The history of my family really shows exactly how it works mechanically.\n\nIt all started with Elisha Paxton, my third great-grandfather. He established a plantation near Lexington, Virginia, beginning around 1815.\n\nAnd with the proceeds likely from the plantation operations, he was able to send many sons to law school, including my second great-grandfather. So, right there, you have the benefit of his education.\n\nIn the early 1830s, several of Elisha's sons, including my second great-grandfather, moved to the Mississippi Delta. There, they set up a law practice and, later, multiple cotton plantations.\n\nREP . SHEILA JACKSON LEE : Cotton became king. Cotton drove the creation of the Wall Street banks and made, really, the economy of the United States. But where did it put African Americans?\n\nSHAWN ROCHESTER : If you go back to 1860, we know there's about 4 million Black people held in bondage. Those people are the most liquid asset in the country - $22 trillion in today's value in terms of the value of those folks to the country. It's an enormous impact. So, the first is what was extracted from those people during that period of time. The second is what was extracted from those people following that time during the Jim Crow era.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That is a clip of The Cost of Inheritance , that's premiering on PBS this week. Lotte Lieb Dula is with us, descendant of William Hayes Paxton, who was an enslaver in the Mississippi Delta, with Reparations for Slavery, a portal for white families walking the path of direct repair. If you can talk about your relationship with Bri Cuffie, who we see in this film, a young Black woman? When she talks about reparations for her, it's repaying student debt. How did you hook up?\n\nLOTTE LIEB DULA : Thank you, Amy. And it's a real honor to be here with you today.\n\nIn early 2018, as you'll see in the documentary, I found some boxes. And within those boxes I found records of my family's records of enslavement on a plantation in Mississippi. And within about 24 hours, I had decided I was going to have to go on a journey of repair. One of the first things I did, looking around to figure out what - where do I go, who do I - I've got to talk to somebody about this, this history, and decide what to do. I discovered a group called Coming to the Table, and they were having a national gathering that summer. And at that national gathering, they were going to be discussing reparations. So I attended.\n\nAnd I noticed immediately, I think, the youngest person at this gathering, that was Briayna Cuffie, and we both ended up attending the reparations session. And I made a bunch of pretty arrogant statements, saying how I wanted, essentially, to change the world and build a portal, and I wanted to know who would partner with me. And there were crickets. And I sort of wandered off a bit dejectedly, and Bri walked up to me and rolled up on me, and she just said, \"You have some pretty mighty ideas there, but you haven't thought about people like me. You're setting up scholarships. You're recommending this and that. What about me? I have six-figure college debt. I'm working three jobs. I'm barely making it. What do you have for me?\" And so, in that moment, I realized not only was this the perfect partner for the portal, but that a path was opening up right in front of my eyes as to a beginning step I could take to engage in direct repair. So, that's how we met. And as you'll see in the film, our relationship unfolds.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Lotte, we only have about a minute, but I'm wondering your response - it's gotten a lot of attention, Nikki Haley's response as the GOP presidential candidate to the causes of the Civil War.\n\nLOTTE LIEB DULA : Oh, I'm disgusted by that comment. Of course we know the cause of the Civil War. It's slavery. In fact, I have in my ancestor's memoir, there's a direct quote, and he says \"I don't know what anybody else is calling this war, but I call it the war for the slaves.\" So, it just goes to show that we really - we are so far apart in how we are looking at our history. We really need to come together. And that's really what we recommend and how our portal works, is we take a very, very fine look at history, and we bring Black and white people together to engage in reparative genealogy and looking at our history together and forming bonds of repair.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Lotte Lieb Dula, we want to thank you for being with us, descendant of an enslaver in the Mississippi Delta, with Reparations for Slavery; Randy Quarterman, fifth-generation descendant of Zeike Quarterman, enslaved by George Adam Keller. Randy co-founded The Reparation Project along with Sarah Eisner. And we want to thank Yoruba Richen, the director of The Cost of Inheritance , an America ReFramed special.

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones, creator of The New York Times's groundbreaking 1619 Project, addressed the U.N. General Assembly. As part of our Juneteenth special, we air her full address. \"It is time for the nations that engaged in and profited from the transatlantic slave trade to do what is right and what is just. It is time for them to make reparations to the descendants of chattel slavery in the Americas,\" Hannah-Jones said. \"This is our global truth, a truth we as human beings understand with stark clarity: There can be no atonement if there is no repair.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nAs we continue our Juneteenth special broadcast, we turn now to Nikole Hannah-Jones, the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist who created The 1619 Project. In March, Nikole Hannah-Jones addressed the United Nations General Assembly as the U.N. marked the International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade.\n\nNIKOLE HANNAH - JONES : Good morning. It is my deepest honor to speak before you today on this day of international remembrance of the victims of the transatlantic slave trade. I have dedicated my life's work to excavating the modern legacy of transatlantic slavery, and so my thoughts are never far from what has become the defining subject of my journalism, and what I believe continues to be the defining undercurrent of life in the Americas: the legacy of slavery.\n\nI stand before you, the great-great-grandchild of enslaved men and women born here in the United States of America, part of the millions who lived and died under the brutal, immoral and inhumane system of chattel slavery that existed for the first 250 years of the land that would come to think of itself as the freest nation in the history of the world.\n\nWe gather here to mark the global trade that took some 15 million beloved human beings across the Atlantic in the hulls of barbaric ships, the largest forced migration in the history of the world, one that would reshape the entire Atlantic world and transform the global economy. We must never forget the scale and the depth of the horrors that people of African descent suffered in the name of profit, profit that enriched the European colonial powers and built the nascent economy of the United States. We must never forget how the systems of slavery collapsed, only to be reborn in other models of violent and racist economic exploitation, such as what we benignly call Jim Crow in the United States, but what is more aptly called apartheid.\n\nBut on this solemn day of remembrance, the looking back cannot be and should not be solely defined by African-descended people's enslavement. Just as defining, just as important to remembering the legacy of the transatlantic slavery are the stories of Black resistance that would, more than any other force, lead to slavery's collapse in our hemisphere.\n\nNo people voluntarily submit to their enslavement. And by obscuring the role of Black resistance in our collective rememberings of the transatlantic slave trade, we continue to do the work of those who sought to justify slavery by stripping us of our collective humanity.\n\nPeople of African descent resisted their enslavement from the moment of their capture. They resisted on the long walk from the interior of Africa to the coast. They resisted in the castles before being dragged out to the waiting ships. They resisted so frequently on the water that slave ships had to be specially designed to try to prevent mutiny. The ocean became the final resting place of thousands of Africans who resisted by choosing a final swim with the ancestors over enslavement in a strange land.\n\nAs we remember our brutal enslavement by people who believed themselves to be civilized, even as they tortured, abused and murdered other human beings for profit, for sugar for their tea, for molasses for their rum, for cotton to wear and for tobacco to smoke, we must remember most the fierce Black radical tradition of resistance, that did not begin with anti-colonialism efforts on the continent or with civil rights movements in the United States and other places, but with, as the scholar Cedric Robinson argued, the Cimarrones of Mexico, who ran away to Indigenous communities or formed their own fugitive communities known as palenques . We must remember Yanga, who led a community of fugitive Africans and fought the Spaniards so fiercely that they won their status as a free Black settlement.\n\nWe must remember Brazil's quilombolas , including Palmares, a fugitive Black community that would endure for 90 years in the Portuguese colony, that would import more Africans into slavery than anywhere else in the Atlantic world.\n\nWe must remember the Maroons of British and French Guiana, Cuba and the United States, and the \"Bush Negroes\" of Suriname, who fought against their oppressors for five decades attempting - as they were attempting to reenslave them.\n\nWe must remember the revolts of enslaved people in Jamaica in 1690, in New York City in 1712, Queen Nanny in 1720, the Stono Rebellion in 1739, and Tacky's Rebellion in 1760. We must remember the successful uprising of enslaved people - the most successful uprising of enslaved people in the history of the world, the Haitian Revolution, where enslaved people rose up and defeated three mighty colonial empires, becoming the first nation in the Americas to abolish slavery and establishing the world's first free Black republic - an audacity that the Western world has punished Haiti for ever since.\n\nWe must remember revolts in Barbados in 1816, the Baptist War in Jamaica in 1831 and Nat Turner's Rebellion that same year in the United States, as Black people attempted to make manifest the words of Patrick Henry, the famed American revolutionary, who proclaimed, \"Give me liberty, or give me death!\" - even as he enslaved African human beings for profit. We must remember freedom fighters such as Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass and Gabriel Prosser.\n\nWe must remember that it was not merely the Enlightenment ideas, some reckoning amongst white abolitionists, that brought the end to the system that had enriched colonial powers, but that abolition was propelled by constant revolt that forced colonial powers to realize, as scholar Mary Reckford wrote, it would remain \"more expensive and dangerous to maintain the old system than to abolish it.\" Black people were actors in their own freedom.\n\nObscuring and marginalizing stories of Black resistance serves to justify the hypocrisy of colonial Europe and the United States by insinuating that had slavery been so bad, surely, African peoples would have fought harder against it. These are lies of omission that in the absence of truth warp our collective memory.\n\nResistance, therefore, must be central to any remembrances of the transatlantic slave trade, and must, therefore, be connected to the ongoing resistance movements in the fight for Black liberation across the globe.\n\nI stand here before you today, a recipient of that tradition of resistance.\n\nMy father was born in a little shack in 1945 on a cotton plantation in Greenwood, Mississippi. He was born into a family of sharecroppers, the violently enforced system of labor exploitation that emerged at the end of slavery. He was born into a strictly apartheid state, one where Black people could not vote, could not use the public library, could not attend schools with white children, and were lynched for things such as starting a union, walking into a room where a white woman was alone, failing to get off of the sidewalk fast enough in deference to a white person, or - the greatest crime of all in the American South - having the audacity to be a financially prosperous Black person. In Greenwood in the 1940s, life was so devastating that Black children could be put to the fields as early as the age of 3 to start carrying water to workers. So, when my father was 2 years old, my grandmother, Arlena Paul, a Black woman sharecropper, packed a suitcase and loaded her two young children on a northbound train and escaped the apartheid of the American South.\n\nMy grandmother had a fourth-grade education, and she would spend the rest of her life as a domestic and a janitor. But that single act of resistance, leaving the racial caste system of the American South with nothing but the determination that her own children would not pick cotton like she had, like her parents had, like her enslaved grandparents before her had, set in motion the events that would lead me to stand before this distinguished body today, addressing this most esteemed convening, representing all of the nations of the world. Hers was an act of resistance that mirrored those of millions of enslaved Black people who resisted every day in ways big and small. She, like our ancestors, resisted in order to plant the seed for freedoms and opportunities that she would never see for herself.\n\nAnd it is this history, this understanding, that leads me to argue that the defining story of the African diaspora in the Americas is not slavery, but our resistance to it, of people determined to be free in societies that did not believe they had a right to freedom.\n\nWe must acknowledge this history as the legacy of slavery can be seen all around us. Today the descendants of slavery fight to resist their conditions in the societies that once enslaved them. They suffer the highest rates of poverty, the highest rates of incarceration, the highest rates of death and the highest rates of violence. And the tradition of resistance continues in protests against police violence and inequality from Brazil to Cuba to the United States.\n\nBut we, the people of the African diaspora, should not have to find ourselves still resisting. It is long past time for the European colonial powers, for the United States of America to live up to their own professed ideas, to become the great and moral nations that they believe themselves to be. It is not enough to simply regret what was done in the past; they are obligated to repair it.\n\nAs I stand before representatives of the countries that once enslaved African peoples and the peoples who were once enslaved, as we collectively remember this day, the way for me to honor those who toiled and died and fought is to say this clearly and without flinching: It is time for the nations that engaged in and profited from the transatlantic slave trade to do what is right and what is just.\n\nIt is time for them to make reparations to the descendants of chattel slavery in the Americas. This is our global truth, the truth we as human beings understand with stark clarity: There can be no atonement if there's no repair. It is time - it is long past time - for reparations for the transatlantic slave trade and all the devastation that it has wrought, and all the devastation that it continues to reap.\n\nI thank you very much for your attention as we all remember this crime against humanity together. Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Nikole Hannah-Jones, the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist who created The 1619 Project.\n\nWhen we come back, we look at how Harvard University has revealed the school's extensive ties to slavery.

The hearing coincided with Juneteenth, a day that commemorates June 19, 1865, when slaves in Galveston, Texas, finally learned that the Emancipation Proclamation had abolished slavery. This year marks the 400th anniversary of the transatlantic slave trade. Lawmakers are considering a bill titled the \"Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act.\" It was introduced by Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, after former Congressmember John Conyers had championed the bill for decades without success. The bill carries the designation H.R. 40, a reference to \"40 acres and a mule,\" one of the nation's first broken promises to newly freed slaves. Ahead of the hearing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, \"I don't think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for whom none of us currently living are responsible, is a good idea.\" Award-winning author Ta-Nehisi Coates and actor Danny Glover testified at the historic congressional hearing on reparations.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We turn now from that famous address in 1852, \"What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?\" to more recent history, the June hearing on reparations for slavery-the first of its kind in over a decade. A House Judiciary subcommittee held the hearing as lawmakers consider a bill titled the \"Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act.\" The bill was introduced by Democratic Congressmember Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, after former Congressmember John Conyers championed it for decades without success. The hearing took place on Juneteenth, the day that commemorates June 19th, 1865, when enslaved Africans in Galveston, Texas, finally learned the Emancipation Proclamation had abolished slavery. This year also marks the 400th anniversary of the transatlantic slave trade.\n\nAhead of the hearing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked by Spectrum reporter Eva McKend whether the government should issue a public apology for slavery. This was McConnell's response.\n\nMAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL: I don't think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for whom none of us currently living are responsible, is a good idea. We've, you know, tried to deal with our original sin of slavery by fighting a civil war, by passing landmark civil rights legislation. We've elected an African-American president. I think we're always a work in progress in this country, but no one currently alive was responsible for that. And I don't think we should be trying to figure out how to compensate for it. First of all, it would be pretty hard to figure out who to compensate. We've had waves of immigrants, as well, who have come to the country and experienced dramatic discrimination of one kind or another. So, no, I don't think reparations are a good idea.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Well, award-winning author Ta-Nehisi Coates testified at the historic congressional reparations hearing and took direct aim at McConnell's response.\n\nTA- NEHISI COATES : Yesterday, when asked about reparations, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered a familiar reply: America should not be held liable for something that happened 150 years ago, since none of us currently alive are responsible.\n\nThis rebuttal proffers a strange theory of governance, that American accounts are somehow bound by the lifetime of its generations. But well into this century, the United States was still paying out pensions to the heirs of Civil War soldiers. We honor treaties that date back some 200 years, despite no one being alive who signed those treaties. Many of us would love to be taxed for the things we are solely and individually responsible for. But we are American citizens, and thus bound to a collective enterprise that extends beyond our individual and personal reach. It would seem ridiculous to dispute invocations of the Founders, or the Greatest Generation, on the basis of a lack of membership in either group. We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance. And the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance.\n\nIt is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery. As historian Ed Baptist has written, enslavement, quote, \"shaped every crucial aspect of the economy and politics\" of America, so that by 1836 more than $600 million, or almost half of the economic activity in the United States, derived directly or indirectly from the cotton produced by the million-odd slaves. By the time the enslaved were emancipated, they comprised the largest single asset in America-$3 billion in 1860 dollars, more than all the other assets in the country combined.\n\nThe method of cultivating this asset was neither gentle cajoling nor persuasion, but torture, rape and child trafficking. Enslavement reigned for 250 years on these shores. When it ended, this country could have extended its hallowed principles-life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness-to all, regardless of color. But America had other principles in mind. And so, for a century after the Civil War, black people were subjected to a relentless campaign of terror, a campaign that extended well into the lifetime of Majority Leader McConnell.\n\nIt is tempting to divorce this modern campaign of terror, of plunder, from enslavement. But the logic of enslavement, of white supremacy, respects no such borders, and the god of bondage was lustful and begat many heirs-coup d'états and convict leasing. vagrancy laws and debt peonage, redlining and racist GI bills, poll taxes and state-sponsored terrorism.\n\nWe grant that Mr. McConnell was not alive for Appomattox. But he was alive for the electrocution of George Stinney. He was alive for the blinding of Isaac Woodard. He was alive to witness kleptocracy in his native Alabama and a regime premised on electoral theft. Majority Leader McConnell cited civil rights legislation yesterday, as well he should, because he was alive to witness the harassment, jailing and betrayal of those responsible for that legislation by a government sworn to protect them. He was alive for the redlining of Chicago and the looting of black homeowners of some $4 billion. Victims of that plunder are very much alive today. I am sure they'd love a word with the majority leader.\n\nWhat they know, what this committee must know, is that while emancipation dead-bolted the door against the bandits of America, Jim Crow wedged the windows wide open. And that is the thing about Senator McConnell's \"something.\" It was 150 years ago. And it was right now.\n\nThe typical black family in this country has one-tenth the wealth of the typical white family. Black women die in childbirth at four times the rate of white women. And there is, of course, the shame of this land of the free boasting the largest prison population on the planet, of which the descendants of the enslaved make up the largest share.\n\nThe matter of reparations is one of making amends and direct redress, but it is also a question of citizenship. In H.R. 40, this body has a chance to both make good on its 2009 apology for enslavement and reject fair-weather patriotism, to say that a nation is both its credits and its debits, that if Thomas Jefferson matters, so does Sally Hemings, that if D-Day matters, so does Black Wall Street, that if Valley Forge matters, so does Fort Pillow, because the question really is not whether we will be tied to the somethings of our past, but whether we are courageous enough to be tied to the whole of them. Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was award-winning author Ta-Nehisi Coates testifying before a House Judiciary subcommittee in June. His seminal 2014 essay , \"The Case for Reparations,\" helped spur new calls to make amends for slavery. He'll join us in a minute. But first, actor and civil rights activist Danny Glover also testified at the hearing.\n\nDANNY GLOVER : Thank you, Mr. Coates. It's not often that you hear the words of a young man and they enliven your emotional memory, your historic memory, as he just did at this moment. Thank you so much.\n\nI am deeply honored to be here today offering my testimony at this historic meeting about the reckoning of a crime against humanity that is foundational to the development of democracy and material well-being in this country. A national reparations policy is a moral, democratic and economic imperative.\n\nI sit here as the great-grandson of a former slave, Mary Brown, who was freed by the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1st, 1863. I had the fortune of meeting her as a small child. I also sit here as the grandson of Reese Mae Hunley and Rufus Mack Hunley, my maternal grandparents, who were both born before Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decision in 1896. And for a significant portion of their lives, they worked as sharecroppers and tenant farmers in rural Georgia, until they were able to save enough money to purchase a small farm. They were subsistence farmers.\n\nDespite much progress over the centuries, this hearing is yet another important step in the long and heroic struggle of African Americans to secure reparations for the damages inflicted by enslavement and post-emancipation and racial exclusionary policies. Many of the organizations who are present today at this hearing are amongst the historical contributors to the present national discourse, congressional deliberations and Democratic Party presidential campaign policy discussions about reparations. We are also indebted to the work of Congressman John Conyers for shepherding this legislation.\n\nThe adoption of H.R. 40 can be a signature legislative achievement, especially within the context of the United Nations International Decade of People of African Descent. We should also note that the Common Market nations and the Caribbean Community-CARICOM-Reparations Commission, chaired by professor Sir Hilary Beckles, who is here with us today, has exercised a leadership role from which we, as a nation, can benefit.\n\nA sustained, direct, effective policy, actions in full collaboration with African Americans and progressive citizens, allies, is the ultimate proof of the sincerity of our national commitment to repair the damages of the legally and often religiously sanctioned inhumanity of slavery, segregation and current structural racism that limits full democratic participation and material advancement of African Americans and of our country's progress as a beacon of justice and equality. ...\n\nI close-excuse me-with the insightful and still relevant words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. And I quote: \"Why is the issue of equality still so far from solution in America, a nation which professes itself to be democratic, inventive, hospitable to new ideas, rich, productive and awesomely powerful? ... Justice for black people will not flow into society merely from court decisions nor from fountains of political oratory. Nor will a few token changes quell all the tempestuous yearnings of millions of disadvantaged black people. White America must recognize justice for black people cannot be achieved without radical changes in the structure of our society. The comfortable, the entrenched, the privileged cannot continue to tremble at the prospect of change in the status quo.\" Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Danny Glover. Economist Julianne Malveaux also spoke.\n\nJULIANNE MALVEAUX : The journalist Ida B. Wells said that lynching was the first example of white supremacy because it was a tool of terrorism. It dampened the ability of African-American people to participate in the vibrant entrepreneurship of the late 19th and early 20th century, with a chilling message that our economic success could be punished by the rope.\n\nThe economic damage to black people post-Reconstruction can be summarized in three ways. Number one, we were denied the ability to participate in our nation's economic growth. The Homestead Act of 1862 did not include formerly enslaved people. More than 10% of the continental U.S. land was distributed to recent immigrants from Europe, but not black folks. So the 40 acres and a mule was given to somebody else, not us. These folks were able not only to get land, but then to get grants from the federal government to develop their land. Meanwhile, African-American people were denied the right to these wealth transfers.\n\nSecondly, we were denied the right to accumulate. The attached-the paper that I mentioned talks about how our accumulation was essentially stymied by lynching. The first lynching that Ida B. Wells examined was one when a black man had the nerve, the utter nerve, to open up a grocery store near a white man's store. So the white man had the brother lynched, had three people lynched because of economic envy. Listen to those words: \"economic envy.\" This is how black people have been suppressed in their ability to accumulate. Tulsa, Oklahoma; Wilmington, North Carolina-long stories that I don't have any time to talk about them, but I want y'all to look at the paper that I submitted and to think about the many ways that black people who tried to participate, tried to encourage, tried to be American, simply tried to be economic actors, were suppressed, because they had the nerve to think it worked. So, my brothers over here who say \"their American dream,\" it's some people's American nightmare. Let's just be clear.\n\nNow, number three is public policy hostility. There was public policy hostility to black people. GI Bill legislation truncated opportunities for African-American veterans. Federal Housing Administration reinforced redlining and segregation as an official policy of the federal government. People talk about racists as if they're individuals. Yes, sir. But the fact is, they're not individuals; they are individuals who are buttressed by the federal government and legislation.\n\nSo let me simply say, H.R. 40 is important. NAARC has developed a 10-point plan. But more importantly, as you, my brothers and sisters on this Congress, go forward, may there be a racial justice audit of any new legislation that has economic implications. Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was economist Julianne Malveaux. When we come back, award-winning author Ta-Nehisi Coates joins me and Democracy Now!

We speak with historians Westenley Alcenat and Gerald Horne on the story of Haiti's finances and how Haitian demands for reparations have been repeatedly shut down. Alcenat says the series \"exposes the rest of the world to a knowledge that actually has existed for over a hundred years,\" and while he welcomes the series, he demands The New York Times apologize for publishing racist Haitian stereotypes in 2010 by columnist David Brooks. Horne also requests The New York Times make the revelatory documents that the series cites accessible to other historians. He says the series will \"hopefully cause us to reexamine the history of this country and move away from the propaganda point that somehow the United States was an abolitionist republic when actually it was the foremost slaveholder's republic.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"The Ransom.\" That's the name of a major series of articles published by The New York Times detailing how Haiti became one of the poorest countries in the world, while bankers in France and the United States made a fortune.\n\nThe story dates back to the early 19th century. In 1804, the enslaved people of Haiti rose up, leading a rebellion against French colonial rule, founding the world's first Black republic. Under military threat from France in 1825, Haiti agreed to pay reparations to France for lost so-called property, including enslaved people, that French owners lost in the rebellion. France threatened to invade and reimpose slavery if Haiti did not agree to a staggering amount in reparations: 150 million francs - 30 times Haiti's annual revenue. Haiti began taking out loans from French banks, leading to an economic crisis that continues through to this day. The New York Times estimates Haiti paid the equivalent of what's now $560 million to France over the next seven decades. The true economic cost to Haiti is estimated to be an astounding $115 billion. And that only tells a part of the story.\n\nIn 1880, a French bank established Haiti's first national bank, essentially putting France in control of Haiti's treasury. That bank, Crédit Industriel et Commercial, used some of its massive profits to help finance the Eiffel Tower. The bank's current owner has just launched an investigation into its dealings with Haiti and its role in what's called the ecosystem of colonialism - that bank, CIC .\n\nThe Times series also looks at the U.S. military occupation of Haiti that lasted from 1915 to 1934. A key backer of the U.S. occupation was the National City Bank of New York, the predecessor of Citibank. Former U.S. diplomat Patrick Gaspard, who now heads the Center for American Progress, has called on Citigroup to pay reparations to Haiti. Gaspard wrote on Twitter, \"A silent scream has been in throats for decades about the role U.S. played in depleting Haiti. No one would listen. Finally some truths,\" he said.\n\nOver the years, Haitian demands for reparations have been repeatedly shut down - sometimes with force. France's former ambassador to Haiti, Thierry Burkhard, admitted to The New York Times that France and the United States effectively orchestrated the 2004 coup that ousted Haiti's first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Burkhard said one benefit of the coup was that it ended Aristide's campaign demanding France pay financial reparations to Haiti.\n\nTo talk more about Haiti and the devastating impact of colonialism and this massive series in The New York Times , we're joined by two guests. Westenley Alcenat is a Haitian American professor at Fordham University, where he teaches courses on the Atlantic slave trade, the American abolition movement and Afro-Caribbean history. Gerald Horne also joins us. He's professor of history and African American studies at the University of Houston, author of many books, including Confronting Black Jacobins: The U.S., the Haitian Revolution, and the Origins of the Dominican Republic .\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Professor Alcenat, let's begin with you. So, this series has come out in The New York Times to both criticism and praise. It's come out in both Creole and in English. That's a first for The New York Times . Can you explain the significance of what many are calling revelations - at least, to the general public - but certainly people in Haiti have been alleging for centuries, not only alleging but, of course, having proof of this?\n\nWESTENLEY ALCENAT : Yes. Thank you, Amy. Thank you for having me today. I'm glad to be here in conversation with you.\n\nSo, first, let me start by saying that - a great acknowledgment to the many reporters and producers who put this very special issue together and to have given it a front-time exposure. And it will mean a lot - not really for Haitians per se , because the facts that are being revealed throughout the report are very well known even to the most illiterate Haitian and even to the youngest Haitian growing up. In fact, given the level of underdevelopment that is prevalent in Haiti today, one knows - at least the Haitian people know - that this could have only been the legacy of an external force, rather of their own making.\n\nSo, I think the significance of the piece will be that it exposes the rest of the world to a knowledge that actually has existed for over a hundred years and shares multiple partners, both in the private sector with regards to the financial industry, as well as United States government, Germany, Great Britain and, most certainly and most influential, France, having played a role in imposing the debt that in many ways will explain Haiti's poverty today.\n\nSo, I welcome the piece. I think it's great in terms of the many research that it brought together both from academic literature that had already existed, as well as new revelations that are coming up. But in terms of calling it \"revelations,\" that would be a misnomer. I myself have written very extensively on the subject. Many other fellow academics, historians have written about it. There have been movements over the decades to get the United States, France and the other parties responsible for this, to get them to some accountability. And I believe a large reason why this never got the fair sort of ear of listening that it should have gotten is because it's coming from Haitians, whom many people view as sort of the Africans of the Western Hemisphere, but which is an identity that Haitians pridely wear - wear proudly, for reasons that reasonably make sense in terms of the freedom that they fought and established for all Black people.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, I'd like to bring in professor Gerald Horne to the conversation, another historian who has covered the issue of colonialism, imperialism and slavery throughout the Americas for decades. I, too, had the same feeling that a lot of this is only new to people who haven't paid attention to the history of the Western Hemisphere over the last several hundred years. I'm wondering your reaction to the piece, because the Times really is delving into history much more than news. I think the most interesting aspect of it was the particular individuals in France and the institutions that directly benefited from the ransom that Haiti was forced to pay, but, largely, this is history that is known by people who know any part of the history of Latin America and of the Western Hemisphere. So I'm wondering your reaction to the piece as a historian who's studied this carefully?\n\nGERALD HORNE : Well, first of all, I would urge and encourage The New York Times to follow through with their point that they have uncovered new documents, by putting these documents online so that other historians can take advantage of their excavations and/or, secondly, placing them at The New York Times archive, which I believe has been sited at the New York Public Library.\n\nBut I think that the story also is of significance and of moment for us in the United States, for we in the United States, because there has been this myth that has been created that the United States and the Haitian Revolution were twins, even though we know, as I begin my book on the Haitian Revolution, George Washington, the Founding Father of this country, was quite nervous about the eruption in Haiti in August 1791. And this was understandable, because the Haitian Revolution, culminating in 1804, led to a general crisis of the entire slave system in the Americas that could only be resolved with its collapse. Therefore, the United States was probably second to France in being an antagonist of the Haitian people. From their point of view, this was a reaction to the fact that many of the slave revolts in the United States had Haitian fingerprints all over them. I'm speaking of Gabriel's revolt in Virginia in 1800, the revolt in Louisiana circa 1811, Denmark Vesey about a decade later in South Carolina. In fact, Vesey had sailed in and out of Haiti before that eruption in Charleston, South Carolina. And then, culminating this hostility to Haiti, there is substantial evidence to suggest that when the island, the island that we refer to as Hispaniola, was split in 1844 with the secession from Haiti of what became the Dominican Republic, that this was an early success for U.S. covert operations.\n\nSo, this story in The New York Times is of significance for we in the United States. Hopefully, it will cause us to reexamine the history of this country and move away from the propaganda point that somehow the United States was an abolitionist republic, when actually it was the foremost slaveholders' republic.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I'm wondering also if it wouldn't have been worthwhile for The New York Times to do another piece on its own coverage of Haiti over the past hundred years or so. I'm thinking back, for instance, during the first coup against President Aristide, when there were numerous articles in The New York Times about how Aristide was considered to be mentally unstable and erratic in his behavior, all of it fed to it by intelligence sources, and even the Times 's coverage perhaps of the U.S. occupation, that long occupation in the early 20th century. The Times seems to be willing to go after France and the U.S., but really doesn't look at its own role in creating the narrative of Haiti as a dysfunctional country. I'm wondering what you think about that, Gerald.\n\nGERALD HORNE : Well, you're absolutely correct. Obviously, criticism should be accompanied by self-criticism, and there is much work to be done in that sphere by The New York Times . You mentioned the occupation, 1915 to 1934. The United States did not - excuse me, The New York Times did not necessarily stress and emphasize in their coverage the mass opposition to the U.S. occupation, particularly by Black Americans, particularly by a founder of the NAACP , speaking of W.E.B. Du Bois, who, as you know, his ancestral roots were in fact on the island. And he led a vigorous campaign against this murderous and bloodthirsty occupation, that in some ways involved the reassertion of unpaid labor, the so-called corvée, as it was called euphemistically, in Haiti. And The New York Times would do well to reexamine its own coverage, because hopefully that would improve today's coverage.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to go back to 2004. Juan just referred to this. France's former ambassador to Haiti has admitted France and the United States effectively orchestrated the 2004 coup that overthrew Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president. The former French ambassador, Thierry Burkhard, told The New York Times one benefit of the coup was that it ended Aristide's campaign demanding France pay reparations to Haiti. I want to turn to an interview we did with Kim Ives of Haïti Liberté . This was right after President Aristide was put on a plane and sent to the Central African Republic. This was what Kim Ives described.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is a U.S.-French-led operation. In fact, didn't Aristide say he holds the French ambassador to Haiti, as well, responsible for his kidnapping and wants to bring charges?\n\nKIM IVES : Yes, the French were involved in all this pressure and, in fact, were in some ways leading the charge. ... This was a purely U.S.-French operation.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, of course, France, probably more than the United States, had more to lose from Aristide continuing in the presidency, since he was beginning to lay claim to reparations from France -\n\nKIM IVES : Right.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: - for the period of colonialism and slavery.\n\nKIM IVES : Well, this is precisely it. You had the restitution for $21.7 billion, which was on the table, and we saw a lot of rivalries were put aside to get Aristide out, between the ruling groups in Haiti of the comprador bourgeoisie and the big landowners, who generally are constantly squabbling throughout Haitian history for power. They put aside their differences to get together, which we see with Andy Apaid representing the bourgeoisie and Guy Philippe and Jodel Chamblain, more the Macoute wing. And we saw France and the U.S., who have also been sort of vying, put aside their differences. So you saw this union, unity, come between rivals against Aristide, because he represented the people and because he was a representative of popular will in Haiti.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, just to be clear, this is mid-March 2004 that Kim Ives was speaking. Right after that, Democracy Now! , I flew to the Central African Republic on a small plane, covering a group of African American activists and politicians, including Randall Robinson of TransAfrica, as well as Congressmember Maxine Waters, who went to the Central African Republic to retrieve the Aristides and then brought them back to the Western Hemisphere as the U.S. government was saying, \"How dare you bring them to this hemisphere?\" to which Randall Robinson responded, \"Whose hemisphere?\" They eventually brought them to Haiti, and the Aristides then went into exile in South Africa for years, before they eventually went back to Haiti, where they are today. I'd like to get response, starting with Professor Horne and then Professor Alcenat, about the significance of these coups, whether we're talking about Aristide in the early '90s or again in 2004, the coups against them, and what that meant for this country. I mean, no president again would demand reparations.\n\nGERALD HORNE : Well, the reparations question is obviously key. Keep in mind that what makes the United States unique is that the slave owners were expropriated. Their property, in the bodies of enslaved Africans, was taken without compensation. That helped to give rise to the terrorism of the Ku Klux Klan. In Haiti, as we've been discussing, the Haitians were obligated to pay back, believe it or not, the enslavers. And likewise, if you look at the British possessions, so-called - Jamaica, Barbados, etc. - you had London compensate the enslavers, and, by some measures, that total was not paid off until just a few years ago. And so, this question of reparations is quite key.\n\nAnd also quite key is the role of Haiti in helping to ignite this entire process of abolition, leading to capital loss, not least in the United States of America. The enslaving class and their descendants have a very long memory. They have not forgotten Haiti's role. That's why they continued to punish Haiti for having the temerity to rise up against slavery. And even today, they continue to punish Haiti because they see Haiti as a haven for low-wage labor. U.S. baseballs in the U.S. national pastime are largely manufactured by cheap labor in Haiti. So there is still much to sort out with regard to this entire controversy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Professor Alcenat, if you could also respond, right through to today, to the U.S. diplomat Patrick Gaspard, who now runs Center for American Progress, demanding Citibank launch an investigation, and the whole issue of reparations, whether you could see it actually being real, given the devastation of Haiti?\n\nWESTENLEY ALCENAT : OK. Thank you, Amy. I think I want to quickly go back to what was asked with regards to The New York Times . Let me remind our audience that it was in 2010, just days after an earthquake had devastated the country and killed upwards of 200,000 and more people, that The New York Times provided a platform for one of its columnists, David Brooks, to say some of the most racist things that I've ever read in The New York Times about Haiti. So, if we are going to also give The New York Times the credit for what is a phenomenal job about talking on this issue, they should also start by apologizing for what Mr. Brooks had said then, which - let me quote real quick:\n\n\"Haiti, like most of the world's poorest nations, suffers from a complex web of progress-resistant cultural influences. There is the influence of the voodoo religion, which spreads the message that life is capricious and planning futile. There are high levels of social mistrust. Responsibility is often not internalized. Child-rearing practices often involve neglect in the early years and harsh retribution when kids hit 9 or 10.\n\n\"We're all supposed to politely respect each other's cultures. But some cultures are more progress-resistant than others, and a horrible tragedy was just exacerbated by one of them.\"\n\nSo I call on The New York Times to both acknowledge the statements of racist demagoguery on its pages from Mr. David Brooks, as anyone can judge for themselves. They can go back and look at the op-ed and its pseudo-intellectual anthropologizing of Haitians. So, that's one.\n\nAnd with regards to Mr. Gaspard, I believe he actually served in the Obama administration. And most people should know that President Obama, being himself the first Black African American president of the United States, actually never made an official visit to the first Black republic in the world, the very nation without which Mr. Obama would have not assumed the role of leading a society like the United States as he had. So, I would like to know from Mr. Gaspard why is that the administration never actually took the very official position that he is taking right now with regards to Haitian poverty and underdevelopment and the explicit role that the United States, France, Canada and Germany have played in all of that.\n\nAnd then, lastly, I just want to respond to your question with regards to just the immensity of the debt and the destructive legacy it has had for Haiti. The tragedy of all of this is that even once this debt is paid, if it were to ever be paid, which, like Professor Horne, I believe there are parties that are invested in never actually making realizing that possibility - even if that debt were to be paid, we are already talking about decades of gaps in development that were missed in the process because of where the money was going - something like upwards to 80% of all Haitian expenditures up until the early part of the 20th century was going to financing the debt - and the fact that American firms from Wall Street in cahoots with the federal government in terms of the State Department, the Navy. And you have names like General Smedley Butler, who actually wrote about his role as the Marines in Haiti and how he secured the interest of the financial corporate groups, as well as working with the State Department to make sure that Haiti becomes a haven for capitalism, as he said. And also, we can even see FDR , President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, himself had been secretary of the Navy upon the time that Haiti was invaded and becoming a protectorate, essentially, of the United States. And he, too, had professed to actually amending the Haitian Constitution to take out a very revolutionary constitutional clause that had banned white males from owning land in Haiti. Among the first constitutional clauses that the occupation targeted was that, and therefore opened the country up to internal meddling by the international powers.\n\nBut lastly, I just want to also note the fact that with regards to what you had said about the Eiffel Tower, Crédit Industriel, which is now a part of Crédit Agricole, one of the largest banks in the world, I think among the 10th largest banks in the world, having funded the building of the Eiffel Tower, which is now this massive monument to French industrial progress, that was happening at a moment in which the United States, France, Germany and parts of Western Europe were developing rapidly from the capital that they were extracting from many of their former colonies or their current colonies. So, imagine: What would the history of development in Haiti be today, if at the same time that the world is undergoing industrial transformations the likes of which we see today in the form of the Eiffel Tower - what if that money that was taken from Haiti, financing French infrastructure, was financing Haitian infrastructure instead? The fact of the matter is, there is no progress-resistant genes that somehow Haitians are born with. Perhaps someone like David Brooks was born with that, with some progress-resistant gene, as he is unable to fathom that Haitians can take care of themselves. But the truth goes to show where the receipts are in terms of why we know Haiti is in the position that it is today.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I'd like to ask Gerald Horne - the bank aspect of this reporting, which to me is, I think, the most newsworthy, in that the Times actually was able to get a hold, in French archives, of financial arrangements that were made between banking interests in France and Haiti, as well as its uncovering - more deeply uncovering the role of First National City Bank in the early 20th century in Haiti. So, I think that this is some of the best stuff in this report, but it's almost like, \"Hey, New York Times discovers imperialism.\" Isn't the role of Wall Street and European banks in controlling the economies, not just of Haiti but of Honduras, of Nicaragua, of Cuba, of many of these countries in Latin America, part of the operational mold of American imperialism?\n\nGERALD HORNE : Most definitely. And I think that the series, laudable as it has been, could also have made a contribution if it had pointed out the close connections between France and the United States. That is to say, in the 20th century, they began to talk about Citibank and Citicorp and how it was involved in the depredations inflicted upon Haiti, but I think if you were to go back to the Haitian revolutionary period, you would also find similar connections. After all, we know that what became the United States was involved in a revolt against London that would not have succeeded without the assistance of France. We know that there was substantial French migration to [inaudible] States and that Frenchmen were involved in similar depredations in Louisiana and slave owning, for example. We know that when Texas seceded from Mexico in 1836, that Texas's major diplomatic ally on the international front happened to be France. And we also know that when the United States Civil War erupted, 1861 to 1865, it was France that opportunistically chose that moment to try to seize and occupy Mexico, and then extend the lease on life of slavery in Texas and throughout the South by welcoming slave owners from Texas and from Dixie into French-occupied Mexico. And it took a mass revolt by the Mexican people to overturn that particular scheme. So there is much more digging and excavation that needs to be done. And I would like to reiterate my call for The New York Times to open the kimono and to disgorge these documents they say that they have uncovered in France, so that other scholars and other researchers can examine same.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We haven't even talked about the Louisiana Purchase, but we can't in this show. However, I want to end on the crisis that Haitians confront today when they try to come into the United States. I think it was last September the U.S. special envoy to Haiti resigned in protest over the Biden administration's policies. In a letter, the longtime diplomat, U.S. envoy to Haiti Daniel Foote, wrote, \"I will not be associated with the United States' inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees.\" Foote also criticized the Biden administration for meddling in Haiti's political affairs, including its support for Ariel Henry as prime minister following the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse in July. Foote's resignation came just days after U.S. Border Patrol agents on horseback were filmed chasing, grabbing and whipping Haitian asylum seekers who had gathered in that makeshift camp in Del Rio, Texas. We only have a minute, Professor Alcenat, but the issue of Haitian refugees being deported by the thousands back to a devastated Haiti?\n\nWESTENLEY ALCENAT : Well, real quick, I think what you've just demonstrated is that Haiti stands as a singular metaphor for understanding the racial legacy of imperial powers like the United States and France. In fact, as the war in Ukraine is happening, the sheer magnitude of the difference in the treatment of certain refugees because of their European background relative to, say, Haitians, as you just showed in terms of what's happening at the border, that's a very revealing example of what Haiti not only means to the United States, but what it means to the world at large in terms of populations from formerly colonized geographies, as well as Black, Brown and Indigenous people in this country, who knows something about the treatment of racism at the hands of the U.S. government. So, in many ways, Haiti should be looked at as a singular metaphor for explaining so many of these various mistreatments and levels of preference for different groups. And I think the more we learn about Haiti, the more we realize how our fate - and this is not an overstatement - our fate is actually directly connected to it, if we are going to better understand what world we're living in with regards to how the powers that be intend to engineer the world towards imperialism.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Our fates intertwined, going right back to the U.S. not recognizing Haiti's independence for decades, fearing that a slave uprising would inspire enslaved people in the United States to rise up. Westenley Alcenat, thanks so much for being with us, Haitian American professor at Fordham University, where he teaches courses on the Atlantic slave trade, the American abolition movement and Afro-Caribbean history. And thank you, Gerald Horne, professor of history and African American studies at the University of Houston, author of many books, including Confronting Black Jacobins: The U.S., the Haitian Revolution, and the Origins of the Dominican Republic .\n\nNext up, in his first trip to Asia as president, Joe Biden has promised to defend Taiwan militarily if it's invaded by China. Is this new U.S. policy? Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "More than money: the logic of slavery reparations\n\nIt's not just about payment. It is about engaging in good faith with the descendants of enslaved people and addressing inequalities - to make a better future possible\n\nAll over North America and Europe, universities, businesses and other organisations are investigating their historical connections to slavery. Some of these institutions once owned plantations or enslaved people. Others were established or maintained through donations from enslavers or their descendants. When an institution uncovers such histories, a question arises: what should the institution do to address the wrongs of the past, wrongs with consequences that continue to be felt today?\n\nThis question is part of a much larger debate: what does society owe the descendants of enslaved and colonised people? How can we measure the harms caused by the slave trade, slavery and colonialism when these harms span centuries and still shape our lives? Who can decide what ought to be done to repair these harms, and who should pay?\n\nAs a historian who specialises in the legacy and memory of slavery, these questions often land in my inbox. I have sat in dozens of meetings with board members of various institutions over the past few years - including those of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian - discussing how they should respond after discovering a historical link to slavery.\n\nGroups that advocate for reparations almost never seek only money ... The social, the political and the economic are bound together and must be addressed together, creating the possibility of a better world.\n\nAll these organisations wanted to publicly acknowledge that enslavement had led to a stratified society in which race and class intersect. However most of them were wary about facing demands for financial compensation, or a potential backlash from those who felt we should have moved on from slavery.\n\nThe idea of reparations is controversial, especially in countries that have failed to acknowledge that centuries of racial inequality have produced the stark social and economic inequalities of the present. Reparations start with this acknowledgement. The term \"restorative justice\", which I use interchangeably with \"reparations\", is usually associated with the legal system, as a method of dealing with crime. It prioritises repairing the harms suffered by the victim of an offence rather than punishing the perpetrator. It also seeks to understand the issues that caused the offence to happen.\n\nWhen it comes to addressing the harms of slavery and colonialism, \"restorative justice\" is often a more palatable term than \"reparations\". Perhaps the latter seems coldly transactional, nothing more than a transfer of cash, whereas \"restorative justice\" implies collaboration and healing. But whichever term they use, groups that advocate for reparations almost never seek only money. Their work is grounded in an understanding that the social, the political and the economic are bound together and must be addressed together, creating the possibility of a better world.\n\nCalls for such reparations have grown louder since 2020. The killings of Breonna Taylor , George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery in the US, followed by Black Lives Matter protests across the world, highlighted how often people are deemed dangerous and disposable, and how often the justice system fails them . Discussions about school and university curricula have revealed that certain aspects of the past are persistently obscured: both the inhumanity of colonial regimes and the longstanding and valuable contributions of minority ethnic communities.\n\nDebates about reparations are both urgent and longstanding. Enslaved people have been demanding reparations since the 15th century, not long after European colonial enslavement began. One of the earliest recorded cases of reparations in the US (though \"reparations\" was not yet the term used) dates to 1783, when the state of Massachusetts ordered that a formerly enslaved woman, Belinda Royall, should receive a pension from the proceeds of her enslaver's estate, in acknowledgement of her unpaid labour.\n\nAfter the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833, British plantation owners were granted huge compensation for having their 'property' - enslaved people - taken from them.\n\nIronically, in the 19th century Britain and France voted that those who needed reparations were not the formerly enslaved but the enslavers. After the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833, British plantation owners were granted huge compensation for the injury of having their \"property\" - enslaved people - taken from them.\n\nAt the heart of demands for reparations is the understanding that the past cannot be erased, and must not be ignored. Former colonial powers cannot undo the damage they inflicted on enslaved and colonised people, but they can engage in good faith with the descendants of those people, and work to address the systemic inequalities that exist today.\n\nYet 21st-century European and North American governments have resisted discussing reparations. When they do take steps to address present-day inequality and racism, they do so without explicitly connecting these problems to the legacies of slavery and empire. And so it is left to individual institutions to decide whether to investigate their histories, and what kind of reparations might be appropriate.\n\nThe efforts of these institutions, which are often beholden to shareholders, donors or alumni, are inevitably partial and constrained. However, there are reasons to be hopeful. Disorganised, insufficient and slow-paced as some of these initiatives may be, there are reasons to believe the debate will continue and intensify. There are grounds to trust in young people's demands for a fairer society. A post-reparations society may be on its way.\n\nGreene King, which operates more than 2,500 pubs, restaurants and hotels in Britain, was founded by Benjamin Greene in 1799. He later became the owner of several plantations in the West Indies and was a vigorous supporter of slavery. In the 1830s, after the Slavery Abolition Act, he received compensation from the British government for having owned 225 enslaved people.\n\nAlmost two centuries later, in the summer of 2020, Greene King publicly acknowledged this history. The company announced a partnership with the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool; it promised to fund Black History Month initiatives, create opportunities for young people from Black and minority ethnic communities, and to develop a diversity strategy.\n\nIts acknowledgement came the month after the murder of Floyd. On both sides of the Atlantic, demands to address centuries of racism were loud and heartfelt. But these demands were not new. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a leading American civil rights group, has been calling for reparations from the US government since the mid-2000s. The Pan-Afrikan Reparations Coalition in Europe was established in 2001.\n\nSome of the calls for reparations have focused on the financial industry. Many banks founded before the 19th century had close connections with the slave trade, funding plantation owners or merchants who invested in slave voyages. In 2004 a group of descendants of enslaved people filed a lawsuit against the insurance market Lloyd's of London for financing the ships that transported their ancestors to North America. Lloyd's denied the claim, and it was dismissed the following year.\n\nMaking clear the connections between the past and the low numbers of employees from minority ethnic backgrounds is central to the work of reparations. Without them, we can never have a full understanding of the consequences of slavery.\n\nYears later, on the same day Greene King made its acknowledgement, Lloyd's publicly apologised for its role in the slave trade. It pledged to work on increasing diversity among its employees, and in 2021 appointed an archivist to research the company's involvement in slavery.\n\nThe terms \"reparations\" and \"restorative justice\" were absent from the announcements by Greene King and Lloyd's. Instead, both companies used the language of multiculturalism and diversity. Hiring more staff from Black and minority ethnic backgrounds was a priority.\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland and Barclays have similarly recognised their links to slavery and stated their support for \"diversity and inclusion\". But they have done so without making any clear connection between the past and the low numbers of their employees from minority ethnic backgrounds. Making these connections is central to the work of reparations. Without them, we can never have a full understanding of the consequences of slavery.\n\nSome institutions have not progressed much beyond simply acknowledging the past. In 2020, the National Trust released a report on its buildings' links to slavery, attracting ferocious criticism from those who continue to celebrate the British empire, or who regard the trust as an institution outside of politics.\n\nThe Bank of England, which owned enslaved people in several Caribbean plantations in the late 1700s, details this past in its current exhibition Slavery & the Bank . Some of the display materials mention that descendants of enslaved people have called for reparations, but there is no suggestion that the Bank will pay reparations, or that the effects of slavery still exist today.\n\nA better model is offered by the Rowntree Society, an educational charity. In February 2020, it decided to study the Rowntree family's connections to slavery (I served as an external consultant). A little over a year later, the society and its various trusts released a statement recognising the \"lasting damage inflicted by the colonial global economy in countries where the Rowntree businesses operated\". In referring to this damage as ongoing, and in declaring that history is \"not closed\" and that its \"legacies ... continue to shape the present\", the Rowntree Society departed from the approach taken by many other institutions: it acknowledged that its actions in the past continue to cause harm in the present.\n\nIn North America, some of the first private institutions to consider reparations were universities, hundreds of which have links to slavery. In 2003, Brown University's first Black president, Ruth J Simmons, commissioned an investigation into the institution's connections to slavery. Three years later, the report made a number of recommendations, which included memorialising the past, creating a research centre for the study of slavery and providing support - financial and otherwise - to local communities negatively affected by Brown's past. Most of these recommendations were put into practice. But in 2021, undergraduates voted that Brown should give reparations to the descendants of enslaved people affiliated with the university. Nearly two years later, the university has revealed no plans to do so.\n\n$100m Amount pledged by Harvard University to carry out recommendations from its 2022 report into its links to slavery\n\nIn the past few years, many more American universities have studied their links to slavery. In April 2022, Harvard released a report representing three years of research. The university's president pledged $100m (£80m) to carry out the report's recommendations, which included building relationships with the descendants of enslaved people who laboured within the university, or were enslaved by Harvard associates.\n\nIn 2019, Glasgow University became the first British university to set up a restorative justice scheme, pledging £20m to build a research centre in partnership with the University of the West Indies, for the study of public health and economic growth in the Caribbean, and the relationship between Caribbean and African countries. After Glasgow's commitment, other universities began to examine their past.\n\nThe University of Cambridge's main report into its involvement with slavery was released in September 2022. This report, for which I served on the external advisory board, is the product of rigorous research. Its recommendations are grouped into four themes: funding further research, memorialisation, engaging with Black British communities and developing links with universities in west Africa and the Caribbean. These recommendations are far less ambitious than Brown's or Harvard's, and the timeframe remains vague. Nevertheless, they leave open the door for further discussions, and for engagement with communities throughout Britain.\n\nEarlier this month, following the recommendations of the University of Cambridge Legacies of Enslavement inquiry, the university's Trinity College announced plans to appoint an academic to work on its legacies of slavery. It also pledged to allocate £1m over five years to scholarships, including those specifically for Caribbean students. The college did not explicitly state that these initiatives were forms of reparations or part of any restorative justice plan. Nor did it mention any consultation with reparation groups in the UK or the Caribbean.\n\nIn February, the Trevelyan family, who are said to have once enslaved 1,000 people in Grenada, made a public apology. The family, who were awarded £34,000 in compensation after slavery was abolished in 1833, once owned Wallington Hall. The Northumberland country house stayed in the family for 150 years before being passed on to the National Trust. The Trevelyans announced that they planned to assign a community fund of £100,000 to the economic development of the island of Grenada. This extraordinary move raised questions about the sum allocated and how closely the family worked with other Caribbean groups such as the Caribbean Community (Caricom). However, the Grenada National Reparations Commission described the attempt at addressing the wrongs of the past as commendable.\n\nThis kind of engagement is absent from many institutions' efforts. Such absence, as well as the vastly different approaches taken by universities and organisations across Britain, reflect a lack of comprehension of what restorative justice requires: both an acknowledgement of continuing harm and sustained discussions with communities who have been shaped by slavery.\n\nCalls for compensation for victims of slavery began centuries ago, initiated by enslaved and formerly enslaved people themselves. In 1778, after slavery had been outlawed in the state of Vermont, Pompey Brakkee, an enslaved man, sued his \"master\" for refusing to free him. Towards the end of the American civil war, Gen William T Sherman ordered that freed families should receive a plot of land and the means to farm it (\"40 acres and a mule\"). This radical plan for land redistribution emerged from Sherman's discussions with Black Christian ministers. The order was reversed by President Andrew Johnson months later.\n\nIn the century after the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act, European powers were less concerned with compensating formerly enslaved people than with establishing and maintaining their own empires. During the first half of the 20th century, European countries looked back on their colonial enterprises as philanthropic and \"civilising\", rather than as exploitative and economically motivated. But after the second world war, as more colonies declared independence, groups across the world put pressure on European governments to address the harms they had caused.\n\nIn 2001, reparations was one of the key questions of the UN World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance , held in Durban, South Africa. Even having the subject on the agenda was hugely controversial, and participating countries disagreed fiercely about the language of the final declaration, which ultimately left each to make up its own mind about whether to pursue reparations.\n\nOther countries, led by Britain, refused to issue a formal apology, fearing that to do so could result in a legal obligation to pay reparations. Regret was deemed a safer response.\n\nFrance declared slavery a crime against humanity and began a programme of memorialisation and education. Other countries, led by Britain, refused to issue a formal apology, fearing that to do so could result in a legal obligation to pay reparations. Instead, regret was deemed a safer response. In 2006, the prime minister, Tony Blair, expressed \"deep sorrow\" for the slave trade. His statement included a call to \"rejoice at the different and better times we live in today\". These words obscured the fact that the times are still profoundly shaped by the existence of slavery.\n\nIn 2014, Caricom, which is composed of 15 member states, put forward a 10-point reparations plan. Among other demands, it called for a formal apology from European governments; a repatriation programme for people of African descent in the Caribbean wishing to return to Africa; European investment in Caribbean public health and literacy programmes, and debt cancellation. Britain, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and other former colonial powers rejected the plan.\n\nThe nearest example we have of a state undertaking reparative justice measures, and acknowledging them as such, is the Netherlands. Last December, the government apologised for the country's role in slavery and established a fund of €200m (£170m) to raise awareness of the Netherlands' history as a colonial power, as well as \"fostering engagement\" and \"addressing the present-day effects of slavery\". However, the apology was seen by some descendants of enslaved people in Suriname and the Dutch Caribbean as having been sprung on them without warning and little collaboration. The Netherlands government said it would consult on future plans with descendant communities.\n\nWe cannot allow countries to leave the work of reparations to individual institutions, which will naturally have their own priorities and agendas. Not only do governments have the capacity to offer reparations on a far larger scale but, most importantly, countries, not just institutions and individuals, invested in and benefited from slavery.\n\nPro-slavery laws were passed in the British parliament; Britain's wealth, like that of many European countries, derives in part from slavery and empire. Regret is not equal to apology, but when Blair expressed regret on behalf of the UK, he at least made it plain that if you live in the UK, your life has been shaped by the legacies of slavery - even if you have never been to a Greene King pub, visited a National Trust property or invested with Barclays.\n\nSome institutional efforts seem little more than a public relations exercise. Others simply repurpose a company's existing diversity policies. One could reasonably argue that such corporate initiatives can and should be part of a reparations strategy. But too often reparative agendas begin and end in the institutions that develop them, with little consideration for the work that must be done in society as a whole.\n\nThe wider political context also shapes institutional thinking, especially for those institutions whose funding derives partly from the government. Last year, the minister for women and equalities, Kemi Badenoch, announced a history curriculum overhaul, under which children would receive a so-called balanced account of the British empire, learning about its \"benefits\" as well as its horrors. Given such announcements, it is unsurprising that universities and cultural institutions produce reports that sound progressive but are not too ambitious or contentious.\n\nThose who have suffered most from the brutality of slavery and colonialism should determine the restorative justice agenda.\n\nControversies over how we should remember the past, such as rows over statues as well as the school syllabus, can paradoxically distract from the inequalities and discrimination that exist in the present. Worsening income inequality, growing poverty, hunger and homelessness are, of course, experienced disproportionately by the descendants of enslaved and colonised people.\n\nThose who have suffered most from the brutality of slavery and colonialism should determine the restorative justice agenda. This requires institutions to give up control and power - something that many are unwilling to do. Even scholarly research into communities affected by slavery can be exploitative, with few research grants going to academics from these communities.\n\nRestorative justice, in the context of the legal system, divides participants into victims and perpetrators. Some reparations groups challenge this division, pointing out that it positions enslaved Africans and their descendants as powerless. We know that people of African descent, forcibly transported across the ocean, were instrumental in their liberation. We know that today, marginalised communities continue to share histories on their own terms, and to push for reparations. The Pan-Afrikan Stop the Maangamizi campaign has called for a parliamentary commission of inquiry for truth and reparatory justice in Britain. The Black Curriculum works to bring Black British history into schools, while in Wales an inclusive curriculum is on its way. Restorative justice is inherently a collaborative process, one that requires institutions to share some of their power.\n\nFor too long, we have been told lies about the past. Even during decolonisation in the second half of the 20th century, colonial powers scrambled to portray themselves as benevolently granting independence after centuries of enlightened rule. But over the past few decades, new narratives have emerged. These narratives challenge the old monochromatic tales of brave conquests and civilising missions. They reveal the brutality of the past and the bleak realities of the present: continuing discrimination, inequality, trauma and violence.\n\nA post-reparations society could encourage us to rethink the notion of happiness, one that is not based on instant and individual gratification but on collective achievement. It would be a society able to build a reconciled collective memory.\n\nSuch realities must not be ignored. Without understanding the history of slavery and colonialism, we cannot understand the extent to which societies today are shaped by systemic racism, unfair distribution of assets, inequality and violence - and how all of these have led to despair, marginalisation and disenfranchisement in parts of the population.\n\nRestorative justice, which recognises the role of marginalised groups, is key to enabling people to lead decent and dignified lives. A post-reparations world might acknowledge the complexity of the colonial past in its entirety, including the damage caused by racial hierarchy; it would not be afraid to discuss the ways in which race and ethnicity, class, gender, religion, ableism and age intersect. A post-reparations society would focus on education and civic participation so that current and future generations can address the challenges of climate change, health inequalities, systemic racism, gender-based violence and poverty; it could encourage us to rethink the notion of happiness, one that is not based on instant and individual gratification but on collective achievement. It would be a society able to build a reconciled collective memory.\n\nAs the populations of North America and many European countries become more diverse, and as wealth inequality continues to grow and climate change disproportionately affects the descendants of colonised people, we can expect calls for reparations to become increasingly loud.\n\nWe will also hear loud objections, from those who benefit from the status quo or who cannot imagine a different world. But it is only through confronting the past that we can reimagine our future - and it is only through reparations that this new future can take shape.\n\nOlivette Otele is distinguished professor of the legacies and memory of slavery at Soas University of London\n\nOlivette Otele is distinguished professor of the legacies and memory of slavery at Soas University of London\n\n3.1 million The estimated number of enslaved Africans Britain transported to its colonies between 1640 and 1807.

      "text": "Think reparations are impossible? The story of Japanese Americans proves otherwise\n\nFour decades after their incarceration in the second world war, survivors received redress. Now veterans of the movement are fighting for reparations for Black Americans\n\nKay Ochi still remembers the small, brown envelope her family received from the US Department of Justice more than 30 years ago.\n\nIt looked like any other piece of official government mail, with a Washington DC postmark. But inside was a printed letter, signed by President George HW Bush - and two checks for $20,000, one for each of her parents.\n\nHer parents were among the 82,000 Japanese Americans who received redress after being forced into concentration camps during the second world war under the guise of national security, in one of the darkest chapters in modern US history. The payments were the culmination of a hard-fought, 20-year movement, driven by sansei, or third-generation Japanese Americans, like Ochi seeking justice for their elders.\n\nOchi's parents needed the money - incarceration had stalled their careers - and they used it for a new roof, to update their kitchen, then shared some with their four daughters. But it was about more than money.\n\n\"We were vindicated,\" said Ochi, now 76. \"It began to lift the weight most of us have carried around.\"\n\nThe checks made Japanese Americans one of the only ethnic groups ever to win reparations from the US government. Now, decades later, their victory is taking on new weight as Black Americans fight for reparations of their own.\n\nProposals to compensate descendants for the lasting harms of slavery and discrimination are under way across the US, most notably in California, where a first-in-the-nation taskforce recently recommended a formal apology, cash payments to the descendants of enslaved people, and other policies to address enduring discrimination. But those efforts have also invited a vocal backlash and will face a prolonged battle to win over public and political support.\n\nMany veterans of the Japanese American movement for redress are getting back into the fight for reparations. Once again, they say, it's the right thing to do. And it's a matter of reciprocity: the Japanese American movement was heavily inspired by the civil rights movement, and Black members of Congress were key allies in persuading the government to back it. These activists are bringing a rare message to the movement: one of hope.\n\n\"The Japanese American experience can be pointed to, can be used, to show that reparations are possible,\" Ochi said. \"It's happened here - it's possible and it's necessary.\"\n\nWhile the story of what happened to Japanese Americans during the second world war is now well known, for decades it was barely discussed.\n\nLike many in her generation, June Hibino grew up only hearing her parents briefly reference the concentration camps. They were among the 120,000 people of Japanese descent on the west coast rounded up and put into concentration camps that spanned from California to Arkansas, over claims of espionage and disloyalty to the US . Many survivors didn't want to talk about their trauma, and parents often wanted to shield their kids from the racism they experienced.\n\nIt was the redress movement that shone a light on this atrocity for the community - and the nation. The push for reparations began as early as 1970, when the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) called for legislation that would make amends to those incarcerated during the war. But it wasn't until the early 1980s, when hundreds of survivors and their families testified at federal commission hearings across the country, that the movement gathered momentum.\n\nGetting involved with the redress movement years after college prompted Hibino to finally talk to her parents about what had happened to them. She then testified on their behalf at an August 1981 commission hearing at Golden Gate College in San Francisco.\n\nShe spoke of the harvest her family lost on their farm; of her father, whose studies at the University of California , Berkeley, were cut short and never resumed; and of her grandmother, who got sick with an infection a few months into incarceration and died alone in the hospital, the government not allowing her family to visit her on her deathbed. And she spoke of the continuing racism she faced as a third-generation Japanese American.\n\n\"For my parents, for my people, I demand monetary compensation,\" she said then. \"And as a sansei, I demand the truth be brought out for all to know. Reparations is our right - and it's been 40 years late in coming. And anything less would be nothing but a token and a whitewash.\"\n\nShe described how listeners were on the edge of their seats as survivors spoke of things they hadn't even shared with their own families. \"People broke down in tears,\" Hibino, now 70, told the Guardian. \"Others were so angry, they pounded the table, because they were finally being allowed to say what happened to them.\"\n\nOchi, a member of the National Coalition for Redress/Reparations (NCRR), one of the major Japanese American groups pushing for reparations, remembers feeling stunned. \"How could all of this have been kept so quiet, untold, for four decades?\" she said. It wasn't until then that she realized the extent of the community's suffering, as well as their losses - of businesses, homes and land, of freedom and dignity. They were all stories that hadn't been documented.\n\n\"We as a community had to write our own history,\" Ochi said.\n\nNow the truth was finally out in the open, but winning reparations also meant fighting in the courts and in Congress.\n\nOn one front, a team of lawyers set out to topple the legal justification for the concentration camps. They reopened the case of Fred Korematsu, who in 1942, when the roundup of people of Japanese descent began, defied military orders and went into hiding, eventually getting arrested and tried. His case went to the supreme court, which upheld the constitutionality of the wartime incarceration of Japanese Americans.\n\nBut four decades years later, lawyers found documents that proved the government had lied and suppressed evidence about the supposed military threat posed by Japanese Americans. Korematsu's conviction was overturned in 1983, undercutting one of the main objections to redress - that wartime incarceration had been constitutional.\n\n\"That was the last piece of the argument against reparations. It boosted the movement,\" said Don Tamaki, one of the lawyers on the case who recently served on California's reparations taskforce as the panel's only non-Black member. His own parents had been incarcerated in Topaz, Utah. \"We were on a mission,\" Tamaki said of the Korematsu case. \"We were out to vindicate our families.\"\n\nOn another front, a federal commission studying incarceration concluded in 1983 that it was the result of \"race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership\", further boosting the case for reparations. Norman Mineta, a Japanese American congressman from San Jose who was incarcerated as a child, co-sponsored a new redress bill in Congress, and hundreds of Japanese Americans flocked to Washington DC to advocate for it.\n\nThere was urgency to pass it: the community wanted to ensure that elderly survivors received compensation before they died.\n\nOchi, who flew to Washington to support the bill, remembers walking on Capitol Hill, handing out press packets and lobbying members of Congress. Most mainstream news organizations weren't covering the movement, so she'd call Japanese American newspapers on the phone to give them the day-by-day account.\n\nJust before the House voted on the bill, a delegation of 141 Japanese Americans arrived in Washington, Miya Iwataki, an organizer with NCRR, remembers. \"We had gardeners, truck drivers, doctors, attorneys, college students, professors, veterans, little kids, moms, Issei [first-generation immigrants to the US],\" she said.\n\nThe movement was also multi-racial. One key legislative ally was Mervyn Dymally, a Black congressman from Los Angeles, Iwataki said. She had met him years before, when she went to a town hall in his district. She pressed him on redress, and he admitted he wasn't familiar with the movement - but asked her to tell him more. Later, he hired Iwataki as his press secretary.\n\nDymally, who introduced a different redress bill in 1982, had helped facilitate early lobbying delegations to Washington, Iwataki said, introducing activists to other congressmen, making appointments, letting them use his office as a headquarters, and even arranging for them to stay at the homes of legislative staff. Dymally was chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, so the CBC was \"among the first\" to sign on to any reparations bills, Iwataki said, with Black California congresspeople including Ron Dellums also playing a critical role.\n\nFinally, seven years after the first commission hearings - and 46 years after incarceration began - Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which offered an official apology \"for these fundamental violations of the basic civil liberties and constitutional rights\" and set up a small fund to pay for public education efforts about this history and $20,000 redress checks to living survivors.\n\n\"A lot of times people look at that iconic photo of President Reagan signing the Civil Liberties Act, surrounded by beaming legislators, and think that's representative of the redress and reparations movement,\" Iwataki said. \"But it's not. It was a movement - and a victory - for and by the people.\"\n\nIt was a major victory, but the work to educate and advocate never stopped.\n\nThese days, Iwataki spends her time organizing and traveling the country, attending reparations conferences, trying to learn as much as she can about the movement for Black reparations and convince other Japanese Americans that they should support it too.\n\nJapanese Americans have had a long history of interracial solidarity on social justice issues, from protesting the war in Vietnam to supporting the anti-apartheid movement to fighting Islamophobia after 9/11 and Donald Trump's Muslim travel ban and family separation policy for migrant families.\n\n\"There's a recognition among Asian Americans that if it wasn't for the civil rights movement, where would we be?\" said Tamaki, explaining that the legislation that came out of the movement opened doors for Asian Americans too. \"We'd probably be where we were after the roundup.\"\n\nAfter the introduction of AB3121, the California bill to create a taskforce to study reparations for Black residents, the veteran NCRR activist Kathy Masaoka helped organize Japanese Americans to call state legislators, asking them to vote for the bill. NCRR and the group Nikkei Progressives also set up a joint committee to start studying African Americans' reparations demands - as well as the Japanese American community's own history of redress.\n\nMany activists and Japanese American community groups have also been involved at a national level, testifying and writing letters in support of HR40, the federal bill to establish a commission to study reparations for African Americans.\n\nBut Japanese American activists stress that they take their lead from Black organizers and groups working on the issue. \"We didn't want to say, 'We know how to do it,'\" Masaoka said.\n\nTamaki spent two years on California's reparations taskforce, listening to expert testimony and the stories of longtime residents of the state. The experience, he said, helped him see the discrimination Japanese Americans faced as just a subplot in the broader history of American racism and anti-Blackness.\n\nHe thought of Tanforan, a horse racetrack in the San Francisco Bay Area where his parents and other Japanese Americans were held before the concentration camps, that had restrooms and water fountains separated for whites and coloreds. \"It's a great illustration of what started as anti-Black pathology that ensnares others as well,\" he said. \"It's unifying, actually, to realize that everybody's got a stake in this game.\"\n\nWhile Japanese American activists are careful to say that they don't have specific lessons for today's movement for Black reparations, they say their success 35 years ago can be a source of optimism - even though success felt far from inevitable at the time.\n\n\"I was thinking it wouldn't happen,\" said Ochi. \"It didn't stop us, because we knew it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nTamaki said while there are \"stark differences\" between Japanese American redress and the Black reparations movement today, he sees parallels in the way public opinion has changed. \"When it first started, the public's reaction to reparations was 'no' and 'hell no,'\" he said of Japanese American redress. \"It took 20 years to shift the thinking - but it did shift.\"\n\nToday, there's a similar, unprecedented momentum building with reparations for Black Americans. He pointed to the more than 350 organizations that have signed on to endorse reparations in California, as well as similar efforts in Illinois and New Jersey to study reparations.\n\nCan reparations be won again?\n\n\"I'm hopeful,\" he said."

      "text": "California brings new state reparations bills amid Trump onslaught on DEI: 'The fight for justice'\n\nState's Black caucus faces ire of advocates as they demand urgent implementation given hostile political climate\n\nAmid the Trump administration's full throated attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion , Black lawmakers in California introduced a package of reparations bills to start the new legislative session.\n\nBlack legislators say these attacks on racial equity make it even more imperative to implement reparations in California , the first state in the US to undertake such a process, which has become a blueprint for other state-level reparations programs.\n\n\"With the constant attacks on civil rights and the rolling back of decades of progress, it is essential that we continue the fight for justice,\" said the state senator Akilah Weber Pierson, chair of the legislative Black caucus.\n\nThe bills, which are based on recommendations from the California reparations taskforce's landmark 2023 report, include measures that could give priority in public university admission for descendants of enslaved people, update the public elementary and high-school curriculum to include the \"impacts of segregation, slavery, and systemic discrimination\", and require government agencies to conduct racial equity analysis.\n\nIt's the second package of reparations legislation introduced by the Black caucus. Last year, only seven of the 16 reparations bills introduced were signed into law. Most notable among them was a formal apology for the state's role in perpetuating slavery. Internal division, as well as a veto from Gavin Newsom , the state governor, led to three of the caucus' signature bills - including one that could have created the mechanism for cash payments - being defeated.\n\nNow, in addition to a political climate that's becoming increasingly hostile to any attempts at advancing racial equity, the Black caucus faces a growing chorus of frustration from reparations advocates who are demanding even more ambitious policy proposals and swift implementation.\n\n\"We are very confident in our package, which includes bills that have bipartisan support,\" Weber Pierson said. \"The fact that Republicans support our efforts shows that, even in the current political climate, the need to repair the centuries of harm imposed on Black Americans goes beyond political affiliations - it is a moral obligation.\"\n\nOne of the main points of contention between the Black caucus and some reparations advocates is around the proposal to create - and fund - an agency to oversee statewide reparations programs.\n\nIn the final days of the last legislative session, bowing to pressure from Newsom's office, which wanted to see additional genealogy studies to determine eligibility included in the bill, the caucus pulled the package entirely. Dozens of advocates rushed to the state Capitol to protest in a heated standoff against legislators.\n\nLast month, the caucus reintroduced a version of this bill that, to the frustration of advocates, includes additional research requirements to determine eligibility for recipients.\n\nEven Kamilah Moore, the former taskforce chair, has been critical of this strategy. \"They created a different agency that's dependent on an additional study on genealogy,\" she said. \"I think it was a mistake.\"\n\nThe taskforce made more than 100 recommendations in its 1,000-page report, Moore said, and the caucus should use those as its North Star. Yet she says they have \"deviated\" from the course.\n\nNow, Moore and a group of reparations advocates are collaborating with an unlikely ally, Republican assembly member Bill Essayli - a Trump supporter who has expressed support for reparations in the past - to introduce a different version of the bill.\n\nWhile it draws on the Black caucus' original proposal that was pulled from a vote at the last minute, Essayli's version calls for the creation of a body called the Freedmen's affairs agency that would be modeled after the federal program that supported formerly enslaved people after the civil war.\n\nThis agency could place fewer conditions on eligibility for reparations programs and payments.\n\n\"We already did a study, called the California reparations taskforce,\" said organizer Chris Lodgson, who works with the reparations advocacy group Coalition for a Just and Equitable California (CJEC). He also helped to draft the Freedmen affairs agency with Essayli. \"What we're interested in is actual implementation.\"\n\nAnother criticism leveled against the Black caucus is how it's spending the $12m Newsom included in last year's state budget for reparations implementations. None of the money has been used yet, Weber Pierson's office told the Guardian. The proposed genealogical research alone would cost an estimated $6m.\n\nAdvocates are frustrated that the money has still not been used, and that if a large chunk is spent on additional research, it could be siphoned away from any reparations programs, including any cash programs that groups such as CJEC have been pushing. Cash reparations were a central feature of the taskforce's recommendations and could be part of the compensation both agencies would be tasked with considering.\n\nWhen asked about cash reparations, a spokesperson for the Black caucus said that \"substantial economic resources must be granted to Black Californians to correct the generational harms that were inflicted\".\n\nNewsom has shied away from addressing the issue directly, saying only that reparations are \"about much more than cash payments\" in an interview with Fox News after the release of the report. His office told the Guardian his position has not changed.\n\nEssayli told the Guardian his bill \"is not about cash reparations, it's about recognition and real opportunity to realize the American dream\".\n\nMeanwhile, as the Trump administration attempts to remove DEI measures in federal programs, firing personnel and weakening civil rights protections, a broader movement against racial equity is gaining momentum. (Trump himself hasn't specifically addressed California's reparations agenda since taking office again.)\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThe supreme court's ruling in 2023 banning the use of affirmative action has impacted Black enrollment rates at some elite universities, and the University of California system was sued earlier this month for allegedly continuing to use affirmative action policy.\n\nNearly 70 anti-DEI cases have been filed since 2024, according to a tracking database compiled by NYU School of Law. This list includes the lawsuit filed against the Evanston municipal reparations program by a conservative legal group, which argues the program is unconstitutional because it discriminates based on race.\n\nIt's been an \"engineered onslaught\" of these legal cases, said attorney Lisa Holder, president of the Equal JusticeSociety. About a year ago, Holder co-founded a coalition of law firms and civil rights attorneys to fight back. The goal is to \"defend, protect and advance policies along the spectrum of diversity, equity, inclusion, to repairing the harm\", she said.\n\n\"This work for justice is a marathon,\" said lawyer Areva Martin, who helped to negotiate a $5.9m settlement with the city of Palm Springs for a group of survivors and descendants that were forcibly evicted from their homes in the 1960s. The predominantly Black and Latino neighborhood, called Section 14, was razed by the city to make way for urban renewal projects.\n\n\"States have to stand up and be the voice of resistance, be the voice for marginalized people,\" she said.\n\nOn a federal level, legislation to study and develop reparations programs, HR 40, which was first introduced by the late representative John Conyers in 1989, was reintroduced in February by representative Ayanna Pressley.\n\nPressley described the present moment as a \"painful inflection point\" in an interview with NBC News , and vowed to keep working to \"blunt the assaults from a hostile administration\", especially when it comes to civil rights.\n\nCalifornia leads the way nationally as both a bulwark for civil rights protection and advancing racial equity, but also as an example for what a state reparations process can look like.\n\n\"California has a lot of eyes on it, and so what happens here is really informing a lot of places,\" said organizer Kristin Nimmers, who works with the group California Black Power Network. \"California organizers are helping different movements across the nation.\"\n\nBoth New York and Illinois are in the process of developing their own reparations legislation, and New Jersey has created a community-run reparations council.\n\nThe New York reparations commission, formed by the governor last year, is expected to release its report sometime this year. And the Illinois African descent-citizens reparations commission is expected to release a harm report in early 2026.\n\n\"California has provided incredible inspiration,\" said New York City-based reparations organizer Trevor Smith, co-founder of the community organization BLIS Collective.\n\n\"New York has the opportunity to build off that foundation, while taking a unique approach that reflects our own history,\" he said.\n\nThe work of California's congressional Black caucus \"sets a framework for the rest of the country on how to repair historical harms\", Weber Pierson said.\n\n\"It transcends who is in office. It is something that must be done, and will get done.\"\n\nThis article was amended on 6 March 2025 to note that Akilah Weber Pierson is chair of the legislative Black caucus and not congressional Black caucus and Lisa Holder is the president of Equal Justice Society, not founder of Equal Justice Initiative as previously stated."

      "text": "Don't listen to the critics: reparations for slavery will right historical wrongs\n\nA new report meticulously analyses the true cost of the transatlantic slave trade, showing how past and present are bound together\n\nD elving into a deeply unsettling chapter of history and seeking to reshape the discourse, a groundbreaking report, Reparations for Transatlantic Chattel Slavery in the Americas and the Caribbean , has calculated that Britain owes a staggering sum of £18.6tn.\n\nOther nations with a legacy of slaveholding, such as the US, Portugal, Spain and France, also stand accused of owing trillions. The total economic toll is thought to be as high as $131tn (£103tn). The revelation lays bare the enduring ramifications of the transatlantic slave trade and the struggle for reparative justice on a global scale.\n\nIn February, the American Society of International Law and the University of the West Indies hosted a symposium on the calculation of reparations from transatlantic chattel slavery. The economic consulting firm Brattle Group was engaged to build an economic framework to help achieve this .\n\nIts 115-page report dissects the complex aftermath of slavery, calculating the true cost - not only economically but also the intangibles: the harrowing loss of liberty and life; the stolen potential of forgone earnings; and the deprivation that reverberates across centuries. Its recognition of intergenerational trauma, loss of heritage and resulting disparities in life expectancy, employment opportunities and income is all meticulously analysed.\n\nParticularly incisive is its calculation of cumulative wealth and GDP amassed by nations that exploited African labour. This approach delves into the systemic enrichment of European countries, showing a web of culpability beyond individual actions. Another striking feature is the report's dissection of the enslavement and post-enslavement eras. The figure of £103tn exceeds the 2019 annual collective GDP of the world.\n\nBrattle's research highlights the £20m paid to British enslavers in 1833 , an amount that translates to £17bn today. This compensation, extracted through a Bank of England loan, continued to be shouldered up to 2015 by British taxpayers, including the Windrush generation and other descendants of enslaved people. It is a stark reminder of the unbroken chains that bind the present to a past that must be reconciled.\n\nTurning to the question of how to channel compensation effectively, the report's authors propose it should be overseen by independent bodies insulated from corruption and political influence, ensuring transparency and accountability. Compensation, they suggest, could be woven into concepts of restitution and rehabilitation, using the momentum created by the work of the Reparations Commission set up by Caricom (the Caribbean Community ). A call to action that transcends political boundaries can pave the way for healing.\n\nOpposition voices echo the same arguments, rooted in a lack of knowledge of the slave trade's atrocities. But critics who argue that assigning monetary value to deep-rooted suffering poses ethical challenges should not dissuade us from pursuing justice. They contend that the economic cost of reparations could overwhelm western economies, diverting resources from pressing issues such as income inequality, education and healthcare. However, a well-structured reparations programme can stimulate economic growth, jobs and innovation in marginalised communities, addressing systemic inequalities and fostering a robust economy.\n\nThe same argument comes up repeatedly: that setting a precedent might open the floodgates for other groups seeking restitution. But addressing injustices doesn't have to lead to endless claims. Unique historical contexts and moral and ethical underpinnings guide reparations, and acknowledging specific wrongs and crafting solutions doesn't automatically invite a multitude of unrelated appeals.\n\nSceptics argue reparations could have unintended consequences, reinforcing societal divisions or fostering a sense of entitlement that hinders progress. There is concern that monetary compensation does not necessarily lead to meaningful change and could perpetuate a cycle of victimhood. Again, fear of unintended consequences shouldn't obscure a moral imperative. Reparations aren't solely about money - they acknowledge, reconcile and commit to dismantling oppressive systems.\n\nAnother common assertion is that the current generation are absolved of blame for their ancestors' actions - societies aren't culpable for past wrongs and shouldn't bear the burden. Critics of calls for reparation say responsibility should be confined to those who directly perpetrated the crimes of slavery and colonialism.\n\nBut the legacy of slavery and colonialism continues to shape our social, economic and political structures, entrenching inequalities spanning generations. Therefore, far from blaming individuals today, reparations acknowledge the impact of systemic oppression and strive to rectify collective wrongs perpetuated by systems and institutions. Western societies have inherited benefits from historical exploitation, building generational wealth while dismantling that of the enslaved, and consciously engineering inequalities.\n\nSome also assert that official apologies and expressions of regret have made reparations redundant or unnecessary. But apologies must be accompanied by efforts to address the consequences of historical wrongs. Reparations aren't redundant; they symbolise a commitment beyond words, promising rectification and healing.\n\nOther critics want to see a focus on issues such as systemic racism, inequality and discrimination rather than past events, and call instead for efforts to create equitable societies. But modern problems needn't sideline historical injustices, as they are usually linked. Reparations are part of a comprehensive strategy acknowledging past and present. Rectifying historical wrongs can complement efforts to build a fairer society.\n\nThe debate over reparations is multifaceted, influenced by historical legacies, ethical considerations and contemporary political contexts. In navigating these arguments, it's imperative to acknowledge that reparations aren't just about assigning blame; they can confront historical truths, foster healing and address systemic injustices.\n\nThe Brattle report compels us to transcend rhetoric and fiscal transactions - it's a quest for reconciliation that speaks to the indomitable spirit of those who bore the brunt of slavery. It serves as a cornerstone of the indefatigable efforts of those who demand justice. It's an acknowledgment of the human cost, the tears shed, and the lives for ever altered - a call for nations to embrace the moral responsibility of redressing history's gravest wrong."

      "text": "African and Caribbean nations agree move to seek reparations for slavery\n\nAfrican Union and Caricom members establish global reparations fund and call for formal apologies from European nations\n\nA global movement to seek reparations for slavery has been forged during a summit in Ghana this week, with the African Union partnering with Caribbean countries to form a \"united front\" to persuade European nations to pay for \"historical mass crimes\".\n\nThe partnership between the 55-member African Union and the Caribbean Community (Caricom) of 20 countries will aim to intensify pressure on former slave-owning nations to engage with the reparations movement.\n\nDelegates also announced the establishment of a global fund based in Africa aiming to accelerate the campaign.\n\nA draft proclamation circulated at the end of the four-day conference did not specify what form the reparations should take but announced that the African Union would explore \"litigation options\" and work with the United Nations to assess \"whether acts of enslavement against Africans constituted serious violations of human rights at the time they were committed\".

You cannot quantify the effects of such tragedies, but they need to be recognised.\"\n\nThe \"entire continent of Africa deserves a formal apology from the European nations involved in the slave trade\", he said, adding: \"No amount of money can restore the damage caused by the transatlantic slave trade and its consequences. But surely, this is a matter that the world must confront and can no longer ignore.\"\n\nAfrican Union delegates travelled to Barbados in July to begin discussions on how to work jointly with Caribbean nations.\n\nCarla Barnett, Caricom's secretary general, told the conference: \"We are at an important inflection point in the global movement for reparatory justice.\" She said it was critical to \"speak with one voice to advance the call for reparations\".\n\nThe British Foreign Office said an official attended the conference \"as part of standard diplomatic engagement\", but the UK government remains resistant to the concept of reparations.\n\nAsked earlier this year by the Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy whether he would offer a \"full and meaningful apology for our country's role in slavery and colonialism\" and commit to reparatory justice, the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, replied \"no\", adding that while it was important to have an inclusive and tolerant society, \"trying to unpick our history is not the right way forward and is not something we will focus our energies on\".\n\nHis approach is shared by the new foreign secretary, David Cameron, who travelled to Jamaica when he was prime minister in 2015 and acknowledged that slavery was \"abhorrent in all its forms\" but said he hoped \"we can move on from this painful legacy\".\n\nAdvances have been made elsewhere. The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, recently expressed \"shame\" for the colonial atrocities his country inflicted on Tanzania and in 2021 Germany officially acknowledged committing genocide during its occupation of Namibia and announced financial aid worth more than £940m. Last year the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, offered a formal apology on behalf of the Dutch state for the Netherlands' historical role in the slave trade, which he recognised as a crime against humanity.\n\nOn a trip to Nairobi last month, King Charles acknowledged the \"abhorrent and unjustifiable acts of violence committed against Kenyans\" during their independence struggle. However, he stopped short of making a formal apology .\n\nDelegates said they felt buoyed by evidence of growing willingness to accept the need to pay reparations - citing Glasgow University's promise to pay £20m to atone for its historical links to the transatlantic slave trade, the Church of England's pledge of £100m to \"address past wrongs\" after its investment portfolio was found to have historic links to the transportation of enslaved people, and also the new Heirs of Slavery movement, formed by descendants of some of Britain's wealthiest enslavers, which supports the call for reparatory justice.\n\nRibeiro-Addy, who attended the Ghana conference and who chairs an all-party parliamentary group on reparations, said it was significant to witness the African Union joining forces with Caricom. \"It's a huge step forward. They've sent a very clear message that this is something that can't be ignored any more,\" she said.\n\nDavid Comissiong, Barbados's ambassador to Caricom and deputy chair of the country's national taskforce on reparations, said: \"I think everybody felt they were experiencing something very historic; people feel encouraged by the amount of work that has been done to create a global reparations movement.\"\n\nDelegates visited Elmina Castle on Friday, a major European slave-trading post in Ghana where enslaved people were held before boarding ships to the Caribbean, Brazil and North America. At least 12 million Africans were forcefully taken by European nations between the 16th and the 19th century and enslaved on plantations.\n\nCaricom's 10-point plan for reparatory justice asks for a full formal apology, debt cancellation, and for former colonial powers to invest in countries' health and education systems. The recent Brattle report commissioned by the University of the West Indies estimated the UK owed £18.8tn in compensation to Caribbean islands for hundreds of years of exploitation."

      "text": "Caribbean leaders vow to maintain pursuit of slavery reparations\n\nCountries meeting at Caricom summit not seeking 'handout' but 'appropriate apology' and compensation\n\nCaribbean leaders have defended the region's pursuit of slavery reparations, describing the compensation for centuries of enslavement and oppression as a matter of simple justice.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian at the Caribbean Community (Caricom) heads of government meeting in Barbados, the Antigua and Barbuda prime minister, Gaston Browne, said Caribbean states were not seeking \"a handout\".\n\n\"What we're seeking here is a final resolution of this issue and a reset in the relationship between the Caribbean and Europe - one in which there's an apology for the wrongs of their forebears, and at the same time, some form of restitution,\" he said.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 19th century, more than 12.5 million Africans were kidnapped, forcibly transported to the Americas and sold into slavery.\n\nBrowne said: \"Our forebears were treated as chattels, they worked for hundreds of years and were not paid. That created a debt, along with the fact that resources of the Caribbean and the profits of these resources were sent to Europe, to North America, to build their cities, their universities, to develop the technologies, to advance their economies, and they left the Caribbean region bereft of necessary institutions for development - not even have proper educational facilities or healthcare facilities.\"\n\nThe issue of transatlantic slavery reparations dominated headlines in October when the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, resisted pressure from member states to include reparations on the agenda at the Commonwealth summit.\n\nThe move has triggered months of criticism and speculation about Britain's engagement with Caribbean nations on the topic.\n\nBrowne's sentiments were echoed by the St Vincent and the Grenadines prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, who was a founding member of the Caribbean reparations movement.\n\n\"Reparations are about addressing the legacies of underdevelopment which have been caused by native genocide and the enslavement of African bodies. We are asking those who benefited from slavery - including the European countries - for some recompense, some reparation, some repairing,\" he said.\n\nConfirming reports that Caricom's 10-point plan for reparatory justice was being updated, he said that the slavery reparations movement is making progress: \"It's [been] raised in the US Congress, in the European Union and the British parliament, and the archbishop of Canterbury has addressed it, families from the past have addressed it. People thought when it started it was some little fringe thing, but it is moving to centre stage.\"\n\nExact reparations figures have not been agreed, the leaders said, but the focus now is on constructive collaboration on the issue, which they confirmed was raised during closed meetings on Thursday, which were also attended by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen,.\n\nIn his final address as Caricom chairman, the Grenadian prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, said: \"Your excellency, Ursula von der Leyen, I don't mean to be impolite, but I will say to you that the issue of reparations for the transatlantic slavery ... is an issue that we will take up with you.\"\n\nSign up to The Long Wave\n\nNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nHe stressed that Caricom's demand for reparations was not just about historical redress but about securing a commitment to justice that would prevent any form of human exploitation in the future.\n\n\"As long as we do not openly and explicitly reject the idea that one human being can own another human being, we run the risk that that idea may somehow take root again and be allowed to flourish,\" he warned.\n\n\"And so, as descendants of people who fought for their freedom from chattel slavery, we owe it to ourselves and to future generations of humanity to ensure that the transatlantic slave trade and the enslavement of Africans in the Caribbean, Latin, Central, South and North America is accepted as a crime against humanity and that the appropriate apology and compensation is paid.\"\n\nMitchell also cited the issue of chattel slavery as he advocated for continued support of Haiti, where rampant gang war has plunged the country into bloody anarchy.\n\n\"Make no mistake, Haiti symbolises the revolution that changed this part of the world,\" Mitchell said. \"Had it not been for Haiti, the idea that one human being could own another human being as chattel slavery and put him to work for their profit may very well still be persisting.\n\n\"And so we owe it to that island, all of us who are freed - the descendants of freed men and women who fought for their freedom - to ensure that we continue supporting and advocating for the partnership and the support to bring Haiti back from the brink.\""

      "text": "'We have to take a first step': inside the fight for reparations in America\n\nIn a new documentary, politicians and activists work to build a program to pay back Black Americans for the lasting legacy of slavery, racism and discrimination\n\nIn the heated debate over reparations in the US, the daunting task before those fighting for compensation for Black Americans is twofold.\n\nTheir first challenge is justifying to those against reparations what has already been documented throughout history time and time again: that the lasting legacy of slavery, and the racism and discrimination tied to it, stretches centuries after the Emancipation Proclamation and continues to harm Black Americans today.\n\nThe second is proving that the messy and complicated process of meting out this restitution, be it monetary or through policy - an endeavor some economic experts have estimated could result in tens of millions of dollars being paid out to millions of Black Americans - is even possible.\n\nIn The Big Payback, a documentary premiering on PBS on Martin Luther King Day, the co-directors Erika Alexander and Whitney Dow set out to meet both these challenges head-on. The film-makers kick off with a rapid-fire introduction of all the salient points that have been made over and over again about how the systems in place have upheld slavery's legacy and why reparations are necessary: Jim Crow, redlining, discriminatory housing policies, the racial poverty divide, the criminal justice system, oppressive voting laws, police shootings.\n\nThe film then peels off to follow two efforts for reparations: those of the congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee on the federal level to move out of the judiciary committee a bill calling for the creation of a commission to study reparations proposals, and the historic work of Robin Rue Simmons, a former alderwoman in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nIn 2019, Evanston became the first city in the country to guarantee funding - up to $10m - for reparations for African American residents. What came next was more than a year of public meetings, discussion, expert testimony and legal review to determine not just what form those funds would take, but who would be eligible to receive them.\n\n\"When we first started, [the film] could only be a case for reparations because it hadn't been done,\" Alexander told the Guardian. \"But then suddenly, in those few months, that young alderwoman did something that has never happened in American history, and we were able to catch it. It was like being with Rosa Parks on the bus.\"\n\nInterviews with community members highlighted just how complex and painstaking the process is to measure the breadth of historic injustices suffered by the descendants of slavery, and just how difficult it is to put a monetary value on that suffering. One man, Mark Dykes, spoke of the long-term traumatic impact of having to adjust behaviors to avoid racial violence or discrimination.\n\n\"Looking back at what my dad had to go through back in the south during Jim Crow, you could literally be beaten and killed for standing up for yourself,\" he said. \"It took me a long time to understand that my dad was protecting me by shuffling his feet and skinning and grinning in front of the white man.\"\n\nSimmons said: \"There's no one form of repair that can satisfy the totality of the harms of Black people and the crimes against the humanity of Black people in this nation.\"\n\nBut she said that wasn't the point to get stuck on. What she hopes viewers will take away from watching her fight for reparations in this documentary is that what matters is that you have to start somewhere - and the time to start is now.\n\nSimmons faced pushback when she and other stakeholders proposed that the first piece of reparations take the form of a $400,000 housing grant program. The documentary captured some of Simmons's critics within Evanston's Black community, who claimed the program was not reparations , but just another social program. Some said Black Americans deserved cash payouts with no strings attached. Alderman Cicely Fleming, who cast the lone vote against the measure , said the program did not allow people to \"dictate the terms of how they are repaired\".\n\nThe decision to focus on reparations first on housing came after numerous community meetings, in which \"the consensus overwhelmingly came out with housing as the area of the most harm and the most demand for repair\", Simmons said. A big part of the process was ensuring that these reparations had legal standing - that they could not be challenged in court - and the local historian Dino Robinson Jr was able to compile a number of discriminatory Evanston zoning laws from 1919 and 1969 that showed how the Black community in the city was harmed.\n\nThe housing grant awards eligible residents up to $25,000 to be used for a down payment on a home or closing cost assistance within the city, or to help pay for repairs, the mortgage principal, interest or late penalties on Evanston property. That means if each applicant received the maximum $25,000 grant, only 16 families or individuals - in a city with a Black population of 12,000 - would receive a check. Last year, the city selected 16 applicants from a pool of 122 in a random lottery. The program originally received more than 600 applicants, but only 122 fell under the parameters of those who had either lived through or were descended from those who lived through discriminatory housing laws in Evanston.\n\nSimmons has heard all the criticisms of the program - that its scope is too narrow, that the Black community deserved more - but she has maintained that when it comes to reparations, you need to start somewhere. And this is just the beginning.\n\n\"To want cash and not a housing benefit is not wrong. The challenge that I would give someone is: how do we have both?\" she said. \"How do we have all? How do we have cash and housing and education and so on? That's what we're doing and that's what we're looking for as repair. But we have to recognize that we have to start somewhere. We have to take a first step. We can't be paralyzed.\"\n\nEvanston has since approved an additional $10m for the reparations fund, Simmons said. Meanwhile, FirstRepair - the not-for-profit Simmons started after her office term ended - is working with local communities around the country looking to begin their own reparations process.\n\nWith a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, however, the Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee's efforts to push forward HR40, the reparations bill first introduced 30 years ago, will likely be futile. Simmons and the film-makers, however, are calling for Joe Biden to form a reparations commission via executive order.\n\nBecause like the reparations debate, the issue here is twofold. Yes, the main focus of reparations is for Black Americans to receive the restitution to which they are entitled. But the other side of the coin is for the institutions that committed the wrongdoing - whether they be local municipalities or the federal government - to acknowledge the hurt they inflicted. While it can begin on a local level, the federal government must also take responsibility and make reparations to Black Americans.\n\n\"The debt resides within the fabric of America,\" Alexander said. \"If you see how it resides within DNA within the systems of government, financial systems, education, the criminal justice system, everything that surrounds this land, then there's no excuse. It's the government's debt.\"\n\nAnd despite the uphill battle before them, Simmons remains optimistic.\n\n\"We're seeing it already, in big cities like San Francisco and small towns like Amherst, Massachusetts,\" Simmons said. \"I hope that they take away from my experience that it is possible to pass what some may have believed as radical, reparative justice policy in their own communities. And that HR40 passing is possible as well.\"\n\nThe Big Payback airs on PBS on 16 January and in the UK and Australia at a later date"

      "text": "Global calls for reparations are only growing louder. Why is Britain still digging in its heels?\n\nThe issue is on all our minds at this week's Commonwealth summit in Samoa. Now is Keir Starmer's chance to address it\n\nD owning Street has said reparations for the British enslavement of black people in the Caribbean are not on the agenda at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting this week in the South Pacific. And Keir Starmer's Labour government has asserted that it will not - now or ever - participate in the payment of any form of reparation.\n\nOn the first matter, nothing could be further from the truth. Reparations are in the mouths and on the minds of all participants, and the formal agenda does not determine the real agenda. It is just a conciliatory framework for the moment, and does not reflect what in fact is a supportive movement.\n\nOn the second, the Labour party's participation is significant. In 2006, Tony Blair's government laid down the party line of hostility to any apology for the crime of chattel enslavement, with the insistence that enslavement by Britain was legal because it said so. The Conservative government under David Cameron agreed, and told black folks to get over it in an address to the Jamaican parliament in 2015.\n\nGlobal opinion, however, has rallied around the idea - rooted in international law and bolstered by the best ethical and moral thinking - that there is a case to answer and that negotiations should be inevitable. In 1939, Arthur Lewis, a Nobel laureate in economics, set it out clearly. Britain, he said, had 200 years of free labour from an estimated 20 million black men, women and children. This was Britain's black debt, which must be acknowledged and repaired.\n\nWhile imperial Britain soared to sustainable economic development and global military superpower status, the enslaved and their descendants were left to this day with enduring pain, persistent poverty and systemic suffering. There is still British colonisation in the Caribbean , a daily reminder of the white racial supremacist culture that ruled the region for centuries. But the call for reparatory justice began with the enslaved themselves.\n\nThe so-called Slavery Abolition Act, the most racist legislation ever passed in the British parliament, defined some 700,000 enslaved black people as \" property \", rather than humans, and was the precondition for the compensation of £20m in cash paid as reparations to the enslavers. The enslaved were valued at £47m , and the remaining amount was paid off with labour in kind for four extra years of enslavement after they were freed. They received no compensation for the theft of their labour or the denial of their human identity.\n\nThe issue of Britain's black debt has generated several accounting and actuarial studies. Many methodologies have been used to quantify the debt, resulting in figures that include the pain and suffering of dehumanisation, torture, terror and genocidal management practices.\n\nThe British imported some 3 million Africans into the Caribbean and upon emancipation in 1833, only about 700,000 had survived. Barbados, where it all began as an economic explosion, received 600,000 people from British ships over 200 years; only 83,000 survived .\n\nSince the 19th century, Caribbean communities have been calling for reparatory justice as part of their social and economic emancipation. There is nothing new or sudden about it. Until recently they were mostly colonies and could not bring a claim against the \"imperial nation\".\n\nIn the 1960s, when nationhood broke on to the development agenda, the first generation of political leaders, led by Eric Williams of Trinidad and Tobago and Alexander Bustamante of Jamaica, tried to open a dialogue about reparations to promote economic transformation. They were humiliated, rejected and told that by claiming national independence they were on their own, and that Britain owed them nothing. However, the legitimacy and loudness of their claim for development support has grown over time.\n\nThe Caricom Reparations Commission has proposed a 10-point plan to frame the dialogue. It is rooted in the call for a conversation about economic development and social justice. It imagines a summit in which governments can engage around the need for economic modernisation in the Caribbean.\n\nThe region has consistently been rejected in calls for a development partnership that recognises reparations. At the moment, \"aid\" is offered as an alternative to development investment, but this has never been accepted in the region. What has been consistently called for is an investment initiative designed to assist cleaning up the colonial mess left behind in the Caribbean.\n\nInvestments are required to facilitate competitiveness in leading economic sectors such as tourism and financial services; in education and health to uproot illiteracy and support research to tackle the chronic disease pandemic. There is a need for partnerships in digital transformation and technological transfer. Finally, there is a call for debt cancellation, given that these young nations received no investment support at independence and were forced to finance their nation-building with debt.\n\nOnce again Caribbean governments and civil society are calling on the British government and national institutions such as the Bank of England and the Church of England - as well as the high street banks and insurance companies that generated and distributed wealth from slavery - to engage in a compassionate, intergenerational strategy to support postcolonial reconstruction. Britain received the Marshall plan after the second world war, but refuses to engage with the Caribbean after the slavery holocaust.\n\nMany British families whose wealth is derived from slavery have already come forward to discuss the reparations project and have been well received. The search for a win-win solution remains the dominant approach. The concepts of reconciliation and racial healing inform the initiative proposed by the Caricom commission.\n\n\"Correcting the world\" for the 21st century is indeed the imperative, and stands in contrast to those who seek to promote fear-mongering and persistent racist attitudes. The British government has yet another opportunity to do the right thing by its citizens and the Caribbean world. There are no enemies within the reparations enterprise, just partners in search of mutual development and justice for all.\n\nHilary Beckles is chair of the Caricom Reparations Commission"

      "text": "Democrat Barbara Lee on reparations and righting history's wrongs: 'This is the moment to push forward'\n\nThe California congresswoman speaks about the legacy of slavery and the need for reparations for African Americans\n\nWhen the California congresswoman Barbara Lee first introduced a bill proposing a national commission on racial healing, the US had erupted in grief and rage over the murder of George Floyd.\n\nSince then, the movement to provide restitution and reparations to Black Americans has gained momentum. As has the backlash.\n\nSeveral US cities are exploring similar efforts to acknowledge and apologise for systemic injustices. And in Lee's home state, a taskforce has suggested billions in compensation to Black residents for decades of state-sanctioned discrimination.\n\nMeanwhile, Florida blocked the teaching of AP African American studies, book bans sweeping US school districts have targeted writings about race, and nearly two dozen US states have tried to stifle attempts to teach an honest version of American history by banning the teaching of \" critical race theory \".\n\nLee, the highest-ranking Black woman appointed to Democratic leadership in the House and a candidate for the US Senate, told the Guardian that she was undeterred. Last month, she and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey reintroduced the legislation to create a commission of \"truth, racial healing and transformation\" that would work in conjunction with other congressional efforts to study reparations and educate the public about the historic atrocities undertaken and sanctioned by the US government.\n\nThe bill establishes the arrival in America of the first ship carrying enslaved Africans as the event that \"facilitated the systematic oppression of all people of colour\". And it tasks a commission of experts with memorialising the injustices inflicted on Black Americans as well as the abuse of Native Americans, the forced removal of Mexican migrants, the discriminatory ban against Chinese labourers and the colonisation of the Pacific.\n\nThe Guardian spoke with Lee about the country's long road to accountability. This interview has been condensed and edited.\n\nWhat does it mean to push for this commission on truth and racial healing, and to push for reparations amid unprecedented rightwing efforts to erase African American history from schools and public libraries?\n\nI think what gets lost is that people need to see this as a unifying movement.\n\nA lot of people push back on reparations because they get defensive, thinking it's about them.\n\nBut this was a government-sanctioned system of slavery. It was a policy of the United States government to enslave Africans. So we're talking about policies that have brought us to this point of systemic racism. And so the government has a responsibility, and the private sector has a responsibility to step up and repair the damage. There's no need to get defensive.\n\nI find that more people are beginning to understand. To understand the legacy of slavery, all you have to do is look at the disparities in criminal justice, in mass incarceration, in healthcare and employment. There's generational trauma as well as generational impacts which we see each and every day in this country.\n\nYou have people who are racist and uncertain about African Americans, for example, and who don't know the history, who don't know the context. But once the truth is told, healing occurs - that's a human phenomenon. Once you have the truth told, then you can move towards unification. As Americans, you can move towards healing.\n\nHow do you get such an effort going amid a growing, extreme right wing movement in Congress?\n\nWell, this is the moment to push it forward. There's no better moment given what we see taking place in terms of trying to deny and destroy our history in this country, and before we were brought here, enslaved. You have to keep educating the public.\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nAnd you just have to keep going. Just like Dr King said, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice - and we have to believe in that.\n\nThis idea of a truth commission first emerged in South Africa, and now more than 40 countries have launched similar efforts.\n\nThis is not a unique concept. This is an international concept of what the right thing to do means. And it's already happened here, in our own country.\n\nThe Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians investigated the forced relocation and internment of Japanese Americans during the second world war, and formed the basis of 1988 Civil Liberties Act to grant survivors a public apology and monetary reparations.\n\nAnd I'm so proud of the fact that Japanese Americans are supporting the reparations movement for African Americans.\n\nAnd I'm really proud of California. We had legislation, which Governor Newsom signed, to establish a taskforce, which is coming forward with some recommendations on how to repair the damage in California. And I think California has established a model for the country, and I think other states need to do this as well.\n\nAnd that model is having a government-sanctioned entity that has certified experts, activists and academics, elected officials who go around and listen to people, listen to the descendants of slavery, listen to what the laws were and policies were, and listen to how they are impacting people today. And I think that once that happens, then, again, you have the healing that can take place.\n\nYour bill to set up a truth commission complements another bill, HR 40 - the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act - which has been reintroduced every year since 1989. Do you see a future in which monetary reparations might be provided for Black Americans?\n\nWhatever the commissions come up with is the appropriate form of reparations - whatever the experts come up with will help repair this damage, I support."

      "text": "Slavery Fueled Our Climate Crisis. Here's How Reparations Can Slow It Down.\n\nContributing Writer\n\nGrowing up, I heard the phrase \"40 acres and a mule\" from all the adults in my life, usually in the context of an unkept promise. \"We're still waiting for our 40 acres,\" they'd say, referring to yet another violation of our rights sprayed across the news. When I was old enough to grasp the concept, my parents explained that after the Civil War, our ancestors were promised 40 acres of land and a mule as an \"apology\" for forced servitude. Growing up in Brooklyn, it was obvious that neither I nor any of my community members were descendants of people who had received such an apology.\n\nIt took some time before I fully understood that there's a nuanced relationship between climate change, colonialism, enslavement and reparations that affects all of us profoundly today. When we discuss the reasons for accelerating global warming, our conversations often focus on the corporate waste littering waterways, or emissions pumped into the ozone from factories. While these present-day practices contribute substantially to rising temperatures and more destructive and more frequent natural disasters, colonialism and chattel slavery also play a huge part. And even beginning to address this damage is going to take more than money - it's going to take new laws and a deeper understanding of how all this damage came to fruition.\n\nAs one 2019 BBC article explains : \" Enslaved people were brought [to North America] to work on the cotton, sugar and tobacco plantations. The crops they grew were sent to Europe or to the northern colonies, to be turned into finished products. Those finished goods were used to fund trips to Africa to obtain more slaves who were then trafficked back to America.\" During slavery in North America, it's believed that 40% of New York's cotton revenue was earned by shipping companies, insurance companies and financial institutions through this very process.\n\nThis wealth, in turn, was used to facilitate the pillaging of land stolen from its stewards, Indigenous people. So in many ways, slavery allowed for unbridled greed and a rapid rise in industrialization that exploited people of color while kicking global warming into overdrive.\n\nFast forward to today. The economy that thrived as a result of this system is still operating at the expense of the environment and the lives of people deemed less than human . And so reparations should be thought of not just as repayment for historical wrongdoings, but as a way to fight for a sustainable future.\n\nMost of our understanding of reparations comes from a plan to redistribute about 400,000 acres of seized Confederate land to formerly enslaved Black people. This plan is commonly known as the \"40 acres and a mule\" approach, or the Sherman Field Order No. 15, named for Union General William Sherman, who issued the order. According to various historical accounts , it was initially devised by a group of Black ministers in Savannah, Georgia, and was set to take place on the seized Southern coastal land stretching from South Carolina to Florida. For the first time, there was a plan that could decrease the power held by the Confederacy while addressing the desires of formerly enslaved people to own land and establish their own sovereign state. It would be a place where they could recreate their world outside of enslavement.\n\nAs historian Lisa Betty puts it, justice is about way more than just a check; it's about reimagining the world as a place where degradation and land theft are no longer normalized. Betty is a leading reparations advocate who's been vocal about how reparations are not just an act of social justice, but one of climate justice. In a recent article for Ethical Style Journal , she examines the ways in which white supremacy, colonialism and the enslavement of Black people not only affected the wealth of Black and Indigenous people in this country, but laid a foundation for the current climate crisis.\n\n\"When my ancestors were fighting in the Morant Bay Rebellion of 1865, it was about being against plantation economies,\" Betty says, referring to the rebellion in Jamaica led by formerly enslaved people who mobilized against poor living conditions and poverty exacerbated by a drought. \"It was about saying no, we shouldn't have monocrop sugar cane or coffee run through the land, and no food for our communities ... We weren't fighting to create plantation systems but to sustain and create alternatives to them.\" In other words, formerly enslaved people had demands that were bigger than financial restitution; they were more in line with a desire to build something that would ensure a safer, healthier future for Black people.\n\nA combination of rabid capitalism and racial erasure has clouded our understanding of what reparations initially entailed: the building of a sustainable future absent of violence against people and nature. Of course, that starts with money. But even those conversations are often left unresolved, because it feels impossible to create a system that provides financial restitution for every descendent of a formerly enslaved person. A recent New York Times piece, about the millions of dollars that descendants of enslaved Haitians paid France for the end of enslavement, reminds us that when it comes to gaslighting Black people, anything is possible .\n\nWhite supremacy has led to an abuse of resource s that is literally killing us and the planet. Even if we executed a plan for financial restitution today - say, Venmo-ing all Black Americans - it wouldn't fix our problems. Many of us have ended up living on land that's been abused and that abuses us in turn with chemicals, illnesses, floods and higher temperatures. For those experiencing climate apartheid in places like Flint, Michigan, and Louisiana's Cancer Alley , the history of enslavement leaves an inescapable residue. We need to totally rethink our relationship with each other and with the natural world around us.\n\n\"We're still living in a plantation economy, but it's worse because now more people are reliant on the plantation economy than even before,\" Betty says. Our inextricable reliance on the global exploitation of land and people fostered by the institution of slavery, she argues, is expediting the climate crisis. So where do we start with reparations as a solution, and how would it address or even slow down climate change?\n\nCatherine Kaiman, attorney and co-founder of t he University of Miami School of Law's Environmental Justice Clinic , pulls from legal scholarship and existing reparationist ideology to propose community-based environmental justice reparations, which she says would allow \"for a more narrow and tailored reparations program that centers around the affected community and its needs.\"\n\nSimilar to the reparative demands of formerly enslaved people in 1865, this framework focuses on wrongdoers taking accountability by acknowledging what they did and using their wealth and power to come up with solutions. \"This is done by considering the physical injuries of the community, as well as the property damage, financial damage, reputation damage, and psychological damage,\" Kaiman says. \"These same principles apply to any reparations initiative.\"\n\nTo provide reparations to communities facing environmental injustice, Kaiman says, lawmakers must implement legislation, and wrongdoers have to use their wealth and influence as resources that fund community-based programming centered around the people and environment they exploited. This would restore power to the people and the environment.\n\nThough the ultimate goal is to insure that those who are harmed receive the proper redress, Kaiman also acknowledges the shortcomings that come with completely relying on existing environmental legislation. \" Environmental laws are actually more adept at addressing current environmental injustices than they are historic injustices, meaning that communities that were previously exposed to contamination through air, soil, or water, have even less legal recourse through environmental laws than those who continue to be actively contaminated,\" she says.\n\nWhile an emphasis on current-day climate justice-based reparations may sound like it overlooks historical injustice, Black Americans are currently 75% more likely to live near commercial facilities that produce noise, odors, traffic or emissions that directly affect them. Again, these are the residuals of slavery and Jim Crow-era neighborhood redlining . Ultimately, we need reparations not just as an apology for our nation's racist past, but for a chance at a sustainable future.\n\n\"We 're owed so much more than just a little check,\" Betty says. \"We're owed the eradication of plantation-based societies, civilizations and economies - and alternatives that were founded in the midst of the chaos that is the 'colonial climate crisis.'\""

      "text": "We Absolutely Could Give Reparations To Black People. Here's How.\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nLet's say you're driving down the street and someone rear-ends you. You get out of your car to assess the damage. The person who hit your vehicle gets out of his car, apologizes for the damage and calls his insurance company. Eventually, you receive a check for the harm done.\n\nNow, let's say that for years, if not generations, your family and families like yours have been damaged by your country's political and economic system -- by law and widespread practice, with the intent of benefiting families not like yours -- then the checks for the harm done would be called reparations.\n\nBeginning with more than two centuries of slavery, black Americans have been deliberately abused by their own nation. It's time to pay restitution.\n\nBlack activists and intellectuals have been making that point with increasing volume over the last few years, turning what was an obscure thought problem into a political issue. T he question of reparations has even entered into the Democratic primary, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) struggling to explain to black voters why he has built such a strong social justice platform on every issue but this one.\n\nSanders was put on the spot last month when a reporter asked him if he would support reparations as president. \"No, I don't think so,\" he said, describing the likelihood of congressional passage as \"nil\" -- as if those odds normally stopped him.\n\nEvery year since 1989, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) has introduced the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act. As the name indicates, H.R. 40 does not require reparations. It simply calls for comprehensive research into the nature and financial impact of African enslavement as well as the ills inflicted on black people during the Jim Crow era. Then, remedies can be suggested.\n\nEvery year, the bill stalls .\n\nFifty-nine percent of black Americans think that the descendants of enslaved Africans deserve reparations, according to a June 2014 HuffPost/YouGov poll . Sixty-three percent of black folks support targeted education and job training programs for the descendants of slaves.\n\nMost other Americans still aren't listening.\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates, perhaps the most prominent voice now pushing reparations, laid out why black Americans deserve even more than repayment for slavery in a sweeping 2014 article, \" The Case for Reparations .\" The exploitation didn't stop with the Emancipation Proclamation, so any restitution must reckon with the discrimination that followed and deal with the living victims of these ills.\n\nLast month, Coates criticized Sanders' decision to shy away from the issue:\n\nIf not even an avowed socialist can be bothered to grapple with reparations, if the question really is that far beyond the pale, if Bernie Sanders truly believes that victims of the Tulsa pogrom deserved nothing, that the victims of contract lending deserve nothing, that the victims of debt peonage deserve nothing, that that political plunder of black communities entitle them to nothing, if this is the candidate of the radical left -- then expect white supremacy in America to endure well beyond our lifetimes and lifetimes of our children.\n\nLet's change that -- let's bother to have the hard but necessary discussion of what black Americans are owed for what was taken from them. If reparations ever come, what would they look like?\n\nSimply put, reparations are due to the millions of black Americans whose families have endured generations of discrimination in the United States. Most black Americans count among their ancestors people who endured chattel slavery , the ultimate denial of an individual's humanity.\n\nWilliam Darity, a public policy professor at Duke University who has studied reparations extensively, proposes two specific requirements for eligibility to receive a payout. First, at least 10 years before the onset of a reparations program, an individual must have self-identified on a census form or other formal document as black, African-American, colored or Negro. Second, each individual must provide proof of an ancestor who was enslaved in the U.S.\n\nWhy does this huge group of Americans deserve restitution? Because starting with slavery, the damage done was institutionalized and inescapable . Darity has created a \"Bill of Particulars,\" including such specific grievances as:\n\nThe extended history of government-sanctioned segregation and other forms of racial oppression in the Jim Crow era\n\nTerror campaigns launched by the Ku Klux Klan , often in collaboration with government officials\n\nPost-WWII public policies that were designed to provide upward mobility for Americans but in practice did not include black people (such as the GI Bill )\n\nRedlining, which made home ownership a possibility for white people while shutting out black folks\n\nOngoing discrimination against and associated denigration of black lives\n\nEric J. Miller, a professor at Loyola Law School, said the case for reparations starts with an honest accounting of the racism that black people have experienced. \"Part of our history is our grandparents participating in these acts of terrible violence [against black people],\" he said. \"But people don't want to acknowledge the horror of what they engaged in.\"\n\nWhite America built its wealth on those generations of legal and physical violence -- a fact most white people today would rather not dwell on.\n\n\"People don't want to believe that they got their gains in an ill manner,\" Miller said. \"The cognitive dissonance of learning that your property is got and preserved on the back of the misery of others is not an incredibly nice thing to live with. So people would rather discount it.\"\n\nBut when the harm is great enough, it's not enough to say you're sorry and try to fix problems going forward. Germany made an effort to repay the Jews for the horrors of the Holocaust. Japanese-Americans were repaid for suffering in internment camps. Black Americans deserve no less.\n\nThis leads us to our next step.\n\nNo one really knows. (That's part of the reason Rep. Conyers wants a commission.) But there are some numbers out there.\n\nA 1990 study by Richard Sutch and Roger Ransom, professors at the University of California, Riverside, estimated that industries fueled by slave labor, like cotton and tobacco, made profits of $3.4 billion (in 1983 dollars) between 1806 and 1860. Darity has estimated that if you throw in an annual interest rate of 5 percent, that number jumps to $9.12 billion (in 2008 dollars).\n\nLarry Neal, an economist at the University of Illinois, came up with an even higher number. His studies concluded that $1.4 trillion (in 1983 dollars) was owed to the descendants of enslaved Africans based on the compensation their ancestors did not receive for their labor between 1620 and 1840. With interest, that amounts to $6.4 trillion in 2014, according to The New Republic.\n\nNone of these numbers account for the physical and sexual violence inflicted upon enslaved Africans.\n\n\"I don't think we really grasp quite how financially lucrative and important slavery was in America -- including things like the illegal slave trade that continued after the Constitution forbade it ,\" Miller said.\n\nThe figures mentioned also don't include compensation for housing segregation and other forms of racial discrimination in the years since slavery ended. Nor do they factor in the extent to which American industries have profited -- and continue to profit -- from exploiting low-income workers , many of whom are black.\n\nHow do we measure those kinds of losses -- the chance at upward economic mobility that was stolen from millions? One way is to compare property values between majority-black neighborhoods that were redlined and white neighborhoods that were not -- or property values within a single neighborhood before and after redlining.\n\nAnother way is to gauge lost educational opportunities. Good public schools are usually found in majority-white suburbs where p eople pay higher property taxes . P oorly performing schools are found more often in economically disenfranchised areas with larger black populations.\n\nBottom line: reparations are going to cost a lot of money. But America is a wealthy nation that can afford to pay for its misdeeds. For perspective, consider that in fiscal year 2014, the U.S. government spent $3.5 trillion , which is only 20 percent of the nation's gross domestic product of about $17.5 trillion.\n\nWe could just divvy it up among eligible black Americans, but reparations advocates propose a more institution-based approach.\n\nDarity suggests that financial payouts be divided between individual recipients and a variety of endowments set up to develop the economic strength of the black community. His model is inspired by Germany's restitution payments both to victims of the Holocaust and to Israel.\n\nThe advantage of individual payouts, Miller notes, is that they maximize autonomy. But much of that money would land back in the white-dominated economy and \"the one percent would become one percentier,\" he said.\n\nHence the value of using a portion of reparation funds to create programs geared toward aiding black people in combating the damage of racism.\n\n\"One could think of Black America as being a community that could benefit from development investments,\" Darity said. \"So you could have a trust fund that was set up to finance higher education, [another] to create greater opportunities for opening one's own business, and so forth.\"\n\nDarity envisions the U.S. government establishing and overseeing these programs. Although it might seem counter-intuitive to give this power to the very institution that committed so much discrimination against black people, the professor said the government should be heavily involved precisely because of that history.\n\n\"The U.S. government is the responsible party because of the entire legal apparatus that supported both slavery and, subsequently, Jim Crow and continues to permit ongoing discrimination,\" he said.\n\nMiller emphasizes that the reparations-funded programs must be fully accessible to and controlled by members of the black community.\n\n\"Unless institutions exist that are controlled by and accountable to the community, then the community will always be dominated, or prone to domination, by others,\" he said.\n\n ̄\\_(ツ)_/ ̄\n\nCongress hasn't even managed to pass H.R. 40. And that's really no surprise since most Americans are not pushing their lawmakers to do anything on this issue.\n\nOnly 6 percent of white Americans support cash payments to the descendants of enslaved Africans, according to that HuffPost/YouGov poll . Only 19 percent favor reparations in the form of education and jobs programs, while 50 percent of whites don't even believe that slavery is one of the reasons why black Americans have lower levels of wealth.\n\nThey're wrong. \"The connection between slavery and the pillars of American society are tight. There are no pillars of American society without slavery,\" Miller said. \"You might think about that even literally. The columns of the White House and the Congress were built by slave labor.\"\n\nTo deflect discussing why reparations are needed, some people request a developed strategy for reparations or a detailed legislative proposal before they'll contemplate the issue. The suggestion, in itself, fits into a tired line of thinking that victims of injustice must explain themselves fully -- and convincingly -- to the system that harmed them before any recognition is provided.\n\n\"These demands always struck me as akin to demanding a payment plan for something one has neither decided one needs nor is willing to purchase,\" Coates wrote . As he has tirelessly reiterated , we must start with a robust discussion on why reparations are owed to black Americans.\n\nIf anything, the expansive U.S. history of anti-black racism is the deterrent -- but letting that deter us today is itself anti-black.\n\nThis returns us to the criticism of Sanders. The symbolism of specifically calling for reparations matters. A white presidential candidate who vows only to fight police violence and other modern ills affecting black Americans is essentially urging that we put a bandage on past injustices without true reconciliation.\n\nIf we don't look back and reckon with what has been done, there is no moving forward.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Why The U.S. Needs To Do Reparations Now\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nDefunding the police is just part of the structural reform needed to root out racism in the U.S., says Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who studies the economic inequities between Black and white Americans.\n\nWhat's truly needed is a big-picture rethink of U.S. policy at every level, she told HuffPost in an interview by phone and in follow-ups over email this week.\n\nIn her 2017 book \" The Color of Money ,\" Baradaran lays out how, over centuries, policymakers wrote Black Americans out of the economic system - and how policies blocking Black people from obtaining mortgages, land and credit created an immense wealth gap between Black and white Americans that persists to this day. In her book, Baradaran says that after slavery was abolished, Black Americans held just .5% of all the wealth in the U.S. Today, the number is barely higher, at about 1%.\n\nBaradaran's work resonates now as millions protest around the U.S. ― speaking out not only against police brutality against Black Americans, but the systemic racism that pervades America's institutions. The coronavirus pandemic has revealed the devastating effects of this inequality, as Black Americans disproportionately bear the brunt of fatalities from the virus and its economic fallout.\n\nBaradaran worked with a few 2020 Democratic presidential contenders ― Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg ― on their policy proposals for addressing the racial wealth gap.\n\nHuffPost spoke with Baradaran by phone about how her research applies to the social unrest gripping the country right now.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nOn Twitter, a reporter from The Washington Post asked what public policy would do the most to address the anger expressed around the country right now. You said: \"Reparations.\"\n\nThe [killing] of George Floyd ignited the protests, but the underlying issues are longstanding. When we talk about remedies, we really have to go back and look at this problem holistically, historically and at the roots. It is a structural issue: hundreds of years of racist policies ― economic, housing, criminal, education.\n\nI teach contract law. When you break a contract, you pay damages. We've broken the contract with Black America. We promised equal protection and equal rights and equality several times, and we violated it each time.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the freedmen were freed, theoretically. The Southern police system and the sharecropping system re-enslaved them. Jim Crow. There wasn't a remedy.\n\nThen the New Deal. Another big structural moment. We create the white suburbs with federally funded, subsidized credit. It rewrote our economy from scratch. Blacks were completely left out. [You can read more about racist New Deal policy in \" The Case for Reparations ,\" Ta-Nehisi Coates's groundbreaking 2014 essay in The Atlantic.]\n\nThen, there's racially explicit contracts that say you cannot sell this house to a Black person. These are all embedded in law.\n\nThen, we say those laws are illegal [with civil rights legislation in the 1960s] but don't do anything to fix the long-lasting effects of all of those racist policies.\n\n\"When you break a contract, you pay damages. We've broken the contract with Black America. We promised equal protection and equal rights and equality several times, and we violated it each time.\"\n\nIn your book, you write about race riots in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Wilmington, North Carolina, in the 19th century, for example. These are instances where white people violently force Black people out of their homes, businesses and entire cities.\n\nBlack families had the common experiences of moving into white neighborhoods and getting bombed, shot at, threatened with guns and violence.\n\nThe state institutionalized that violence. Instead of bombing the houses and having a race riot outside of a Black person's house, which happened all the time, you instead put it into a contract. Saying you can't give this house to a Black person, we'll take you to court.\n\nThe lawyers came in and did the work of the mobs. The Federal Housing Authority was that. The government bureaucrats did the work of what race riots achieved.\n\nWe embedded racism into policy. And how do you get that out? How do you fix that? I think reparations is the only answer.\n\nAnd I think a process of reparations should involve truth and reconciliation. Let's sit and talk about it. Have experts. Here are the witnesses. Here is the data. Here is what happened. Lay it all out.\n\nWe all know what the process is like to do something wrong and make up for it. You learn it in Sunday school, yoga, whatever is your spiritual practice. Making amends is part of that.\n\nWhat else would reparations involve?\n\nReparations are giving the Black community what they've always deserved. Giving them exactly what was given to whites.\n\nHow was wealth extracted from Black communities? It was through laws and policies and institutions that worked for whites and not Blacks. Every institution that benefited from these harms would account for them and make them up.\n\nWe have the funds. We saw this with the coronavirus. Over a weekend, the Fed infused trillions of dollars into the repo markets and into the economy. We don't have limits of resources. We have limits of empathy and imagination.\n\nIn practice, does that mean Black Americans are getting checks from different institutions?\n\nIt would depend. What does the institution do? Within each organization, target the places where the pain is.\n\nIf it's the FHA [Federal Housing Administration], what white people got was a guaranteed mortgage by the federal government that was really low-interest. So it would be down payment assistance, or you could do grants of houses.\n\nI wrote the 21st century Homestead Act , which would take a formerly redlined Black community with a lot of abandoned properties; one of the hubs of poverty. The cities would take these properties, redevelop and give them through a grant to Black residents. [More detail on Baradaran's housing proposal here.]\n\nAt the Department of Education, you could cancel Black student debt. Cancel all debt. Cancel debt for students at historically Black universities.\n\nThe IRS: We do this big mortgage interest rate deduction, which is a regressive tax. You end that. End that and you figure out how to make taxing progressive.\n\nIf you talk to any agency, they know where the bodies are hidden. The point of this would be to shift the thinking and figure out ways to reverse these problems.\n\nHard to imagine that happening.\n\nLet me give an example of something that has worked in this area. The Congressional Budget Office runs this cost-benefit analysis. Every agency action, every regulation, every statute, every bill has to filter through this analysis of how much does it add to the debt? It constrains all regulatory action. Every time I work on legislation with anyone, they're like, \"Well, how would you score this?\"\n\nI'm proposing something like that. Just score it as what are its effects on the racial wealth gap?\n\nWhat do police reparations look like in this framework? Would \"defund the police\" make sense when it comes to structural reform?\n\nThe system of policing in America is deeply racist. W.E.B. Du Bois pointed out that policing basically began in the South as a way to criminalize Black freedom and enforce Black labor laws. Policing in other countries is just vastly different from ours, and so is punishment for crime.\n\nPolicing has always been more targeted toward Black and Brown communities. From top to bottom ― sentencing, arrests, criminal codes ― from the way they are written to the way they are enforced. It's embedded. So you have to dismantle that whole system to achieve justice.\n\nThere is such a skewed funding structure ― police vs. every other agency. So yes, defund police and put those funds in education, public parks, etc. I mean, look at police funding in white suburban neighborhoods vs. funds for public places and work toward equality there.\n\nPolice killings are just the tip of the iceberg ― they are the part of the injustice that we can see and be horrified by.\n\nBut I want to be clear about this: We as a society are paying for this system of policing. Those people in the suburbs who are horrified [by social unrest] are complicit in the system that keeps their neighborhoods \"safe\" and the \"bad neighborhoods\" under constant surveillance.\n\nSo while we should definitely reform police and hold them accountable, that is just the bare minimum ― it's like treating the system that comes to the surface, putting a Band-Aid on it, and letting the cancer continue on.\n\nUnless we treat the cancer, we can't stop these police killings. And the police should not be carrying the entire burden of our racist history.\n\nI know you've worked on a few Democratic campaigns. Where do you see policymakers on this?\n\nThe window has shifted on reparations. I think people understand it is on the table at least. And look, I don't care what you call it. I think the theory for me is just fixing the damage. Justice.\n\nI hope a Biden administration considers the scale of the problem and has a large-scale solution to match.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Could Media Reparations Help Save The Black Press?\n\nSenior Front Page Editor, HuffPost\n\nDozens of Black news publishers gathered last month for an annual convention where the 2024 presidential election and voter turnout were a top concern, but in other conversations, journalists raised issues about the state of the media landscape.\n\nBlack-owned newspapers like the Michigan Chronicle, The Afro and The St. Louis American were represented at the National Newspaper Publishers Association's (NNPA) national convention in Baltimore, Maryland. The organization, which serves as the trade association for over 200 Black-owned media companies in the United States, was founded in 1940 and has, for decades, covered stories and issues in the Black community that mainstream newsrooms would ignore.\n\nThe conference's theme centered on increasing voter engagement and turnout as the presidential election nears. However, their efforts have been complicated by online accounts creating and amplifying election disinformation that targets Black audiences, according to a new analysis .\n\nWith newsrooms shuttering nationwide at stunning rates and audiences turning to other, sometimes less reliable, sources for news, Black publishers are fighting for survival.\n\nLarry Lee, president and publisher of the 62-year-old Sacramento Observer, said he has seen substantial growth in his paper's audience, staff and revenue since a major website redesign and the adaptation of new media tactics. Still, he remains concerned for the future of Black journalism.\n\n\"This moment that we're in is a little perilous because there's been a stagnation of growth for everyone across the board the last year,\" said Lee, who traveled from Sacramento, California, to Baltimore for the convention. \"So, while there's been some growth over the last few years, the last year has been a bit of a warning shot across the bow about where we are and our abilities to continue to grow audiences.\"\n\nMedia reparations may be the key to solving some of the problems facing the Black press, according to the media advocacy organization Free Press. Media reparations examine how the American media industry has harmed Black people and seeks redress from those institutions by providing greater funding and directing resources into Black-led newsrooms and media companies.\n\nDuring the so-called racial reckoning of 2020, Black Caucus at Free Press launched Media 2070 , an initiative that began as an anthology of essays detailing the history of the media's origins in racism and slavery - like running ads for enslaved persons, for example - and the importance of media reparations.\n\n\"We're a consortium of journalists, media makers, artists, healers and educators that are working to change these power structures so that Black people have the resources, the power and the space to be able to own our stories, all the way from ideation to creation and through distribution,\" said Diamond Hardiman, reparative journalism manager at Free Press.\n\nThe media industry has a long, fraught history of racism that it has yet to answer for. Local newspaper coverage contributed to a white mob's 1921 destruction of the Greenwood neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and several newspapers ran editorials supporting segregation . Isabel Wilkerson, the first African American woman to earn a Pulitzer Prize in journalism, wrote about how newspapers were used as vehicles to push anti-Black violence and racism.\n\n\"Newspapers were giving Black violence top billing, the most breathless outrage reserved for any rumor of Black male indiscretion toward a white woman, all but guaranteeing a lynching,\" she wrote in her 2010 book \"The Warmth of Other Suns.\" \"Sheriff's deputies mysteriously found themselves unable to prevent the abduction of a Black suspect from a jailhouse cell. Newspapers alerted readers to the time and place of an upcoming lynching.\"\n\nThose impacts reverberate today. Media 2070 lists some of the ways the government worked to suppress the Black press and how the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued the first broadcasting and TV licenses to white men and white-owned companies only during the Jim Crow era. Today, African Americans own less than 1% of the country's TV stations, according to a report by the FCC .\n\nThe organization aims to see the complete transformation of the media industry by 2070.\n\nThe media reparations movement may seem like a pipe dream for Black publishers, who need resources now and aren't necessarily thinking decades into the future. But the Media 2070 team knows the transformational change they hope to achieve will not happen overnight.\n\n\"Media reparations is as much about the process that we take to get to repair as much as it is about the destination we're talking about in 2070,\" Hardiman continued. \"Part of that process is investigating what it looks like to have infrastructure that can respond to harm better or what it looks like to create cultures of care in newsrooms, which is part of the work that could and would impact Black-owned press.\"\n\nThe Media 2070 team has already worked with the Black press in this endeavor, having collaborated with the New York Amsterdam News , one of the country's oldest continuously run Black newspapers. \"That was a beautiful exercise, and seeing how the future and present and the past can all come together and collide in a meaningful way,\" said Venneikia Williams, campaign manager for Media 2070.\n\n\"We're not at odds. It can be a partnership.\"\n\nThe idea of reparations has been thrust back into the spotlight in recent years due to the efforts of a reparations task force in California and an initiative in Evanston, Illinois, that focuses on housing grants .\n\nLee is hopeful that media reparations can help spread awareness about the disparities within the media industry, such as California's only three Black-owned radio stations - in the entire state.\n\n\"If the media reparations movement can provide that platform and can bring the proper stakeholders to the table, then perhaps there's some assistance that they can provide toward more equity to Black-led and Black-owned media outlets around the country,\" he explained.\n\nBut Black newsrooms have faced challenges for decades, and he pushed back against the idea that they need a savior. The media crunch, while concerning, is really nothing new to the members of the National Newspaper Publishers Association.\n\n\"I don't want to suggest that the Black press needs saving, but it does need support and investment,\" the publisher said. \"Black newspapers have not folded over the last five to eight years at the same rate as mainstream newspapers. We have some resiliency as Black newspaper owners and Black-led newsrooms.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "We Should All Be Paying Attention To The San Francisco Reparations Proposal\n\nContributing Writer\n\nA reparations committee is proposing San Francisco give each qualifying Black resident $5 million in reparations to repair the racial wealth gap stemming from the legacy of chattel slavery. And as you can imagine, everyone has something to say about it.\n\nThe San Francisco African American Reparations Advisory Committee is a collective of Black professionals who advise the city's leaders on repairing harm to their communities. They recently delivered an extensive report that pinpoints specific strategies for reparations that address historical segregation and redlining (extensions of chattel slavery) that contributed to the racial wealth gap.\n\nThe report is detailed and thoughtful. The criteria for receiving reparations, first off, is that individuals must be 18 or older to qualify and prove they have identified as African American for at least 10 years. Individuals must also provide proof that they fit into two out of eight additional qualifying categories, such as being born in San Francisco between 1940-1966 with proof of residency for at least 13 years or being impacted by the criminal justice system's failed war on drugs (either personally or as a descendent). In addition to a proposal for a $5 million lump sum for each qualifying person, the plan outlines debt relief and supplemental income for those earning less than the city's average median income.\n\nBefore we go any further, let's agree that this nation owes Black Americans reparations, period. If you're unsure about this, immediately dive into some contemporary literature to learn why chattel slavery is the root of America's most pressing disparities.\n\nMany Republicans, who of course hate the idea of San Francisco's proposal, argue that the plan would be too costly, unfair and divisive . Republican Florida Rep. Byron Donalds called the $5 million lump sum a distraction from solving problems like homelessness and the opioid epidemic.\n\nThe plan, which would cost the city $50 billion if just 10,000 residents qualified, is indeed ambitious. But even addressing just the financial repercussions of slavery on Black Americans is going to require ambition. And for the record, $5 million is not enough to \"call it even\" for slavery, especially in a city that's one of the most notorious in the country for its history of housing discrimination .\n\nWhether you agree with the dollar amount it proposes or not, the committee's plan is innovative because it uses historical and socioeconomic evidence to identify what, exactly, it will take to help the average Black San Franciscan to close the racial wealth gap. The plan holds the city accountable while offering compensation to help level the playing field and allow Black residents to build generational wealth like their white counterparts do every day. It's been estimated that the plan would exceed San Francisco's municipal budget, but there has yet to be any public discourse around what could be done with support from state and federal budgets.\n\nWhile the committee awaits feedback, the advisory board's president, Aaron Peskin, expressed hope for its approval. \"There are so many efforts that result in incredible reports that just end up gathering dust on a shelf. We cannot let this be one of them,\" Peskin told the San Francisco Chronicle .\n\nMy hope is that this proposal amounts to something substantial. The truth can be jarring and expensive sometimes, and we all have to be honest here about what this country has robbed us of. I want to see Black folks, somewhere in the U.S., get reparations in my lifetime. And if we're going to haggle, $5 million is a good place to start.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Asian Americans Out Loud\n\nJapanese American Activists Support Black Reparations To Heal Wounds Past And Present\n\nAmericans of Japanese ancestry got a check and formal apology for their unjust incarceration. These activists say Black Americans deserve the same.\n\nAsian Americans Out Loud is a project highlighting Asian Americans who are leading the way forward in art and activism. You can read more by visiting our APAHM  2021 homepage .\n\nStory By Mari Hayman\n\nPhotography by Kristen Murakoshi\n\nMasuo, my great-grandfather, died before he could get a reparation check.\n\nTwo armed FBI agents arrived on his doorstep on Dec. 12, 1941, and detained him without charges. He was shuttled from one Department of Justice detention center to another for the entirety of World War II and wasn't released until January 1946. Those few years of trauma guaranteed he would never really be OK again, and I believe it was the heavy weight of shame - of losing everything he'd spent his whole life working for - that killed him.\n\nThat is partly why many of my family members - including Masuo's last living child, my 96-year-old grandfather - have protested with Tsuru for Solidarity , an activist group led by Japanese Americans. Tsuru believes that Japanese Americans can heal the past by working in solidarity with other oppressed communities in the present. Its goal has always been for Japanese American survivors of incarceration (and their descendants) to be the allies they never had themselves.\n\nSatsuki Ina , a co-founder and co-chair of Tsuru for Solidarity, was born in 1944 in the Tule Lake segregation center, a maximum-security prison camp in California for Japanese Americans during World War II. In 2019, she was part of a group of protesters - many of them survivors of the wartime incarceration - who hung thousands of tsuru , or origami cranes, outside a immigrant detention center in Dilley, Texas, \"to let the children inside know there were people who cared about what was happening to them.\"\n\nThe South Texas Family Residential Center, an immigrant detention facility in Dilley, Texas, is pictured on Aug. 23, 2019. Tsuru for Solidarity held a protest here in 2019, likening it to Japanese American incarceration camps that also held young children.\n\nPhoto by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nSince then, the group has been protesting with local immigrant rights activists and religious leaders at immigrant detention centers around the United States. \"When we work across communities, this is where we grow our power to be able to change policy and practices designed to oppress people, \" Ina says.\n\nYet last year, after the police killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man in Minneapolis, and the racial justice protests that followed, Tsuru for Solidarity realized it needed to further expand its solidarity efforts. In what Ina called a \"natural evolution\" of the group's work, Tsuru began supporting the effort to pass H.R. 40 - a bill in the U.S. House to establish a commission to study the institution and legacy of slavery in the United States and recommend how to compensate the descendants of African Americans who weren't even allowed to have what my great-grandfather lost.\n\nJapanese American support for H.R. 40 makes sense for many reasons, among them a firsthand understanding of why reparations matter. I can only imagine how redress and a presidential apology might have helped make my great-grandfather whole again, restored his sense of dignity and self. After a hard-fought, multigenerational effort that finally gave former camp survivors permission to speak about their losses and grief, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act in 1988 - and my grandparents, who were imprisoned as teenagers, received the formal apology and cash payments that had eluded their parents.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan celebrates with community leaders and politicians after signing the Civil Liberties Act of 1988.\n\nPhoto by © Wally McNamee/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nStill, historical precedent alone hasn't been enough to convince other Americans to accept the idea of Black reparations. Ever since Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) first introduced H.R. 40 in 1989, the bill has been languishing. Conyers died in 2019, and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) is now the lead sponsor of the legislation, joined by more than 170 co-sponsors. In a historic step forward, the House Judiciary Committee voted on April 15 to advance H.R. 40, but it still faces an uphill battle .\n\nTsuru for Solidarity has taken various approaches to drumming up public support for H.R. 40 - first of all, by mobilizing Japanese Americans. Those efforts have already led to some important moments, including Japanese American activist Kathy Masaoka 's powerful testimony in support of H.R. 40 at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing in February , Tsuru's letter to the Judiciary Committee the same month, and an ACLU forum on H.R. 40 in which Japanese American and African American speakers united in calling for reparations.\n\nLisa Doi, a Tsuru co-chair based in Chicago, told me that after Tsuru called for letters to Congress, she received more than 300 testimonies from Japanese American camp survivors and their descendants urging lawmakers to pass the bill.\n\n\"It's an era where you put petitions online and people fill out the form - but this is people who sat down with a blank piece of paper and said why they support this legislation,\" Doi said. \"I was the person who received them by email, and I was able to look at them, and they were these really meaningful personal statements.\"\n\nDoi pointed to the coronavirus pandemic and the police shootings of Black Americans last year as reasons for the show of support. Without commenting on H.R. 40's chances for passage, she noted, \" Radical change might feel more realistic at a time when people have experienced tremendous upheaval in their lives.\"\n\n\"In the last 18 months, between the pandemic and quote-unquote uprisings in response to the murder of George Floyd, I think it has expanded the imagination of what might be politically possible,\" she said. \"Maybe it's a moment when America is ready and able to grapple with the racist and structurally violent parts of our history.\"\n\nA protester holds up a portrait of George Floyd during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in front of the Brooklyn Library and Grand Army Plaza on June 5, 2020, in New York City.\n\nPhoto by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt is something members of Tsuru for Solidarity have been trying to grapple with themselves. For H.R. 40 to really have a chance - and for Japanese American support for the bill to be more than a feel-good exercise - it must be accepted and unquestioned that Black lives matter, including in our own community.\n\n\" During the Black Lives Matter actions that were taking place, we definitely realized that Japanese American communities needed to look at their own anti-Blackness,\" Ina said.\n\n\"I went to school in San Francisco with mostly Black kids after the war, but our communities remained pretty divided,\" she remembered. \"I don't think people talk about it, but there was this community ethic that the more we identified with - what you millennials call our proximity to whiteness - the more we would be safe from losing our freedom again and being victims of hatred.\"\n\nIna told me that, along with mobilizing support for H.R. 40, Tsuru has organized a series of intergenerational workshops on anti-Blackness specifically for Japanese Americans. And just recently, she said, she personally began holding healing circles in Oakland's Chinatown to help Asian American organizations in the Bay Area share how they are processing recent acts of anti-Asian hate, a discussion she ultimately hopes to open up to Black community members as well.\n\n\"We're trying to have an influence on the way we look at each other,\" she said. \"The source of this is the racism that we've all shared, that we've experienced as victims - and how do we connect with each other. So I feel these healing circles can be very profound in our relationship with each other and building power together.\"\n\nSatsuki Ina, co-founder and co-chair of Tsuru for Solidarity.\n\nKristen Murakoshi for HuffPost\n\nMeanwhile, Duncan Ryuken Williams , another Tsuru co-chair who is also a Buddhist priest and director of the Shinso Ito Center for Japanese Religions and Culture at the University of Southern California, is running a reparations-themed virtual event series and book club . From January through July, participants will read and discuss texts including Isabel Wilkerson's \"Caste\" and Ta-Nehisi Coates' \" The Case for Reparations \" alongside books and articles about Japanese American redress.\n\n\"Until we solve long-standing fractures and unaddressed racial animus, we can't become whole,\" he said of the importance of fighting for reparations in solidarity with Black Americans.\n\nTo illustrate this, Williams described a Japanese pottery technique called \" kintsugi \" - the artistic practice of putting broken ceramics back together with a golden lacquer that adorns their former fracture lines. The point, he said, is not only to repair and make an object whole again, but to honor its history rather than minimize it.\n\n\"Because I'm a Buddhist priest, this metaphor is what made the most sense to me,\" Williams explained. Not only in terms of \"financial recompense and gold,\" he added, \"but also, at the deepest level, how can we do that at the psychic or spiritual level so those hurts can be healed and alleviated?\"\n\n\"The answer, if I have one, is in that word: solidarity,\" he told me later.\n\n\"There's a mountain of suffering out there, and we can't address and solve it as one person. We can only repair it collectively and in solidarity and together.\"\n\nMore APAHM Stories\n\nHow Native Hawaiians And Pacific Islanders Are Fighting To Be Seen During The Pandemic\n\nAsian American Activists Want So Much More Than To Not Be Attacked\n\nHow Welcome To Chinatown Is Preserving The Vibrancy Of Asian-Owned Small Businesses"

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said she would support a \"full-blown\" congressional discussion about reparations for the descendants of former slaves.\n\n\"America was founded on principles of liberty and freedom and on the backs of slave labor,\" the 2020 presidential candidate said at the event. \"This is a stain on America, and we're not going to fix that, we're not going to change that until we address it head on, directly.\"\n\nShe added: \"I believe it's time to start the national, full-blown conversation about reparations in this country.\"\n\nWarren made the remarks at a CNN presidential town hall at Jackson State University in Mississippi. She said she directly supported a House bill that would create a congressional commission to develop proposals for reparations to African-Americans descended from slaves, although Warren failed to directly say if she would support any financial payments at this time.\n\nSlavery is a stain on America & we need to address it head on. I believe it's time to start a national, full-blown conversation about reparations. I support the bill in the House to support a congressional panel of experts so that our nation can do what's right & begin to heal.\n\nThe bill was first introduced by former Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) in 1989, but Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) reintroduced it in January, according to Politico. The legislation would also \"make recommendations concerning any form of apology and compensation to begin the long-delayed process of atonement for slavery,\" Jackson Lee said.\n\nWarren first voiced her support for a discussion on reparations last month, saying America needed to \"confront the dark history of slavery and government-sanctioned discrimination in this country.\" On Monday she addressed generations of inequality, pointing to studies that show vast gulfs in net worth between black families and white families.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

We should, but that is a different conversation,\" he said. \"We're talking about housing discrimination.\"\n\nHomeownership, he pointed out, has been so defined by racism that many communities still have laws that forbid the sale of homes to people of color. And entire communities are still living with the legacy of real estate tactics from a not-too-distant past, such as redlining, blockbusting and overt discrimination in federal home loans.\n\n\"The only really strange thing about paying reparations to Black people is that we haven't done it yet,\" the host of \"Last Week Tonight\" said on Sunday night.\n\n\"When you deprive somebody of something, you make it right by paying what you owe,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, figuring out exactly how to pay might well get complicated.

      "text": "What We Are Owed\n\nChris Burnett\n\nWesley Lowery July+August 2024 Issue\n\n40 Acres and a Lie tells the history of an often-misunderstood government program that gave formerly enslaved people land titles after the Civil War. A year and a half later, almost all the land had been taken back. Read more here and listen to a three-part audio investigation here .\n\nAlvin Taylor still remembers the sight each day as he'd return from school, of more houses in his neighborhood being burned to the ground. He was about 8 years old when the fires came for his home. Fenita Kirkwood recalls listening, as a 9-year-old girl, to her father arguing with men who had come to their doorstep to insist they had to leave. \"That big yellow bulldozer pulled up in front of our house on a Friday,\" remembers Lawrence Williams, who ran inside to fetch his mother. \"I came in later and she was in the kitchen crying, asking God, 'What are we going to do?'\"\n\nThey were all children at the time, living in Section 14, a small plot of tribal land near downtown Palm Springs, California, in the mid-1960s. The city itself remained strictly segregated, and so their parents had helped to build a sort of shantytown out of trailers, wooden shacks, and small concrete dwellings-a mixed-race community that housed many of Palm Springs' working-­class Black residents. \"We built a thriving community. There were businesses, churches...It was an actual village where people helped raise each other's children, and we borrowed eggs from next door,\" explains Pearl Devers, who was 12 years old when a change in federal law eased development restrictions on federal land-meaning there was significant money to be made by clearing residents from it.\n\nThe city condemned their properties, then proceeded to burn Section 14 to the ground. State officials later wrote that it amounted to a \"city-engineered holocaust,\" concluding, \"Palm Springs ignored that the residents of Section 14 were human beings.\"\n\nIn the century and a half since the enslaved gained freedom, their descendants have fought to find home. We've clustered in colonies and cities, pooled our resources and talents, and aspired to a safety and security still elusive in this strange land where we were brought. It's been made too easy to forget that so many of these efforts found success, that within years of this nation recognizing our humanity-if not our full citizenship-under law, Black Americans were acquiring wealth, building homes, and establishing thriving communities.\n\nBut this country could not bring itself to allow our ancestors such refuge. In the years since slavery, it has so often allowed the massacre of our families, the plundering of our homes, and the destruction of our communities.­ For generations we've fought not only for futures but also to overcome a convenient national amnesia and to reclaim that which was unjustly taken from us in the past.\n\nIn Oklahoma, the last living survivors of the 1921 massacre in Tulsa have petitioned the state Supreme Court for financial redress for the government's role in destroying their homes and killing their neighbors. In Texas, a Black family is battling in court for rights to a piece of land that sits atop a valuable gas shale and that they believe rightfully belonged to their ancestors. In Arkansas, descendants of a formerly enslaved Black man known as Old Joe are fighting to be compensated because they believe their forebears were deceived out of the rights to a valuable plot.\n\n\"They stole it from us, and so we want it back,\" Anthony Bruce said as we walked along the Southern California beachfront where his great-great-grandparents had started one of California's first Black-run resorts, only to have the land stolen from them by local officials under eminent domain. It was only the second time he'd ever been to the spot once known as Bruce's Beach.\n\n\"I hope that people are encouraged to make that effort to find out more about their own inheritance and to find out about their own genealogy and ancestry,\" Bruce told me just months before local officials agreed to pay his family $20 million. \"Every single person should have their own God-given right to own land, to prosper, to raise their children in a safe environment.\"\n\nAbout 125 miles east, the survivors of Section 14 have spent years building their case, educating the public, and identifying the families who have a claim to redress. They succeeded in convincing city officials to apologize to the displaced former residents and remove a City Hall statue of the former mayor who oversaw the evictions.\n\nThen, earlier this year, Palm Springs said it would agree to pay some amount of reparations to the Section 14 survivors. The city and the survivors still don't agree on how many homes were demolished, how much those homes were worth at the time, and therefore how much should be paid out now. So it's unclear where the payment will fall between the $15.7 million in reparations that the survivors have demanded and the $4.2 million that the city has offered.\n\nStill, it is the latest victory in a series of cases in which Black Americans are being compensated for cherished lands, once the home and hope of their ancestors, that were lost.\n\nThese bits of payback are recent, but Black Americans have been demanding compensation and restitution for their suffering since the end of the Civil War. \"Thousands of ex-slaves devoted years to pressing the reparations cause,\" historian Mary Frances Berry writes in her 2006 biography of activist Callie House, whose 300,000-member National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association spent decades following Emancipation petitioning Congress for reparations. House's movement, which was later sabotaged by federal law enforcement, even filed a lawsuit that argued that formerly enslaved people were entitled to tax money seized from Confederate cotton production. The ensuing century would see reparations championed by a number of Black activists, most notably Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore, but the issue was largely banished to the far margins of mainstream acceptance.\n\nYet finally, we've entered an age of redress. Key to this shift has been our ability-due to broader availability of accurate historical records, a more diverse set of leaders in positions of institutional and societal power, and technological advances that allow more Americans than ever before to trace their own familial histories-to locate the descendants of specific victims of specific historical crimes. \"Redlining was not all that long ago,\" concedes John McWhorter, a Black linguist and conservative political commentator who spent decades publicly opposing reparations but now says that he would be open to some forms of financial redress for Black Americans. \"Being able to afford better-quality housing would be of concrete and immediate benefit to Black people, enabling them to escape many of the manifestations of inequity based on race.\"\n\nReparations can no longer be dismissed as an indiscriminate handout or a catchall public penance. They are now, more broadly than ever, properly understood as a series of targeted acts of redress and remedy. From Jim Crow lynchings to racist massacres that left Black communities plundered and Black families devastated to decades of explicitly discriminatory policies that often robbed Black Americans of their autonomy, dignity, and ambition-all are receiving long-overdue scrutiny. In his 2000 book The Debt , famed civil rights attorney Randall Robinson argues that direct financial redress was the only adequate means of helping Black Americans \"bottom-mired in urban hells by the savage time-release social debilitations of American slavery.\" Robinson adds, \"Solutions must be tailored to the scope of the crime.\"\n\nBy the time Robinson's book was published, there had already been cases in which America had paid direct monetary reparations: The federal government cut $25,000 checks to the families of Italian immigrants lynched in New Orleans in 1891; in 1946, President Harry Truman signed into law a bill creating the Indian Claims Commission, which paid out about $1.3 billion to Indigenous tribes that had faced violence and the unjust seizure of their lands; Japanese Americans who faced imprisonment and dislocation during World War II were given $20,000 payments; survivors of a white mob's 1923 attack on the Black residents of Rosewood, Florida, received $150,000 payments, and their descendants were given access to a scholarship fund; and $10 million was paid to the hundreds of Black men unwillingly included in a Tuskegee study on the effects of untreated syphilis.\n\n\"When someone hurts you, telling you that they are sorry for what they did is a healing act,\" civil rights attorney Fred D. Gray, who represented the Tuskegee men, wrote. \"This is no less true when it is your government that has committed the wrong.\"\n\nIn the fall of 2021, Alexia Fernández Campbell, an investigative reporter at the Center for Public Integrity, stumbled upon a black-and-white image of an old, crumpled slip of paper. She'd been looking into a potential project about gas pipelines in Black neighborhoods, and at the suggestion of a researcher who had traced Black colonies in Texas, she began searching for land records that might be included in the Freedmen's Bureau collection held by the National Archives.\n\nThat paper was one of thousands of land titles granted to formerly enslaved Black men and women, entitling them to plots of land in Georgia, South Carolina, and northeastern Florida, in the months that followed the end of the Civil War. The titles had been issued by Union General William T. Sherman, as part of a promise that would be remembered by generations of Black Americans as \"40 Acres and a Mule.\"\n\n\"The promise was the first systematic attempt to provide a form of reparations to newly freed slaves, and it was astonishingly radical for its time, proto-socialist in its implications,\" historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. writes. \"In fact, such a policy would be radical in any country today: the federal government's massive confiscation of private property...formerly owned by Confederate landowners, and its methodical redistribution to former black slaves.\"\n\nBut the deal died with President Lincoln, its promissory note rendered void when his successor, President Andrew Johnson, issued pardons to the former Confederate landowners.\n\nIn the century and a half since, the broken promise of 40 Acres has been inextricably tied to the Black reparations movement, shorthand for two fundamental truths: Black Americans are owed something for the horrors of enslavement, and that debt has yet to be paid. \"The freedpeople desperately wanted land, believed that they had been deceived, and felt betrayed,\" writes historian John David Smith. \"The legacy of that sense of betrayal lingers on...a sober reminder of the ex-slaves' broken hopes and shattered dreams.\"\n\nIn the early 1970s, poet and playwright Oscar Brown Jr. noted, \"I'm not bitter. Neither am I cruel, but ain't nobody paid for slavery yet. About my 40 acres and my mule.\" In the late 1970s, a young filmmaker named Spike Lee would choose 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks as the name of the production company under which he would release dozens of films and documentaries in the coming decades. In 1999, Nas rapped, \"Owe me back like you owe your tax. Owe me back like 40 acres to Blacks.\" Five years later, Kanye West added that Black Americans \"shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us. We tryna buy back our 40 acres.\"\n\n\"'They can keep the apology. What good is it?'\" New York Times writer Brent Staples recalled his Uncle Mack, the grandson of an enslaved person, exclaiming in response to President Bill Clinton saying he would be willing to issue an apology for slavery but that he did not support the payment of reparations, \"'They promised us 40 acres and the mule. None of our people ever got that.'\"\n\nWhat Uncle Mack and so many of us didn't know is that some of our people did, in fact, at least for a time, get their 40 acres-as the now-digitized land certificates in the National Archives show.\n\nOver the course of two years, a team of Public Integrity reporters, editors, and researchers identified 1,250 Black men and women who had been given plots of land during Reconstruction only to then have that land ripped away when Johnson pardoned many former Confederate landowners. From there, the team conducted genealogical research to locate living descendants of many of those who had received and then lost the land. For the first time, these living Black Americans were made aware of the specific land that had been given to and then taken from their ancestors.\n\nThis project is an unprecedented and innovative use of Freedmen's Bureau records-an impossible task for most of American history, until recent advances in genealogical research and the digitization of thousands of pages of Reconstruction-era documents made it feasible.\n\nBeyond its rigor, this work is of the highest importance because it shows what is now technologically possible, which should in turn prompt us to reconsider what is politically possible and morally right.\n\nIt forces us to look squarely at the names and faces of the Black men and women whose humanity through Emancipation our nation has only recently acknowledged, who were given plots of land upon which they hoped to build lives and legacies. And it allows us to trace what came next, as their displaced descendants navigated a nation that remained constructed to ensure their failure, without the benefits that could have accrued from these lands that were lost.\n\nThis project is a collaboration between the Center for Public Integrity, the Center for Investigative Reporting, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop.

      "text": "The Shocking Discovery That Suddenly Made Reparations Deeply Personal for One Woman\n\nAlexia Fernández Campbell and Nadia Hamdan June 18, 2024\n\nMichael Johnson\n\nMichael Johnson\n\n40 Acres and a Lie tells the history of an often-misunderstood government program that gave formerly enslaved people land titles, only to take the land back. Read more here and listen to a three-part audio investigation here .\n\nRuth Wilson squinted through her browline glasses at the image of a smudged, crumpled document on the computer screen.\n\n\"To all whom it may concern,\" she read. \"Fergus Wilson having selected 40 acres of land on Sapelo Island, Georgia, pursuant to Special Field Orders, No. 15...has permission to hold and occupy said tract...\"\n\nThe 71-year-old retired high school counselor let out a deep exhale as she leaned back on her leather living room couch, her dog Luckie looking up from his cushion by the fireplace. \"Sometimes things aren't worth the paper they're written on,\" she remarked. \"They took it back.\"\n\nThe document was one of 143 land titles contained within recently digitized records of the Freedmen's Bureau, the federal agency tasked with, among other things, distributing land to those who had been emancipated from slavery. These titles detail specific Black men and women who received plots of land in Georgia and South Carolina and empowered the Center for Public Integrity to conduct the first-ever effort to identify and locate living descendants of those whose land was stripped away as Reconstruction faltered. To date, reporters have traced genealogies for roughly 100 of the 1,250 identified as having received land following the orders. While many of their descendants stayed in Georgia and South Carolina, others migrated to states like Delaware, Michigan, and Ohio.\n\nAmong the land titles was the crumbling slip of paper-with smudged ink, torn edges, and three deep creases suggesting it had been folded into a small square-that in 1865 granted Wilson's great-great-grandfather Fergus Wilson his 40-acre plot.\n\nWhen an English professor at the University of South Carolina, Michele Reese, first contacted Ruth Wilson and told her that one of her ancestors was given land by the Freedmen's Bureau, she had a hard time believing it. To her, 40 Acres and a Mule had always invoked little more than one in a long series of hollow, broken promises.\n\n\"In the Black community,\" she explained, \"we don't say it, but we understand we don't plan on the white man for nothing.\"\n\nFergus Wilson had been enslaved by Charles Spalding, whose family owned a sugarcane and cotton empire on Sapelo Island, Georgia. As the biggest landowners on the island, the Spalding family enslaved 385 people there. In 1861, they sold Wilson to the president of a railway company, and he was detailed to a railway hospital in Savannah. In court documents he'd file years later, Wilson said he and his wife, Priscilla, would sneak baskets of food to Union prisoners in rail cars during the war. \"I had rather suffer death than to see them open their mouths and we not fill them,\" Wilson wrote, before adding that the Union troops later stole all the crops from his garden.\n\n\"He had a great quantity of rice, but I don't know how much. I can't count, but my old man, he can count,\" Priscilla would testify years later. \"I saw them take the rice in bags, they took it away on their shoulders. It was good, clean rice.\"\n\nUnder General William T. Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15, formerly enslaved men and women were entitled to up to 40 acres. For his plot, Wilson chose land south of Savannah on Sapelo Island, on a rice plantation that had been previously owned by the Spaldings. The eldest of his five sons, Fergus Jr. and Richard, also received titles to 40 acres each on Sapelo Island.\n\nBut once the war ended, the Spaldings fought to get their land back. Charles Spalding, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate Army, swore his allegiance to the Union and sought a presidential pardon in December 1865.\n\nA month later, an administrator for the estate of his deceased brother Randolph asked the Freedmen's Bureau to return the Spalding plantation to their family so they could pay off creditors. His widow and their children had all taken the amnesty oath, according to a letter sent to county officials, and needed those 7,400 acres to pay the family's debts.\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson soon pardoned Charles Thomas Spalding, allowing him to reclaim the Sapelo Island plantation as his own. While the Freedmen's Bureau resisted returning land to Confederate planters like Spalding, by 1867 the plantation had been returned to him and Wilson's land title rendered worthless. Wilson's sons Fergus Jr. and Richard would eventually leave Sapelo Island and move to Savannah after losing their 40 acres too.\n\nInstead of moving back to Savannah, Wilson pooled his money with other freedmen to buy farmland in Camden County, near the coastal border with Florida, according to research conducted by professor Reese, of the University of South Carolina. They paid half upfront-$300-to a Freedmen's Bureau agent, then paid off the rest after selling their first harvest.\n\nBefore he died in 1873, at about 70 years old, Wilson successfully petitioned the Southern Claims Commission for half of the $492 he requested as restitution for the crops and rice that Sherman's soldiers stole from him. Years after Fergus' death, his sons Hercules and Anthony Wilson would serve in the Georgia General Assembly.\n\n\"Of the three colored members in the House two are brothers. They are Hercules Wilson, of McIntosh, and Anthony Wilson, of Camden,\" relayed an October 1885 article in the Savannah Morning News . \"Wilson, of McIntosh, is a brick mason, and Wilson, of Camden, is a farmer and school teacher,\" the report continued. \"All are well-to-do, industrious, and sober. They board together at a private house on Peters street.\"\n\nThat year, Hercules Wilson proposed a civil rights bill that would have banned racial discrimination by private businesses such as hotels and theaters, earning a rebuke from the most widely read newspaper columnist in the South. \"I see that the colored member from Camden has introduced a bill to enforce the perfect equality of the races,\" columnist Bill Arp wrote in a front-page Atlanta Constitution piece in which he implored state lawmakers to not be like others before them who had \"pandered to northern prejudices\" and \"were afraid to do anything for fear the north would be offended.\"\n\n\"Our lawmakers will set down on Camden & Co. Our people have got as good manners and as much humanity as any people and know how to treat the negro according to his disservings,\" Arp continued. \"We intend to make distinctions. The Creator made them and drew the color line and we shall not try to wipe it out...If the wards are dissatisfied, let them go elsewhere and get another guardian.\"\n\nBy November 1885, Hercules Wilson had resigned, noting that he was better paid as a bricklayer than as a lawmaker. It would be more than a century before Georgia's public accommodations were desegregated.\n\n\"If anything were wanting to show the inferiority of the colored race, it is exhibited in the person of Hercules Wilson,\" declared the Boston Evening Transcript . \"Had he been a white man, he would have joined the third house of the Legislature. But the poor noodle preferred to lay bricks at $4 or $5 a day!\"\n\nHis great-granddaughter Ruth Wilson has only ever been to Georgia once, when as a child she was taken to a wedding in Savannah. She spent her entire life in North Carolina, where her grandfather, Hercules Wilson Jr.-born in 1882-settled to attend seminary, becoming the first in the family to receive higher education. \"My granddaddy left Georgia,\" she said. \"And no, he didn't go back.\"\n\nShe grew up knowing relatively little about the family down in Georgia. Her grandfather told her that his father had been a state legislator, but other than that they never discussed slavery and Reconstruction. Hercules Wilson Jr. married and began pastoring in a series of churches near Charlotte. He was proud that all three of his children would go on to college. He loved reading the classics, Ruth recalled, and watching his family members dance. As a teen, he got his family kicked out of a Baptist congregation by dancing at a church picnic. The Wilsons have been Presbyterians ever since.\n\nRuth was raised in Henderson, North Carolina, the only child of Hercules' son James and his wife, Mary, who were both teachers. She still recalls her parents, after a trip to Winston Salem, bringing back the first black doll she'd ever seen-one she still has to this day-and a white-owned pharmacy where a young white girl was allowed to sit at the counter to eat ice cream but she was not. \"If you grow up in it, nobody has to tell you about skin color,\" Ruth said. \"It comes naturally.\" She attended elementary and middle school amid the tumultuous efforts at integration that followed the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision before enrolling in a private high school and then the University of North Carolina, Greensboro.\n\nIt was only in recent years, after beginning to use Ancestry.com to trace her genealogy, that she first heard the name Fergus Wilson and learned that he'd been given 40 acres only to have them taken away.\n\n\"Nothing is like manna from heaven. And if it's gifted to us, beware: cuz what is given can be taken back,\" Wilson said. \"And the good news about [Fergus], he was smart enough to have a Plan B.\"\n\nThis project is a collaboration between the Center for Public Integrity, the Center for Investigative Reporting, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop.

Manny Ceneta/Getty\n\nFourteen trillion dollars.\n\nThat's the total amount of money that the federal government owes to Black people in America for the legacy of slavery, according to economist William Darity and his colleagues.\n\nIt's not an abstract figure. As Darity explains in the final episode of our \" 40 Acres and a Lie \" series-a groundbreaking collaboration between the Center for Public Integrity , Reveal, and Mother Jones -that number is based on a series of calculations, beginning with the broken promise that newly freed people would receive 40 acres of land. This famous pledge went largely unfulfilled. But in many cases, the betrayal was event deeper. Our two-year investigation, based on Reconstruction-era documents, identified 1,250 formerly enslaved Black Americans given land by the government, only to have it taken away soon after.\n\n\"I think that there's no doubt that there's a legitimate view of the 40 acres commitment as a form of reparations,\" says Darity. It was a promise from the federal government-an entity directly responsible for the horrors of slavery-to help build what would have essentially been \"a coastal Black Belt community\" after the Civil War.\n\nAs Reveal host Al Letson puts it, Darity \"believes if that program had never been rescinded, around four million freed people could have settled that huge chunk of land set aside for them, which stretched from South Carolina to Georgia to Upper Florida.\"\n\nIt was a real, tangible commitment, and the government's failure to live up to it has had real monetary consequences. According to Darity, the $14 trillion dollars the feds owe to Black Americans is \"identical\" to the present-day difference in wealth between Black and white households.\n\n\"That,\" says Darity, \"is the beginning of the racial wealth gap in the United States.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Michael M. Santiago/Getty\n\n\"I was born for this-and I know exactly what I'm doing.\"\n\nKarcheik Sims-Alvarado, assistant professor of Africana studies at Morehouse College-and the institution's Director of Public History and Historic Preservation-chairs a task force that's the first of its kind in the country: one dedicated to the study of reparations.\n\nA governmental advisory body in Fulton County, Georgia, the task force looks at the mass expropriation of Black land, in part through decades of records painstakingly worked through by Sims-Alvarado and a small team of researchers. They've amassed a paper trail of forced expulsions, mob violence, and the abuse of legal tools like eminent domain, all feeding into a wider national wave of efforts to discuss reparations-and assess exactly what's owed.\n\nListen to Sims-Alvarado, the late activist Roy Jenkins, and other leaders of the continuing fight for reparations in this week's episode of Reveal , the third and final segment of 40 Acres and a Lie -an award-winning series by the Center for Investigative Reporting in collaboration with the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "40 Acres and a Lie\n\nAn Investigation From Mother Jones, The Center for Public Integrity, and Reveal June 13, 2024\n\nBlack Americans have been demanding compensation and restitution for their suffering since the end of the Civil War.\n\n40 Acres and a Mule remains the nation's most famous attempt to provide some form of reparations for American slavery. Today, it is largely remembered as a broken promise and an abandoned step toward multiracial democracy. Less known is that the federal government actually did issue hundreds, perhaps thousands, of titles to specific plots of land between 4 and 40 acres. Freedmen and women built homes, established local governments, and farmed the land. But their utopia didn't last long. After President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, his successor, Andrew Johnson, stripped property from formerly enslaved Black residents across the South and returned it to their past enslavers.\n\nOver the course of two and a half years, a team of Public Integrity reporters, editors, and researchers identified 1,250 Black men and women who had earned land as reparations after the Civil War. From there, the team conducted genealogical research to locate living descendants of many of those who had received and then lost the land. For the first time, these living Black Americans were made aware of the specific land that had been given to and then taken away from their ancestors.\n\nThis project is an unprecedented and innovative use of Freedmen's Bureau records-an impossible task for most of American history, until recent advances in genealogical research and the digitization of thousands of pages of Reconstruction-era documents made it feasible.\n\nIn our three-part podcast series with the Center for Public Integrity, we explore the legacy of America's broken promise to formerly enslaved Black people.\n\nAfter Jim Hutchinson was freed from slavery in 1865, the federal government gave him a land title: 40 acres on Edisto Island, South Carolina. Soon after, that land was taken back. Through his descendants and the descendants of a former slaveholder, we reveal the truth about 40 Acres and a Mule-and how the federal government's ultimate betrayal fueled a racial wealth gap that persists today.\n\nIn 1865, Skidaway Island, Georgia, was becoming a Black utopia. Former cotton plantations gave way to a self-governing Black community. That is, until the federal government revoked 40 acres for tens of thousands of formerly enslaved people and returned the land to former slaveholders. Today, much of Skidaway Island belongs to The Landings, a wealthy, mostly white gated community.\n\n40 Acres and a Mule has come to represent an unpaid debt, and it's served as a rallying cry for generations of Black citizens demanding reparations. The final episode in this series explores how the debate around reparations has moved from the fringes to the mainstream, as a rising number of states, cities, and even one county in the South are actively exploring making amends.\n\nClick the button below to search Freedmen's Bureau records by keyword, person, or location:\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity identified 1,250 men and women who received land titles under Sherman's Field Orders, No. 15.

      "text": "My Video Responding to Racist Comments Went Viral. Let's Talk About It.\n\nMother Jones illustration\n\nThe generations-old debate over reparations for the descendants of enslaved Black people has fascinated me for my whole adult life. I've been to town halls, film screenings, and public hearings on the topic. Recently, my fascination took me on a trip to San Diego, where I took a front-row seat to one of history's most promising and high-profile efforts to secure reparations: a meeting of the California Reparations Task Force. You can watch my video series on that trip here .\n\nThis reporting adventure allowed me to engage with organizers and advocates, and delve more deeply into the thorny issues about what a holistic repair would look like for Black Californians. Task Force members are wrestled with critical questions like who gets paid, how much, and what debt, if any, is owed to Black immigrants. Having cultivated a (healthy, IMO) skeptical attitude towards this topic for most of my life, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself feeling... optimistic. I encourage you to explore the whole series .\n\nThen came the racist comments.\n\nReparations efforts have been contentious throughout American history , so I expected for my videos to evoke strong reactions from contemporary audiences, too. But instead of ignoring extreme comments on social media (of which there were many), I decided to address some of the most common and obviously racist replies.\n\nThis, I assure you, is not masochism. My goal is to debunk the persistent anti-Black tropes that often undergird the oppositions to reparations.\n\nIn the first video, I challenge a misconception about Black self-sufficiency and present historical examples of how Black independence-in the press, commerce, and thriving communities like Tulsa, Oklahoma-were systematically undermined and destroyed by organized white supremacists.\n\nA post shared by Mother Jones (@motherjonesmag)\n\nIn the second video, I address a commenter's question about why they can't receive reparations since they never owned slaves. They might be surprised to learn that, rather than providing reparations to slaves themselves to heal our fledgling nation, it was the slave owners themselves who received the compensation. Go figure.\n\nA post shared by Mother Jones (@motherjonesmag)\n\nMost importantly, I want you to learn something in this series, even if that means engaging with some of the worst people on the internet.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Major Investigation Discovers More Than 1,200 Formerly Enslaved People Received - and Then Lost - '40 Acres and a Mule' After the Civil War\n\nNearly 160 years after the federal government created what became the nation's first and most famous attempt to provide reparations by giving \"40 acres and a mule\" to formerly enslaved people in the South, a major investigation from the Center for Public Integrity and the Center for Investigative Reporting has identified more than 1,200 people in South Carolina and Georgia who received - and then lost - their land under the program right after the Civil War.\n\nThe discovery is significant because it was largely assumed the program only promised land to Black people, and yet this investigation demonstrates that was not the case, even though they were only temporary landholders. It's also the largest collection of land titles from the \"40 Acres and a Mule\" program known to ever be analyzed and published.\n\nDuring their two-and-a-half-year investigation, reporters from the Center for Public Integrity trained artificial intelligence to analyze 1.8 million records recently digitized from the Reconstruction-era Freedmen's Bureau, allowing them to track down 41 living descendants, several of whom were unaware of their ancestors' land being taken and the intergenerational wealth denied to their families.\n\n\"This investigation offers an important historical corrective. For generations it was commonly believed that no formerly enslaved people received the land promised by the federal government. But thousands did, even if it was fleeting,\" said Clara Jeffery, Editor-in-Chief of the Center for Investigative Reporting, which produces Mother Jones and Reveal . \"Hopefully this helps the public better understand the origins of the reparations movement, and why support for it is building.\"\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity created a free, online search tool that allows the public to search 1.8 million documents from the Freedmen's Bureau and other agencies. Of those, 500,000 are transcribed and can be searched by entering names, places, and keywords, and the remaining 1.3 million documents can be searched through image recognition technology, but not by keyword. The tool was developed using the Smithsonian's Freedmen's Bureau Transcription Project, which is working with volunteers to transcribe handwritten documents.\n\n\"This dedicated team of reporters and researchers spent hundreds of hours doing genealogy research and tracking down documents,\" said Jennifer LaFleur, assistant professor at U.C. Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism, and former senior editor at the Center for Public Integrity, who coordinated the reporting project. \"Employing machine learning to a document search tool allowed the team to find far more land titles and logs in the agency's digital archives than we ever could have on our own, and that greatly opened up the breadth of this reporting.\"\n\nFollowing the Civil War's end in 1865, the U.S. government created a program through the Freedmen's Bureau to give formerly enslaved people up to 40 acres, land that had been part of plantations in the South. But after plantation owners protested, federal officials gave the land back to the former Confederates. The property granted to the more than 1,200 title holders identified by reporters represents just a fraction of all the land that was supposed to be given to Black people across South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida in the years after the Civil War.\n\nReporters identified 744 people in South Carolina and 506 people in Georgia who got land through the program, some of which is now located in gated, majority-white communities and worth as much as $2.5 million. Some of the descendants interviewed in the series are intertwined by slavery, with one family in Edisto Island, South Carolina, being enslaved by another (of which the latter family still owns the land).\n\n\"All these years later we're only now learning the full injustice of the country's first attempt to provide redress to the formerly enslaved,\" said Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Wesley Lowery, who is co-chair of the Center for Public Integrity. \"This investigation is a testament to the need for thriving and independent journalism in the United States that is willing to look critically at the realities of not only our nation's present, but its past. This is truly groundbreaking work.\"\n\nCenter for Public Integrity reporters Alexia Fernández Campbell, April Simpson, and Pratheek Rebala reported the series in partnership with the Center for Investigative Reporting and the Investigative Reporting Workshop . In addition to the online research tool, the series includes six articles published on Mother Jones ' website and three episodes of the radio show and podcast Reveal , which will be broadcast beginning June 15.\n\nInexpensive, too!

      "text": "40 Acres and a Lie\n\nChris Burnett\n\nAlexia Fernández Campbell , April Simpson , and Pratheek Rebala July+August 2024 Issue\n\n40 Acres and a Lie tells the history of an often-misunderstood government program that gave formerly enslaved people land titles after the Civil War. A year and a half later, almost all the land had been taken back. Read more here and listen to a three-part audio investigation here .\n\nPompey Jackson was born in the heart of Georgia's rice empire-the human property of one of the state's wealthiest and most powerful families.\n\nHe and his sisters were among hundreds enslaved on a sprawling marshland estate called Grove Hill, where life was brutal. People died every month, mostly young children. Those who reached adulthood often suffered spinal injuries, lung disease, and foot rot from sloshing through flooded rice fields. Jackson survived smallpox. He was a teenager in late 1864 when Union General William T. Sherman and his soldiers advanced through the Ogeechee River low country on their way to capture Savannah.\n\nSherman freed thousands during his march through the South, later writing that \"freedmen, in droves, old and young, followed [our troops] to reach a place of safety.\" On January 16, 1865, at the urging of Savannah's Black ministers, Sherman issued an edict called Special Field Orders, No. 15, which reserved large swaths of coastal South Carolina, Georgia, and northeastern Florida for the formerly enslaved to live and work on and govern themselves.\n\nSherman's pledge of land for the formerly enslaved-which would become known as \"40 Acres and a Mule\"-remains the nation's most famous attempt to provide some form of reparations for American slavery. Today, it is largely remembered as a broken promise and an abandoned step toward multiracial democracy. Less known is that the federal government actually did issue hundreds, perhaps thousands, of titles to specific plots of land between 4 and 40 acres-before ultimately changing course and returning the land to the plantation owners. (The freedmen were not, in fact, promised a mule, though some did receive them.)\n\nJackson was among the first freedmen in Georgia to get one of these land titles, choosing to begin his life after the war on a plot carved out of the very rice fields where he'd spent his years enslaved. On April 20, 1865, a federal agent issued Jackson a land title for 4 acres at Grove Hill.\n\nWe came across that title as part of the Center for Public Integrity's years-long effort to search through nearly 1.8 million records, which allowed us to identify 1,250 formerly enslaved men and women, including Jackson, who received land titles in Georgia and South Carolina in the months that followed Sherman's field orders. All of the records were created by the now-defunct US Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, and were only digitized in the last 10 years. We first discovered some of the land titles in 2021, within a recently digitized roll of microfilm labeled \"Unbound Miscellaneous Records.\" To aid in our search, we developed an image recognition algorithm that helped us surface land titles that covered more than 24,000 acres on 34 plantations that were seized by the Union Army from Confederate landowners. While the titles we have represent just a fraction of those distributed under Sherman's orders, we were able to identify at least 34 former plantations where specific land was granted to Black families and then taken back.\n\nIn 2000, when Congress passed the Freedmen's Bureau Preservation Act, it financed a five-year effort to index and microfilm the records-mostly handwritten, and often in elaborate penmanship-from the Reconstruction-era agency charged with aiding millions of emancipated slaves. In the years that followed, the Mormon Church began digitizing images from the microfilm through its genealogy platform FamilySearch, making 1.5 million records available online in partnership with the National Archives. Eric Foner, a leading historian who has written extensively about the Civil War, said this digitization was vital because there are no other sources outside of the Freedmen's Bureau records that illustrate this aspect of Reconstruction so clearly.\n\nWhile historians had long known that at least some of these titles still existed-one has been featured on the National Archives website since at least 2007-such a large collection has never been published and analyzed in one place. \"These records contain an enormous amount of genealogical information that has not been readily available to many African Americans,\" said historian Karen Cook Bell, who said she first ­encountered­­ some land titles back in 1991 while searching through National Archives paper records by hand to research her dissertation.\n\n\"Having this kind of evidence-of actual families who received land and had that land taken away-certainly can address, in some measure, the issue of reparations,\" said Cook Bell, whose 2018 book, Claiming Freedom: Race, Kinship, and Land in Nineteenth-Century Georgia , documents life on lowcountry plantations such as Grove Hill. In her book, she identified nearly 400 formerly enslaved men and women in Georgia who had received land titles. \"When you talk about the economic inequalities in American society, they all center around who has access to property, and who has access to land.\"\n\nAfter surfacing the digitized land titles and logs entries, we conducted genealogical research to trace what happened to the descendants of these 1,250 men and women in the century and a half since Sherman's promise was broken-reviewing thousands of Freedmen's Bureau bank records, marriage certificates, and census documents. Many names didn't appear on any other public records; other names were too common to research with confidence. Ultimately, we created family trees for about 100 of the freedmen and women and identified 41 of their living descendants.\n\n\"I had no idea,\" said Mila Rios, after being shown a Freedmen's Bureau log that included the name of her great-great-grandfather, Pompey Jackson. \"That's infringement. It was given to him and taken back.\"\n\nSherman's special Field Orders, No. 15 set aside the islands and coastline of Georgia, South Carolina, and northeastern Florida exclusively \"for the settlement of the negroes now made free by the acts of war.\" The orders granted the head of each family up to 40 acres of land on seized or abandoned plantations, and afforded them military protection \"until such time as they can protect themselves, or until Congress shall regulate their title.\" The orders further noted that \"in the settlements hereafter to be established, no white person whatever, unless military officers and soldiers detailed for duty, will be permitted to reside; and the sole and exclusive management of affairs will be left to the freed people themselves.\" In his memoirs, Sherman explained that he had not necessarily intended to ensure the freedmen the right to the land indefinitely, but at least through the end of the war and until federal officials took more permanent measures.\n\nIn the meantime, the task of explaining and administering the orders fell to Rufus Saxton, a decorated Union general, who traveled to the Second African Baptist Church in Savannah on a February afternoon in 1865. After an organist played a celebratory hymn and the Reverend Ulysses L. Houston, who'd helped persuade Sherman to redistribute land, offered a prayer, Saxton addressed those who had crowded into the church that day.\n\n\"The soil is the source of all true prosperity and wealth,\" Saxton reportedly told those who had gathered in the pews. \"No people can be great unless they own soil. You know that; General Sherman knows it; our Father in heaven knows it. And now I want to tell you, you may own the soil.\" Saxton's declaration created a stir, but his words would come back to haunt him.\n\nA few weeks later, President Abraham Lincoln signed into law a bill that clarified that Black families could rent their chosen plots for three years, with the option to buy them. The bill also created the Freedmen's Bureau, an agency charged with coordinating temporary housing, food, health care, education, and work for the 3 million formerly enslaved people across the nation.\n\nWithin a few weeks, Saxton's officers were issuing land titles to freed people. By June, Saxton reported that he had settled some 40,000 Black citizens on the land set aside for them through Sherman's orders.\n\nAmong them were a woman named Eleaza Johnson and a man named York Williams, who each received 40 acres on Skidaway Island. A short boat ride from Savannah, the 11,430-acre island that had been home to a dozen plantations was where Houston resettled more than 1,000 freed people in an attempt to build a self-sufficient Black colony.\n\nOn the mainland south of Savannah, near the neck of the Ogeechee River, at least 50 men and women, including Pompey Jackson, were issued land titles at Grove Hill. Many had been enslaved there together. The new landholders elected a board of representatives to advise the Freedmen's Bureau agent in their district, formed their own militia, the Ogeechee Home Guards, and continued producing rice to sell in Savannah.\n\nDespite getting started late into the growing season, and having no mules or agricultural equipment, the freedmen were succeeding, shocking many of their former slave owners, Saxton reported back to headquarters in Washington, DC. \"They have persevered with an industry and energy beyond our most sanguine expectations,\" he wrote.\n\nLife was far from perfect. For those who settled on the Sea Islands, such as Skidaway and Edisto, medical care was scarce. Those on the mainland faced the constant threat of white violence and little chance of justice if they fell victim to it. \"The negroes are frequently murdered, shot down in cold blood, without any provocation except their loyalty and because they assert their freedom,\" Saxton relayed in a letter at the time.\n\n\"I hope and pray that our Government will not listen to the ex-parte statements of the old rulers of these States, many of whom are still traitors at heart, and even now are seeking to grasp again the political power under the old flag,\" Saxton added. \"It will be bad for the Freedmen if these men again get into power.\"\n\nIt wasn't long before Saxton's fears became a reality. In April 1865, just a month after creating the Freedmen's Bureau, Lincoln was assassinated by actor and Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, was an avowed white supremacist who moved quickly to pardon many former Confederates and return their land.\n\n\"[Johnson] used executive power very, very skillfully to undermine transfer of land to Black people, and to really hamstring the Freedmen's Bureau,\" said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University. He added that Johnson acted out of personal prejudice toward the freedmen, but also political expediency. \"By restoring land and by giving pardons to the former landowners in the South, he thought he could make that group of people beholden to him politically.\"\n\nGeneral Oliver Howard, the head of the Freedmen's Bureau, traveled to South Carolina in October 1865 and told the Black families gathered at a church on Edisto Island, south of Charleston, that the president had pardoned their former enslavers, according to the diary of a teacher who was there. Howard suggested that the freedmen could work for the planters, urging them to lay aside bitter feelings and reconcile with their former enslavers.\n\n\"No, never,\" the people murmured, according to the teacher's account. \"Can't do it,\" they said. They burst into song, singing about \"wandering in the wilderness of sorrow and gloom.\"\n\nFor more than a year, a battle raged over who was entitled to the land-the former Confederates or the formerly enslaved. Legislation that would have codified Sherman's field orders into federal law made it through Congress, but was vetoed by Johnson. The Freedmen's Bureau resisted, insisting the property now belonged to the emancipated men and women. \"They felt that they had earned the land. They're the ones who had tamed the land, cultivated the land,\" said Damani Davis, the archivist who oversees the National Archives' Freedmen's Bureau collection. \"Their family and ancestors were buried in the land.\"\n\nThat prompted Johnson to dispatch two generals to ensure that the former slaveholders were reinstalled as landowners. By the time Congress took up another Freedmen's Bureau bill in the summer of 1866, most of the land had been taken back. Lawmakers eventually mustered enough votes to override Johnson's veto and pass a weaker bill that gave a few scraps to some formerly enslaved people who had received land titles and were still on that land. The law swapped out their titles for warrants that allowed them to buy up to 20 acres for $1.50 per acre on government land in Beaufort County, South Carolina, far less than they had originally been promised.\n\nIn parts of the South, violence broke out as former rebels returned to plots that had since been occupied by the emancipated. One Freedmen's Bureau agent reported that a 12-year-old boy had been \"battered and bruised\" by \"his former master, who had driven him off, helpless and hungry, to find food and shelter as best he could.\" Armed members of the Ogeechee Home Guards revolted, landing several of them in jail. (\"The declared intention of the Negroes is to make it impossible for white men to live in this section and then take possession of the plantation themselves,\" the Savannah Morning News reported.) Many other freedmen on the South Carolina Sea Islands refused to work for their former enslavers.\n\nAmong the white Southerners trying to reclaim the rice plantations lost following the war was William Habersham, one of the previous owners of Grove Hill. In January 1866, nine months after Jackson received his 4 acres, Habersham swore his allegiance to the Union and sought a presidential pardon. He enlisted Dan Talmage, a well-connected friend in New York, to make his case.\n\n\"His former slaves wish to labor for him & he is willing to pay them wages or give them a fair share proportion of the crop,\" Talmage wrote to one of his senators in Washington, DC. \"I beg therefore that you use your influence to return him from his embarrassment. The season of planting is near and therefore important to get the matter arranged soon.\"\n\nWhile it is unclear if any of the formerly enslaved were truly interested in working for Habersham again, the appeals on his behalf worked. Within a few days, President Johnson pardoned Habersham, eventually allowing him to reclaim Grove Hill as his own.\n\nMonths later, in November 1866, a federal agent issued Jackson a \"first-class warrant\" to buy land in Beaufort County as consolation for his now worthless title to part of Habersham's plantation. But Jackson wouldn't leave Georgia, instead joining a number of freedmen who stayed in the Savannah area and found jobs as porters, housekeepers, and dockworkers.\n\nJackson was hired as a carpenter for a white man named William Carmichael, who had bought Causton's Bluff, one of the Habersham family's rice plantations. Jackson built shotgun houses for formerly enslaved workers who lived on the land for free, were paid 71 cents per day, and were permitted to use some of the land to plant their own cotton to sell. In 1867, he married Patience Simmons, a freedwoman from South Carolina, according to public records we reviewed. He registered to vote in Savannah.\n\n\"When [the land] was taken away, they didn't wallow in despair,\" wrote Cook Bell, now a historian at Bowie State University, noting that many of the freedmen gathered to build Black towns and found work fishing and raising livestock-and invested in land.\n\nPompey and Patience had seven children. Their daughter Florence Jackson described Pompey as a tall, quiet man who regretted never learning to write, according to Mila Rios, her great-granddaughter. But Pompey did learn to sign his name. A Freedmen's Bureau Bank record from 1874 shows his signature at the bottom. It would take 20 years from the day he opened that bank account until he was finally able to buy his own piece of land.\n\nIn 1894, Jackson paid $75 to purchase a parcel in East Savannah, then an unincorporated part of the city where freed slaves lived. The deed mentioned that Jackson was president of the East Savannah Home Protection Society, which Rios believes was a mutual aid organization he founded for freed people.\n\nFlorence recalled growing up in a shotgun house her father built on that land, and learning to make lye soap from hog fat and dandelion wine from their garden. Pompey ensured all his children learned to read and write, Rios said. Florence completed eighth grade, the highest available to her. But she would spend her life disappointed that, despite her education, the only job she could get in Savannah was washing clothes for white families.\n\nSome of Jackson's descendants joined the wave of Black Americans who migrated north in the early decades of the 20th century. His granddaughter Louise-Florence's daughter-moved to Philadelphia in 1923 because her husband, a construction worker, was being paid less than his white co-workers, Rios said. Florence and her husband followed them north.\n\nBy then, the promise of 40 Acres and a Mule had long faded, and the land title Jackson received was worthless. It would take decades for his granddaughter Louise, who worked as a nurse in a hospital maternity ward, and her husband to save enough money to purchase real estate. In 1951, they bought a quarter of an acre plot in a racially mixed Philadelphia suburb.\n\nOn a warm spring day in 2022, a \"No Trespassing\" sign dangled from a chain-link fence around a stretch of overgrown fields that were once part of Grove Hill. Some of that land is now for sale-the future location of a luxury gated community called The Habersham Plantation. An ad describes it as one of \"Savannah's hidden gems,\" and promised fishing, crabbing, boating, and kayaking on the Grove River.\n\nAn empty 4-acre lot-the size of Pompey Jackson's plot-sold for $250,000 in October 2023. Based on that sale, 40 acres on Grove Hill could be worth about $2.5 million today.\n\nThat kind of generational wealth could have had a huge impact on freedmen and their descendants, said William \"Sandy\" Darity Jr., an economics professor at Duke University and a leading advocate for reparations.\n\n\"There would've been a territory ranging from the Sea Islands to northern Florida that would've been essentially a coastal Black belt community,\" he said. Instead, he noted, Black Americans remained plagued by a wealth gap, possessing just a quarter of the wealth held by white American families. \"That would've had very significant implications for Black economic wellbeing as well as Black political power.\"\n\nIn 1892, decades after the plantation was returned to William Habersham, the land was auctioned to pay off his family's debts. It was purchased by one of his distant cousins, Robert Habersham Elliott, who bought all 1,700 acres for an amount equal to $544,000 in today's dollars. Over the course of the next century, parts of the sprawling plantation would be divided, sold, and developed. In 2005, most of the land that once was Grove Hill was purchased by a developer for $3.2 million. The neighboring old manor house is now a private event space and occasional movie set.\n\nWe reached out to several of William Habersham's potential living descendants through a genealogy platform, but they did not respond. The homeowners association at The Habersham Plantation did not respond to our call or emails.\n\nSitting at the kitchen table of her two-bedroom house in suburban Fort Lauderdale, Mila Rios, Pompey Jackson's great-great-granddaughter, said she was stunned to learn about her family's ­connection to Grove Hill and to 40 Acres and a Mule.\n\n\"Unless you delved into it yourself, you'd never know\" what really happened, Rios said. She said she doesn't expect compensation for the 4 acres of land taken away from her family, though she believes her ancestors were entitled to it. \"Me, personally, I'm not owed a dime,\" she said, before acknowledging that she might feel different had her life included financial hardship.\n\nAfter all, Pompey Jackson's family defied the odds. Rios pulls out a black-and-white photo of her great-grandmother, taken on a sunny day in the early 1960s. Silver bracelets jingle on Rios' wrists as she points out Florence, Florence's daughter Louise, Florence's sister, and some of their friends gathered in their backyard in suburban Philadelphia.\n\nThere, in the house her grandfather built on one-fifth of an acre, Rios experienced a comfortable middle-class childhood. At the mostly white high school she attended, history teachers barely touched upon the era of Reconstruction and 40 Acres and a Mule. Rios attended Bethune-Cookman University, a historically Black college in Florida, and later obtained a PhD in clinical psychology from UCLA. She spent most of her career treating sexually abused girls in Los Angeles. Rios married a successful aerospace engineer, and together they traveled to Switzerland, Paris, and Rome.\n\n\"I've had a fabulous life,\" said Rios, who is now a widow. \"I'm proud of what my ancestors did, or else I wouldn't be...who I am today or where I am today.\"\n\nRios' great-grandmother Florence had hoped to move back to Savannah one day but never did. One of her brothers, however, lived his entire life on the property in Savannah that their father, Pompey, purchased back in 1894. The shotgun house he built is long gone, but the land is still in the family. Its current market value is $55,500, according to the latest appraisal from Chatham County-far less than a 4-acre plot on Grove Hill.\n\nThis project is a collaboration between the Center for Public Integrity, the Center for Investigative Reporting, and the Investigative Reporting Workshop.

      "text": "Tommy Tuberville Decries Reparations as Payments for \"People That Do the Crime\"\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on May 26, 2022. Tom Williams/Congressional Quarterly /ZUMA\n\nOn Saturday, Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) implied Black Americans were \"the people that do the crime\" in comments railing against reparations.\n\nSpeaking at a Donald Trump rally for Republican candidates in Nevada, Tuberville described Democrats as engaged in a battle to take from white people and give to Black people whom he stereotyped as criminals. Democrats \"aren't soft on crime, they're pro-crime,\" Tuberville said, \"[they] want crime because they want to take over what you got, they want to control what you have, they want reparations because they think the people that do the crime are owed that.\"\n\n\"Bullshit!\" he finished. The audience cheered.\n\nTuberville: They want reparation because they think the people that do the crime are owed that! Bullshit! pic.twitter.com/W3mOP5vte7\n\n- Acyn (@Acyn) October 9, 2022\n\nReparations are financial recompense for Black people whose ancestors were enslaved and lived through Jim Crow. The policy of giving reparations to Black Americans has support on the left, but it is not the policy of the Democratic Party. President Joe Biden has said he supports a study on reparations, which is in the party's 2020 platform, but has ignored calls to create such a commission to enact the policy. Democrats do not support violent crime as a way of seizing property to compensate for the harms done by slavery and legal oppression.\n\nBut Tuberville's point is not to describe actual policy proposals. It's to reinforce the general animating feature of the MAGA worldview that white Americans are embattled as non-white people seek to replace them, disempower them, and take their wealth. It's a zero-sum politics of us versus them: As Tuberville put it, \"the people that do the crime\" and \"you.\"\n\nThe press often writes about the political dog whistles-racist political appeals conveyed through coded language-that politicians deploy to win votes. But as Mother Jones ' Tim Murphy recently wrote , the whistle, only audible to a few, has been replaced in recent years by a bull horn. Often, \"this speech isn't coded so much as it's loaded.\"\n\nTuberville's speech perfectly encapsulates this point.\n\nIt shouldn't be lost that at the same time that the Republican Party, under Trump's influence, has become more explicit in its use of racism, the Trumpist vision of the country is that racism is not only over but that its real victims are now white people.\n\nIt's not just rhetoric, either. This is also the party's legal position. At the same time that Alabama's senator is describing politics as a contest over resources between white people and Black people, the state of Alabama, in a case now before the Supreme Court, wants to roll back the 1965 Voting Rights Act to allow the state to draw political maps that disempower Black voters by gerrymandering them out of office. Forcing the Alabama to draw maps that give opportunities to Black voters, one of the state's briefs said , \" reduces individual Alabamians to members of competing racial monoliths.\" It's hard to think of a better way to characterize Tuberville's comments.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Reparations and Bernie Sanders: Another View\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates recently criticized Bernie Sanders for saying he opposed reparations. I responded briefly last week, but Max Sawicky has more to say about this, and a couple of days ago asked if he could say it here. Well, why not? I'm not the best guy in the world to defend a socialist, after all. So here's Max on reparations and Bernie Sanders.\n\nBy Max Sawicky\n\nI read Ta-Nehisi Coates. Sometimes I like what I see, but not so much this past week. I'm here to take exception to his recent columns on Bernie Sanders and reparations.\n\nIn the Hillary vs. Bernie civil war, we often attack each other on spurious grounds. You're just looking for a job. You're corrupt in ways multifarious. You're ____splaining. Please. The objective of politics is to encourage people to voluntarily and happily come around to your own view on what is to be done . Browbeating is counterproductive. At the end of this little adventure, we all have to get behind blocking a Republican from the presidency, and the ensuing barbarism. I have nothing bad to say about Ta-Nehisi Coates the person, and you shouldn't either. Let's get to the meat and potatoes.\n\nI'll start with his basic case for reparations. Exhibit A is the big, justly praised essay in The Atlantic . I will stipulate that the fact of a debt of the United States to African-Americans is incontrovertible. Reading the essay made me more convinced of that than before. Whether that justifies trashing Sanders is a different matter.\n\nTNC's basic argument is that the Sanders campaign purports to be a radical break with the status quo but fails to live up to its name. Even worse, it is of a piece with white supremacy.\n\nThe polemic launches with a basic misinterpretation of Sanders' remark that reparations is \"divisive,\" driven by Coates' bitter rejoinder that socialism and single-payer are divisive too. But these are very different kinds of \"divisive.\" In the case of reparations, don't kid yourself: it means instant electoral suicide. With single-payer, it means opposition from moneyed interests. Single-payer is popular. Socialism could be too, sooner I would say than reparations, since for Bernie socialism means a welfare state turbocharged by expanding universal, race-blind programs.\n\nWhat's more, single-payer advocacy could pay dividends in the form of incremental improvements to Obamacare, such as a public option or a crackdown on prescription drug prices. The same is true of other proposals, such as free college or massive infrastructure investment. That aside, even with zero cooperation from Congress, a president has command of important executive levers . Reparations is more of an all-or-nothing thing.\n\nI'd like to see a scenario in which reparations becomes popular. The appeals are usually moralistic. I am susceptible to such appeals, and probably you are too. Would that MoJo readers ruled the world, but we don't.\n\nCoates is offended by reparations' unpopularity, and we should be as well, but it remains a fact. Bernie is running to win , not to mount a symbolic campaign. He could be criticized for inattention to other issues, such as defense spending, reproductive rights, and Israel/Palestine. Coates has no such handicaps. As he says, \"Sometimes the moral course lies outside of the politically possible.\" Precisely! This is national, presidential politics, not an Atlantic symposium. If you're searching for the moral course, you are not about winning an election.\n\nIn the final paragraph of his first blast, Coates goes over the top:\n\nReparations is not one possible tool against white supremacy. It is the indispensable tool against white supremacy. One cannot propose to plunder a people, incur a moral and monetary debt, propose to never pay it back, and then claim to be seriously engaging in the fight against white supremacy.\n\nEvidently Sanders is not merely neglecting racism, he is proposing to maintain it. In his follow-up column , Coates describes Sanders' lapse as \"making peace with white supremacy.\"\n\nBesides the slurs are the politics:\n\nSanders's basic approach is to ameliorate the effects of racism through broad, mostly class-based policies-doubling the minimum wage, offering single-payer health-care, delivering free higher education. This is the same \"A rising tide lifts all boats\" thinking that has dominated Democratic anti-racist policy for a generation.\n\nI don't think I need to explain that John F. Kennedy's original \"rising tide,\" beloved by subsequent centrist Democrats, referred to economic growth providing universal benefit. It clearly does no longer. (I would say it never did.) That's Bernie's point. Nor should I need to explain that because minorities are concentrated in low-wage jobs, an increase in the minimum wage or a reduction in the unemployment rate disproportionately benefits them. I assume TNC is aware of it. He's not dumb, so failure to acknowledge it is questionable politics.\n\nHe goes on:\n\nSanders proposes to intensify this approach. But Sanders's actual approach is really no different than President Obama's.\n\nReally? There is no difference between Sanders and Obama? Or Clinton? If an expansion of universal programs ameliorates (but doesn't end) racism, a bigger expansion does so to a greater extent. Size matters. There's a huge difference between Obamacare and Medicare-for-all, and opponents of these programs know it. In fact, much of the opposition to Sanders' sort of proposals-not to mention Obamacare itself-is founded, ironically, precisely on the accurate impression of a disparate racial impact.\n\nI began declaring my support for the concept of reparations. Since we're talking politics and policy, the question looms of what to propose. Coates repeatedly insists that universal social-democratic programs are all well and good, but they are woefully inadequate responses to racism. They are mere \"bandages\" on the wound. This is a gross exaggeration, see the above example of the minimum wage, but strictly speaking it is true. So the knock on Sanders rests on what he refuses to support. What is the Coates alternative?\n\nAs Kevin pointed out , TNC claims a solution may be found in a bill (H.R. 40) from Rep. John Conyers that he has introduced every year, since at least 2001. It would form a commission to study reparations and devise programs. This is pretty weak stuff. I've worked in Washington D.C. since 1984. Politicians propose commissions and studies when they can't do anything, when they don't want to do anything, or when they don't know what else to do . I would credit Conyers with a gambit to start an official conversation. I'm for it, but it isn't much. It would actually be easy for Bernie to endorse. But it's still a pretty insubstantial thing, in and of itself.\n\nYou can check the legislative history. In years past H.R. 40 garnered as many as 35 or 40 co-sponsors, mostly members of the Black Caucus and a few avant-garde types like Dennis Kucinich and Jerry Nadler. In more recent years, there have been hardly any (two at most) co-sponsors of the bill, white or black. It makes no sense to excoriate Bernie Sanders for inadequate attention to racism in a national presidential campaign, for failure to support a proposal that most members of the Congressional Black Caucus, not to mention Barack Obama, have not bothered to endorse for years, or ever.\n\nOn the other hand, Coates has kind words for \"a program of job training and public works that takes racial justice as its mission but includes the poor of all races.\" Of course, this kind of race-blind, racially progressive program is Bernie's bread and butter. In a subsequent post , Coates cites the work of William Darity, a distinguished economist, as a source for specific proposals. I would like people to be more familiar with this work, but at present I'm afraid that promotion of race-targeted payments is not a political exercise.\n\nCoates wants to see a national moral reckoning with the debt created by centuries of white supremacy. Moral reckonings are the stuff of conferences, anthologies, sermons, and long-form magazine articles. Politics is a different business. When it comes to politics , Coates is shooting blanks.\n\nExcept for this: you might think Coates is an equal-opportunity critic of Clinton and Sanders. He recently dinged Hillary for her shaky understanding of Reconstruction. But what he's really implying is that there's nothing special about the Sanders campaign, so you lose nothing by voting for the more electable Clinton.\n\nWhite supremacy happened before capitalism, but along with other fans of the great bearded one, I would assert that the two came to be deeply interconnected. Capitalism creates legions of victims whose descendants are owed more than all the money in the world. It also creates a potential army of comrades. The Sanders campaign is the first opening towards such a movement in a long time.\n\nFor a more critical view of reparations from the left, see Doug Henwood's interview with Professor Adolph Reed.

      "text": "Uncounted Millions: Reparations Now\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nAdele Flateau: Some people feel like this has nothing to do with us. You know, reparations, why? Because this is something that, you know, other generations did. We had nothing to do with slavery. But I think what they failed to realize is that, let's say in our case, the reparations that he did get, even though it was meager compared to the value of how do you value a person, your own family.\n\nBut he was able to uplift his own family, but then that became future generations who were educated, became professionals, doctors, lawyers, people who were able to help respectively uplift their own communities. So that -- so we reverberated now to us 200 years later. So when people say that, you know, that's in the past, it's not really in the past because there are people who didn't benefit like we did.\n\nThe vast majority, basically, you would say of Black people did not have any benefit whatsoever. So, imagine if they had that little step up at that time, you know. It would have changed the course of lives of millions of people.\n\nRep. Steve Cohen: The Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties will come to order --\n\nTrymaine Lee: On June 19th, 2019, Congress held a hearing. This hearing had been a long time coming, a step in securing for millions of Black Americans what Gabriel Coakley had managed to win for his family a century and a half earlier.\n\nRep. Cohen: But the greatest credit for H.R. 40 belongs to two individuals. First and foremost, Mr. John Conyers.\n\nLee: In 1989, a year after the successful passage of the Civil Liberties Act, which granted Japanese Americans reparations, Michigan Representative John Conyers introduced a bill that he hoped would follow a similar process to study reparations for Black Americans. H.R. 40, nodding to the failed promise of 40 acres and a mule, was introduced year after year and went nowhere for 30 straight years until that day.\n\nRep. Cohen: Enacting H.R. 40 will be an important step in finding effective long-term solutions to these problems, ones that can trace their origins to our nation's shameful history of slavery and anti-Black racism.\n\nLee: This hearing was more than two years into Trump's presidency, but the Democrats had recently won back the House in the midterm elections.\n\nRep. Cohen: And now I'd like to recognize the gentlelady from Texas for an opening statement, Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee.\n\nLee: Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee is now picking up the mantle of retired Congressman John Conyers.\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee: H.R. 40 is, in fact, the response of the United States of America long overdue. Slavery is the original sin, and the idea of this commission should be welcomed by all Americans.\n\nDanny Glover: I sit here as the great grandson of a former slave, Mary Brown. I had the fortune of meeting her as a small child.\n\nLee: There was a long list of notable speakers on both sides of the debate, like actor and activist Danny Glover.\n\nGlover: This hearing is yet another important step in the long and heroic struggle of African Americans to secure reparations for the damages inflicted by enslavement and racial exclusionary policies.\n\nLee: And writer Coleman Hughes --\n\nColeman Hughes: If we were to pay reparations today, we would only divide the country further, making it harder to build the political coalitions required to solve the problems facing Black people today. We would insult many Black Americans by putting a price on the suffering of their ancestors.\n\nLee: The ranking member of the subcommittee was a relatively unknown second term congressman from Louisiana named Mike Johnson.\n\nRep. Mike Johnson: But putting aside the injustice of monetary reparations from current taxpayers for the sins of a small subset of Americans from many generations ago -- let me finish. The fair distribution of reparations would be nearly impossible once one considers the complexity of the American struggle to abolish slavery.\n\nJust consider this, okay. There are tens of millions of today's non-African Americans who are descended from people who arrived in the country, of course, after slavery ended. And therefore they can't be held responsible for its legacy.\n\nLee: Today, of course, he is the Speaker of the House. But the day truly belonged to a man who has become pivotal in the modern-day discussion of reparations, Ta-Nehisi Coates.\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates: Yesterday, when asked about reparations, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered a familiar reply. America should not be held liable for something that happened 150 years ago since none of us currently alive are responsible. This rebuttal proffers a strange theory of governance that American accounts are somehow bound by the lifetime of its generations.\n\nBut well into this century, the United States was still paying out pensions to the heirs of Civil War soldiers. We honor treaties that date back some 200 years, despite no one being alive who signed those treaties. We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance.\n\nAnd the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that, a dilemma of inheritance. It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery. By the time the enslaved were emancipated, they comprised the largest single asset in America, $3 billion in 1860 dollars, more than all the other assets in the country combined.\n\nThe method of cultivating this asset was neither gentle cajoling, nor persuasion, but torture, rape, and child trafficking. Mr. McConnell was not alive for Appomattox, but he was alive for the electrocution of George Steny. He was alive for the blinding of Isaac Woodward. He was alive to witness kleptocracy in his native Alabama, and a regime premised on electoral theft.\n\nMajority Leader McConnell cited civil rights legislation yesterday, as well he should, because he was alive to witness the harassment, jailing, and betrayal of those responsible for that legislation by a government sworn to protect them. What this committee must know is that while emancipation deadbolted the door against the bandits of America, Jim Crow wedged the windows wide open.\n\nAnd that is the thing about Senator McConnell's something. It was 150 years ago, and it was right now. In H.R. 40, this body has a chance to project fair-weather patriotism. To say that a nation is both its credits and its debits. That if Thomas Jefferson matters, so does Sally Hemings. That if D-Day matters, so does Black Wall Street. That if Valley Forge matters, so does Fort Pillow.\n\nBecause the question really is not whether we will be tied to the somethings of our past, but whether we are courageous enough to be tied to the whole of them. Thank you.\n\nLee: The hearing room was so packed that several overflow rooms were set up to accommodate the largely Black crowd, some of whom had traveled great distances to witness this day. The hearing was well over three hours long.\n\nRep. Cohen: And with that, the hearing is adjourned.\n\nLee: But in the end, it was just that, a hearing. There would be no floor vote for H.R. 40, no path for legislation to merely study reparations. Even still, it was a watershed moment for the reparations movement, a momentum-building event that would help fuel the flurry of proposals we see today.\n\nNewscaster: Racism and slavery in Boston getting historic reconsideration with a new reparations task force.\n\nLee: And new ideas around what could constitute reparations.\n\nNewscaster: Evanston City Council voted 8-1 to approve reparations to Black residents. Those approved can use up to $25,000 for things like down payments, home improvement, or mortgage assistance.\n\nLee: And for the many times great-grandchildren of one of the only Black families to ever receive reparations, that fight is not far from home.\n\nJohn Flateau: We're waiting on the governor to sign that bill. It did pass the legislature.\n\nLee: What's the bill?\n\nJohn Flateau: It's a reparations commission for the state of New York.\n\nLee: Today, in 2024, is the bill finally coming due?\n\nWhat's the number that you put on reparations in America?\n\nDr. William Darity: It's about $16 trillion.\n\nLee: $16 trillion. That's a lot.\n\nDarity: But that's the figure. That's the gap.\n\nLee: It is what it is.\n\nThe number may be high, perhaps even hard to fully wrap your mind around. But many are saying the time for payback has finally come.\n\nDreisen Heath: I will see meaningful reparations in my lifetime. You know, this is our rent for living on Earth. It's to fight for this issue.\n\nLee: I'm Trymaine Lee, and this is \"Into America.\"\n\nThe Coakley legacy shows us what could have been, but what is going to be. On the final episode of \"Uncounted Millions,\" the descendants of Gabriel Coakley make their way back east where a century and a half of boundary pushing and foundation building would culminate in a new generation of activists, entrepreneurs, and movement makers, pushing the United States to finally repair what's been broken.\n\nLee: Act One: A New Legacy.\n\nWe've been following this family through the generations. From the nation's capital, where Gabriel Coakley was freeing his people and finessing reparations from the government, to the next in line, who were building off those seeds and watched their family's roots flourish.\n\nAnd then to the other side of the family tree, in the deep South, to those who found fortune in the tumultuous time after Reconstruction, but could not hold on to it. To the moment where these two families would meet, fleeing violence and chasing opportunity in the Golden State.\n\nBut the next era after the war would bring the newlywed couple, Sidney and Jean Flateau, parents of Adele, John and Richard, back east to New York.\n\nRichard Flateau: I can remember a bell being rung.\n\nLee: Here's Richard Flateau from our conversation at John's house in Brooklyn.\n\nRichard Flateau: My parents had a cowbell.\n\nJohn Flateau: Yes.\n\nRichard Flateau: And when it was time for dinner, somebody would ring the bell and that's how we would know, you know, it was time for dinner.\n\nJohn Flateau: We were living in that three-story house right on Clawson, seven kids spread out. But when you hear that bell, you better respond to that bell and you better be sitting at that dinner table if you wanted to have dinner. So that was --\n\nLee: The family would settle in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, and they continued to grow.\n\nRichard Flateau: You know, there were a lot of changes taking place. And by the time I was growing up, I think most of the whites had moved out of the area.\n\nLee: These children would come of age as neighborhoods in the city were literally being divided and devalued by infrastructure projects, and as white flight was stripping parts of the city of money and resources. And of course, fiery social movements were roaring across the country, including right here in New York. Anti-war, civil rights, Stonewall, Black Power.\n\nThe family continually stressed that it wasn't just money and opportunity that they would inherit. There was always a sense of service, a mission.\n\nAdele Flateau: This is what we're supposed to do. We're supposed to help our families, to educate our community, to uplift the community.\n\nLee: Both parents embodied this. Their mother, Jean, had a career as a social worker in Brooklyn. Their father, Sidney, spent many years working in the aeronautical business, but then followed Jean, finishing his graduate degree and starting his own career in social work. Whether through their professional work or work in the community, Sidney and Jean held a torch for the next generation in the fight for Black equality.\n\nAnd the siblings, in their own unique ways, carried this light of service. Richard had a knack for business, a connection with great, great, great granddaddy Coakley that he can't brush off.\n\nRichard Flateau: In terms of entrepreneurialism, I didn't hear my parents talk about it much, but then going back now and looking at what Coakley did, he had businesses, so he had restaurants, and I've been an entrepreneur for most of my career, so I have a business.\n\nLee: I know where the impulse starts, but it's in you.\n\nRichard Flateau: Yes. Exactly.\n\nLee: Richard would serve on Bed-Stuy's community board for 13 years, and there was also his faith.\n\nRichard Flateau: I've been a trustee of a church, so there's a direct connection there. I've been a trustee of a Catholic church, involved, well, actually three churches, a parish that has three churches.\n\nLee: For Adele, it started with activism and education in the late '60s.\n\nAdele Flateau: I was engaged in political activism at Brooklyn College. At that time, we were advocating for free tuition and to get more people of color in general into the city university system.\n\nLee: Adele was part of a student movement fighting for greater access and support for students of color through boycotts, strikes, and even occupations of campus buildings at Brooklyn College.\n\nAdele Flateau: And I'd say we were pretty successful, you know, as a group in doing that and raising awareness about that.\n\nLee: The movement pushed Mayor John Lindsay and the school's chancellor into implementing an open admissions policy several years ahead of schedule, which drastically overhauled the entire city university of New York system.\n\nAdele Flateau: And then, you know, I was involved in another movement, which is more like a socialist organization. And so it gave me more of an international perspective on inequities that were happening outside of the U.S.\n\nLee: Adele even spent significant time in England and France organizing with radical workers movements. Eventually, she made her way back to Brooklyn, where she went back to school, settled down and started a family and ended up with a 30-year career in health care administration. But she's never stopped advocating for Black education.\n\nAdele Flateau: Right now, I'm part of a legacy sort of organization that my mother was involved in for 43 years. And she recruited all of her daughters into what's called the National Association of University Women. And so all of us have been involved in helping, like to raise scholarships. So, again, it's like a continuation of really what was started, you know, by our ancestors.\n\nLee: John Flateau went the academic route.\n\nJohn Flateau: I'm a professor at Medgar Evers College right here in Brooklyn. I teach government, public policy, American history, political science.\n\nLee: But John, he didn't just teach politics. He shaped politics.\n\nJohn Flateau: Prior to that, I've served in a number of government positions, executive positions for the state of New York and the city of New York.\n\nLee: This is pretty humble of John, who for decades was at the center of electoral politics in New York. From 1975 to 1982, he served as the executive director of the New York State Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus. 1982 was also the year that he was the lead plaintiff in a case to redraw congressional and state legislative lines.\n\nHe would continue to focus on voting rights, serving as an elections commissioner on New York's Independent Redistricting Commission. He was not a politician, but he was always in the mix. In the early '90s, John was chief of staff for New York City's first Black mayor, David Dinkins. And in more recent years, he was in a reparations in New York state of mind. It was one of the first things he told me when we met, before we'd even set everything up.\n\nJohn Flateau: We're doing a reparations forum at Medgar Evers College on Friday. And I'll be on that panel. We're waiting on the governor to sign that bill. It did pass the legislature.\n\nLee: What's the bill? I haven't heard of it.\n\nJohn Flateau: It's a reparations commission for the state of New York.\n\nLee: Right.\n\nJohn Flateau: Yeah.\n\nLee: In June of 2023, the New York legislature passed a bill to establish the state's own reparations commission in the vein of Illinois and California.\n\nSen. Zellnor Myrie: There's a misconception that New York was hands off in the enslavement of people of African descent.\n\nLee: New York State Senator Zellnor Myrie was one of the Democrats pushing for this bill to be signed.\n\nSen. Myrie: A lot of things that this city and state take pride in, being the financial capital of the world, that was rooted in the enslavement of people. Slaves were sold on Wall Street. A lot of the banks that dominate our financial ecosystem now, they financed people who owned slaves and other people along the supply chain in the Atlantic slave trade. So, this is a conversation that needs to happen and certainly needs to happen in New York.\n\nLee: But the bill sat on Governor Kathy Hochul's desk for weeks and weeks. As fall cooled into winter, the pressure on Governor Hochul was heating up.\n\nProtestors: Sign the bill! Sign the bill! Sign the bill!\n\nSen. Cordell Cleare: Reparations. Yesterday. My son says today, but we need reparations yesterday. And there's a lot more that --\n\nProtestor: This is an historic legislation that needs to be signed. The governor needs to know that this needs to be one of her top priorities.\n\nLee: And then, on December 19th, it finally happened.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul: By signing this bill today, I'm authorizing the creation of a commission, a committee to study what reparations might look like in New York. Let's be clear about what reparations means. It doesn't mean fixing the past, undoing what happened. We can't do that. No one can. But it does mean more than giving people a simple apology 150 years later.\n\nSen. Myrie: Dr. Flateau was a major champion of this bill and in fact was at the bill signing when it was signed into law.\n\nLee: Senator Myrie not only represents several neighborhoods in Central Brooklyn, including parts of Bed-Stuy. He considers John to be a friend and mentor.\n\nSen. Myrie: Dr. Flateau, he was always updating you, whether you asked for it or not. And on reparations, he was so consistent in sending e-mails, certainly to me, but I imagine to many other folks, about this being on the governor's desk, about this being a priority, and whether or not we were going to get it signed. And so it was incredible to see him there and present when it was signed and to see him send a celebratory e-mail and say, we finally did it.\n\nLee: This must have been a true moment of triumph for John. But the actual work of this task force, the research, the recommendations, any kind of tangible reparations for Black New Yorkers, John will never get to see.\n\nOn December 30th of 2023, John Flateau died suddenly at his home. He was 73 years old.\n\nNewscaster: Capitol leaders are remembering a pioneer of the state's redistricting process.\n\nNewscaster: Dr. John Flateau recently passed away. His services were held today in Brooklyn. He was a commissioner on New York's Independent Redistricting Commission and dedicated much of his life to public service.\n\nLee: This story from ABC News 10 was one of many remembrances that John would receive in the coming weeks. U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, another son of Brooklyn, issued a statement offering his condolences and remembering his impact on the community and political landscape. So, too, did former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nHis memorial services were attended by an equally as impressive cast of political movers and shakers and power brokers, past and present, including current Mayor Eric Adams. And the eulogies were especially moving, focusing on John's dedication to lifting his community.\n\nJim Harden: Because John Flateau was a great leader. And when the books are written about great Black Americans, John Flateau has a place.\n\nNew York State Senate: Senate Resolution 1466 by Senator Stuart Cousins mourning the death of Dr. John Lewis Flateau, devoted family man, dedicated professor and distinguished member of his community.\n\nLee: A resolution was introduced in his memory by New York State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stuart Cousins, one of the champions of New York's reparations bill.\n\nSen. Andrea Stuart Cousins: And I'm just so happy that the fulfillment of something that he worked for for so long in so many ways happened before he transitioned.\n\nLee: Among those who paid tribute on the Senate floor was Senator Myrie.\n\nSen. Myrie: I would not be standing here today if not for Dr. Flateau. He paved a way for many of us, but particularly for people that look like me and particularly for young Black men in Brooklyn. In this country's history, we have said we care about democracy, but it took the struggle, particularly of Black Americans, to perfect our democracy, to hold us to that higher standard.\n\nAnd Dr. Flateau was such a perfecter because he didn't just know about the grand and big ideas, he knew the minutiae. And he knew that the minutiae was where the momentum actually was. And that that's how they had kept people down for a long time in the details. He knew the details better than anyone else.\n\nAnd so I find it appropriate that today, not only are we honoring him with this resolution, but we are naming a bill after him to create an elections and voting academic center here in this state. Because the details matter. We can only perfect our democracy with people who care deeply about those it affects the most. And Dr. Flateau was such a person.\n\nLee: I only got to meet John once, that first time, when I met the family in his living room, when we recorded this nearly four-hour sit-down interview that you've all heard so much of. We were hoping to speak to John even more, to soak up every last bit of his story, of his family story. But as it goes, there's never enough time.\n\nI've been coming back to this one moment from that sit-down at his house. It was just, you know, this short, casual moment. The kind so often left in a pile on the cutting room floor.\n\nYeah, thank y'all. Thank y'all seriously for having us. We really do appreciate this. It's good.\n\nJohn Flateau: No, we appreciate.\n\nLee: Thank you.\n\nJohn Flateau: And we happen to be in almost in the same place at the same time. You've just a neighborhood won over and --\n\nLee: Yeah.\n\nJohn Flateau: -- and timing just came together.\n\nLee: It happens like that.\n\nJohn Flateau: Providentially, yes.\n\nLee: That's right.\n\nProvidentially. I love that word. Providentially. It's hard not to feel that way. This family, this story, all the questions and mysteries, the lost and found records, all just revealed itself in a way that's hard to chalk up to anything but providence.\n\nThe family will continue to honor John the best way they know how, by pushing for the things he believed in most, like reparations for New Yorkers.\n\nAdele Flateau: He would definitely be very excited about it because most of his career was focused around building equity, you know, building racial equality, political empowerment, and laying out the facts of what was going on in Black America. So we're going to miss that from him.\n\nLee: We'll be right back.\n\nAct Two: An Uphill Battle\n\nAfter a lifetime of service, John's legacy has now been solidified with his push for a reparations task force in New York. An action which, if carried through to its most optimistic conclusion, could one day result in reparations that might change the lives of millions of Black residents.\n\nWith the signing of this reparations commission bill, New York joined California and Illinois as the three states with task forces. California recently introduced a slew of bills in response to the state's reparations report.\n\nNewscaster: And the legislative Black Caucus formally introduced more than a dozen bills they say will lead to the start of reparations for California descendants of enslaved Black Americans. It comes less than a year after the California reparations task force submitted this 1,000 plus page recommendations report to the governor and legislature.\n\nLee: Cities and municipalities are getting involved too. The city of San Francisco started looking into this issue, suggesting that Black residents could be owed as much as $5 million each in reparations. And in Evanston, Illinois, they've already gotten started.\n\nNewscaster: Eligible Black people can receive up to $25,000 each to use for housing. The money will come from tax revenue collected from the sales of recreational marijuana. The bill --\n\nLee: Over 100 applicants have received funding since the program's approval in 2019, with 80 more expected to receive payment this year. There are now dozens of municipalities who are somewhere in the process of at least studying reparations. And all of this movement begs the question, what about the federal government?\n\nSen. Myrie: Our federal government is a large, large, large ship that takes a very long time to turn. And our states can be a little bit more flexible.\n\nLee: New York State Senator Zellnor Myrie.\n\nSen. Myrie: But on reparations, I do think that there has to be a national conversation about this because this is a national sin. And so I think it merits a national response.\n\nLee: In 2021, the White House said it would support the idea of studying reparations. That same year, H.R. 40 was advanced out of committee, the furthest the bill had ever gotten in the three decades since Conyers first introduced it. Last year, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee reintroduced the bill and got the most co-sponsors to sign on in its history.\n\nBut it still has never received a floor vote. And to be crystal clear, H.R. 40 is a bill for the study of reparations, not actual reparations. But it's not the only federal effort. Representative Barbara Lee, who we heard from last episode, is pushing to establish a commission on truth, racial healing and transformation to examine the effects of slavery.\n\nThe bill has been supported by Representative Cori Bush, who has put forth her own bill, co-sponsored by Jamal Bowman from New York. This bill goes further than just studying reparations. They're calling on the federal government to actually pay them to the tune of $14 trillion.\n\nRep. Cori Bush: What we are working on is we're looking at the Black-white wealth gap, which is about $14 trillion. So there, you know, we have scholars like Dr. Sandy Darity and others who have been working on a dollar amount, looking at what that is. And so what we say is --\n\nDarity: When thinking about what the components of a reparations plan must be, the priority is to eliminate the racial wealth gap.\n\nLee: Dr. William Darity is a professor of public policy at Duke University. He launched an entire research field called stratification economics that looks at economic inequality across social groups. He is also considered one of the foremost scholars on reparations. His book, \"From Here to Equality,\" co-written with A. Kirsten Mullen, explains that full repair would require three building blocks, acknowledgement, redress and closure.\n\nDarity: We have a partial checkmark on the first, acknowledgement. Circa 2006, 2007, each branch of Congress provided an apology for slavery. It did not provide a full scale apology for all of the atrocities that took place after slavery ended, which I think are central to any case for reparations. But the Senate's version of the apology said specifically that this was not a basis for a claim for restitution.\n\nLee: So they were already thinking like, okay, let's not go too far because then we'll help establish a foundation for this greater push for reparations.\n\nDarity: Exactly.\n\nLee: For Darity, it all comes back to the racial wealth gap.\n\nDarity: So we think of the wealth gap as capturing the cumulative intergenerational effects of white supremacy. So that all of these factors that would have gone into influencing the capacity of Black families to accumulate wealth are captured in the current statistic of the disparity.\n\nLee: I wonder how do you quantify the wealth gap between Black and white Americans today? In your research, in your understanding of the situation, where are we today?\n\nDarity: The 2022 data indicates that the average difference in wealth between a Black and a white household in the United States is $1.15 million. If we were to try to break that down into a per person estimate, $390,000 to $400,000 per person. That differential is immense. And it is reflective of the gap in the capacity of Black Americans to participate fully as citizens.\n\nLee: So the average white family has more than a million dollars' worth of wealth compared to an average Black family?\n\nDarity: The average white family, yes.\n\nLee: When it comes to what we do have, though, where is our wealth concentrated in terms of, you know, where it sits on the scale?\n\nDarity: Among those Black Americans who have some type of significant net worth, the primary source of wealth for those households is equity in their homes. When we start talking about more affluent white households, their sources of wealth are far more diverse.\n\nWe're talking about non-residential property. We're talking about business ownership. We're talking about pensions. And we're also talking about ownership of financial assets, participation in the stock exchange. And to be a player in terms of buying stocks and bonds, you have to have a certain threshold of wealth in the first place. And so we don't have the opportunity to pursue some of these higher return options at all. And so if we could change the racial wealth distribution in the United States, we could change the character of this country.\n\nLee: When you add up that million dollars plus gap for Black families today, the number is staggering.\n\nDarity: If you estimate that there are about 40 million Black Americans whose ancestors were enslaved in the United States, 40 million times $400,000 gives you that rough estimate of $16 trillion.\n\nLee: What's the number that you put on reparations in America?\n\nDarity: It's about $16 trillion.\n\nLee: $16 trillion. That's a lot.\n\nDarity: Yeah, but that's the figure. That's the gap.\n\nLee: It is what it is.\n\nCori Bush's current bill, titled Reparations Now, cited Darity's work and gave a $14 trillion price tag. But as time ticks on, that price tag goes up and up.\n\nDarity: The $14 trillion figure was generated based upon the 2019 data. The $16 trillion is from the 2022 data. So it's just an indication that the longer we wait, the larger the bill gets.\n\nLee: Is it hard for people to -- obviously, for some people, reparations is just, they can't even -- anti-Blackness and the state in which we exist in this country is so baked in where it's hard for people to even imagine paying back Black people for all that was stolen from us. But is it hard for people to understand these numbers? Because these are big numbers. Is it hard for people to get their heads around of what is that worth?\n\nDarity: Yeah. It is. It's a big number, and it's hard for people to get their heads around it. And I try to use the following illustration. If generous donors put $1 billion into a fund on a monthly basis, it would take a millennium for them to get to $16 trillion.\n\nLee: Then there's the question of eligibility. Dr. Darity proposes two standards to qualify.\n\nDarity: The first is a lineage standard. An individual would have to demonstrate that they have at least one ancestor who was enslaved in the United States. But the second is an identity standard. And what we say is the following. An individual would have to have self-identified as Black, Negro, African American, or Afro-American for at least 12 years before the adoption of a reparations program or the adoption of a study commission for reparations.\n\nLee: This question of eligibility is still a pretty contested subject. But this standard that Darity outlines is commonly used in reparation frameworks. California's task force recommended a similar standard regarding lineage, a direct line to someone who was enslaved.\n\nIs there a dollar amount that would, you know, heal us as Black Americans in this country that doesn't change the white supremacy, that doesn't change the political dynamics? Does reparations do what we would hope and dream it would do? Or is it just purely about here's a financial representation of what is owed?\n\nDarity: I think it's more the latter. But I also think it's the basis for giving Black Americans the material conditions for full citizenship. A more affluent Black community would also be in a better political position than it is today. But no, I don't really have much of a focus on healing and repair and psychological, emotional --\n\nLee: Cut the check.\n\nDarity: Yeah, cut the check and let the folks who receive those checks do with it what they see fit for the purposes of improving their own lives.\n\nLee: So if the federal government was willing to, you know, push through legislation that they would consider a reparations bill that would pay for all the damages and stolen money and what is owed, but it was short of $16 trillion, would that be insufficient?\n\nDarity: Depends on how far short it was of $16 trillion.\n\nLee: We'll take $2 trillion short, but $10 trillion short is --\n\nDarity: Yeah, yeah. I mean -- and that ultimately is up to Black American descendants of U.S. slavery.\n\nLee: Do you honestly and truly believe that the federal government of the United States will ever pay descendants of enslaved people reparations? Do you believe that reparations will actually happen at some point in America?\n\nDarity: I hope reparations will happen at some point in America. There are some signals that suggest that the possibility is there. Not tomorrow. But I bring to mind a study that was done in the year 2000. And at that time they found that 4 percent of white Americans endorsed monetary payments as reparations to Black Americans. That's F-O-U-R, 4 percent.\n\nLee: Wow.\n\nDarity: A study that was completed by a team of researchers at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst at the beginning of 2023 found that the percentage of white Americans who support monetary payments as reparations for Black Americans is now closer to 30 percent.\n\nLee: The team of researchers was headed up by Dr. Tatishe Nteta, a political science professor at University of Massachusetts, Amherst.\n\nDr. Tatishe Nteta: The best public opinion data goes back to really about the 1980s. And what you find when you look at that data is that consistently large percentages of Americans expressing opposition to any form of reparations directed at African Americans. It is much more popular today than it has been in the past.\n\nAnd so when you think about where we're at in the United States, about 35 to 38 percent express some level of support for reparations, whether that's cash payments or housing assistance or educational assistance or even just symbolic in terms of apologies. And so this is a high point in the level of support expressed by Americans writ-large for these policies.\n\nLee: How did those numbers skew in terms of Black and white? Were you seeing the outcomes very different?\n\nNteta: African Americans are, and this is not surprising, are overwhelmingly supportive of reparations. About three quarters of African Americans express support for reparations. But whites are on the other side, a majority of whites express opposition to reparations. What we also see is what people say is the great awakening of America.\n\nProgressives, Biden voters, and Democrats all support reparations in all of its forms. So majorities of those groups. And so, you know, as we look forward to the future and if we assume that younger generations will continue to sort of liberalize on these issues, we may see an increase in support for a policy like reparations, but we're not there yet. We're not at majoritarian support just quite yet.\n\nLee: So three quarters of Black folks who were polled said they supported that last quarter, what were they saying like? What do you find about Black folks who oppose reparations? What were they saying?\n\nNteta: So if you assume that people are motivated by self-interest, that there's a non-trivial portion of the African American community that if reparations are paid will not qualify. Like my parents came from South Africa in 1965. I was born here in the United States. I've been socialized as an African American. I identify as such, but no one in my family would be qualified for reparations.\n\nIt does place a dividing line in the Black community that a number of people have highlighted. At least reparations as directed towards the descendants of slaves. Now, if you flip the script and talk about reparations, not about slavery, but talk about reparations for things like Jim Crow, then you widen the circle and you include more folks.\n\nAnd what's interesting based on our polling is that reparations for Jim Crow are much more popular. And so the question going forward for the movement is whether or not the focus is going to maintain on reparations for slavery, which potentially could do damage to the unity of the Black community or to seek reparations for something like Jim Crow and to personalize the story.\n\nLee: For Dr. Nteta, the most surprising thing he found was the reasoning behind opposition to reparations.\n\nNteta: What we found was that people aren't concerned about the cost of the program. They're not concerned about the logistics, you know, identifying who is a descendant of a slave and who is not. The central issue that explains opposition in our polling is this question of deservedness. I think it's a reflection of the stereotypes directed at African Americans, particularly regarding their work ethic, the stereotypical, the sort of materialistic inclinations.\n\nDave Chapelle: Our top story, as we all know, Congress recently approved paying over a trillion dollars to African Americans as reparations for slavery.\n\nNteta: We go back to that Dave Chappelle skit from the early 2000s about the provision of reparations. And of course, it's done in a comedic fashion, but I think in comedy you find a lot of reality. And the skit was really about what would happen the day after reparations are paid and African Americans are buying cars and outfitting their cars with rims and buying gold chains.\n\nCharacter 1: Sir, now that you've got your check, do you plan on quitting your job driving this truck?\n\nCharacter 2: Truck driver? I ain't no truck driver. I'm a janitor.\n\nCharacter 1: Janitor?\n\nCharacter 2: That's right, baby. I just bought this truck straight cash. And I got enough cigarettes to last me and my family for the rest of our lives.\n\nNteta: You know, people laughed, but in that laughter is a recognition of the predictions that people have for what African Americans do when they get some influx of money. And I think that's really at the heart of the level of opposition in public opinion today.\n\nLee: Does public opinion around reparations shift or change at all when we're talking about different kinds of reparations, like whether it's free college, whether it's actually a check, whether it's land? Like, how does that all parse out?\n\nNteta: Yeah. What we found is Americans are least supportive of cash payments to descendants of slaves. And so around 35 to 38 percent of Americans express support for that policy and then the remainder really oppose it. But when you ask about other forms of reparations, interestingly, college tuition and housing assistance enjoys about 45 percent support among Americans.\n\nAnd so if folks are looking for a win, it may behoove the movement to start thinking more about these areas rather than the provision of cash payments, which are relatively unpopular.\n\nLee: Do you think reparations on a federal level, a national level is possible in this moment? And can you actually, given everything you understand about how people think about this, you see a day in which the federal government? No? The point no -- nope?\n\nNteta: Federal government? No. So I have very little faith in the potential of the federal government making the decision to step in to do something about this issue. Let's -- again, let's be frank. The Congress refuses to even put together committees to talk about reparations, let alone pass a reparations policy.\n\nSo in the short term, I don't see this as likely coming from the federal government, but that doesn't mean all hope is lost. And what you're seeing where the heat is for the reparations movement is at the state level and at the local level. You're seeing these cities that are relatively progressive, who are looking for solutions to the problem of racial inequality. And they're looking to reparations as potentially that solution.\n\nLee: Perhaps the federal government is not ready or willing to take on this responsibility. And while it's not clear how effectively local efforts could shrink the racial wealth gap, they might be the best shot. Back in New York, the reparations process is moving forward. On February 29th, Governor Hochul announced the names of the task force commissioners who will serve a similar role to Don Tamaki in California.\n\nWe can only imagine that maybe John Flateau's name would have been on that list. His siblings know he would have been right in the thick of it one way or another.\n\nAdele Flateau: I wish he was here because he would probably help us sort out a lot of things or recommendations about how we address this kind of issue. But he was very much on top of it. And that was one of the last conversations actually we had with him because it happened shortly before he passed away. So I know he would have been -- he would have been part of the conversation for sure, you know.\n\nLee: As we draw to the end of our journey with the Coakley Flateau's, we head back to where this story and their story began, the District of Columbia.\n\nThis document here would change your family's trajectory.\n\nAdele Flateau: Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nLee: Act Three: Uncounted Millions.\n\nWe'll never know how Gabriel Coakley might have imagined how his signature on that petition might have changed the lives of those who'd come after him or after those whose names he listed on it. But we do know that he would go on to pour himself and his money into his community and Black institutions, helping to fortify his section of the Black world in D.C. in a way that was necessary, and for the times revolutionary. He'd share a notch in history with ambitious Black men and women who'd mount their own forms of nation building in Washington and beyond.\n\nLike the great abolitionist and orator Frederick Douglass, who built a home in D.C. where he spent the last decade and a half of his life. It's likely that Douglass and Coakley could have met as Douglass was well acquainted with St. Augustine and had high esteem for the congregation and the community that the church had built.\n\nAnd on April 16th, 1883, to commemorate the 21st anniversary of Emancipation Day in D.C., Douglass stood before an audience inside the first congregational church not far from Coakley's home and delivered a powerful, rousing speech where he said freedom alone wasn't enough to repair what America had broken in slavery. We can only wonder if Coakley was there that day to hear his words. I'm going to read some of it for you.\n\nTime and events which have done so much for us in the past will, I trust, not do less for us in the future. The moral government of the universe is on our side and cooperates with all honest efforts to lift up the downtrodden and oppressed in all lands, whether the oppressed be white or Black. In whatever else, the Negro may have been a failure, he has in one respect been a marked and brilliant success.\n\nHe has managed by one means or another to make himself one of the most prominent and interesting figures that now attract and hold the attention of the world. He goes on. It was so in the time of slavery and it is so now. Then the cause was interest. Now the cause is pride and prejudice. Then the cause was property. He was then worth twenty hundred millions to his owner.\n\nHe is now worth uncounted millions to himself. While a slave, there was a mountain of gold on his breast to keep him down. Now that he is free, there is a mountain of prejudice to hold him down. Let's sit with that for a minute. Twenty hundred millions to his owner. Uncounted millions to himself. A mountain of gold on his breast to keep him down. And in freedom, a mountain of prejudice to hold him down.\n\nI can't shake that one line. Uncounted millions. There's so much packed in those words. Unrealized wealth or value. A vastness of untapped potential. Perhaps some sort of financial negligence or at least neglect. Some great amount owed.\n\nThis clarion call to be made whole, to stake a claim on what's rightfully ours, has been lifted for generations since. For that mountain of gold, for those uncounted millions, for reparations. We'll never know if Gabriel Coakley was seated in the pews that day to hear those words. But there's no doubt, he lived them. He knew his people's worth.\n\nThis whole series started with a discovery. That in the great war over slavery and freedom, a Black man found a loophole in the white man's law that secured him never before paid compensation for slavery. On our journey to learn more, we dug deep. In basement archives, small town records rooms, and historic cemeteries. Through digital libraries and one family's catalog of memories. But there was one document that none of us had ever seen with our own eyes. Gabriel Coakley's original petition for compensation.\n\nAdele Flateau: How are you doing?\n\nLee: How are you doing? Good to see you all.\n\nAdele Flateau: Yeah. Thank you.\n\nLee: How y'all feeling today?\n\nAdele Flateau: Great.\n\nRichard Flateau: Good.\n\nLee: We asked Adele and Richard, and two of their sons, Antoine and Desmond, to meet us in D.C. at the National Archives. This was just a few weeks after John had passed away, and it was the first time we'd seen the family since.\n\nSo thank you for taking the time with everything going on to come down here because we're all very excited, though, to finally see this document here.\n\nAdele Flateau: Yeah, it's something that John definitely would have wanted us to, you know, to finish. And he was very excited about it, and so we couldn't think of not, you know, going ahead, really.\n\nLee: Right.\n\nAdele Flateau: But it's definitely very bittersweet right now.\n\nLee: We also invited Dr. Lopez Matthews, head of the D.C. Archives across town, to put the document into a little more context.\n\nHey, Adele, this is Dr. Lopez Matthews. He's been the head archivist of D.C. in this story, and he's been helping us understand the story a bit.\n\nLopez Matthews: So, it's a fascinating story.\n\nAdele Flateau: Yes.\n\nLee: We've been waiting out in the hallway until the staff leads us into the records room.\n\nAll right, it's the moment of truth. Y'all ready?\n\nAdele Flateau: Yeah.\n\nLee: All right, let's go.\n\nAdele Flateau: I'm following you.\n\nLee: And this place looks exactly like it should, right? With all the old books and all the old documents.\n\nAdele Flateau: Oh, yeah.\n\nLee: Beautiful looking --\n\nAdele Flateau: Oh, should I put my phone somewhere?\n\nLee: It's a simple but grand room with high walls lined with books, and a recessed second floor with a spiral staircase leading up to it.\n\nSo this is the moment you guys have been waiting for.\n\nAdele Flateau: Yes, very much.\n\nRichard Flateau: Yes, indeed.\n\nLee: I think we're ready.\n\nThe clerk brings over a simple file box and starts to leaf through it.\n\nSo what exactly do we have here?\n\nClerk: So these are all sorts of petitions to free enslaved folks. Y'all, our petition number 332. Got it tabbed for you.\n\nRichard Flateau: Gabriel Coakley's name.\n\nClerk: Yeah.\n\nAdele Flateau: Yeah. There is --\n\nLee: Is there a way for us to see this? Can we touch it and open it?\n\nMatthews: You can. You just have to be gentle. It opens to the left. You have to open it that way.\n\nLee: Who wants to do the honors?\n\nAdele Flateau: I don't know if the archivist maybe should do that.\n\nMatthews: Your hands are clean and dry.\n\nLee: They're clean.\n\nMatthews: Just be gentle.\n\nAdele Flateau: Okay.\n\nRichard Flateau: That's amazing.\n\nLee: Richard, what are you seeing there?\n\nRichard Flateau: I'm seeing a dollar amount.\n\nDesmond Flateau-Gooding: Looks like a description of the slaves.\n\nLee: Now, would this have been his handwriting or a lawyer's?\n\nMatthews: No, this would have been the clerk or someone who was filling out the petition for them.\n\nAdele Flateau: Oh, wow.\n\nMatthews: They wanted to make sure it was someone who had good handwriting.\n\nRichard Flateau: Right.\n\nLee: Antoine reads from the petition.\n\nAntoine Flateau: Petition to the commissioners under the Act of Congress approved the 16th of April 1862 entitled An Act for the Release of Certain Persons Held to Service or Labor in the District of Columbia. Your petitioner, Gabriel Coakley of Washington, D.C. By this, his petition in writing represents and states that he is a loyal person to the United States who at the time of passage of the said Act of Congress held a claim to service or labor.\n\nLee: As we've described before, the petition starts with Gabriel pledging loyalty to the Union since this was during the Civil War.\n\nAntoine Flateau: -- of the personal description following. Adam Coakley is of a brown complexion, about five feet, two inches height.\n\nLee: And then there's the description of all his family members, property in the eyes of the government, listed with their physical characteristics and temperaments.\n\nAntoine Flateau: Mary is a bright mulatto. About five feet, four inches high. Mary Ann is of a yellow complexion, is 11 years old.\n\nLee: You might hear how, for Black Americans, records like these that help trace a family story are almost non-existent. But you also need to know where to look. It's remarkable just how accessible this all was. You could hold and touch these pieces of paper, these freedom papers, 162 years later.\n\nBut in some respects, this was just paperwork. A bureaucratic process for most of these petitioners to be repaid for their property. But for this family, this simple paperwork is more than just procedural.\n\nAntoine Flateau: I'm kind of left speechless. This is a really trying time in history for African Americans in this country, you know. This is a remarkable legacy that he left for us. Not knowing the future, you know, of this country or, you know, for his family.\n\nLee: We're standing in the National Archives, home to some of the most historic documents of freedom that this country has. The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights. Where does a document like this, especially in the context of Black people fighting their freedom, where does a document like this fall in this long historical line of historical documents?\n\nMatthews: Well, I think it falls on the line of progress in America. It speaks to the continual improvement that a country goes to. We started at one period. We started with this horrible institution. But we are moving beyond that. Those who suffered under that institution are finding at least a little bit of redress for that injustice.\n\nAnd so these documents, you know, the National Archives holds documents that tells the story of America. And this document really tells another piece of that important story.\n\nLee: We've been having this conversation around reparations in America and what is owed to Black people. Is this, in your estimation, reparations? Is that what this is?\n\nDesmond Flateau-Gooding: Man, I feel like reparations has such a negative connotation. It's such a loaded term. It's restorative. Like, in a lot of ways, he was able to, you know, again, get the family back together and really change the course of the future generations to come. All right. So, I mean, who knows what we would have looked like as a family if he wasn't able to get this accomplished?\n\nAdele Flateau: Well, the way I see it is that the reparations was not just about money, because what he was able to do with that is create a new generation of educated Blacks, like, you know, his family members. And even though we didn't know much about him, it's like that legacy was instilled in us, the value of education, not always higher education in that sense, but just being educated, being educated about your community, being educated about political empowerment.\n\nThat's something that, you know, we have always -- it's like been a part of our DNA. We don't know how it got there. It's there. And John was like the epitome of that.\n\nLee: John's presence loomed large over this visit. It was John who first discovered that their ancestor was on this list of petitioners in the first place, that a record of his signature would be in these very halls, not as a person emerging from bondage, but as a free man pulling his people out of it while pulling one over on the white supremacist system that refused to see them as whole.\n\nHe may not have collected the uncounted millions that he was worth, but it was no pittance. It was enough to cast ripples for generations. And John, he would remember that he had to give back. There's this one last moment that I want to play from our conversation in his living room, a moment that perhaps speaks best to his family and their legacy and what still remains for Black Americans.\n\nSo as we sit here today and you're going through this amazing history where your great, great, great grandfather purchases the freedom of his wife, his children. When you sit in that for a moment, how does that feel recognizing that this man did something that would have been extraordinary by any measure at any time? What do you, how do you, think about that?\n\nJohn Flateau: What I think about that is, yes, he was an extraordinary, phenomenal man and accomplished in extraordinary times and we are the beneficiaries. And if you understand what he accomplished 150 years ago, those of us that are here on Earth now, we should have no complaints, no excuses for not advancing the struggles, freedom, equality of people of African descent that we are a part of today.\n\nLee: This family has had a front row seat to history, slavery, freedom, reconstruction and redemption. Great migration, world wars, the civil rights movement, the rough and tumble world of New York politics. And now the fight for reparations. We've walked with them through time and space, trying to wrap our arms around the sheer enormity of their family's incredible story.\n\nThen and now the courage, the cunning, the fortune and misfortune. Theirs is both a singular tale and one that's universal. It's certainly about what could have been, but it's also about what is and has been. And that is the sheer beauty and brilliance and resilience of Black America. Despite what might be owed us, we will always be fighting for what's ours.\n\nThank you so much for listening to \"Uncounted Millions.\" And please stay tuned in the coming weeks for some bonus content.

Council approved Tuesday, according to The Washington Post . The 2025 budget includes a provision directing the chief financial officer to allocate money for the task force.\n\nThe legislation to create the task force is aimed at developing reparations for Black residents \"directly wronged and traumatized by the ills of slavery, Jim Crow, and structural and institutional racism,\" the bill reads . It also requires the commissioner of the Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking to create a slavery-era database of slaveholding records, including life insurance policies on enslaved persons.\n\nThe bill was introduced by council member Kenyan McDuffie early last year and discussed at public hearings for several months afterward. In a Racial Equity Impact Assessment, the council's Office of Racial Equity conducted historical research and offered recommendations to understand the bill's impact on Black residents. \"We can never fully capture the horror that was inflicted on Black people by white enslavers or the governments that supported them,\" the report reads.\n\nMcDuffie told the Post that the budget allocation is only a first step but that \"having the funding included in the budget to establish the creation of the commission, to do all the research that's going to be required to develop potential proposals, is absolutely critical to moving it forward.\"\n\nHowever, H.R. 40, a federal bill to create a commission to study the effects of slavery - reintroduced more than three decades after it was first introduced by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. - stalled in the House of Representatives after the House Judiciary Committee passed it in 2021.\n\nSeveral members of California's Legislative Black Caucus launched a statewide tour to promote 14 bills to address historical racial wrongs in the state, including two constitutional amendments proposed for this year's ballot. California's efforts at reparations began with a task force that compiled a 1,100-page report over two years, including a method for calculating financial compensation.\n\nIn 2021, Evanston, Illinois, became the first city to implement a reparations program to address discriminatory policies from 1919 to 1969. The program provides $25,000 to Black residents directly affected by or whose ancestors were affected by practices like redlining. Evanston, which has already issued payments to at least 129 Black residents, faces a lawsuit from a conservative activist group that argues that the program violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.\n\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nIsabel Yip is an intern for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

(Bettmann / Getty images)\n\nReparations are having a moment. This march, Evanston, Ill., became the first government in the United States to attempt to address racial inequality by providing mortgage assistance and $25,000 homeownership and improvement grants to descendants of residents harmed by discriminatory housing policies in the city. Soon afterward, the US House of Representatives began hearings on HR 40, which would create a commission to study reparations for slavery and other forms of discrimination against Black people in the United States. President Biden expressed support for the study and reiterated that support at the commemoration of the 1921 race massacre in Tulsa, Okla., in May. Meanwhile, California became the first state to initiate an official task force to study and develop a reparations plan for African Americans harmed by slavery and its legacies. Books in Review From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century By By William A. Darity Jr. and A. Kirsten Mullen Buy this book Bolstered by the Black Lives Matter movement and last summer's protests following the murder of George Floyd, support for reparations has also been aided by a growing awareness of the history of slavery and other forms of racial exploitation in the United States. In the past decade, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Nikole Hannah-Jones, and other Black journalists have exposed a broad readership to the question of reparations as well as to the scholarship on slavery's importance in the development of capitalism and American democracy, the racial inequalities inherent to New Deal social policies, and the causes and effects of mass incarceration. By doing so, they helped shift the discussion about racial inequality from a question of marginalization and oppression to a focus on the central role that Black people have played in the economic and political history of the United States. Despite the increasing awareness of this history, however, nearly two-thirds of Americans still oppose federal payments to Black people whose ancestors were enslaved. Opposition is strongest among Republicans, who view reparations as overly divisive and unjustified, but barely half of all Democrats, and only a third of white Democrats, support them. In From Here to Equality , William A. Darity Jr. and A. Kirsten Mullen draw on both journalistic and scholarly sources to make a strong case for cash payments to Black descendants of slaves. To those who dismiss reparations as a recent claim for an ancient crime, they point out that African Americans have been demanding compensation since the end of slavery and that the debt has been redoubled by officially sanctioned violence and discrimination since abolition. Likewise, to the \"alarmingly large numbers of Americans, both white and black, who do not believe that racial inequality and discrimination continue to exist,\" Darity and Mullen provide a detailed analysis of the deep disparities in wealth, income, education, and other measures of well-being that have persisted since emancipation. Yet despite their clear evidence of the lingering effects of slavery and Jim Crow, Darity and Mullen isolate African American reparations from claims for compensation by Native Americans, immigrants, and others. Not only does this risk alienating potential allies, it also narrows the scope of what the Black freedom movement has almost always pursued: A radical program for economic and racial justice for all Americans.

Drawing on the work of Anne Farrow, Craig Wilder, Joel Lang, and Jennifer Frank, Darity and Mullen explain that slavery was integral to the national-not just the Southern-economy, and that its proceeds therefore helped establish some of the nation's most prominent banks, insurance companies, and universities. Emphasizing several periods when the United States might have taken a different path, they show how slavery became more durable and racialized in the colonial era and then expanded rapidly in the South after a brief period of ambivalence about it during the Revolution. They also explain how Abraham Lincoln and other Northern politicians sought to avoid conflict by appeasing Southern slave owners, and how their hands were forced by the recalcitrance of the Confederate states, rising opposition to the war among Northern whites, and the insistence of African Americans on turning the war into a fight against slavery. In Darity and Mullen's telling, the Civil War was a critical moment not just because it ended slavery but because it also raised the question of how the formerly enslaved would be compensated for centuries of unpaid labor. They cite the testimony of the formerly enslaved minister Garrison Frazier in 1865, who explained to Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton that \"the freedom, as I understand it...is taking us from under the yoke of bondage, and placing us where we could reap the fruit of our own labor, take care of ourselves, and assist the Government in maintaining our freedom.\" Current Issue View our current issue This testimony was the inspiration for Sherman's famous Field Order No. 15, which would have distributed over 5 million acres of plantation land to formerly enslaved families along the Atlantic coast. A version of Sherman's order was taken up by Congress, but in yet another missed opportunity to repair the damage done by slavery, Andrew Johnson vetoed it and returned the land to former slave owners. But the Civil War was not the last missed opportunity, and a key component of Darity and Mullen's case is that \"the plunder\" of Black America, as Ta-Nehisi Coates dubbed it, continued unabated throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century. Drawing on the work of Coates and other journalists, sociologists, and historians who have charted this pillage over the past century and a half, Darity and Mullen offer a story of dispossession, exploitation, and disfranchisement whose devastating costs, they argue, also \"make the case for reparations.\" H aving explored the centuries of injustice that now demand compensation, Darity and Mullen turn to the most common objections that they have encountered in the 15 years that they have spent researching and developing their case. Over that period, Darity and Mullen explain, increased awareness of racial inequality has led to a multiplicity of reactions, from \"challenging the legitimacy of reparations to asking questions about the logistics of a reparations plan.\" Most of these objections are answered in previous chapters, but they also examine the claims that past injustices were addressed by emancipation, 20th-century social welfare policies, and affirmative action, and they show why all of these are clearly unsatisfactory in the face of the history they have recounted. Indeed, they argue, many of those initiatives-in particular welfare and affirmative action programs-not only failed to end racial inequalities but at times deepened them. Related Article Richard Wright's Lost Novel Elias Rodriques In the final chapters of the book, Darity and Mullen lay out a program for determining who is responsible for paying reparations, who would be eligible, how much would be paid, and how the funds would be distributed. The detailed history Darity and Mullen present supports the moral and economic claims for reparations. Yet given the persistent opposition, it is puzzling that they describe the potential constituency for reparations in the narrowest possible terms. In written testimony submitted to a congressional hearing on HR 40, Darity suggested that the bill be amended to clarify that it would benefit only people who identify as \"black, Negro, or African American\" and have \"at least one ancestor who was enslaved in the United States.\" Acknowledging that this excludes \"post-slavery immigrants\" from Africa and the Caribbean, \"whose own ancestors are likely to have been subjected to enslavement and colonialism elsewhere,\" he suggested they could make their claims against the United Kingdom or France, but not the United States. In addition to alienating potential allies, the exclusion of Black immigrants from reparations obscures not only the consequences of racism and segregation in the aftermath of emancipation but also the inherently international character of slavery and the inequalities it forged. The scholarship that Darity and Mullen draw on emphasizes the centrality of racial exploitation to the development of the United States, but it also demonstrates that the national story was, as W.E.B. Du Bois put it, \"but a local phase of a world problem.\" The historian Ana Lucia Araujo, in her \"transnational and comparative history\" Reparations for Slavery and the Slave Trade , shows that the demand for compensation in the United States has always been related to reparations movements in the Caribbean, South America, and Africa. That tradition is carried on today by the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, which links demands on the US government with a transnational movement seeking reparations for people of African descent. To limit the scope of what could be an international movement is a missed opportunity, but it also overlooks the influence of the United States and its role in international slavery and racial inequality. As Araujo explains, the US government's refusal to recognize Haiti weakened the Black-led republic at a time when it was attempting to establish economic independence from Europe and was revised only out of hope that African Americans could be resettled in the Caribbean after the Civil War. Since then, US political, military, and economic power has undermined the economic status of former slaves and their descendants in the Caribbean and Central America and led many of them to seek refuge and opportunity through migration to the United States. Certainly, the US government bears some responsibility for those affected by its imperial power. And that responsibility does not end with people of African descent. Darity and Mullen's account of slavery's centrality to the economic development of the United States includes frequent references to \"Negro, mulatto and Indian slaves,\" and as Tiya Miles and other historians have shown, African American history has long been deeply intertwined with that of Native Americans. Commenting on the anniversary of the Tulsa massacre, Robin D.G. Kelley noted, \"Any discussion of repair and reparations, of grieving and mourning the events of 1921 and its aftermath, must grapple with the colonial violence that made Tulsa or Oklahoma and its settler regime possible.\" Darity and Mullen acknowledge that Native Americans \"could make a far more costly claim on the American government than black Americans,\" potentially including the entire territory of the United States. Yet rather than casting Indigenous people as potential allies in the demand for reparations, they insist that such claims are \"irrelevant\" to the specific urgency of \"the black reparations claim.\" Black West Indians and Latin Americans are not the only immigrants with a potential interest in reparations. Emphasizing the whiteness, education, and wealth that some immigrants have brought with them to the United States, Darity and Mullen conclude that \"voluntary immigrants\" who arrived after the end of slavery \"have benefited from America's Jim Crow regime and its established and ongoing racial hierarchy\" and therefore share responsibility for reparations. But what of the Chinese and other Asian immigrants who were deprived of legal protections, landownership, and citizenship by racist exclusion laws; refugees from US military interventions in Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, and Central America; and Mexican \"guest workers\" and undocumented migrants who powered the \"internal colonialism\" that, according to the historian Mae Ngai, was also central to the economic development of the southwestern United States? As Erika Lee's recent history of xenophobia shows, anti-immigrant sentiment has often been closely linked to anti-Black racism. These histories may help explain why Asian and Latino Americans are far more supportive of reparations for slavery than white Americans, and why, rather than dismiss all immigrants as beneficiaries of racial inequality, we should ask which among them might find common cause in a movement to end it. Email I n the context of an increasingly racially diverse United States, the need for allies is an issue of strategy as much as of justice. Acknowledging that not enough Americans support reparations, Darity and Mullen caution that their proposals will not be possible without \"a dramatic change\" in national leadership and \"an inspired national movement dedicated to the fulfillment of the goal of racial justice.\" With African Americans holding steady at roughly 12 percent of the population, it is difficult to see how they could build such a movement on their own. Darity and Mullen suggest that support could also come from \"whites descended from slave owners\" who are seeking \"atonement,\" but guilt seems a weak foundation for a political alliance. It seems more feasible to build a coalition of those with an interest in repairing the damage done by slavery and other forms of racial exploitation. But if we are to build such a movement, its demands have to go beyond just one group's claims and one policy program alone. Darity and Mullen describe the goal of reparations as \"sharp and enduring reductions in racial disparities, particularly economic disparities like racial wealth inequality, and corresponding sharp and enduring improvements in black well-being.\" These are admirable objectives, but even with reparations and the reduction of these racial disparities in wealth, African Americans would still face other falling standards of well-being endured by Americans as a whole. For example, if Black families were equal to white ones, their median net worth would increase from $23,000 to $184,000, but most of their gains would go to a few wealthy households: 10 percent of Black families would control 76 percent of Black household wealth while just 1 percent would go to the poorest half of Black families. To use another metric, in an economically equal United States, African Americans would likely still be killed by police and be incarcerated at far higher levels than citizens of nearly every other nation in the world. Likewise, they would still likely fall victim to a health care system that prioritizes profit and a labor market that values productivity over humanity. Yet Darity and Mullen assert that \"once the reparations program is executed and racial inequality eliminated, African Americans would make no further claims for race-specific policies on their behalf from the American government-on the assumption that no new race-specific injustices are inflicted upon them.\" In his opening address at the 1963 March on Washington, A. Philip Randolph characterized the Black freedom movement as a \"massive moral revolution\" aimed not only at securing equal access to voting rights, government services, public accommodations, and jobs, but also at creating a society where \"the sanctity of private property takes second place to the sanctity of the human personality.\" Americans of all races had a stake in that transformation, he explained, but \"it falls to the Negro to reassert this proper priority of values, because our ancestors were transformed from human personalities into private property.\" Darity and Mullen draw a far more modest lesson from the African American struggle against slavery, Jim Crow, and other forms of racial exploitation. Their demand for repayment of the wealth and income taken since the nation's founding is worthy in its own right and would help address the deep economic disparities between Black and white Americans. Yet as Randolph suggested, the legacy of these freedom struggles is far more ambitious and revolutionary than the simple calculus of compensation. Any political movement powerful enough to secure policies sufficient to repair the damage inflicted by centuries of slavery and other forms of racial oppression in the United States will also have the power to secure a more radical and enduring transformation of our social and political order, and it should do so for practical and moral reasons. To win reparations will require allies who have a shared interest in addressing the country's history of racial exploitation, but it will also need more expansive forms of solidarity and systemic change. As Randolph observed over 50 years ago, Black people \"are in the forefront of today's movement for social and racial justice, because we know we cannot expect the realization of our aspirations through the same old anti-democratic social institutions and philosophies that have all along frustrated our aspirations.\"\n\nBy By William A.

Acknowledging that not enough Americans support reparations, Darity and Mullen caution that their proposals will not be possible without \"a dramatic change\" in national leadership and \"an inspired national movement dedicated to the fulfillment of the goal of racial justice.\" With African Americans holding steady at roughly 12 percent of the population, it is difficult to see how they could build such a movement on their own. Darity and Mullen suggest that support could also come from \"whites descended from slave owners\" who are seeking \"atonement,\" but guilt seems a weak foundation for a political alliance. It seems more feasible to build a coalition of those with an interest in repairing the damage done by slavery and other forms of racial exploitation. But if we are to build such a movement, its demands have to go beyond just one group's claims and one policy program alone. Darity and Mullen describe the goal of reparations as \"sharp and enduring reductions in racial disparities, particularly economic disparities like racial wealth inequality, and corresponding sharp and enduring improvements in black well-being.\" These are admirable objectives, but even with reparations and the reduction of these racial disparities in wealth, African Americans would still face other falling standards of well-being endured by Americans as a whole. For example, if Black families were equal to white ones, their median net worth would increase from $23,000 to $184,000, but most of their gains would go to a few wealthy households: 10 percent of Black families would control 76 percent of Black household wealth while just 1 percent would go to the poorest half of Black families. To use another metric, in an economically equal United States, African Americans would likely still be killed by police and be incarcerated at far higher levels than citizens of nearly every other nation in the world. Likewise, they would still likely fall victim to a health care system that prioritizes profit and a labor market that values productivity over humanity. Yet Darity and Mullen assert that \"once the reparations program is executed and racial inequality eliminated, African Americans would make no further claims for race-specific policies on their behalf from the American government-on the assumption that no new race-specific injustices are inflicted upon them.\" In his opening address at the 1963 March on Washington, A. Philip Randolph characterized the Black freedom movement as a \"massive moral revolution\" aimed not only at securing equal access to voting rights, government services, public accommodations, and jobs, but also at creating a society where \"the sanctity of private property takes second place to the sanctity of the human personality.\" Americans of all races had a stake in that transformation, he explained, but \"it falls to the Negro to reassert this proper priority of values, because our ancestors were transformed from human personalities into private property.\" Darity and Mullen draw a far more modest lesson from the African American struggle against slavery, Jim Crow, and other forms of racial exploitation. Their demand for repayment of the wealth and income taken since the nation's founding is worthy in its own right and would help address the deep economic disparities between Black and white Americans. Yet as Randolph suggested, the legacy of these freedom struggles is far more ambitious and revolutionary than the simple calculus of compensation. Any political movement powerful enough to secure policies sufficient to repair the damage inflicted by centuries of slavery and other forms of racial oppression in the United States will also have the power to secure a more radical and enduring transformation of our social and political order, and it should do so for practical and moral reasons. To win reparations will require allies who have a shared interest in addressing the country's history of racial exploitation, but it will also need more expansive forms of solidarity and systemic change. As Randolph observed over 50 years ago, Black people \"are in the forefront of today's movement for social and racial justice, because we know we cannot expect the realization of our aspirations through the same old anti-democratic social institutions and philosophies that have all along frustrated our aspirations.\"\n\nIn From Here to Equality , William A. Darity Jr. and A. Kirsten Mullen draw on both journalistic and scholarly sources to make a strong case for cash payments to Black descendants of slaves. To those who dismiss reparations as a recent claim for an ancient crime, they point out that African Americans have been demanding compensation since the end of slavery and that the debt has been redoubled by officially sanctioned violence and discrimination since abolition. Likewise, to the \"alarmingly large numbers of Americans, both white and black, who do not believe that racial inequality and discrimination continue to exist,\" Darity and Mullen provide a detailed analysis of the deep disparities in wealth, income, education, and other measures of well-being that have persisted since emancipation. Yet despite their clear evidence of the lingering effects of slavery and Jim Crow, Darity and Mullen isolate African American reparations from claims for compensation by Native Americans, immigrants, and others. Not only does this risk alienating potential allies, it also narrows the scope of what the Black freedom movement has almost always pursued: A radical program for economic and racial justice for all Americans.

Drawing on the work of Anne Farrow, Craig Wilder, Joel Lang, and Jennifer Frank, Darity and Mullen explain that slavery was integral to the national-not just the Southern-economy, and that its proceeds therefore helped establish some of the nation's most prominent banks, insurance companies, and universities. Emphasizing several periods when the United States might have taken a different path, they show how slavery became more durable and racialized in the colonial era and then expanded rapidly in the South after a brief period of ambivalence about it during the Revolution. They also explain how Abraham Lincoln and other Northern politicians sought to avoid conflict by appeasing Southern slave owners, and how their hands were forced by the recalcitrance of the Confederate states, rising opposition to the war among Northern whites, and the insistence of African Americans on turning the war into a fight against slavery. In Darity and Mullen's telling, the Civil War was a critical moment not just because it ended slavery but because it also raised the question of how the formerly enslaved would be compensated for centuries of unpaid labor. They cite the testimony of the formerly enslaved minister Garrison Frazier in 1865, who explained to Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton that \"the freedom, as I understand it...is taking us from under the yoke of bondage, and placing us where we could reap the fruit of our own labor, take care of ourselves, and assist the Government in maintaining our freedom.\" Current Issue View our current issue This testimony was the inspiration for Sherman's famous Field Order No. 15, which would have distributed over 5 million acres of plantation land to formerly enslaved families along the Atlantic coast. A version of Sherman's order was taken up by Congress, but in yet another missed opportunity to repair the damage done by slavery, Andrew Johnson vetoed it and returned the land to former slave owners. But the Civil War was not the last missed opportunity, and a key component of Darity and Mullen's case is that \"the plunder\" of Black America, as Ta-Nehisi Coates dubbed it, continued unabated throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century. Drawing on the work of Coates and other journalists, sociologists, and historians who have charted this pillage over the past century and a half, Darity and Mullen offer a story of dispossession, exploitation, and disfranchisement whose devastating costs, they argue, also \"make the case for reparations.\" H aving explored the centuries of injustice that now demand compensation, Darity and Mullen turn to the most common objections that they have encountered in the 15 years that they have spent researching and developing their case. Over that period, Darity and Mullen explain, increased awareness of racial inequality has led to a multiplicity of reactions, from \"challenging the legitimacy of reparations to asking questions about the logistics of a reparations plan.\" Most of these objections are answered in previous chapters, but they also examine the claims that past injustices were addressed by emancipation, 20th-century social welfare policies, and affirmative action, and they show why all of these are clearly unsatisfactory in the face of the history they have recounted. Indeed, they argue, many of those initiatives-in particular welfare and affirmative action programs-not only failed to end racial inequalities but at times deepened them. Related Article Richard Wright's Lost Novel Elias Rodriques In the final chapters of the book, Darity and Mullen lay out a program for determining who is responsible for paying reparations, who would be eligible, how much would be paid, and how the funds would be distributed. The detailed history Darity and Mullen present supports the moral and economic claims for reparations. Yet given the persistent opposition, it is puzzling that they describe the potential constituency for reparations in the narrowest possible terms. In written testimony submitted to a congressional hearing on HR 40, Darity suggested that the bill be amended to clarify that it would benefit only people who identify as \"black, Negro, or African American\" and have \"at least one ancestor who was enslaved in the United States.\" Acknowledging that this excludes \"post-slavery immigrants\" from Africa and the Caribbean, \"whose own ancestors are likely to have been subjected to enslavement and colonialism elsewhere,\" he suggested they could make their claims against the United Kingdom or France, but not the United States. In addition to alienating potential allies, the exclusion of Black immigrants from reparations obscures not only the consequences of racism and segregation in the aftermath of emancipation but also the inherently international character of slavery and the inequalities it forged. The scholarship that Darity and Mullen draw on emphasizes the centrality of racial exploitation to the development of the United States, but it also demonstrates that the national story was, as W.E.B. Du Bois put it, \"but a local phase of a world problem.\" The historian Ana Lucia Araujo, in her \"transnational and comparative history\" Reparations for Slavery and the Slave Trade , shows that the demand for compensation in the United States has always been related to reparations movements in the Caribbean, South America, and Africa. That tradition is carried on today by the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, which links demands on the US government with a transnational movement seeking reparations for people of African descent. To limit the scope of what could be an international movement is a missed opportunity, but it also overlooks the influence of the United States and its role in international slavery and racial inequality. As Araujo explains, the US government's refusal to recognize Haiti weakened the Black-led republic at a time when it was attempting to establish economic independence from Europe and was revised only out of hope that African Americans could be resettled in the Caribbean after the Civil War. Since then, US political, military, and economic power has undermined the economic status of former slaves and their descendants in the Caribbean and Central America and led many of them to seek refuge and opportunity through migration to the United States. Certainly, the US government bears some responsibility for those affected by its imperial power. And that responsibility does not end with people of African descent. Darity and Mullen's account of slavery's centrality to the economic development of the United States includes frequent references to \"Negro, mulatto and Indian slaves,\" and as Tiya Miles and other historians have shown, African American history has long been deeply intertwined with that of Native Americans. Commenting on the anniversary of the Tulsa massacre, Robin D.G. Kelley noted, \"Any discussion of repair and reparations, of grieving and mourning the events of 1921 and its aftermath, must grapple with the colonial violence that made Tulsa or Oklahoma and its settler regime possible.\" Darity and Mullen acknowledge that Native Americans \"could make a far more costly claim on the American government than black Americans,\" potentially including the entire territory of the United States. Yet rather than casting Indigenous people as potential allies in the demand for reparations, they insist that such claims are \"irrelevant\" to the specific urgency of \"the black reparations claim.\" Black West Indians and Latin Americans are not the only immigrants with a potential interest in reparations. Emphasizing the whiteness, education, and wealth that some immigrants have brought with them to the United States, Darity and Mullen conclude that \"voluntary immigrants\" who arrived after the end of slavery \"have benefited from America's Jim Crow regime and its established and ongoing racial hierarchy\" and therefore share responsibility for reparations. But what of the Chinese and other Asian immigrants who were deprived of legal protections, landownership, and citizenship by racist exclusion laws; refugees from US military interventions in Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, and Central America; and Mexican \"guest workers\" and undocumented migrants who powered the \"internal colonialism\" that, according to the historian Mae Ngai, was also central to the economic development of the southwestern United States? As Erika Lee's recent history of xenophobia shows, anti-immigrant sentiment has often been closely linked to anti-Black racism.

Du Bois put it, \"but a local phase of a world problem.\" The historian Ana Lucia Araujo, in her \"transnational and comparative history\" Reparations for Slavery and the Slave Trade , shows that the demand for compensation in the United States has always been related to reparations movements in the Caribbean, South America, and Africa. That tradition is carried on today by the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, which links demands on the US government with a transnational movement seeking reparations for people of African descent. To limit the scope of what could be an international movement is a missed opportunity, but it also overlooks the influence of the United States and its role in international slavery and racial inequality. As Araujo explains, the US government's refusal to recognize Haiti weakened the Black-led republic at a time when it was attempting to establish economic independence from Europe and was revised only out of hope that African Americans could be resettled in the Caribbean after the Civil War. Since then, US political, military, and economic power has undermined the economic status of former slaves and their descendants in the Caribbean and Central America and led many of them to seek refuge and opportunity through migration to the United States. Certainly, the US government bears some responsibility for those affected by its imperial power. And that responsibility does not end with people of African descent. Darity and Mullen's account of slavery's centrality to the economic development of the United States includes frequent references to \"Negro, mulatto and Indian slaves,\" and as Tiya Miles and other historians have shown, African American history has long been deeply intertwined with that of Native Americans. Commenting on the anniversary of the Tulsa massacre, Robin D.G. Kelley noted, \"Any discussion of repair and reparations, of grieving and mourning the events of 1921 and its aftermath, must grapple with the colonial violence that made Tulsa or Oklahoma and its settler regime possible.\" Darity and Mullen acknowledge that Native Americans \"could make a far more costly claim on the American government than black Americans,\" potentially including the entire territory of the United States. Yet rather than casting Indigenous people as potential allies in the demand for reparations, they insist that such claims are \"irrelevant\" to the specific urgency of \"the black reparations claim.\" Black West Indians and Latin Americans are not the only immigrants with a potential interest in reparations. Emphasizing the whiteness, education, and wealth that some immigrants have brought with them to the United States, Darity and Mullen conclude that \"voluntary immigrants\" who arrived after the end of slavery \"have benefited from America's Jim Crow regime and its established and ongoing racial hierarchy\" and therefore share responsibility for reparations. But what of the Chinese and other Asian immigrants who were deprived of legal protections, landownership, and citizenship by racist exclusion laws; refugees from US military interventions in Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, and Central America; and Mexican \"guest workers\" and undocumented migrants who powered the \"internal colonialism\" that, according to the historian Mae Ngai, was also central to the economic development of the southwestern United States? As Erika Lee's recent history of xenophobia shows, anti-immigrant sentiment has often been closely linked to anti-Black racism. These histories may help explain why Asian and Latino Americans are far more supportive of reparations for slavery than white Americans, and why, rather than dismiss all immigrants as beneficiaries of racial inequality, we should ask which among them might find common cause in a movement to end it. Email I n the context of an increasingly racially diverse United States, the need for allies is an issue of strategy as much as of justice. Acknowledging that not enough Americans support reparations, Darity and Mullen caution that their proposals will not be possible without \"a dramatic change\" in national leadership and \"an inspired national movement dedicated to the fulfillment of the goal of racial justice.\" With African Americans holding steady at roughly 12 percent of the population, it is difficult to see how they could build such a movement on their own. Darity and Mullen suggest that support could also come from \"whites descended from slave owners\" who are seeking \"atonement,\" but guilt seems a weak foundation for a political alliance. It seems more feasible to build a coalition of those with an interest in repairing the damage done by slavery and other forms of racial exploitation. But if we are to build such a movement, its demands have to go beyond just one group's claims and one policy program alone. Darity and Mullen describe the goal of reparations as \"sharp and enduring reductions in racial disparities, particularly economic disparities like racial wealth inequality, and corresponding sharp and enduring improvements in black well-being.\" These are admirable objectives, but even with reparations and the reduction of these racial disparities in wealth, African Americans would still face other falling standards of well-being endured by Americans as a whole. For example, if Black families were equal to white ones, their median net worth would increase from $23,000 to $184,000, but most of their gains would go to a few wealthy households: 10 percent of Black families would control 76 percent of Black household wealth while just 1 percent would go to the poorest half of Black families. To use another metric, in an economically equal United States, African Americans would likely still be killed by police and be incarcerated at far higher levels than citizens of nearly every other nation in the world. Likewise, they would still likely fall victim to a health care system that prioritizes profit and a labor market that values productivity over humanity. Yet Darity and Mullen assert that \"once the reparations program is executed and racial inequality eliminated, African Americans would make no further claims for race-specific policies on their behalf from the American government-on the assumption that no new race-specific injustices are inflicted upon them.\" In his opening address at the 1963 March on Washington, A. Philip Randolph characterized the Black freedom movement as a \"massive moral revolution\" aimed not only at securing equal access to voting rights, government services, public accommodations, and jobs, but also at creating a society where \"the sanctity of private property takes second place to the sanctity of the human personality.\" Americans of all races had a stake in that transformation, he explained, but \"it falls to the Negro to reassert this proper priority of values, because our ancestors were transformed from human personalities into private property.\" Darity and Mullen draw a far more modest lesson from the African American struggle against slavery, Jim Crow, and other forms of racial exploitation. Their demand for repayment of the wealth and income taken since the nation's founding is worthy in its own right and would help address the deep economic disparities between Black and white Americans. Yet as Randolph suggested, the legacy of these freedom struggles is far more ambitious and revolutionary than the simple calculus of compensation. Any political movement powerful enough to secure policies sufficient to repair the damage inflicted by centuries of slavery and other forms of racial oppression in the United States will also have the power to secure a more radical and enduring transformation of our social and political order, and it should do so for practical and moral reasons. To win reparations will require allies who have a shared interest in addressing the country's history of racial exploitation, but it will also need more expansive forms of solidarity and systemic change. As Randolph observed over 50 years ago, Black people \"are in the forefront of today's movement for social and racial justice, because we know we cannot expect the realization of our aspirations through the same old anti-democratic social institutions and philosophies that have all along frustrated our aspirations.\"\n\nEmphasizing several periods when the United States might have taken a different path, they show how slavery became more durable and racialized in the colonial era and then expanded rapidly in the South after a brief period of ambivalence about it during the Revolution. They also explain how Abraham Lincoln and other Northern politicians sought to avoid conflict by appeasing Southern slave owners, and how their hands were forced by the recalcitrance of the Confederate states, rising opposition to the war among Northern whites, and the insistence of African Americans on turning the war into a fight against slavery. In Darity and Mullen's telling, the Civil War was a critical moment not just because it ended slavery but because it also raised the question of how the formerly enslaved would be compensated for centuries of unpaid labor. They cite the testimony of the formerly enslaved minister Garrison Frazier in 1865, who explained to Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton that \"the freedom, as I understand it...is taking us from under the yoke of bondage, and placing us where we could reap the fruit of our own labor, take care of ourselves, and assist the Government in maintaining our freedom.\" Current Issue View our current issue This testimony was the inspiration for Sherman's famous Field Order No. 15, which would have distributed over 5 million acres of plantation land to formerly enslaved families along the Atlantic coast. A version of Sherman's order was taken up by Congress, but in yet another missed opportunity to repair the damage done by slavery, Andrew Johnson vetoed it and returned the land to former slave owners. But the Civil War was not the last missed opportunity, and a key component of Darity and Mullen's case is that \"the plunder\" of Black America, as Ta-Nehisi Coates dubbed it, continued unabated throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century. Drawing on the work of Coates and other journalists, sociologists, and historians who have charted this pillage over the past century and a half, Darity and Mullen offer a story of dispossession, exploitation, and disfranchisement whose devastating costs, they argue, also \"make the case for reparations.\" H aving explored the centuries of injustice that now demand compensation, Darity and Mullen turn to the most common objections that they have encountered in the 15 years that they have spent researching and developing their case. Over that period, Darity and Mullen explain, increased awareness of racial inequality has led to a multiplicity of reactions, from \"challenging the legitimacy of reparations to asking questions about the logistics of a reparations plan.\" Most of these objections are answered in previous chapters, but they also examine the claims that past injustices were addressed by emancipation, 20th-century social welfare policies, and affirmative action, and they show why all of these are clearly unsatisfactory in the face of the history they have recounted. Indeed, they argue, many of those initiatives-in particular welfare and affirmative action programs-not only failed to end racial inequalities but at times deepened them.

The detailed history Darity and Mullen present supports the moral and economic claims for reparations. Yet given the persistent opposition, it is puzzling that they describe the potential constituency for reparations in the narrowest possible terms. In written testimony submitted to a congressional hearing on HR 40, Darity suggested that the bill be amended to clarify that it would benefit only people who identify as \"black, Negro, or African American\" and have \"at least one ancestor who was enslaved in the United States.\" Acknowledging that this excludes \"post-slavery immigrants\" from Africa and the Caribbean, \"whose own ancestors are likely to have been subjected to enslavement and colonialism elsewhere,\" he suggested they could make their claims against the United Kingdom or France, but not the United States.

Darity and Mullen suggest that support could also come from \"whites descended from slave owners\" who are seeking \"atonement,\" but guilt seems a weak foundation for a political alliance. It seems more feasible to build a coalition of those with an interest in repairing the damage done by slavery and other forms of racial exploitation. But if we are to build such a movement, its demands have to go beyond just one group's claims and one policy program alone. Darity and Mullen describe the goal of reparations as \"sharp and enduring reductions in racial disparities, particularly economic disparities like racial wealth inequality, and corresponding sharp and enduring improvements in black well-being.\" These are admirable objectives, but even with reparations and the reduction of these racial disparities in wealth, African Americans would still face other falling standards of well-being endured by Americans as a whole. For example, if Black families were equal to white ones, their median net worth would increase from $23,000 to $184,000, but most of their gains would go to a few wealthy households: 10 percent of Black families would control 76 percent of Black household wealth while just 1 percent would go to the poorest half of Black families. To use another metric, in an economically equal United States, African Americans would likely still be killed by police and be incarcerated at far higher levels than citizens of nearly every other nation in the world. Likewise, they would still likely fall victim to a health care system that prioritizes profit and a labor market that values productivity over humanity. Yet Darity and Mullen assert that \"once the reparations program is executed and racial inequality eliminated, African Americans would make no further claims for race-specific policies on their behalf from the American government-on the assumption that no new race-specific injustices are inflicted upon them.\" In his opening address at the 1963 March on Washington, A. Philip Randolph characterized the Black freedom movement as a \"massive moral revolution\" aimed not only at securing equal access to voting rights, government services, public accommodations, and jobs, but also at creating a society where \"the sanctity of private property takes second place to the sanctity of the human personality.\" Americans of all races had a stake in that transformation, he explained, but \"it falls to the Negro to reassert this proper priority of values, because our ancestors were transformed from human personalities into private property.\" Darity and Mullen draw a far more modest lesson from the African American struggle against slavery, Jim Crow, and other forms of racial exploitation. Their demand for repayment of the wealth and income taken since the nation's founding is worthy in its own right and would help address the deep economic disparities between Black and white Americans. Yet as Randolph suggested, the legacy of these freedom struggles is far more ambitious and revolutionary than the simple calculus of compensation. Any political movement powerful enough to secure policies sufficient to repair the damage inflicted by centuries of slavery and other forms of racial oppression in the United States will also have the power to secure a more radical and enduring transformation of our social and political order, and it should do so for practical and moral reasons. To win reparations will require allies who have a shared interest in addressing the country's history of racial exploitation, but it will also need more expansive forms of solidarity and systemic change. As Randolph observed over 50 years ago, Black people \"are in the forefront of today's movement for social and racial justice, because we know we cannot expect the realization of our aspirations through the same old anti-democratic social institutions and philosophies that have all along frustrated our aspirations.\"\n\nBut the Civil War was not the last missed opportunity, and a key component of Darity and Mullen's case is that \"the plunder\" of Black America, as Ta-Nehisi Coates dubbed it, continued unabated throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century. Drawing on the work of Coates and other journalists, sociologists, and historians who have charted this pillage over the past century and a half, Darity and Mullen offer a story of dispossession, exploitation, and disfranchisement whose devastating costs, they argue, also \"make the case for reparations.\" H aving explored the centuries of injustice that now demand compensation, Darity and Mullen turn to the most common objections that they have encountered in the 15 years that they have spent researching and developing their case. Over that period, Darity and Mullen explain, increased awareness of racial inequality has led to a multiplicity of reactions, from \"challenging the legitimacy of reparations to asking questions about the logistics of a reparations plan.\" Most of these objections are answered in previous chapters, but they also examine the claims that past injustices were addressed by emancipation, 20th-century social welfare policies, and affirmative action, and they show why all of these are clearly unsatisfactory in the face of the history they have recounted. Indeed, they argue, many of those initiatives-in particular welfare and affirmative action programs-not only failed to end racial inequalities but at times deepened them.

The detailed history Darity and Mullen present supports the moral and economic claims for reparations. Yet given the persistent opposition, it is puzzling that they describe the potential constituency for reparations in the narrowest possible terms. In written testimony submitted to a congressional hearing on HR 40, Darity suggested that the bill be amended to clarify that it would benefit only people who identify as \"black, Negro, or African American\" and have \"at least one ancestor who was enslaved in the United States.\" Acknowledging that this excludes \"post-slavery immigrants\" from Africa and the Caribbean, \"whose own ancestors are likely to have been subjected to enslavement and colonialism elsewhere,\" he suggested they could make their claims against the United Kingdom or France, but not the United States. In addition to alienating potential allies, the exclusion of Black immigrants from reparations obscures not only the consequences of racism and segregation in the aftermath of emancipation but also the inherently international character of slavery and the inequalities it forged. The scholarship that Darity and Mullen draw on emphasizes the centrality of racial exploitation to the development of the United States, but it also demonstrates that the national story was, as W.E.B. Du Bois put it, \"but a local phase of a world problem.\" The historian Ana Lucia Araujo, in her \"transnational and comparative history\" Reparations for Slavery and the Slave Trade , shows that the demand for compensation in the United States has always been related to reparations movements in the Caribbean, South America, and Africa. That tradition is carried on today by the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, which links demands on the US government with a transnational movement seeking reparations for people of African descent. To limit the scope of what could be an international movement is a missed opportunity, but it also overlooks the influence of the United States and its role in international slavery and racial inequality. As Araujo explains, the US government's refusal to recognize Haiti weakened the Black-led republic at a time when it was attempting to establish economic independence from Europe and was revised only out of hope that African Americans could be resettled in the Caribbean after the Civil War. Since then, US political, military, and economic power has undermined the economic status of former slaves and their descendants in the Caribbean and Central America and led many of them to seek refuge and opportunity through migration to the United States. Certainly, the US government bears some responsibility for those affected by its imperial power. And that responsibility does not end with people of African descent. Darity and Mullen's account of slavery's centrality to the economic development of the United States includes frequent references to \"Negro, mulatto and Indian slaves,\" and as Tiya Miles and other historians have shown, African American history has long been deeply intertwined with that of Native Americans. Commenting on the anniversary of the Tulsa massacre, Robin D.G. Kelley noted, \"Any discussion of repair and reparations, of grieving and mourning the events of 1921 and its aftermath, must grapple with the colonial violence that made Tulsa or Oklahoma and its settler regime possible.\" Darity and Mullen acknowledge that Native Americans \"could make a far more costly claim on the American government than black Americans,\" potentially including the entire territory of the United States. Yet rather than casting Indigenous people as potential allies in the demand for reparations, they insist that such claims are \"irrelevant\" to the specific urgency of \"the black reparations claim.\" Black West Indians and Latin Americans are not the only immigrants with a potential interest in reparations. Emphasizing the whiteness, education, and wealth that some immigrants have brought with them to the United States, Darity and Mullen conclude that \"voluntary immigrants\" who arrived after the end of slavery \"have benefited from America's Jim Crow regime and its established and ongoing racial hierarchy\" and therefore share responsibility for reparations. But what of the Chinese and other Asian immigrants who were deprived of legal protections, landownership, and citizenship by racist exclusion laws; refugees from US military interventions in Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, and Central America; and Mexican \"guest workers\" and undocumented migrants who powered the \"internal colonialism\" that, according to the historian Mae Ngai, was also central to the economic development of the southwestern United States? As Erika Lee's recent history of xenophobia shows, anti-immigrant sentiment has often been closely linked to anti-Black racism. These histories may help explain why Asian and Latino Americans are far more supportive of reparations for slavery than white Americans, and why, rather than dismiss all immigrants as beneficiaries of racial inequality, we should ask which among them might find common cause in a movement to end it.

These histories may help explain why Asian and Latino Americans are far more supportive of reparations for slavery than white Americans, and why, rather than dismiss all immigrants as beneficiaries of racial inequality, we should ask which among them might find common cause in a movement to end it. Email I n the context of an increasingly racially diverse United States, the need for allies is an issue of strategy as much as of justice. Acknowledging that not enough Americans support reparations, Darity and Mullen caution that their proposals will not be possible without \"a dramatic change\" in national leadership and \"an inspired national movement dedicated to the fulfillment of the goal of racial justice.\" With African Americans holding steady at roughly 12 percent of the population, it is difficult to see how they could build such a movement on their own. Darity and Mullen suggest that support could also come from \"whites descended from slave owners\" who are seeking \"atonement,\" but guilt seems a weak foundation for a political alliance. It seems more feasible to build a coalition of those with an interest in repairing the damage done by slavery and other forms of racial exploitation. But if we are to build such a movement, its demands have to go beyond just one group's claims and one policy program alone. Darity and Mullen describe the goal of reparations as \"sharp and enduring reductions in racial disparities, particularly economic disparities like racial wealth inequality, and corresponding sharp and enduring improvements in black well-being.\" These are admirable objectives, but even with reparations and the reduction of these racial disparities in wealth, African Americans would still face other falling standards of well-being endured by Americans as a whole. For example, if Black families were equal to white ones, their median net worth would increase from $23,000 to $184,000, but most of their gains would go to a few wealthy households: 10 percent of Black families would control 76 percent of Black household wealth while just 1 percent would go to the poorest half of Black families. To use another metric, in an economically equal United States, African Americans would likely still be killed by police and be incarcerated at far higher levels than citizens of nearly every other nation in the world. Likewise, they would still likely fall victim to a health care system that prioritizes profit and a labor market that values productivity over humanity. Yet Darity and Mullen assert that \"once the reparations program is executed and racial inequality eliminated, African Americans would make no further claims for race-specific policies on their behalf from the American government-on the assumption that no new race-specific injustices are inflicted upon them.\" In his opening address at the 1963 March on Washington, A. Philip Randolph characterized the Black freedom movement as a \"massive moral revolution\" aimed not only at securing equal access to voting rights, government services, public accommodations, and jobs, but also at creating a society where \"the sanctity of private property takes second place to the sanctity of the human personality.\" Americans of all races had a stake in that transformation, he explained, but \"it falls to the Negro to reassert this proper priority of values, because our ancestors were transformed from human personalities into private property.\" Darity and Mullen draw a far more modest lesson from the African American struggle against slavery, Jim Crow, and other forms of racial exploitation. Their demand for repayment of the wealth and income taken since the nation's founding is worthy in its own right and would help address the deep economic disparities between Black and white Americans. Yet as Randolph suggested, the legacy of these freedom struggles is far more ambitious and revolutionary than the simple calculus of compensation. Any political movement powerful enough to secure policies sufficient to repair the damage inflicted by centuries of slavery and other forms of racial oppression in the United States will also have the power to secure a more radical and enduring transformation of our social and political order, and it should do so for practical and moral reasons. To win reparations will require allies who have a shared interest in addressing the country's history of racial exploitation, but it will also need more expansive forms of solidarity and systemic change. As Randolph observed over 50 years ago, Black people \"are in the forefront of today's movement for social and racial justice, because we know we cannot expect the realization of our aspirations through the same old anti-democratic social institutions and philosophies that have all along frustrated our aspirations.\"\n\nThe detailed history Darity and Mullen present supports the moral and economic claims for reparations. Yet given the persistent opposition, it is puzzling that they describe the potential constituency for reparations in the narrowest possible terms. In written testimony submitted to a congressional hearing on HR 40, Darity suggested that the bill be amended to clarify that it would benefit only people who identify as \"black, Negro, or African American\" and have \"at least one ancestor who was enslaved in the United States.\" Acknowledging that this excludes \"post-slavery immigrants\" from Africa and the Caribbean, \"whose own ancestors are likely to have been subjected to enslavement and colonialism elsewhere,\" he suggested they could make their claims against the United Kingdom or France, but not the United States. In addition to alienating potential allies, the exclusion of Black immigrants from reparations obscures not only the consequences of racism and segregation in the aftermath of emancipation but also the inherently international character of slavery and the inequalities it forged. The scholarship that Darity and Mullen draw on emphasizes the centrality of racial exploitation to the development of the United States, but it also demonstrates that the national story was, as W.E.B. Du Bois put it, \"but a local phase of a world problem.\" The historian Ana Lucia Araujo, in her \"transnational and comparative history\" Reparations for Slavery and the Slave Trade , shows that the demand for compensation in the United States has always been related to reparations movements in the Caribbean, South America, and Africa. That tradition is carried on today by the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America, which links demands on the US government with a transnational movement seeking reparations for people of African descent. To limit the scope of what could be an international movement is a missed opportunity, but it also overlooks the influence of the United States and its role in international slavery and racial inequality. As Araujo explains, the US government's refusal to recognize Haiti weakened the Black-led republic at a time when it was attempting to establish economic independence from Europe and was revised only out of hope that African Americans could be resettled in the Caribbean after the Civil War. Since then, US political, military, and economic power has undermined the economic status of former slaves and their descendants in the Caribbean and Central America and led many of them to seek refuge and opportunity through migration to the United States. Certainly, the US government bears some responsibility for those affected by its imperial power. And that responsibility does not end with people of African descent. Darity and Mullen's account of slavery's centrality to the economic development of the United States includes frequent references to \"Negro, mulatto and Indian slaves,\" and as Tiya Miles and other historians have shown, African American history has long been deeply intertwined with that of Native Americans. Commenting on the anniversary of the Tulsa massacre, Robin D.G. Kelley noted, \"Any discussion of repair and reparations, of grieving and mourning the events of 1921 and its aftermath, must grapple with the colonial violence that made Tulsa or Oklahoma and its settler regime possible.\" Darity and Mullen acknowledge that Native Americans \"could make a far more costly claim on the American government than black Americans,\" potentially including the entire territory of the United States. Yet rather than casting Indigenous people as potential allies in the demand for reparations, they insist that such claims are \"irrelevant\" to the specific urgency of \"the black reparations claim.\" Black West Indians and Latin Americans are not the only immigrants with a potential interest in reparations. Emphasizing the whiteness, education, and wealth that some immigrants have brought with them to the United States, Darity and Mullen conclude that \"voluntary immigrants\" who arrived after the end of slavery \"have benefited from America's Jim Crow regime and its established and ongoing racial hierarchy\" and therefore share responsibility for reparations. But what of the Chinese and other Asian immigrants who were deprived of legal protections, landownership, and citizenship by racist exclusion laws; refugees from US military interventions in Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, and Central America; and Mexican \"guest workers\" and undocumented migrants who powered the \"internal colonialism\" that, according to the historian Mae Ngai, was also central to the economic development of the southwestern United States?

Acknowledging that not enough Americans support reparations, Darity and Mullen caution that their proposals will not be possible without \"a dramatic change\" in national leadership and \"an inspired national movement dedicated to the fulfillment of the goal of racial justice.\" With African Americans holding steady at roughly 12 percent of the population, it is difficult to see how they could build such a movement on their own. Darity and Mullen suggest that support could also come from \"whites descended from slave owners\" who are seeking \"atonement,\" but guilt seems a weak foundation for a political alliance. It seems more feasible to build a coalition of those with an interest in repairing the damage done by slavery and other forms of racial exploitation. But if we are to build such a movement, its demands have to go beyond just one group's claims and one policy program alone. Darity and Mullen describe the goal of reparations as \"sharp and enduring reductions in racial disparities, particularly economic disparities like racial wealth inequality, and corresponding sharp and enduring improvements in black well-being.\" These are admirable objectives, but even with reparations and the reduction of these racial disparities in wealth, African Americans would still face other falling standards of well-being endured by Americans as a whole. For example, if Black families were equal to white ones, their median net worth would increase from $23,000 to $184,000, but most of their gains would go to a few wealthy households: 10 percent of Black families would control 76 percent of Black household wealth while just 1 percent would go to the poorest half of Black families. To use another metric, in an economically equal United States, African Americans would likely still be killed by police and be incarcerated at far higher levels than citizens of nearly every other nation in the world. Likewise, they would still likely fall victim to a health care system that prioritizes profit and a labor market that values productivity over humanity. Yet Darity and Mullen assert that \"once the reparations program is executed and racial inequality eliminated, African Americans would make no further claims for race-specific policies on their behalf from the American government-on the assumption that no new race-specific injustices are inflicted upon them.\" In his opening address at the 1963 March on Washington, A. Philip Randolph characterized the Black freedom movement as a \"massive moral revolution\" aimed not only at securing equal access to voting rights, government services, public accommodations, and jobs, but also at creating a society where \"the sanctity of private property takes second place to the sanctity of the human personality.\" Americans of all races had a stake in that transformation, he explained, but \"it falls to the Negro to reassert this proper priority of values, because our ancestors were transformed from human personalities into private property.\" Darity and Mullen draw a far more modest lesson from the African American struggle against slavery, Jim Crow, and other forms of racial exploitation. Their demand for repayment of the wealth and income taken since the nation's founding is worthy in its own right and would help address the deep economic disparities between Black and white Americans. Yet as Randolph suggested, the legacy of these freedom struggles is far more ambitious and revolutionary than the simple calculus of compensation. Any political movement powerful enough to secure policies sufficient to repair the damage inflicted by centuries of slavery and other forms of racial oppression in the United States will also have the power to secure a more radical and enduring transformation of our social and political order, and it should do so for practical and moral reasons. To win reparations will require allies who have a shared interest in addressing the country's history of racial exploitation, but it will also need more expansive forms of solidarity and systemic change. As Randolph observed over 50 years ago, Black people \"are in the forefront of today's movement for social and racial justice, because we know we cannot expect the realization of our aspirations through the same old anti-democratic social institutions and philosophies that have all along frustrated our aspirations.\"\n\nDarity and Mullen acknowledge that Native Americans \"could make a far more costly claim on the American government than black Americans,\" potentially including the entire territory of the United States. Yet rather than casting Indigenous people as potential allies in the demand for reparations, they insist that such claims are \"irrelevant\" to the specific urgency of \"the black reparations claim.\" Black West Indians and Latin Americans are not the only immigrants with a potential interest in reparations. Emphasizing the whiteness, education, and wealth that some immigrants have brought with them to the United States, Darity and Mullen conclude that \"voluntary immigrants\" who arrived after the end of slavery \"have benefited from America's Jim Crow regime and its established and ongoing racial hierarchy\" and therefore share responsibility for reparations. But what of the Chinese and other Asian immigrants who were deprived of legal protections, landownership, and citizenship by racist exclusion laws; refugees from US military interventions in Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, and Central America; and Mexican \"guest workers\" and undocumented migrants who powered the \"internal colonialism\" that, according to the historian Mae Ngai, was also central to the economic development of the southwestern United States? As Erika Lee's recent history of xenophobia shows, anti-immigrant sentiment has often been closely linked to anti-Black racism.

Lawyers for the defendant argued that Wood's claim to reparations for decades of unpaid labor was barred by a statute of limitations . Nearly 150 years later, as Congress prepared to hear testimony on the idea of reparations , Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell offered much the same argument. \"I don't think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago for whom none of us currently living are responsible is a good idea,\" he said , before ticking off the Civil War, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and the election of Barack Obama as evidence that any debts owed to the descendants of the enslaved have already been largely paid. \"I think we're always a work in progress in this country, but no one currently alive was responsible for that.\" 1 Whether five years after Emancipation or a century and a half later, whether the claimants were the formerly enslaved or their descendants, the United States has steadfastly refused at nearly every opportunity to provide recompense for slavery and its disastrous legacy. The country reneged on its post-Emancipation promise of 40 acres and a mule just a few months after making it. In the 1890s, the federal government brutally crushed a national campaign to give freed black people pension plans . And for nearly each of the last 30 years, Congress has rejected a bill that would merely create a commission to study the consequences of slavery and consider the impact of reparations. 2 \"Any legislation that sought to put black people on an equal footing has been ultimately, if not strangled in the crib, slowly starved,\" historian Carroll Gibbs, the author of Black, Copper, & Bright: The District of Columbia's Black Civil War Regiment , told me. \"It's important to understand that what makes the argument hollow-that it's too late to do anything because everybody's dead now-is that the US refused to do it when everyone was still alive.\" 3 Instead, the US government supported and enshrined into law policies that further entrenched white supremacy. Case in point: The only reparations program enacted by the federal government doled out the 2020 equivalent of over $23 million in Treasury Department funds-not to the formerly enslaved but to their white enslavers. 4 (National Archives) In April 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act , a congressional bill abolishing slavery in Washington, DC. Less than half a year earlier, he proposed similar legislation in Delaware that stalled in the state's House of Representatives. Under the DC law-the first emancipation legislation in this country's history-enslavers were eligible to receive up to $300 for each person they were legally obliged to liberate. (I use the term \"enslaver\" rather than \"slave owner\" because it acknowledges the active role those individuals played in keeping human beings locked in a brutal and violent institution. And while the reductive term \"slave\" has historically been used to strip black people of their humanity, referring to an \"enslaved person\" makes clear that bondage was a legally enforced position.) No such provision was made for DC's newly freed black population.

Others had run away before the act became law, and in a few cases, enslaved people died just after Lincoln signed the bill. 8 \"Under such circumstances,\" the commissioners determined, \"it would be manifestly unjust to withhold compensation on account of the inability of the claimant to produce\" the enslaved person they claimed. The panel decided enslavers deserved compensation if the people they'd enslaved had escaped no more than two years prior. Petitioners were also asked to include \"written evidence\" substantiating their claims, but submissions lacking that proof ran little risk of being rejected. This \"liberal construction of the act,\" the commissioners wrote, sprang from the desire to free the most people (and, of course, pay the most enslavers) without paperwork getting in the way. But the laxity with which this rule was applied highlighted one of the many horrific aspects of enslavement: the ease with which white claims to black bodies and lives could be made. 9 \"Slaves were held, owned, and mistreated so callously that there quite often was not a legal basis for their ownership,\" says Kenneth Winkle, a historian at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the research project Civil War Washington . \"Slave owners were asked to provide records or bills of sale or receipts or some paperwork. Most of them simply said, 'I've misplaced it' or 'I'm not sure I ever had any.' A white person could claim ownership of an African-American as a slave based on the testimony of two other white people, with no paperwork necessary.\" 10 Putting a price on human beings: Horatio King was a member of the commission adjudicating claims under the District of Columbia's 1862 Compensated Emancipation Act. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division) The Compensated Emancipation Act did not grant automatic emancipation to enslaved people not named in petitions, and some enslavers did not file for compensation by the act's 90-day deadline, many of them pro-slavery Confederate sympathizers who had no intention of emancipating those they enslaved. To address these cases, Congress passed the Supplementary Act in July 1862, which allowed black folks to submit petitions pleading for their own emancipation and to testify and serve as witnesses-the first time African Americans were allowed to do so in federal proceedings. More than 160 claims were filed by people the commissioners described as \"held to service in the District of Columbia by reason of African descent.\" 11 Winkle and his colleagues at Civil War Washington have meticulously cataloged, digitized, transcribed, and posted online nearly all of the petitions filed under the Compensated Emancipation Act. No matter how much you may know about the violence, cruelty, depravity, and terror of slavery, those horrors are revealed anew in the petitions filed. The petitioners' responses to the bureaucratic formality of noting how they \"acquired\" other human beings as their property leads to firsthand accounts of black people ripped from their families, treated like hand-me-downs, and enslaved by dint of birth. One claimant wrote that an enslaved woman named \"Ann Williams [was] acquired by marriage forty years ago \" and that her grandson, Albert Hollyday, \"was born while his mother (Eliza since sold) was owned by me.\" Another enslaver (this time a woman, of which there were many) reported that a black woman identified only as Delilah was \" willed to me by my father in 1816 \" and that \"while my slave and in my survace [sic] Delilah had a daughter named Amanda who while my slave and in my survace [sic] became the mother of said Casper & William,\" two young men for whom she requested $450 and $350, respectively. 12 Enslaved people are listed by name in the petitions, a rarity in documents from the era. That omission was intentional and institutional: Recording the names of the enslaved threatened to confer personhood, and the denial of humanity was the bedrock on which black chattel slavery rested. Erasure of black people from the American historical record is partly located in the practice of reducing the enslaved to nameless head counts or dollar amounts, an obliteration of black existence that continues to impede African American efforts at heritage and genealogical research. Even this tiny recognition of black humanity was conceded only in exchange for federal dollars. 13 The degrading reduction of black human beings to what were deemed salable traits is both the most salient horror in the petitions and the entire reason for the exercise. Petitioners described the old , the very young, and the sick as having \"no value,\" rendered worthless by a market that no longer had a way to exploit them. Just as horrifying are the price tags affixed by petitioners to enslaved people for whom they hoped to receive top dollar. Through descriptions of enslaved people's physical and mental characteristics, the petitioners provided justifications for their compensation claims, highlighting what the commissioners labeled \" their intrinsic utility to their owners .\" Ironically, these reductive descriptions provide rare glimpses of the human beings named, the lives they lived, and the circumstances they endured. 14 Linda Harris, for example, is described as a \" slave for life ,\" of \"olive brown complexion with full suit of hair, free spoken and intelligent.\" Her enslaver writes that Linda is \"honest\" and \"an excellent cook, washerwoman or nurse. During the past year she has had occasional attacks of rheumatism; and is at intervals troubled with weakness of the breast, but has never been compelled to abandon her usual duties.\" (As if, one thinks, she had a choice.) Linda's estimated worth is given as $800. Her enslaver was paid $306.60 for her. 15 The petition: Linda Harris's enslaver received $306.60 for emancipating her. (National Archives via Civil War Washington) William Alexander Johnson, 22 years old, is described as 5 feet 8 inches tall and \" a skillful mechanic , very ingenious in every branch of mechanism...employed in making models for patents, in making and repairing mathematical instruments.\" His enslaver requested $2,000 for him; she was compensated in the amount of $657. 16 Twenty-three-year-old Margaret E. Taylor was the mother of 5-year-old Annie and infant Fanny, both of whom are described as being of \"mulatto color.\" Their male enslaver notes that \"both [were] born while their said mother was held to said service or labor by your Petitioner.\" He was given $569.40 for the woman and her children, with Fanny garnering just $21.90. 17 Gibbs told me that, in addition to the dehumanizing nature of the process, he was consistently struck by the way the descriptions counter the narrative that enslaved people were mentally feeble or lazy. \"Despite the claims of proslavery [advocates],\" he said, \"we're looking at people whom their masters described in many cases as worthy, competent, skilled.\" 18 Philip Reid is described in a petition as 42 years old, \"not prepossessing in appearance, but smart in mind,\" and formerly \"employed...by the Government.\" He was a skilled artisan who helped cast DC's Statue of Freedom and whose ingenuity succeeded in placing the bronze figure atop the Capitol, where it stands today. For his 33 weeks of labor without respite, Reid was paid $1.25 per day. He was allowed to keep only his Sunday wages; the rest went to his enslaver, Clark Mills. In his claim , Mills requested $1,500 in compensation for Reid. He received $350.40. 19 \"The primary drawback in consulting these records is that most of them were compiled by the slave owners, not by the slaves themselves,\" Winkle said. \"So this becomes a huge exercise in reading between the lines, so to speak, and certainly not taking this information at face value but analyzing it before putting the pieces together to try to create an authentic collective portrait of who these slaves were, how they lived their lives, and what they accomplished. And surviving slavery was an incredible accomplishment.\" He added that the petitions represent \"just over 3,300 slaves in the District of Columbia. I always say it's one-tenth of 1 percent of all the slaves in the American South, but we see them. They are named. We can see them as individuals.\" 20 Seeking justice: In 1870, Sojourner Truth petitioned Congress for land reparations. (National Portrait Gallery) \"Self-petitions\" from enslaved African Americans requesting their freedom, many of them written by white pro bono lawyers, provide yet more insight. Phillip Meredith, a 30-year-old black man, lists his enslaver of 30 years as \" General Robert Lee .\" A corroborating witness notes the general was \"formerly of U.S. Army now in Rebel service.\" Meredith's petition was approved. 21 A more heartrending story is told through the \"self-petition\" of Mary A. Prather on behalf of herself and her 3-year-old son, Arthur. \"Mary says she had permission\" from her enslaver to be hired out, according to testimony, but that permission was later rescinded, making her a fugitive and thus ineligible for emancipation under the act. Mary's and Arthur's names appear in the commissioners' report among those \" from whom certificates have been withheld .\" 22 Washington Childs wrote in his \"self-petition\" that he was 33 years old , 6 feet 2 inches tall, with \"a large hair mole on the right side of his chin.\" He indicated that he was hired out in Washington, DC, \"nearly or quite five years last past\" by his Virginian enslaver, who would have received all of his wages during that time. His enslaver provided a letter of support for Childs's emancipation to be presented to the commission. Included in the missive is a citation of an outstanding debt of $60 , along with the galling request that Childs pay it off by sending \"a barrel of good sugar & sacks of coffee and 2 bolts of cotton & [a] pound of best Tea, that is if you can send the tea & cotton by express.\" 23 His emancipation was granted, and his enslaver was not compensated. But the overwhelming majority of those who submitted compensation claims succeeded in getting funds-often in amounts lower than requested, but at times up to $788. The compensation given to white enslavers helped maintain their financial security and the continuation of white supremacy and power. 24 \"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young , the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber , the second largest,\" Gibbs told me. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory . She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe , \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" 25 E ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which applied only to the treasonous Confederate states, over which the Union had no jurisdiction. Slavery wasn't fully abolished until nearly three years later, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 26 Stolen land, stolen freedom: A sharecropper plowing in Montgomery, Alabama. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) In January 1865, the United States undertook the \"40 acres and a mule\" reparations program, distributing 400,000 acres of Southern coastal land confiscated from disloyal Confederates to freed black families in plots of \" not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground. \" (Union Gen. William T. Sherman, who issued the initial order , also authorized distribution of old Army mules.) Historian and former US Commission on Civil Rights chair Mary Frances Berry noted that by June of 1865, \" 40,000 freedmen had been settled \" on the land and were already \"growing crops.\" Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, cruelly reversed the policy, evicting the land's black occupants and returning their properties to the white Confederate enslavers who had attacked the Union. Many of those black folks would be forced into sharecropping, a Jim Crow form of slavery in all but name. 27 American history has since been marked by too many calls for reparations to list, each rebuffed in turn by the US government. In 1870, Sojourner Truth unsuccessfully petitioned Congress for land reparations, stating, \"I shall make them understand that there is a debt to the Negro people which they can never repay. At least, then, they must make amends.\" Walter Vaughan, a white slavery apologist who believed black dollars would ultimately fatten white Southern pockets, wrote an 1890 bill to give freed people pensions like those granted to Civil War veterans. Introduced in Congress by Nebraska Representative William J. Connell, Vaughan's \" ex-slave pension bill \" died before becoming law, as did eight other reparations proposals introduced between 1896 and 1903. During the same period, a formerly enslaved woman and mother of five named Callie House cofounded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. In 1915, the group sued the US Treasury for $68 million, the estimated amount of taxes collected on cotton between 1862 and 1868 . A lower tribunal and the Supreme Court cited government immunity in dismissing the suit. For her temerity, House was charged with mail fraud , convicted by an all-white jury, and sentenced to a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Nearly 50 years later, reparations advocate Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore secured enough petition signatures-over 1 million-to compel President John F. Kennedy to meet with her, but no legal remedies followed. The US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed a 1995 reparations lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a 2007 class action case against corporations that benefited from black enslavement. 28 In 2019 the House of Representatives held a hearing on HR 40 -the number refers to Sherman's unfulfilled promise of land-a bill that was introduced in every Congress from 1989 to 2017 by Michigan Representative John Conyers. Unceremoniously killed in committee for nearly 30 years, HR 40 would not compel federal payouts to the descendants of enslaved people but instead would merely impanel a commission to examine the impact of \" slavery and its continuing vestiges .\" In taking up the bill's sponsorship, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee noted that it would help illuminate the statistics that show the \"stunning chasm between the destinies of White America and that of Black America.\" For example, the median wealth of white families is currently estimated at $171,000; for black families, it is $17,600 -approximately a tenfold difference. Fewer than 10 percent of white families have zero or negative net worth, while nearly 20 percent of black households do. Discrimination against black people in mortgage lending, historically and today, has hobbled opportunities for homeownership , the source of two-thirds of equity for American households and one of the most reliable forms of intergenerational wealth . And while we're on the subject of black folks being denied property, it seems like a good moment to note that if those 40 acres and a mule had been distributed as promised, the land would be worth about $6.4 trillion today . 29 More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice! March 12, 2025 If there were an actual interest in ending those disparities, Congress would at the very least support studying the numbers. Instead, opponents of HR 40 argue against even investigating the issue. That opposition, including McConnell's dismissive remarks, demonstrates the ahistorical American self-mythologizing at the heart of the country's bitter opposition to slavery reparations. The Senate leader and his ilk are fighting an ideological war to defend the lie that slavery was a historical anomaly, an inconsequential blip on an American moral arc that always otherwise bends toward racial justice. It's an attempt to rewrite history, omitting how the denial of reparations shortchanged black freedom and omitting the policies of Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, and unstinting white terror against black success. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the highly influential 2014 Atlantic article \"The Case for Reparations,\" directly addressed McConnell-whose family enslaved black human beings -in his testimony on HR 40. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" Coates stated. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\" 30 R ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions. Yale, Brown, Harvard, William & Mary, and more than 50 other members of the Universities Studying Slavery consortium have acknowledged the role of black enslavement in their early funding, founding, construction, and maintenance. (The collective includes schools in Britain, which also gave reparations solely to enslavers; the taxpayer-funded payments of $3.9 billion ended only in 2015. ) To atone for their ties to slavery, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Georgetown University have all established reparations funds . In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\nWhether five years after Emancipation or a century and a half later, whether the claimants were the formerly enslaved or their descendants, the United States has steadfastly refused at nearly every opportunity to provide recompense for slavery and its disastrous legacy. The country reneged on its post-Emancipation promise of 40 acres and a mule just a few months after making it. In the 1890s, the federal government brutally crushed a national campaign to give freed black people pension plans . And for nearly each of the last 30 years, Congress has rejected a bill that would merely create a commission to study the consequences of slavery and consider the impact of reparations. 2 \"Any legislation that sought to put black people on an equal footing has been ultimately, if not strangled in the crib, slowly starved,\" historian Carroll Gibbs, the author of Black, Copper, & Bright: The District of Columbia's Black Civil War Regiment , told me. \"It's important to understand that what makes the argument hollow-that it's too late to do anything because everybody's dead now-is that the US refused to do it when everyone was still alive.\" 3 Instead, the US government supported and enshrined into law policies that further entrenched white supremacy. Case in point: The only reparations program enacted by the federal government doled out the 2020 equivalent of over $23 million in Treasury Department funds-not to the formerly enslaved but to their white enslavers. 4 (National Archives) In April 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act , a congressional bill abolishing slavery in Washington, DC. Less than half a year earlier, he proposed similar legislation in Delaware that stalled in the state's House of Representatives. Under the DC law-the first emancipation legislation in this country's history-enslavers were eligible to receive up to $300 for each person they were legally obliged to liberate. (I use the term \"enslaver\" rather than \"slave owner\" because it acknowledges the active role those individuals played in keeping human beings locked in a brutal and violent institution. And while the reductive term \"slave\" has historically been used to strip black people of their humanity, referring to an \"enslaved person\" makes clear that bondage was a legally enforced position.) No such provision was made for DC's newly freed black population. Instead, seeing no more use for them, the government offered formerly enslaved people funds only if they agreed to relocate to Haiti, Liberia, \"or such other country beyond the limits of the United States.\" For this act of self-deportation from the land they had made an economic powerhouse, payment would \"not exceed one hundred dollars for each emigrant.\" 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Almost no freed people took up the government on its insulting offer, but DC-area enslavers submitted 966 petitions in the months following the law's passage.

For his 33 weeks of labor without respite, Reid was paid $1.25 per day. He was allowed to keep only his Sunday wages; the rest went to his enslaver, Clark Mills. In his claim , Mills requested $1,500 in compensation for Reid. He received $350.40. 19 \"The primary drawback in consulting these records is that most of them were compiled by the slave owners, not by the slaves themselves,\" Winkle said. \"So this becomes a huge exercise in reading between the lines, so to speak, and certainly not taking this information at face value but analyzing it before putting the pieces together to try to create an authentic collective portrait of who these slaves were, how they lived their lives, and what they accomplished. And surviving slavery was an incredible accomplishment.\" He added that the petitions represent \"just over 3,300 slaves in the District of Columbia.

Phillip Meredith, a 30-year-old black man, lists his enslaver of 30 years as \" General Robert Lee .\" A corroborating witness notes the general was \"formerly of U.S. Army now in Rebel service.\" Meredith's petition was approved. 21 A more heartrending story is told through the \"self-petition\" of Mary A. Prather on behalf of herself and her 3-year-old son, Arthur. \"Mary says she had permission\" from her enslaver to be hired out, according to testimony, but that permission was later rescinded, making her a fugitive and thus ineligible for emancipation under the act. Mary's and Arthur's names appear in the commissioners' report among those \" from whom certificates have been withheld .\" 22 Washington Childs wrote in his \"self-petition\" that he was 33 years old , 6 feet 2 inches tall, with \"a large hair mole on the right side of his chin.\" He indicated that he was hired out in Washington, DC, \"nearly or quite five years last past\" by his Virginian enslaver, who would have received all of his wages during that time. His enslaver provided a letter of support for Childs's emancipation to be presented to the commission. Included in the missive is a citation of an outstanding debt of $60 , along with the galling request that Childs pay it off by sending \"a barrel of good sugar & sacks of coffee and 2 bolts of cotton & [a] pound of best Tea, that is if you can send the tea & cotton by express.\" 23 His emancipation was granted, and his enslaver was not compensated. But the overwhelming majority of those who submitted compensation claims succeeded in getting funds-often in amounts lower than requested, but at times up to $788. The compensation given to white enslavers helped maintain their financial security and the continuation of white supremacy and power. 24 \"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young , the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber , the second largest,\" Gibbs told me. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory . She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe , \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" 25 E ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which applied only to the treasonous Confederate states, over which the Union had no jurisdiction. Slavery wasn't fully abolished until nearly three years later, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 26 Stolen land, stolen freedom: A sharecropper plowing in Montgomery, Alabama. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) In January 1865, the United States undertook the \"40 acres and a mule\" reparations program, distributing 400,000 acres of Southern coastal land confiscated from disloyal Confederates to freed black families in plots of \" not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground. \" (Union Gen. William T. Sherman, who issued the initial order , also authorized distribution of old Army mules.) Historian and former US Commission on Civil Rights chair Mary Frances Berry noted that by June of 1865, \" 40,000 freedmen had been settled \" on the land and were already \"growing crops.\" Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, cruelly reversed the policy, evicting the land's black occupants and returning their properties to the white Confederate enslavers who had attacked the Union. Many of those black folks would be forced into sharecropping, a Jim Crow form of slavery in all but name. 27 American history has since been marked by too many calls for reparations to list, each rebuffed in turn by the US government. In 1870, Sojourner Truth unsuccessfully petitioned Congress for land reparations, stating, \"I shall make them understand that there is a debt to the Negro people which they can never repay. At least, then, they must make amends.\" Walter Vaughan, a white slavery apologist who believed black dollars would ultimately fatten white Southern pockets, wrote an 1890 bill to give freed people pensions like those granted to Civil War veterans. Introduced in Congress by Nebraska Representative William J. Connell, Vaughan's \" ex-slave pension bill \" died before becoming law, as did eight other reparations proposals introduced between 1896 and 1903. During the same period, a formerly enslaved woman and mother of five named Callie House cofounded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. In 1915, the group sued the US Treasury for $68 million, the estimated amount of taxes collected on cotton between 1862 and 1868 . A lower tribunal and the Supreme Court cited government immunity in dismissing the suit. For her temerity, House was charged with mail fraud , convicted by an all-white jury, and sentenced to a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Nearly 50 years later, reparations advocate Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore secured enough petition signatures-over 1 million-to compel President John F. Kennedy to meet with her, but no legal remedies followed. The US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed a 1995 reparations lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a 2007 class action case against corporations that benefited from black enslavement. 28 In 2019 the House of Representatives held a hearing on HR 40 -the number refers to Sherman's unfulfilled promise of land-a bill that was introduced in every Congress from 1989 to 2017 by Michigan Representative John Conyers. Unceremoniously killed in committee for nearly 30 years, HR 40 would not compel federal payouts to the descendants of enslaved people but instead would merely impanel a commission to examine the impact of \" slavery and its continuing vestiges .\" In taking up the bill's sponsorship, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee noted that it would help illuminate the statistics that show the \"stunning chasm between the destinies of White America and that of Black America.\" For example, the median wealth of white families is currently estimated at $171,000; for black families, it is $17,600 -approximately a tenfold difference. Fewer than 10 percent of white families have zero or negative net worth, while nearly 20 percent of black households do. Discrimination against black people in mortgage lending, historically and today, has hobbled opportunities for homeownership , the source of two-thirds of equity for American households and one of the most reliable forms of intergenerational wealth . And while we're on the subject of black folks being denied property, it seems like a good moment to note that if those 40 acres and a mule had been distributed as promised, the land would be worth about $6.4 trillion today . 29 More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice! March 12, 2025 If there were an actual interest in ending those disparities, Congress would at the very least support studying the numbers. Instead, opponents of HR 40 argue against even investigating the issue. That opposition, including McConnell's dismissive remarks, demonstrates the ahistorical American self-mythologizing at the heart of the country's bitter opposition to slavery reparations. The Senate leader and his ilk are fighting an ideological war to defend the lie that slavery was a historical anomaly, an inconsequential blip on an American moral arc that always otherwise bends toward racial justice. It's an attempt to rewrite history, omitting how the denial of reparations shortchanged black freedom and omitting the policies of Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, and unstinting white terror against black success. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the highly influential 2014 Atlantic article \"The Case for Reparations,\" directly addressed McConnell-whose family enslaved black human beings -in his testimony on HR 40. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" Coates stated. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\" 30 R ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions. Yale, Brown, Harvard, William & Mary, and more than 50 other members of the Universities Studying Slavery consortium have acknowledged the role of black enslavement in their early funding, founding, construction, and maintenance. (The collective includes schools in Britain, which also gave reparations solely to enslavers; the taxpayer-funded payments of $3.9 billion ended only in 2015. ) To atone for their ties to slavery, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Georgetown University have all established reparations funds . In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\n\"Any legislation that sought to put black people on an equal footing has been ultimately, if not strangled in the crib, slowly starved,\" historian Carroll Gibbs, the author of Black, Copper, & Bright: The District of Columbia's Black Civil War Regiment , told me. \"It's important to understand that what makes the argument hollow-that it's too late to do anything because everybody's dead now-is that the US refused to do it when everyone was still alive.\" 3 Instead, the US government supported and enshrined into law policies that further entrenched white supremacy. Case in point: The only reparations program enacted by the federal government doled out the 2020 equivalent of over $23 million in Treasury Department funds-not to the formerly enslaved but to their white enslavers. 4 (National Archives) In April 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act , a congressional bill abolishing slavery in Washington, DC. Less than half a year earlier, he proposed similar legislation in Delaware that stalled in the state's House of Representatives. Under the DC law-the first emancipation legislation in this country's history-enslavers were eligible to receive up to $300 for each person they were legally obliged to liberate. (I use the term \"enslaver\" rather than \"slave owner\" because it acknowledges the active role those individuals played in keeping human beings locked in a brutal and violent institution. And while the reductive term \"slave\" has historically been used to strip black people of their humanity, referring to an \"enslaved person\" makes clear that bondage was a legally enforced position.) No such provision was made for DC's newly freed black population. Instead, seeing no more use for them, the government offered formerly enslaved people funds only if they agreed to relocate to Haiti, Liberia, \"or such other country beyond the limits of the United States.\" For this act of self-deportation from the land they had made an economic powerhouse, payment would \"not exceed one hundred dollars for each emigrant.\" 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Almost no freed people took up the government on its insulting offer, but DC-area enslavers submitted 966 petitions in the months following the law's passage. In accordance with eligibility requirements, each filer declared loyalty to the Union and presented itemized descriptions-essentially, invoices-of those they'd enslaved, assigning estimated dollar amounts to each human being. Lincoln empaneled a three-person commission to render a final judgment on the monetary merit of each petition and thus on the black lives described therein. 6 T he trio of DC-based commissioners decided that their first order of business was to locate someone well acquainted with the task of putting price tags on human beings. The Civil War, now entering its second year, disrupted the retail market for enslaved people, causing instability in pricing. Further, the trading of enslaved people-meaning the literal and legal sale of humans from one enslaver to another-was banned in Washington, DC, under the Compromise of 1850. \"There are few persons, especially in a community like Washington, where slavery has been for many years an interest of comparatively trifling importance, who possess the knowledge and discrimination as to the value of slaves,\" the commission mused in its written report . This area of unpreparedness, the commissioners feared, might interfere with their ability to assess the \"just apportionment of compensation\" to which enslavers were entitled. Driven by sympathetic concern for the hardships of enslavers denied the legal right to enslave-and to avoid what they unironically referred to as the \"interminable labor\" of accurately guesstimating people's worth-the commission brought on Bernard M. Campbell, \"an experienced dealer in slaves from Baltimore.\" 7 Broken promise: The US government reneged on Gen. William T. Sherman's order to provide \"40 acres and a mule\" to formerly enslaved people, forcing millions into sharecropping. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) Current Issue View our current issue According to the law, petitioners needed to \"produce\" the enslaved people for whom they requested compensation, and Campbell's duties included conducting physical examinations to determine their value, just as at auctions. But the rule of an in-person appearance was often waived. \"Many [freed people] left immediately\" when Emancipation was announced in the district, seeking out paid work with the military and in parts farther north. Others had run away before the act became law, and in a few cases, enslaved people died just after Lincoln signed the bill. 8 \"Under such circumstances,\" the commissioners determined, \"it would be manifestly unjust to withhold compensation on account of the inability of the claimant to produce\" the enslaved person they claimed. The panel decided enslavers deserved compensation if the people they'd enslaved had escaped no more than two years prior. Petitioners were also asked to include \"written evidence\" substantiating their claims, but submissions lacking that proof ran little risk of being rejected. This \"liberal construction of the act,\" the commissioners wrote, sprang from the desire to free the most people (and, of course, pay the most enslavers) without paperwork getting in the way. But the laxity with which this rule was applied highlighted one of the many horrific aspects of enslavement: the ease with which white claims to black bodies and lives could be made. 9 \"Slaves were held, owned, and mistreated so callously that there quite often was not a legal basis for their ownership,\" says Kenneth Winkle, a historian at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the research project Civil War Washington . \"Slave owners were asked to provide records or bills of sale or receipts or some paperwork. Most of them simply said, 'I've misplaced it' or 'I'm not sure I ever had any.' A white person could claim ownership of an African-American as a slave based on the testimony of two other white people, with no paperwork necessary.\" 10 Putting a price on human beings: Horatio King was a member of the commission adjudicating claims under the District of Columbia's 1862 Compensated Emancipation Act. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division) The Compensated Emancipation Act did not grant automatic emancipation to enslaved people not named in petitions, and some enslavers did not file for compensation by the act's 90-day deadline, many of them pro-slavery Confederate sympathizers who had no intention of emancipating those they enslaved. To address these cases, Congress passed the Supplementary Act in July 1862, which allowed black folks to submit petitions pleading for their own emancipation and to testify and serve as witnesses-the first time African Americans were allowed to do so in federal proceedings. More than 160 claims were filed by people the commissioners described as \"held to service in the District of Columbia by reason of African descent.\" 11 Winkle and his colleagues at Civil War Washington have meticulously cataloged, digitized, transcribed, and posted online nearly all of the petitions filed under the Compensated Emancipation Act. No matter how much you may know about the violence, cruelty, depravity, and terror of slavery, those horrors are revealed anew in the petitions filed. The petitioners' responses to the bureaucratic formality of noting how they \"acquired\" other human beings as their property leads to firsthand accounts of black people ripped from their families, treated like hand-me-downs, and enslaved by dint of birth. One claimant wrote that an enslaved woman named \"Ann Williams [was] acquired by marriage forty years ago \" and that her grandson, Albert Hollyday, \"was born while his mother (Eliza since sold) was owned by me.\" Another enslaver (this time a woman, of which there were many) reported that a black woman identified only as Delilah was \" willed to me by my father in 1816 \" and that \"while my slave and in my survace [sic] Delilah had a daughter named Amanda who while my slave and in my survace [sic] became the mother of said Casper & William,\" two young men for whom she requested $450 and $350, respectively. 12 Enslaved people are listed by name in the petitions, a rarity in documents from the era. That omission was intentional and institutional: Recording the names of the enslaved threatened to confer personhood, and the denial of humanity was the bedrock on which black chattel slavery rested. Erasure of black people from the American historical record is partly located in the practice of reducing the enslaved to nameless head counts or dollar amounts, an obliteration of black existence that continues to impede African American efforts at heritage and genealogical research. Even this tiny recognition of black humanity was conceded only in exchange for federal dollars. 13 The degrading reduction of black human beings to what were deemed salable traits is both the most salient horror in the petitions and the entire reason for the exercise. Petitioners described the old , the very young, and the sick as having \"no value,\" rendered worthless by a market that no longer had a way to exploit them. Just as horrifying are the price tags affixed by petitioners to enslaved people for whom they hoped to receive top dollar. Through descriptions of enslaved people's physical and mental characteristics, the petitioners provided justifications for their compensation claims, highlighting what the commissioners labeled \" their intrinsic utility to their owners .\" Ironically, these reductive descriptions provide rare glimpses of the human beings named, the lives they lived, and the circumstances they endured. 14 Linda Harris, for example, is described as a \" slave for life ,\" of \"olive brown complexion with full suit of hair, free spoken and intelligent.\" Her enslaver writes that Linda is \"honest\" and \"an excellent cook, washerwoman or nurse. During the past year she has had occasional attacks of rheumatism; and is at intervals troubled with weakness of the breast, but has never been compelled to abandon her usual duties.\" (As if, one thinks, she had a choice.) Linda's estimated worth is given as $800. Her enslaver was paid $306.60 for her. 15 The petition: Linda Harris's enslaver received $306.60 for emancipating her. (National Archives via Civil War Washington) William Alexander Johnson, 22 years old, is described as 5 feet 8 inches tall and \" a skillful mechanic , very ingenious in every branch of mechanism...employed in making models for patents, in making and repairing mathematical instruments.\" His enslaver requested $2,000 for him; she was compensated in the amount of $657. 16 Twenty-three-year-old Margaret E.

That opposition, including McConnell's dismissive remarks, demonstrates the ahistorical American self-mythologizing at the heart of the country's bitter opposition to slavery reparations. The Senate leader and his ilk are fighting an ideological war to defend the lie that slavery was a historical anomaly, an inconsequential blip on an American moral arc that always otherwise bends toward racial justice. It's an attempt to rewrite history, omitting how the denial of reparations shortchanged black freedom and omitting the policies of Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, and unstinting white terror against black success. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the highly influential 2014 Atlantic article \"The Case for Reparations,\" directly addressed McConnell-whose family enslaved black human beings -in his testimony on HR 40. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" Coates stated. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\" 30 R ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions. Yale, Brown, Harvard, William & Mary, and more than 50 other members of the Universities Studying Slavery consortium have acknowledged the role of black enslavement in their early funding, founding, construction, and maintenance. (The collective includes schools in Britain, which also gave reparations solely to enslavers; the taxpayer-funded payments of $3.9 billion ended only in 2015. ) To atone for their ties to slavery, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Georgetown University have all established reparations funds . In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\nInstead, the US government supported and enshrined into law policies that further entrenched white supremacy. Case in point: The only reparations program enacted by the federal government doled out the 2020 equivalent of over $23 million in Treasury Department funds-not to the formerly enslaved but to their white enslavers. 4 (National Archives) In April 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act , a congressional bill abolishing slavery in Washington, DC. Less than half a year earlier, he proposed similar legislation in Delaware that stalled in the state's House of Representatives. Under the DC law-the first emancipation legislation in this country's history-enslavers were eligible to receive up to $300 for each person they were legally obliged to liberate. (I use the term \"enslaver\" rather than \"slave owner\" because it acknowledges the active role those individuals played in keeping human beings locked in a brutal and violent institution. And while the reductive term \"slave\" has historically been used to strip black people of their humanity, referring to an \"enslaved person\" makes clear that bondage was a legally enforced position.) No such provision was made for DC's newly freed black population. Instead, seeing no more use for them, the government offered formerly enslaved people funds only if they agreed to relocate to Haiti, Liberia, \"or such other country beyond the limits of the United States.\" For this act of self-deportation from the land they had made an economic powerhouse, payment would \"not exceed one hundred dollars for each emigrant.\" 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Almost no freed people took up the government on its insulting offer, but DC-area enslavers submitted 966 petitions in the months following the law's passage. In accordance with eligibility requirements, each filer declared loyalty to the Union and presented itemized descriptions-essentially, invoices-of those they'd enslaved, assigning estimated dollar amounts to each human being. Lincoln empaneled a three-person commission to render a final judgment on the monetary merit of each petition and thus on the black lives described therein. 6 T he trio of DC-based commissioners decided that their first order of business was to locate someone well acquainted with the task of putting price tags on human beings. The Civil War, now entering its second year, disrupted the retail market for enslaved people, causing instability in pricing. Further, the trading of enslaved people-meaning the literal and legal sale of humans from one enslaver to another-was banned in Washington, DC, under the Compromise of 1850. \"There are few persons, especially in a community like Washington, where slavery has been for many years an interest of comparatively trifling importance, who possess the knowledge and discrimination as to the value of slaves,\" the commission mused in its written report . This area of unpreparedness, the commissioners feared, might interfere with their ability to assess the \"just apportionment of compensation\" to which enslavers were entitled. Driven by sympathetic concern for the hardships of enslavers denied the legal right to enslave-and to avoid what they unironically referred to as the \"interminable labor\" of accurately guesstimating people's worth-the commission brought on Bernard M. Campbell, \"an experienced dealer in slaves from Baltimore.\" 7 Broken promise: The US government reneged on Gen. William T. Sherman's order to provide \"40 acres and a mule\" to formerly enslaved people, forcing millions into sharecropping. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) Current Issue View our current issue According to the law, petitioners needed to \"produce\" the enslaved people for whom they requested compensation, and Campbell's duties included conducting physical examinations to determine their value, just as at auctions. But the rule of an in-person appearance was often waived. \"Many [freed people] left immediately\" when Emancipation was announced in the district, seeking out paid work with the military and in parts farther north. Others had run away before the act became law, and in a few cases, enslaved people died just after Lincoln signed the bill. 8 \"Under such circumstances,\" the commissioners determined, \"it would be manifestly unjust to withhold compensation on account of the inability of the claimant to produce\" the enslaved person they claimed. The panel decided enslavers deserved compensation if the people they'd enslaved had escaped no more than two years prior. Petitioners were also asked to include \"written evidence\" substantiating their claims, but submissions lacking that proof ran little risk of being rejected. This \"liberal construction of the act,\" the commissioners wrote, sprang from the desire to free the most people (and, of course, pay the most enslavers) without paperwork getting in the way. But the laxity with which this rule was applied highlighted one of the many horrific aspects of enslavement: the ease with which white claims to black bodies and lives could be made. 9 \"Slaves were held, owned, and mistreated so callously that there quite often was not a legal basis for their ownership,\" says Kenneth Winkle, a historian at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the research project Civil War Washington . \"Slave owners were asked to provide records or bills of sale or receipts or some paperwork. Most of them simply said, 'I've misplaced it' or 'I'm not sure I ever had any.' A white person could claim ownership of an African-American as a slave based on the testimony of two other white people, with no paperwork necessary.\" 10 Putting a price on human beings: Horatio King was a member of the commission adjudicating claims under the District of Columbia's 1862 Compensated Emancipation Act. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division) The Compensated Emancipation Act did not grant automatic emancipation to enslaved people not named in petitions, and some enslavers did not file for compensation by the act's 90-day deadline, many of them pro-slavery Confederate sympathizers who had no intention of emancipating those they enslaved. To address these cases, Congress passed the Supplementary Act in July 1862, which allowed black folks to submit petitions pleading for their own emancipation and to testify and serve as witnesses-the first time African Americans were allowed to do so in federal proceedings. More than 160 claims were filed by people the commissioners described as \"held to service in the District of Columbia by reason of African descent.\" 11 Winkle and his colleagues at Civil War Washington have meticulously cataloged, digitized, transcribed, and posted online nearly all of the petitions filed under the Compensated Emancipation Act. No matter how much you may know about the violence, cruelty, depravity, and terror of slavery, those horrors are revealed anew in the petitions filed. The petitioners' responses to the bureaucratic formality of noting how they \"acquired\" other human beings as their property leads to firsthand accounts of black people ripped from their families, treated like hand-me-downs, and enslaved by dint of birth. One claimant wrote that an enslaved woman named \"Ann Williams [was] acquired by marriage forty years ago \" and that her grandson, Albert Hollyday, \"was born while his mother (Eliza since sold) was owned by me.\" Another enslaver (this time a woman, of which there were many) reported that a black woman identified only as Delilah was \" willed to me by my father in 1816 \" and that \"while my slave and in my survace [sic] Delilah had a daughter named Amanda who while my slave and in my survace [sic] became the mother of said Casper & William,\" two young men for whom she requested $450 and $350, respectively. 12 Enslaved people are listed by name in the petitions, a rarity in documents from the era. That omission was intentional and institutional: Recording the names of the enslaved threatened to confer personhood, and the denial of humanity was the bedrock on which black chattel slavery rested. Erasure of black people from the American historical record is partly located in the practice of reducing the enslaved to nameless head counts or dollar amounts, an obliteration of black existence that continues to impede African American efforts at heritage and genealogical research. Even this tiny recognition of black humanity was conceded only in exchange for federal dollars. 13 The degrading reduction of black human beings to what were deemed salable traits is both the most salient horror in the petitions and the entire reason for the exercise. Petitioners described the old , the very young, and the sick as having \"no value,\" rendered worthless by a market that no longer had a way to exploit them. Just as horrifying are the price tags affixed by petitioners to enslaved people for whom they hoped to receive top dollar. Through descriptions of enslaved people's physical and mental characteristics, the petitioners provided justifications for their compensation claims, highlighting what the commissioners labeled \" their intrinsic utility to their owners .\" Ironically, these reductive descriptions provide rare glimpses of the human beings named, the lives they lived, and the circumstances they endured. 14 Linda Harris, for example, is described as a \" slave for life ,\" of \"olive brown complexion with full suit of hair, free spoken and intelligent.\" Her enslaver writes that Linda is \"honest\" and \"an excellent cook, washerwoman or nurse. During the past year she has had occasional attacks of rheumatism; and is at intervals troubled with weakness of the breast, but has never been compelled to abandon her usual duties.\" (As if, one thinks, she had a choice.) Linda's estimated worth is given as $800. Her enslaver was paid $306.60 for her. 15 The petition: Linda Harris's enslaver received $306.60 for emancipating her. (National Archives via Civil War Washington) William Alexander Johnson, 22 years old, is described as 5 feet 8 inches tall and \" a skillful mechanic , very ingenious in every branch of mechanism...employed in making models for patents, in making and repairing mathematical instruments.\" His enslaver requested $2,000 for him; she was compensated in the amount of $657. 16 Twenty-three-year-old Margaret E. Taylor was the mother of 5-year-old Annie and infant Fanny, both of whom are described as being of \"mulatto color.\" Their male enslaver notes that \"both [were] born while their said mother was held to said service or labor by your Petitioner.\" He was given $569.40 for the woman and her children, with Fanny garnering just $21.90. 17 Gibbs told me that, in addition to the dehumanizing nature of the process, he was consistently struck by the way the descriptions counter the narrative that enslaved people were mentally feeble or lazy. \"Despite the claims of proslavery [advocates],\" he said, \"we're looking at people whom their masters described in many cases as worthy, competent, skilled.\" 18 Philip Reid is described in a petition as 42 years old, \"not prepossessing in appearance, but smart in mind,\" and formerly \"employed...by the Government.\" He was a skilled artisan who helped cast DC's Statue of Freedom and whose ingenuity succeeded in placing the bronze figure atop the Capitol, where it stands today. For his 33 weeks of labor without respite, Reid was paid $1.25 per day. He was allowed to keep only his Sunday wages; the rest went to his enslaver, Clark Mills. In his claim , Mills requested $1,500 in compensation for Reid. He received $350.40. 19 \"The primary drawback in consulting these records is that most of them were compiled by the slave owners, not by the slaves themselves,\" Winkle said. \"So this becomes a huge exercise in reading between the lines, so to speak, and certainly not taking this information at face value but analyzing it before putting the pieces together to try to create an authentic collective portrait of who these slaves were, how they lived their lives, and what they accomplished. And surviving slavery was an incredible accomplishment.\" He added that the petitions represent \"just over 3,300 slaves in the District of Columbia. I always say it's one-tenth of 1 percent of all the slaves in the American South, but we see them. They are named. We can see them as individuals.\" 20 Seeking justice: In 1870, Sojourner Truth petitioned Congress for land reparations. (National Portrait Gallery) \"Self-petitions\" from enslaved African Americans requesting their freedom, many of them written by white pro bono lawyers, provide yet more insight. Phillip Meredith, a 30-year-old black man, lists his enslaver of 30 years as \" General Robert Lee .\" A corroborating witness notes the general was \"formerly of U.S. Army now in Rebel service.\" Meredith's petition was approved. 21 A more heartrending story is told through the \"self-petition\" of Mary A. Prather on behalf of herself and her 3-year-old son, Arthur. \"Mary says she had permission\" from her enslaver to be hired out, according to testimony, but that permission was later rescinded, making her a fugitive and thus ineligible for emancipation under the act. Mary's and Arthur's names appear in the commissioners' report among those \" from whom certificates have been withheld .\" 22 Washington Childs wrote in his \"self-petition\" that he was 33 years old , 6 feet 2 inches tall, with \"a large hair mole on the right side of his chin.\" He indicated that he was hired out in Washington, DC, \"nearly or quite five years last past\" by his Virginian enslaver, who would have received all of his wages during that time. His enslaver provided a letter of support for Childs's emancipation to be presented to the commission. Included in the missive is a citation of an outstanding debt of $60 , along with the galling request that Childs pay it off by sending \"a barrel of good sugar & sacks of coffee and 2 bolts of cotton & [a] pound of best Tea, that is if you can send the tea & cotton by express.\" 23 His emancipation was granted, and his enslaver was not compensated. But the overwhelming majority of those who submitted compensation claims succeeded in getting funds-often in amounts lower than requested, but at times up to $788. The compensation given to white enslavers helped maintain their financial security and the continuation of white supremacy and power. 24 \"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young , the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber , the second largest,\" Gibbs told me. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory . She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe , \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" 25 E ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which applied only to the treasonous Confederate states, over which the Union had no jurisdiction. Slavery wasn't fully abolished until nearly three years later, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 26 Stolen land, stolen freedom: A sharecropper plowing in Montgomery, Alabama. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) In January 1865, the United States undertook the \"40 acres and a mule\" reparations program, distributing 400,000 acres of Southern coastal land confiscated from disloyal Confederates to freed black families in plots of \" not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground. \" (Union Gen. William T. Sherman, who issued the initial order , also authorized distribution of old Army mules.) Historian and former US Commission on Civil Rights chair Mary Frances Berry noted that by June of 1865, \" 40,000 freedmen had been settled \" on the land and were already \"growing crops.\" Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, cruelly reversed the policy, evicting the land's black occupants and returning their properties to the white Confederate enslavers who had attacked the Union. Many of those black folks would be forced into sharecropping, a Jim Crow form of slavery in all but name. 27 American history has since been marked by too many calls for reparations to list, each rebuffed in turn by the US government. In 1870, Sojourner Truth unsuccessfully petitioned Congress for land reparations, stating, \"I shall make them understand that there is a debt to the Negro people which they can never repay. At least, then, they must make amends.\" Walter Vaughan, a white slavery apologist who believed black dollars would ultimately fatten white Southern pockets, wrote an 1890 bill to give freed people pensions like those granted to Civil War veterans. Introduced in Congress by Nebraska Representative William J. Connell, Vaughan's \" ex-slave pension bill \" died before becoming law, as did eight other reparations proposals introduced between 1896 and 1903. During the same period, a formerly enslaved woman and mother of five named Callie House cofounded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. In 1915, the group sued the US Treasury for $68 million, the estimated amount of taxes collected on cotton between 1862 and 1868 . A lower tribunal and the Supreme Court cited government immunity in dismissing the suit. For her temerity, House was charged with mail fraud , convicted by an all-white jury, and sentenced to a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Nearly 50 years later, reparations advocate Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore secured enough petition signatures-over 1 million-to compel President John F. Kennedy to meet with her, but no legal remedies followed. The US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed a 1995 reparations lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a 2007 class action case against corporations that benefited from black enslavement. 28 In 2019 the House of Representatives held a hearing on HR 40 -the number refers to Sherman's unfulfilled promise of land-a bill that was introduced in every Congress from 1989 to 2017 by Michigan Representative John Conyers. Unceremoniously killed in committee for nearly 30 years, HR 40 would not compel federal payouts to the descendants of enslaved people but instead would merely impanel a commission to examine the impact of \" slavery and its continuing vestiges .\" In taking up the bill's sponsorship, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee noted that it would help illuminate the statistics that show the \"stunning chasm between the destinies of White America and that of Black America.\" For example, the median wealth of white families is currently estimated at $171,000; for black families, it is $17,600 -approximately a tenfold difference. Fewer than 10 percent of white families have zero or negative net worth, while nearly 20 percent of black households do. Discrimination against black people in mortgage lending, historically and today, has hobbled opportunities for homeownership , the source of two-thirds of equity for American households and one of the most reliable forms of intergenerational wealth . And while we're on the subject of black folks being denied property, it seems like a good moment to note that if those 40 acres and a mule had been distributed as promised, the land would be worth about $6.4 trillion today . 29 More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice!

One claimant wrote that an enslaved woman named \"Ann Williams [was] acquired by marriage forty years ago \" and that her grandson, Albert Hollyday, \"was born while his mother (Eliza since sold) was owned by me.\" Another enslaver (this time a woman, of which there were many) reported that a black woman identified only as Delilah was \" willed to me by my father in 1816 \" and that \"while my slave and in my survace [sic] Delilah had a daughter named Amanda who while my slave and in my survace [sic] became the mother of said Casper & William,\" two young men for whom she requested $450 and $350, respectively. 12 Enslaved people are listed by name in the petitions, a rarity in documents from the era. That omission was intentional and institutional: Recording the names of the enslaved threatened to confer personhood, and the denial of humanity was the bedrock on which black chattel slavery rested. Erasure of black people from the American historical record is partly located in the practice of reducing the enslaved to nameless head counts or dollar amounts, an obliteration of black existence that continues to impede African American efforts at heritage and genealogical research. Even this tiny recognition of black humanity was conceded only in exchange for federal dollars. 13 The degrading reduction of black human beings to what were deemed salable traits is both the most salient horror in the petitions and the entire reason for the exercise. Petitioners described the old , the very young, and the sick as having \"no value,\" rendered worthless by a market that no longer had a way to exploit them. Just as horrifying are the price tags affixed by petitioners to enslaved people for whom they hoped to receive top dollar. Through descriptions of enslaved people's physical and mental characteristics, the petitioners provided justifications for their compensation claims, highlighting what the commissioners labeled \" their intrinsic utility to their owners .\" Ironically, these reductive descriptions provide rare glimpses of the human beings named, the lives they lived, and the circumstances they endured. 14 Linda Harris, for example, is described as a \" slave for life ,\" of \"olive brown complexion with full suit of hair, free spoken and intelligent.\" Her enslaver writes that Linda is \"honest\" and \"an excellent cook, washerwoman or nurse. During the past year she has had occasional attacks of rheumatism; and is at intervals troubled with weakness of the breast, but has never been compelled to abandon her usual duties.\" (As if, one thinks, she had a choice.) Linda's estimated worth is given as $800. Her enslaver was paid $306.60 for her. 15 The petition: Linda Harris's enslaver received $306.60 for emancipating her. (National Archives via Civil War Washington) William Alexander Johnson, 22 years old, is described as 5 feet 8 inches tall and \" a skillful mechanic , very ingenious in every branch of mechanism...employed in making models for patents, in making and repairing mathematical instruments.\" His enslaver requested $2,000 for him; she was compensated in the amount of $657. 16 Twenty-three-year-old Margaret E. Taylor was the mother of 5-year-old Annie and infant Fanny, both of whom are described as being of \"mulatto color.\" Their male enslaver notes that \"both [were] born while their said mother was held to said service or labor by your Petitioner.\" He was given $569.40 for the woman and her children, with Fanny garnering just $21.90. 17 Gibbs told me that, in addition to the dehumanizing nature of the process, he was consistently struck by the way the descriptions counter the narrative that enslaved people were mentally feeble or lazy. \"Despite the claims of proslavery [advocates],\" he said, \"we're looking at people whom their masters described in many cases as worthy, competent, skilled.\" 18 Philip Reid is described in a petition as 42 years old, \"not prepossessing in appearance, but smart in mind,\" and formerly \"employed...by the Government.\" He was a skilled artisan who helped cast DC's Statue of Freedom and whose ingenuity succeeded in placing the bronze figure atop the Capitol, where it stands today. For his 33 weeks of labor without respite, Reid was paid $1.25 per day. He was allowed to keep only his Sunday wages; the rest went to his enslaver, Clark Mills. In his claim , Mills requested $1,500 in compensation for Reid. He received $350.40. 19 \"The primary drawback in consulting these records is that most of them were compiled by the slave owners, not by the slaves themselves,\" Winkle said. \"So this becomes a huge exercise in reading between the lines, so to speak, and certainly not taking this information at face value but analyzing it before putting the pieces together to try to create an authentic collective portrait of who these slaves were, how they lived their lives, and what they accomplished. And surviving slavery was an incredible accomplishment.\" He added that the petitions represent \"just over 3,300 slaves in the District of Columbia. I always say it's one-tenth of 1 percent of all the slaves in the American South, but we see them. They are named. We can see them as individuals.\" 20 Seeking justice: In 1870, Sojourner Truth petitioned Congress for land reparations. (National Portrait Gallery) \"Self-petitions\" from enslaved African Americans requesting their freedom, many of them written by white pro bono lawyers, provide yet more insight. Phillip Meredith, a 30-year-old black man, lists his enslaver of 30 years as \" General Robert Lee .\" A corroborating witness notes the general was \"formerly of U.S. Army now in Rebel service.\" Meredith's petition was approved. 21 A more heartrending story is told through the \"self-petition\" of Mary A. Prather on behalf of herself and her 3-year-old son, Arthur. \"Mary says she had permission\" from her enslaver to be hired out, according to testimony, but that permission was later rescinded, making her a fugitive and thus ineligible for emancipation under the act. Mary's and Arthur's names appear in the commissioners' report among those \" from whom certificates have been withheld .\" 22 Washington Childs wrote in his \"self-petition\" that he was 33 years old , 6 feet 2 inches tall, with \"a large hair mole on the right side of his chin.\" He indicated that he was hired out in Washington, DC, \"nearly or quite five years last past\" by his Virginian enslaver, who would have received all of his wages during that time. His enslaver provided a letter of support for Childs's emancipation to be presented to the commission. Included in the missive is a citation of an outstanding debt of $60 , along with the galling request that Childs pay it off by sending \"a barrel of good sugar & sacks of coffee and 2 bolts of cotton & [a] pound of best Tea, that is if you can send the tea & cotton by express.\" 23 His emancipation was granted, and his enslaver was not compensated. But the overwhelming majority of those who submitted compensation claims succeeded in getting funds-often in amounts lower than requested, but at times up to $788. The compensation given to white enslavers helped maintain their financial security and the continuation of white supremacy and power. 24 \"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young , the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber , the second largest,\" Gibbs told me. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory . She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe , \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" 25 E ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which applied only to the treasonous Confederate states, over which the Union had no jurisdiction. Slavery wasn't fully abolished until nearly three years later, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 26 Stolen land, stolen freedom: A sharecropper plowing in Montgomery, Alabama. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) In January 1865, the United States undertook the \"40 acres and a mule\" reparations program, distributing 400,000 acres of Southern coastal land confiscated from disloyal Confederates to freed black families in plots of \" not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground. \" (Union Gen. William T. Sherman, who issued the initial order , also authorized distribution of old Army mules.) Historian and former US Commission on Civil Rights chair Mary Frances Berry noted that by June of 1865, \" 40,000 freedmen had been settled \" on the land and were already \"growing crops.\" Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, cruelly reversed the policy, evicting the land's black occupants and returning their properties to the white Confederate enslavers who had attacked the Union. Many of those black folks would be forced into sharecropping, a Jim Crow form of slavery in all but name. 27 American history has since been marked by too many calls for reparations to list, each rebuffed in turn by the US government. In 1870, Sojourner Truth unsuccessfully petitioned Congress for land reparations, stating, \"I shall make them understand that there is a debt to the Negro people which they can never repay. At least, then, they must make amends.\" Walter Vaughan, a white slavery apologist who believed black dollars would ultimately fatten white Southern pockets, wrote an 1890 bill to give freed people pensions like those granted to Civil War veterans. Introduced in Congress by Nebraska Representative William J. Connell, Vaughan's \" ex-slave pension bill \" died before becoming law, as did eight other reparations proposals introduced between 1896 and 1903. During the same period, a formerly enslaved woman and mother of five named Callie House cofounded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. In 1915, the group sued the US Treasury for $68 million, the estimated amount of taxes collected on cotton between 1862 and 1868 . A lower tribunal and the Supreme Court cited government immunity in dismissing the suit. For her temerity, House was charged with mail fraud , convicted by an all-white jury, and sentenced to a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Nearly 50 years later, reparations advocate Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore secured enough petition signatures-over 1 million-to compel President John F. Kennedy to meet with her, but no legal remedies followed. The US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed a 1995 reparations lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a 2007 class action case against corporations that benefited from black enslavement. 28 In 2019 the House of Representatives held a hearing on HR 40 -the number refers to Sherman's unfulfilled promise of land-a bill that was introduced in every Congress from 1989 to 2017 by Michigan Representative John Conyers. Unceremoniously killed in committee for nearly 30 years, HR 40 would not compel federal payouts to the descendants of enslaved people but instead would merely impanel a commission to examine the impact of \" slavery and its continuing vestiges .\" In taking up the bill's sponsorship, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee noted that it would help illuminate the statistics that show the \"stunning chasm between the destinies of White America and that of Black America.\" For example, the median wealth of white families is currently estimated at $171,000; for black families, it is $17,600 -approximately a tenfold difference. Fewer than 10 percent of white families have zero or negative net worth, while nearly 20 percent of black households do. Discrimination against black people in mortgage lending, historically and today, has hobbled opportunities for homeownership , the source of two-thirds of equity for American households and one of the most reliable forms of intergenerational wealth . And while we're on the subject of black folks being denied property, it seems like a good moment to note that if those 40 acres and a mule had been distributed as promised, the land would be worth about $6.4 trillion today . 29 More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice! March 12, 2025 If there were an actual interest in ending those disparities, Congress would at the very least support studying the numbers. Instead, opponents of HR 40 argue against even investigating the issue. That opposition, including McConnell's dismissive remarks, demonstrates the ahistorical American self-mythologizing at the heart of the country's bitter opposition to slavery reparations. The Senate leader and his ilk are fighting an ideological war to defend the lie that slavery was a historical anomaly, an inconsequential blip on an American moral arc that always otherwise bends toward racial justice. It's an attempt to rewrite history, omitting how the denial of reparations shortchanged black freedom and omitting the policies of Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, and unstinting white terror against black success. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the highly influential 2014 Atlantic article \"The Case for Reparations,\" directly addressed McConnell-whose family enslaved black human beings -in his testimony on HR 40. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" Coates stated. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\" 30 R ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions. Yale, Brown, Harvard, William & Mary, and more than 50 other members of the Universities Studying Slavery consortium have acknowledged the role of black enslavement in their early funding, founding, construction, and maintenance. (The collective includes schools in Britain, which also gave reparations solely to enslavers; the taxpayer-funded payments of $3.9 billion ended only in 2015. ) To atone for their ties to slavery, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Georgetown University have all established reparations funds . In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nAlmost no freed people took up the government on its insulting offer, but DC-area enslavers submitted 966 petitions in the months following the law's passage. In accordance with eligibility requirements, each filer declared loyalty to the Union and presented itemized descriptions-essentially, invoices-of those they'd enslaved, assigning estimated dollar amounts to each human being. Lincoln empaneled a three-person commission to render a final judgment on the monetary merit of each petition and thus on the black lives described therein. 6 T he trio of DC-based commissioners decided that their first order of business was to locate someone well acquainted with the task of putting price tags on human beings. The Civil War, now entering its second year, disrupted the retail market for enslaved people, causing instability in pricing. Further, the trading of enslaved people-meaning the literal and legal sale of humans from one enslaver to another-was banned in Washington, DC, under the Compromise of 1850. \"There are few persons, especially in a community like Washington, where slavery has been for many years an interest of comparatively trifling importance, who possess the knowledge and discrimination as to the value of slaves,\" the commission mused in its written report . This area of unpreparedness, the commissioners feared, might interfere with their ability to assess the \"just apportionment of compensation\" to which enslavers were entitled. Driven by sympathetic concern for the hardships of enslavers denied the legal right to enslave-and to avoid what they unironically referred to as the \"interminable labor\" of accurately guesstimating people's worth-the commission brought on Bernard M. Campbell, \"an experienced dealer in slaves from Baltimore.\" 7 Broken promise: The US government reneged on Gen. William T. Sherman's order to provide \"40 acres and a mule\" to formerly enslaved people, forcing millions into sharecropping. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) Current Issue View our current issue According to the law, petitioners needed to \"produce\" the enslaved people for whom they requested compensation, and Campbell's duties included conducting physical examinations to determine their value, just as at auctions. But the rule of an in-person appearance was often waived. \"Many [freed people] left immediately\" when Emancipation was announced in the district, seeking out paid work with the military and in parts farther north. Others had run away before the act became law, and in a few cases, enslaved people died just after Lincoln signed the bill. 8 \"Under such circumstances,\" the commissioners determined, \"it would be manifestly unjust to withhold compensation on account of the inability of the claimant to produce\" the enslaved person they claimed. The panel decided enslavers deserved compensation if the people they'd enslaved had escaped no more than two years prior. Petitioners were also asked to include \"written evidence\" substantiating their claims, but submissions lacking that proof ran little risk of being rejected. This \"liberal construction of the act,\" the commissioners wrote, sprang from the desire to free the most people (and, of course, pay the most enslavers) without paperwork getting in the way. But the laxity with which this rule was applied highlighted one of the many horrific aspects of enslavement: the ease with which white claims to black bodies and lives could be made. 9 \"Slaves were held, owned, and mistreated so callously that there quite often was not a legal basis for their ownership,\" says Kenneth Winkle, a historian at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the research project Civil War Washington . \"Slave owners were asked to provide records or bills of sale or receipts or some paperwork. Most of them simply said, 'I've misplaced it' or 'I'm not sure I ever had any.' A white person could claim ownership of an African-American as a slave based on the testimony of two other white people, with no paperwork necessary.\" 10 Putting a price on human beings: Horatio King was a member of the commission adjudicating claims under the District of Columbia's 1862 Compensated Emancipation Act. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division) The Compensated Emancipation Act did not grant automatic emancipation to enslaved people not named in petitions, and some enslavers did not file for compensation by the act's 90-day deadline, many of them pro-slavery Confederate sympathizers who had no intention of emancipating those they enslaved. To address these cases, Congress passed the Supplementary Act in July 1862, which allowed black folks to submit petitions pleading for their own emancipation and to testify and serve as witnesses-the first time African Americans were allowed to do so in federal proceedings. More than 160 claims were filed by people the commissioners described as \"held to service in the District of Columbia by reason of African descent.\" 11 Winkle and his colleagues at Civil War Washington have meticulously cataloged, digitized, transcribed, and posted online nearly all of the petitions filed under the Compensated Emancipation Act. No matter how much you may know about the violence, cruelty, depravity, and terror of slavery, those horrors are revealed anew in the petitions filed. The petitioners' responses to the bureaucratic formality of noting how they \"acquired\" other human beings as their property leads to firsthand accounts of black people ripped from their families, treated like hand-me-downs, and enslaved by dint of birth. One claimant wrote that an enslaved woman named \"Ann Williams [was] acquired by marriage forty years ago \" and that her grandson, Albert Hollyday, \"was born while his mother (Eliza since sold) was owned by me.\" Another enslaver (this time a woman, of which there were many) reported that a black woman identified only as Delilah was \" willed to me by my father in 1816 \" and that \"while my slave and in my survace [sic] Delilah had a daughter named Amanda who while my slave and in my survace [sic] became the mother of said Casper & William,\" two young men for whom she requested $450 and $350, respectively. 12 Enslaved people are listed by name in the petitions, a rarity in documents from the era.

That opposition, including McConnell's dismissive remarks, demonstrates the ahistorical American self-mythologizing at the heart of the country's bitter opposition to slavery reparations. The Senate leader and his ilk are fighting an ideological war to defend the lie that slavery was a historical anomaly, an inconsequential blip on an American moral arc that always otherwise bends toward racial justice. It's an attempt to rewrite history, omitting how the denial of reparations shortchanged black freedom and omitting the policies of Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, and unstinting white terror against black success. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the highly influential 2014 Atlantic article \"The Case for Reparations,\" directly addressed McConnell-whose family enslaved black human beings -in his testimony on HR 40. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" Coates stated. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\" 30 R ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions. Yale, Brown, Harvard, William & Mary, and more than 50 other members of the Universities Studying Slavery consortium have acknowledged the role of black enslavement in their early funding, founding, construction, and maintenance. (The collective includes schools in Britain, which also gave reparations solely to enslavers; the taxpayer-funded payments of $3.9 billion ended only in 2015. ) To atone for their ties to slavery, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Georgetown University have all established reparations funds . In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\nT he trio of DC-based commissioners decided that their first order of business was to locate someone well acquainted with the task of putting price tags on human beings. The Civil War, now entering its second year, disrupted the retail market for enslaved people, causing instability in pricing. Further, the trading of enslaved people-meaning the literal and legal sale of humans from one enslaver to another-was banned in Washington, DC, under the Compromise of 1850. \"There are few persons, especially in a community like Washington, where slavery has been for many years an interest of comparatively trifling importance, who possess the knowledge and discrimination as to the value of slaves,\" the commission mused in its written report . This area of unpreparedness, the commissioners feared, might interfere with their ability to assess the \"just apportionment of compensation\" to which enslavers were entitled. Driven by sympathetic concern for the hardships of enslavers denied the legal right to enslave-and to avoid what they unironically referred to as the \"interminable labor\" of accurately guesstimating people's worth-the commission brought on Bernard M. Campbell, \"an experienced dealer in slaves from Baltimore.\" 7 Broken promise: The US government reneged on Gen. William T. Sherman's order to provide \"40 acres and a mule\" to formerly enslaved people, forcing millions into sharecropping. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) Current Issue View our current issue According to the law, petitioners needed to \"produce\" the enslaved people for whom they requested compensation, and Campbell's duties included conducting physical examinations to determine their value, just as at auctions. But the rule of an in-person appearance was often waived. \"Many [freed people] left immediately\" when Emancipation was announced in the district, seeking out paid work with the military and in parts farther north. Others had run away before the act became law, and in a few cases, enslaved people died just after Lincoln signed the bill. 8 \"Under such circumstances,\" the commissioners determined, \"it would be manifestly unjust to withhold compensation on account of the inability of the claimant to produce\" the enslaved person they claimed. The panel decided enslavers deserved compensation if the people they'd enslaved had escaped no more than two years prior. Petitioners were also asked to include \"written evidence\" substantiating their claims, but submissions lacking that proof ran little risk of being rejected. This \"liberal construction of the act,\" the commissioners wrote, sprang from the desire to free the most people (and, of course, pay the most enslavers) without paperwork getting in the way. But the laxity with which this rule was applied highlighted one of the many horrific aspects of enslavement: the ease with which white claims to black bodies and lives could be made. 9 \"Slaves were held, owned, and mistreated so callously that there quite often was not a legal basis for their ownership,\" says Kenneth Winkle, a historian at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the research project Civil War Washington . \"Slave owners were asked to provide records or bills of sale or receipts or some paperwork. Most of them simply said, 'I've misplaced it' or 'I'm not sure I ever had any.' A white person could claim ownership of an African-American as a slave based on the testimony of two other white people, with no paperwork necessary.\" 10 Putting a price on human beings: Horatio King was a member of the commission adjudicating claims under the District of Columbia's 1862 Compensated Emancipation Act. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division) The Compensated Emancipation Act did not grant automatic emancipation to enslaved people not named in petitions, and some enslavers did not file for compensation by the act's 90-day deadline, many of them pro-slavery Confederate sympathizers who had no intention of emancipating those they enslaved. To address these cases, Congress passed the Supplementary Act in July 1862, which allowed black folks to submit petitions pleading for their own emancipation and to testify and serve as witnesses-the first time African Americans were allowed to do so in federal proceedings. More than 160 claims were filed by people the commissioners described as \"held to service in the District of Columbia by reason of African descent.\" 11 Winkle and his colleagues at Civil War Washington have meticulously cataloged, digitized, transcribed, and posted online nearly all of the petitions filed under the Compensated Emancipation Act. No matter how much you may know about the violence, cruelty, depravity, and terror of slavery, those horrors are revealed anew in the petitions filed. The petitioners' responses to the bureaucratic formality of noting how they \"acquired\" other human beings as their property leads to firsthand accounts of black people ripped from their families, treated like hand-me-downs, and enslaved by dint of birth. One claimant wrote that an enslaved woman named \"Ann Williams [was] acquired by marriage forty years ago \" and that her grandson, Albert Hollyday, \"was born while his mother (Eliza since sold) was owned by me.\" Another enslaver (this time a woman, of which there were many) reported that a black woman identified only as Delilah was \" willed to me by my father in 1816 \" and that \"while my slave and in my survace [sic] Delilah had a daughter named Amanda who while my slave and in my survace [sic] became the mother of said Casper & William,\" two young men for whom she requested $450 and $350, respectively. 12 Enslaved people are listed by name in the petitions, a rarity in documents from the era. That omission was intentional and institutional: Recording the names of the enslaved threatened to confer personhood, and the denial of humanity was the bedrock on which black chattel slavery rested. Erasure of black people from the American historical record is partly located in the practice of reducing the enslaved to nameless head counts or dollar amounts, an obliteration of black existence that continues to impede African American efforts at heritage and genealogical research. Even this tiny recognition of black humanity was conceded only in exchange for federal dollars. 13 The degrading reduction of black human beings to what were deemed salable traits is both the most salient horror in the petitions and the entire reason for the exercise. Petitioners described the old , the very young, and the sick as having \"no value,\" rendered worthless by a market that no longer had a way to exploit them. Just as horrifying are the price tags affixed by petitioners to enslaved people for whom they hoped to receive top dollar. Through descriptions of enslaved people's physical and mental characteristics, the petitioners provided justifications for their compensation claims, highlighting what the commissioners labeled \" their intrinsic utility to their owners .\" Ironically, these reductive descriptions provide rare glimpses of the human beings named, the lives they lived, and the circumstances they endured. 14 Linda Harris, for example, is described as a \" slave for life ,\" of \"olive brown complexion with full suit of hair, free spoken and intelligent.\" Her enslaver writes that Linda is \"honest\" and \"an excellent cook, washerwoman or nurse. During the past year she has had occasional attacks of rheumatism; and is at intervals troubled with weakness of the breast, but has never been compelled to abandon her usual duties.\" (As if, one thinks, she had a choice.) Linda's estimated worth is given as $800. Her enslaver was paid $306.60 for her. 15 The petition: Linda Harris's enslaver received $306.60 for emancipating her. (National Archives via Civil War Washington) William Alexander Johnson, 22 years old, is described as 5 feet 8 inches tall and \" a skillful mechanic , very ingenious in every branch of mechanism...employed in making models for patents, in making and repairing mathematical instruments.\" His enslaver requested $2,000 for him; she was compensated in the amount of $657. 16 Twenty-three-year-old Margaret E. Taylor was the mother of 5-year-old Annie and infant Fanny, both of whom are described as being of \"mulatto color.\" Their male enslaver notes that \"both [were] born while their said mother was held to said service or labor by your Petitioner.\" He was given $569.40 for the woman and her children, with Fanny garnering just $21.90. 17 Gibbs told me that, in addition to the dehumanizing nature of the process, he was consistently struck by the way the descriptions counter the narrative that enslaved people were mentally feeble or lazy. \"Despite the claims of proslavery [advocates],\" he said, \"we're looking at people whom their masters described in many cases as worthy, competent, skilled.\" 18 Philip Reid is described in a petition as 42 years old, \"not prepossessing in appearance, but smart in mind,\" and formerly \"employed...by the Government.\" He was a skilled artisan who helped cast DC's Statue of Freedom and whose ingenuity succeeded in placing the bronze figure atop the Capitol, where it stands today. For his 33 weeks of labor without respite, Reid was paid $1.25 per day. He was allowed to keep only his Sunday wages; the rest went to his enslaver, Clark Mills. In his claim , Mills requested $1,500 in compensation for Reid. He received $350.40. 19 \"The primary drawback in consulting these records is that most of them were compiled by the slave owners, not by the slaves themselves,\" Winkle said. \"So this becomes a huge exercise in reading between the lines, so to speak, and certainly not taking this information at face value but analyzing it before putting the pieces together to try to create an authentic collective portrait of who these slaves were, how they lived their lives, and what they accomplished. And surviving slavery was an incredible accomplishment.\" He added that the petitions represent \"just over 3,300 slaves in the District of Columbia. I always say it's one-tenth of 1 percent of all the slaves in the American South, but we see them. They are named. We can see them as individuals.\" 20 Seeking justice: In 1870, Sojourner Truth petitioned Congress for land reparations. (National Portrait Gallery) \"Self-petitions\" from enslaved African Americans requesting their freedom, many of them written by white pro bono lawyers, provide yet more insight. Phillip Meredith, a 30-year-old black man, lists his enslaver of 30 years as \" General Robert Lee .\" A corroborating witness notes the general was \"formerly of U.S. Army now in Rebel service.\" Meredith's petition was approved. 21 A more heartrending story is told through the \"self-petition\" of Mary A. Prather on behalf of herself and her 3-year-old son, Arthur. \"Mary says she had permission\" from her enslaver to be hired out, according to testimony, but that permission was later rescinded, making her a fugitive and thus ineligible for emancipation under the act. Mary's and Arthur's names appear in the commissioners' report among those \" from whom certificates have been withheld .\" 22 Washington Childs wrote in his \"self-petition\" that he was 33 years old , 6 feet 2 inches tall, with \"a large hair mole on the right side of his chin.\" He indicated that he was hired out in Washington, DC, \"nearly or quite five years last past\" by his Virginian enslaver, who would have received all of his wages during that time. His enslaver provided a letter of support for Childs's emancipation to be presented to the commission. Included in the missive is a citation of an outstanding debt of $60 , along with the galling request that Childs pay it off by sending \"a barrel of good sugar & sacks of coffee and 2 bolts of cotton & [a] pound of best Tea, that is if you can send the tea & cotton by express.\" 23 His emancipation was granted, and his enslaver was not compensated. But the overwhelming majority of those who submitted compensation claims succeeded in getting funds-often in amounts lower than requested, but at times up to $788. The compensation given to white enslavers helped maintain their financial security and the continuation of white supremacy and power. 24 \"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young , the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber , the second largest,\" Gibbs told me. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory . She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe , \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" 25 E ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which applied only to the treasonous Confederate states, over which the Union had no jurisdiction. Slavery wasn't fully abolished until nearly three years later, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 26 Stolen land, stolen freedom: A sharecropper plowing in Montgomery, Alabama. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) In January 1865, the United States undertook the \"40 acres and a mule\" reparations program, distributing 400,000 acres of Southern coastal land confiscated from disloyal Confederates to freed black families in plots of \" not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground. \" (Union Gen. William T. Sherman, who issued the initial order , also authorized distribution of old Army mules.) Historian and former US Commission on Civil Rights chair Mary Frances Berry noted that by June of 1865, \" 40,000 freedmen had been settled \" on the land and were already \"growing crops.\" Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, cruelly reversed the policy, evicting the land's black occupants and returning their properties to the white Confederate enslavers who had attacked the Union. Many of those black folks would be forced into sharecropping, a Jim Crow form of slavery in all but name. 27 American history has since been marked by too many calls for reparations to list, each rebuffed in turn by the US government. In 1870, Sojourner Truth unsuccessfully petitioned Congress for land reparations, stating, \"I shall make them understand that there is a debt to the Negro people which they can never repay. At least, then, they must make amends.\" Walter Vaughan, a white slavery apologist who believed black dollars would ultimately fatten white Southern pockets, wrote an 1890 bill to give freed people pensions like those granted to Civil War veterans. Introduced in Congress by Nebraska Representative William J. Connell, Vaughan's \" ex-slave pension bill \" died before becoming law, as did eight other reparations proposals introduced between 1896 and 1903. During the same period, a formerly enslaved woman and mother of five named Callie House cofounded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. In 1915, the group sued the US Treasury for $68 million, the estimated amount of taxes collected on cotton between 1862 and 1868 . A lower tribunal and the Supreme Court cited government immunity in dismissing the suit. For her temerity, House was charged with mail fraud , convicted by an all-white jury, and sentenced to a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Nearly 50 years later, reparations advocate Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore secured enough petition signatures-over 1 million-to compel President John F. Kennedy to meet with her, but no legal remedies followed. The US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed a 1995 reparations lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a 2007 class action case against corporations that benefited from black enslavement. 28 In 2019 the House of Representatives held a hearing on HR 40 -the number refers to Sherman's unfulfilled promise of land-a bill that was introduced in every Congress from 1989 to 2017 by Michigan Representative John Conyers. Unceremoniously killed in committee for nearly 30 years, HR 40 would not compel federal payouts to the descendants of enslaved people but instead would merely impanel a commission to examine the impact of \" slavery and its continuing vestiges .\" In taking up the bill's sponsorship, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee noted that it would help illuminate the statistics that show the \"stunning chasm between the destinies of White America and that of Black America.\" For example, the median wealth of white families is currently estimated at $171,000; for black families, it is $17,600 -approximately a tenfold difference. Fewer than 10 percent of white families have zero or negative net worth, while nearly 20 percent of black households do. Discrimination against black people in mortgage lending, historically and today, has hobbled opportunities for homeownership , the source of two-thirds of equity for American households and one of the most reliable forms of intergenerational wealth . And while we're on the subject of black folks being denied property, it seems like a good moment to note that if those 40 acres and a mule had been distributed as promised, the land would be worth about $6.4 trillion today . 29 More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice!

The compensation given to white enslavers helped maintain their financial security and the continuation of white supremacy and power. 24 \"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young , the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber , the second largest,\" Gibbs told me. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory . She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe , \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" 25 E ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which applied only to the treasonous Confederate states, over which the Union had no jurisdiction. Slavery wasn't fully abolished until nearly three years later, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 26 Stolen land, stolen freedom: A sharecropper plowing in Montgomery, Alabama. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) In January 1865, the United States undertook the \"40 acres and a mule\" reparations program, distributing 400,000 acres of Southern coastal land confiscated from disloyal Confederates to freed black families in plots of \" not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground. \" (Union Gen. William T. Sherman, who issued the initial order , also authorized distribution of old Army mules.) Historian and former US Commission on Civil Rights chair Mary Frances Berry noted that by June of 1865, \" 40,000 freedmen had been settled \" on the land and were already \"growing crops.\" Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, cruelly reversed the policy, evicting the land's black occupants and returning their properties to the white Confederate enslavers who had attacked the Union. Many of those black folks would be forced into sharecropping, a Jim Crow form of slavery in all but name. 27 American history has since been marked by too many calls for reparations to list, each rebuffed in turn by the US government. In 1870, Sojourner Truth unsuccessfully petitioned Congress for land reparations, stating, \"I shall make them understand that there is a debt to the Negro people which they can never repay. At least, then, they must make amends.\" Walter Vaughan, a white slavery apologist who believed black dollars would ultimately fatten white Southern pockets, wrote an 1890 bill to give freed people pensions like those granted to Civil War veterans. Introduced in Congress by Nebraska Representative William J. Connell, Vaughan's \" ex-slave pension bill \" died before becoming law, as did eight other reparations proposals introduced between 1896 and 1903. During the same period, a formerly enslaved woman and mother of five named Callie House cofounded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. In 1915, the group sued the US Treasury for $68 million, the estimated amount of taxes collected on cotton between 1862 and 1868 . A lower tribunal and the Supreme Court cited government immunity in dismissing the suit. For her temerity, House was charged with mail fraud , convicted by an all-white jury, and sentenced to a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Nearly 50 years later, reparations advocate Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore secured enough petition signatures-over 1 million-to compel President John F. Kennedy to meet with her, but no legal remedies followed. The US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed a 1995 reparations lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a 2007 class action case against corporations that benefited from black enslavement. 28 In 2019 the House of Representatives held a hearing on HR 40 -the number refers to Sherman's unfulfilled promise of land-a bill that was introduced in every Congress from 1989 to 2017 by Michigan Representative John Conyers. Unceremoniously killed in committee for nearly 30 years, HR 40 would not compel federal payouts to the descendants of enslaved people but instead would merely impanel a commission to examine the impact of \" slavery and its continuing vestiges .\" In taking up the bill's sponsorship, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee noted that it would help illuminate the statistics that show the \"stunning chasm between the destinies of White America and that of Black America.\" For example, the median wealth of white families is currently estimated at $171,000; for black families, it is $17,600 -approximately a tenfold difference. Fewer than 10 percent of white families have zero or negative net worth, while nearly 20 percent of black households do. Discrimination against black people in mortgage lending, historically and today, has hobbled opportunities for homeownership , the source of two-thirds of equity for American households and one of the most reliable forms of intergenerational wealth . And while we're on the subject of black folks being denied property, it seems like a good moment to note that if those 40 acres and a mule had been distributed as promised, the land would be worth about $6.4 trillion today . 29 More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice! March 12, 2025 If there were an actual interest in ending those disparities, Congress would at the very least support studying the numbers. Instead, opponents of HR 40 argue against even investigating the issue. That opposition, including McConnell's dismissive remarks, demonstrates the ahistorical American self-mythologizing at the heart of the country's bitter opposition to slavery reparations. The Senate leader and his ilk are fighting an ideological war to defend the lie that slavery was a historical anomaly, an inconsequential blip on an American moral arc that always otherwise bends toward racial justice. It's an attempt to rewrite history, omitting how the denial of reparations shortchanged black freedom and omitting the policies of Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, and unstinting white terror against black success. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the highly influential 2014 Atlantic article \"The Case for Reparations,\" directly addressed McConnell-whose family enslaved black human beings -in his testimony on HR 40. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" Coates stated. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\" 30 R ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions. Yale, Brown, Harvard, William & Mary, and more than 50 other members of the Universities Studying Slavery consortium have acknowledged the role of black enslavement in their early funding, founding, construction, and maintenance. (The collective includes schools in Britain, which also gave reparations solely to enslavers; the taxpayer-funded payments of $3.9 billion ended only in 2015. ) To atone for their ties to slavery, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Georgetown University have all established reparations funds . In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\n\"Under such circumstances,\" the commissioners determined, \"it would be manifestly unjust to withhold compensation on account of the inability of the claimant to produce\" the enslaved person they claimed. The panel decided enslavers deserved compensation if the people they'd enslaved had escaped no more than two years prior. Petitioners were also asked to include \"written evidence\" substantiating their claims, but submissions lacking that proof ran little risk of being rejected. This \"liberal construction of the act,\" the commissioners wrote, sprang from the desire to free the most people (and, of course, pay the most enslavers) without paperwork getting in the way. But the laxity with which this rule was applied highlighted one of the many horrific aspects of enslavement: the ease with which white claims to black bodies and lives could be made. 9 \"Slaves were held, owned, and mistreated so callously that there quite often was not a legal basis for their ownership,\" says Kenneth Winkle, a historian at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the research project Civil War Washington . \"Slave owners were asked to provide records or bills of sale or receipts or some paperwork. Most of them simply said, 'I've misplaced it' or 'I'm not sure I ever had any.' A white person could claim ownership of an African-American as a slave based on the testimony of two other white people, with no paperwork necessary.\" 10 Putting a price on human beings: Horatio King was a member of the commission adjudicating claims under the District of Columbia's 1862 Compensated Emancipation Act. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division) The Compensated Emancipation Act did not grant automatic emancipation to enslaved people not named in petitions, and some enslavers did not file for compensation by the act's 90-day deadline, many of them pro-slavery Confederate sympathizers who had no intention of emancipating those they enslaved. To address these cases, Congress passed the Supplementary Act in July 1862, which allowed black folks to submit petitions pleading for their own emancipation and to testify and serve as witnesses-the first time African Americans were allowed to do so in federal proceedings. More than 160 claims were filed by people the commissioners described as \"held to service in the District of Columbia by reason of African descent.\" 11 Winkle and his colleagues at Civil War Washington have meticulously cataloged, digitized, transcribed, and posted online nearly all of the petitions filed under the Compensated Emancipation Act. No matter how much you may know about the violence, cruelty, depravity, and terror of slavery, those horrors are revealed anew in the petitions filed. The petitioners' responses to the bureaucratic formality of noting how they \"acquired\" other human beings as their property leads to firsthand accounts of black people ripped from their families, treated like hand-me-downs, and enslaved by dint of birth. One claimant wrote that an enslaved woman named \"Ann Williams [was] acquired by marriage forty years ago \" and that her grandson, Albert Hollyday, \"was born while his mother (Eliza since sold) was owned by me.\" Another enslaver (this time a woman, of which there were many) reported that a black woman identified only as Delilah was \" willed to me by my father in 1816 \" and that \"while my slave and in my survace [sic] Delilah had a daughter named Amanda who while my slave and in my survace [sic] became the mother of said Casper & William,\" two young men for whom she requested $450 and $350, respectively. 12 Enslaved people are listed by name in the petitions, a rarity in documents from the era. That omission was intentional and institutional: Recording the names of the enslaved threatened to confer personhood, and the denial of humanity was the bedrock on which black chattel slavery rested. Erasure of black people from the American historical record is partly located in the practice of reducing the enslaved to nameless head counts or dollar amounts, an obliteration of black existence that continues to impede African American efforts at heritage and genealogical research. Even this tiny recognition of black humanity was conceded only in exchange for federal dollars. 13 The degrading reduction of black human beings to what were deemed salable traits is both the most salient horror in the petitions and the entire reason for the exercise. Petitioners described the old , the very young, and the sick as having \"no value,\" rendered worthless by a market that no longer had a way to exploit them. Just as horrifying are the price tags affixed by petitioners to enslaved people for whom they hoped to receive top dollar. Through descriptions of enslaved people's physical and mental characteristics, the petitioners provided justifications for their compensation claims, highlighting what the commissioners labeled \" their intrinsic utility to their owners .\" Ironically, these reductive descriptions provide rare glimpses of the human beings named, the lives they lived, and the circumstances they endured. 14 Linda Harris, for example, is described as a \" slave for life ,\" of \"olive brown complexion with full suit of hair, free spoken and intelligent.\" Her enslaver writes that Linda is \"honest\" and \"an excellent cook, washerwoman or nurse. During the past year she has had occasional attacks of rheumatism; and is at intervals troubled with weakness of the breast, but has never been compelled to abandon her usual duties.\" (As if, one thinks, she had a choice.) Linda's estimated worth is given as $800. Her enslaver was paid $306.60 for her. 15 The petition: Linda Harris's enslaver received $306.60 for emancipating her. (National Archives via Civil War Washington) William Alexander Johnson, 22 years old, is described as 5 feet 8 inches tall and \" a skillful mechanic , very ingenious in every branch of mechanism...employed in making models for patents, in making and repairing mathematical instruments.\" His enslaver requested $2,000 for him; she was compensated in the amount of $657. 16 Twenty-three-year-old Margaret E. Taylor was the mother of 5-year-old Annie and infant Fanny, both of whom are described as being of \"mulatto color.\" Their male enslaver notes that \"both [were] born while their said mother was held to said service or labor by your Petitioner.\" He was given $569.40 for the woman and her children, with Fanny garnering just $21.90. 17 Gibbs told me that, in addition to the dehumanizing nature of the process, he was consistently struck by the way the descriptions counter the narrative that enslaved people were mentally feeble or lazy. \"Despite the claims of proslavery [advocates],\" he said, \"we're looking at people whom their masters described in many cases as worthy, competent, skilled.\" 18 Philip Reid is described in a petition as 42 years old, \"not prepossessing in appearance, but smart in mind,\" and formerly \"employed...by the Government.\" He was a skilled artisan who helped cast DC's Statue of Freedom and whose ingenuity succeeded in placing the bronze figure atop the Capitol, where it stands today. For his 33 weeks of labor without respite, Reid was paid $1.25 per day. He was allowed to keep only his Sunday wages; the rest went to his enslaver, Clark Mills. In his claim , Mills requested $1,500 in compensation for Reid. He received $350.40. 19 \"The primary drawback in consulting these records is that most of them were compiled by the slave owners, not by the slaves themselves,\" Winkle said. \"So this becomes a huge exercise in reading between the lines, so to speak, and certainly not taking this information at face value but analyzing it before putting the pieces together to try to create an authentic collective portrait of who these slaves were, how they lived their lives, and what they accomplished. And surviving slavery was an incredible accomplishment.\" He added that the petitions represent \"just over 3,300 slaves in the District of Columbia. I always say it's one-tenth of 1 percent of all the slaves in the American South, but we see them. They are named. We can see them as individuals.\" 20 Seeking justice: In 1870, Sojourner Truth petitioned Congress for land reparations. (National Portrait Gallery) \"Self-petitions\" from enslaved African Americans requesting their freedom, many of them written by white pro bono lawyers, provide yet more insight. Phillip Meredith, a 30-year-old black man, lists his enslaver of 30 years as \" General Robert Lee .\" A corroborating witness notes the general was \"formerly of U.S. Army now in Rebel service.\" Meredith's petition was approved. 21 A more heartrending story is told through the \"self-petition\" of Mary A. Prather on behalf of herself and her 3-year-old son, Arthur. \"Mary says she had permission\" from her enslaver to be hired out, according to testimony, but that permission was later rescinded, making her a fugitive and thus ineligible for emancipation under the act. Mary's and Arthur's names appear in the commissioners' report among those \" from whom certificates have been withheld .\" 22 Washington Childs wrote in his \"self-petition\" that he was 33 years old , 6 feet 2 inches tall, with \"a large hair mole on the right side of his chin.\" He indicated that he was hired out in Washington, DC, \"nearly or quite five years last past\" by his Virginian enslaver, who would have received all of his wages during that time. His enslaver provided a letter of support for Childs's emancipation to be presented to the commission. Included in the missive is a citation of an outstanding debt of $60 , along with the galling request that Childs pay it off by sending \"a barrel of good sugar & sacks of coffee and 2 bolts of cotton & [a] pound of best Tea, that is if you can send the tea & cotton by express.\" 23 His emancipation was granted, and his enslaver was not compensated. But the overwhelming majority of those who submitted compensation claims succeeded in getting funds-often in amounts lower than requested, but at times up to $788. The compensation given to white enslavers helped maintain their financial security and the continuation of white supremacy and power. 24 \"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young , the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber , the second largest,\" Gibbs told me. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory . She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe , \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" 25 E ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted.

For his 33 weeks of labor without respite, Reid was paid $1.25 per day. He was allowed to keep only his Sunday wages; the rest went to his enslaver, Clark Mills. In his claim , Mills requested $1,500 in compensation for Reid. He received $350.40. 19 \"The primary drawback in consulting these records is that most of them were compiled by the slave owners, not by the slaves themselves,\" Winkle said. \"So this becomes a huge exercise in reading between the lines, so to speak, and certainly not taking this information at face value but analyzing it before putting the pieces together to try to create an authentic collective portrait of who these slaves were, how they lived their lives, and what they accomplished. And surviving slavery was an incredible accomplishment.\" He added that the petitions represent \"just over 3,300 slaves in the District of Columbia. I always say it's one-tenth of 1 percent of all the slaves in the American South, but we see them. They are named. We can see them as individuals.\" 20 Seeking justice: In 1870, Sojourner Truth petitioned Congress for land reparations. (National Portrait Gallery) \"Self-petitions\" from enslaved African Americans requesting their freedom, many of them written by white pro bono lawyers, provide yet more insight. Phillip Meredith, a 30-year-old black man, lists his enslaver of 30 years as \" General Robert Lee .\" A corroborating witness notes the general was \"formerly of U.S. Army now in Rebel service.\" Meredith's petition was approved. 21 A more heartrending story is told through the \"self-petition\" of Mary A. Prather on behalf of herself and her 3-year-old son, Arthur. \"Mary says she had permission\" from her enslaver to be hired out, according to testimony, but that permission was later rescinded, making her a fugitive and thus ineligible for emancipation under the act. Mary's and Arthur's names appear in the commissioners' report among those \" from whom certificates have been withheld .\" 22 Washington Childs wrote in his \"self-petition\" that he was 33 years old , 6 feet 2 inches tall, with \"a large hair mole on the right side of his chin.\" He indicated that he was hired out in Washington, DC, \"nearly or quite five years last past\" by his Virginian enslaver, who would have received all of his wages during that time. His enslaver provided a letter of support for Childs's emancipation to be presented to the commission. Included in the missive is a citation of an outstanding debt of $60 , along with the galling request that Childs pay it off by sending \"a barrel of good sugar & sacks of coffee and 2 bolts of cotton & [a] pound of best Tea, that is if you can send the tea & cotton by express.\" 23 His emancipation was granted, and his enslaver was not compensated. But the overwhelming majority of those who submitted compensation claims succeeded in getting funds-often in amounts lower than requested, but at times up to $788. The compensation given to white enslavers helped maintain their financial security and the continuation of white supremacy and power. 24 \"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young , the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber , the second largest,\" Gibbs told me. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory . She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe , \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" 25 E ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which applied only to the treasonous Confederate states, over which the Union had no jurisdiction. Slavery wasn't fully abolished until nearly three years later, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 26 Stolen land, stolen freedom: A sharecropper plowing in Montgomery, Alabama. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) In January 1865, the United States undertook the \"40 acres and a mule\" reparations program, distributing 400,000 acres of Southern coastal land confiscated from disloyal Confederates to freed black families in plots of \" not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground. \" (Union Gen. William T. Sherman, who issued the initial order , also authorized distribution of old Army mules.) Historian and former US Commission on Civil Rights chair Mary Frances Berry noted that by June of 1865, \" 40,000 freedmen had been settled \" on the land and were already \"growing crops.\" Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, cruelly reversed the policy, evicting the land's black occupants and returning their properties to the white Confederate enslavers who had attacked the Union. Many of those black folks would be forced into sharecropping, a Jim Crow form of slavery in all but name. 27 American history has since been marked by too many calls for reparations to list, each rebuffed in turn by the US government. In 1870, Sojourner Truth unsuccessfully petitioned Congress for land reparations, stating, \"I shall make them understand that there is a debt to the Negro people which they can never repay. At least, then, they must make amends.\" Walter Vaughan, a white slavery apologist who believed black dollars would ultimately fatten white Southern pockets, wrote an 1890 bill to give freed people pensions like those granted to Civil War veterans. Introduced in Congress by Nebraska Representative William J. Connell, Vaughan's \" ex-slave pension bill \" died before becoming law, as did eight other reparations proposals introduced between 1896 and 1903. During the same period, a formerly enslaved woman and mother of five named Callie House cofounded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. In 1915, the group sued the US Treasury for $68 million, the estimated amount of taxes collected on cotton between 1862 and 1868 . A lower tribunal and the Supreme Court cited government immunity in dismissing the suit. For her temerity, House was charged with mail fraud , convicted by an all-white jury, and sentenced to a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Nearly 50 years later, reparations advocate Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore secured enough petition signatures-over 1 million-to compel President John F. Kennedy to meet with her, but no legal remedies followed. The US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed a 1995 reparations lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a 2007 class action case against corporations that benefited from black enslavement. 28 In 2019 the House of Representatives held a hearing on HR 40 -the number refers to Sherman's unfulfilled promise of land-a bill that was introduced in every Congress from 1989 to 2017 by Michigan Representative John Conyers. Unceremoniously killed in committee for nearly 30 years, HR 40 would not compel federal payouts to the descendants of enslaved people but instead would merely impanel a commission to examine the impact of \" slavery and its continuing vestiges .\" In taking up the bill's sponsorship, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee noted that it would help illuminate the statistics that show the \"stunning chasm between the destinies of White America and that of Black America.\" For example, the median wealth of white families is currently estimated at $171,000; for black families, it is $17,600 -approximately a tenfold difference. Fewer than 10 percent of white families have zero or negative net worth, while nearly 20 percent of black households do. Discrimination against black people in mortgage lending, historically and today, has hobbled opportunities for homeownership , the source of two-thirds of equity for American households and one of the most reliable forms of intergenerational wealth . And while we're on the subject of black folks being denied property, it seems like a good moment to note that if those 40 acres and a mule had been distributed as promised, the land would be worth about $6.4 trillion today . 29 More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice! March 12, 2025 If there were an actual interest in ending those disparities, Congress would at the very least support studying the numbers. Instead, opponents of HR 40 argue against even investigating the issue. That opposition, including McConnell's dismissive remarks, demonstrates the ahistorical American self-mythologizing at the heart of the country's bitter opposition to slavery reparations. The Senate leader and his ilk are fighting an ideological war to defend the lie that slavery was a historical anomaly, an inconsequential blip on an American moral arc that always otherwise bends toward racial justice. It's an attempt to rewrite history, omitting how the denial of reparations shortchanged black freedom and omitting the policies of Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, and unstinting white terror against black success. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the highly influential 2014 Atlantic article \"The Case for Reparations,\" directly addressed McConnell-whose family enslaved black human beings -in his testimony on HR 40. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" Coates stated. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\" 30 R ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions. Yale, Brown, Harvard, William & Mary, and more than 50 other members of the Universities Studying Slavery consortium have acknowledged the role of black enslavement in their early funding, founding, construction, and maintenance. (The collective includes schools in Britain, which also gave reparations solely to enslavers; the taxpayer-funded payments of $3.9 billion ended only in 2015. ) To atone for their ties to slavery, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Georgetown University have all established reparations funds . In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\nPutting a price on human beings: Horatio King was a member of the commission adjudicating claims under the District of Columbia's 1862 Compensated Emancipation Act. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division)\n\nThe Compensated Emancipation Act did not grant automatic emancipation to enslaved people not named in petitions, and some enslavers did not file for compensation by the act's 90-day deadline, many of them pro-slavery Confederate sympathizers who had no intention of emancipating those they enslaved. To address these cases, Congress passed the Supplementary Act in July 1862, which allowed black folks to submit petitions pleading for their own emancipation and to testify and serve as witnesses-the first time African Americans were allowed to do so in federal proceedings. More than 160 claims were filed by people the commissioners described as \"held to service in the District of Columbia by reason of African descent.\" 11 Winkle and his colleagues at Civil War Washington have meticulously cataloged, digitized, transcribed, and posted online nearly all of the petitions filed under the Compensated Emancipation Act. No matter how much you may know about the violence, cruelty, depravity, and terror of slavery, those horrors are revealed anew in the petitions filed. The petitioners' responses to the bureaucratic formality of noting how they \"acquired\" other human beings as their property leads to firsthand accounts of black people ripped from their families, treated like hand-me-downs, and enslaved by dint of birth. One claimant wrote that an enslaved woman named \"Ann Williams [was] acquired by marriage forty years ago \" and that her grandson, Albert Hollyday, \"was born while his mother (Eliza since sold) was owned by me.\" Another enslaver (this time a woman, of which there were many) reported that a black woman identified only as Delilah was \" willed to me by my father in 1816 \" and that \"while my slave and in my survace [sic] Delilah had a daughter named Amanda who while my slave and in my survace [sic] became the mother of said Casper & William,\" two young men for whom she requested $450 and $350, respectively. 12 Enslaved people are listed by name in the petitions, a rarity in documents from the era. That omission was intentional and institutional: Recording the names of the enslaved threatened to confer personhood, and the denial of humanity was the bedrock on which black chattel slavery rested. Erasure of black people from the American historical record is partly located in the practice of reducing the enslaved to nameless head counts or dollar amounts, an obliteration of black existence that continues to impede African American efforts at heritage and genealogical research. Even this tiny recognition of black humanity was conceded only in exchange for federal dollars. 13 The degrading reduction of black human beings to what were deemed salable traits is both the most salient horror in the petitions and the entire reason for the exercise. Petitioners described the old , the very young, and the sick as having \"no value,\" rendered worthless by a market that no longer had a way to exploit them. Just as horrifying are the price tags affixed by petitioners to enslaved people for whom they hoped to receive top dollar. Through descriptions of enslaved people's physical and mental characteristics, the petitioners provided justifications for their compensation claims, highlighting what the commissioners labeled \" their intrinsic utility to their owners .\" Ironically, these reductive descriptions provide rare glimpses of the human beings named, the lives they lived, and the circumstances they endured. 14 Linda Harris, for example, is described as a \" slave for life ,\" of \"olive brown complexion with full suit of hair, free spoken and intelligent.\" Her enslaver writes that Linda is \"honest\" and \"an excellent cook, washerwoman or nurse. During the past year she has had occasional attacks of rheumatism; and is at intervals troubled with weakness of the breast, but has never been compelled to abandon her usual duties.\" (As if, one thinks, she had a choice.) Linda's estimated worth is given as $800. Her enslaver was paid $306.60 for her. 15 The petition: Linda Harris's enslaver received $306.60 for emancipating her. (National Archives via Civil War Washington) William Alexander Johnson, 22 years old, is described as 5 feet 8 inches tall and \" a skillful mechanic , very ingenious in every branch of mechanism...employed in making models for patents, in making and repairing mathematical instruments.\" His enslaver requested $2,000 for him; she was compensated in the amount of $657. 16 Twenty-three-year-old Margaret E.

(National Archives via Civil War Washington) William Alexander Johnson, 22 years old, is described as 5 feet 8 inches tall and \" a skillful mechanic , very ingenious in every branch of mechanism...employed in making models for patents, in making and repairing mathematical instruments.\" His enslaver requested $2,000 for him; she was compensated in the amount of $657. 16 Twenty-three-year-old Margaret E. Taylor was the mother of 5-year-old Annie and infant Fanny, both of whom are described as being of \"mulatto color.\" Their male enslaver notes that \"both [were] born while their said mother was held to said service or labor by your Petitioner.\" He was given $569.40 for the woman and her children, with Fanny garnering just $21.90. 17 Gibbs told me that, in addition to the dehumanizing nature of the process, he was consistently struck by the way the descriptions counter the narrative that enslaved people were mentally feeble or lazy. \"Despite the claims of proslavery [advocates],\" he said, \"we're looking at people whom their masters described in many cases as worthy, competent, skilled.\" 18 Philip Reid is described in a petition as 42 years old, \"not prepossessing in appearance, but smart in mind,\" and formerly \"employed...by the Government.\" He was a skilled artisan who helped cast DC's Statue of Freedom and whose ingenuity succeeded in placing the bronze figure atop the Capitol, where it stands today. For his 33 weeks of labor without respite, Reid was paid $1.25 per day. He was allowed to keep only his Sunday wages; the rest went to his enslaver, Clark Mills. In his claim , Mills requested $1,500 in compensation for Reid. He received $350.40. 19 \"The primary drawback in consulting these records is that most of them were compiled by the slave owners, not by the slaves themselves,\" Winkle said. \"So this becomes a huge exercise in reading between the lines, so to speak, and certainly not taking this information at face value but analyzing it before putting the pieces together to try to create an authentic collective portrait of who these slaves were, how they lived their lives, and what they accomplished. And surviving slavery was an incredible accomplishment.\" He added that the petitions represent \"just over 3,300 slaves in the District of Columbia. I always say it's one-tenth of 1 percent of all the slaves in the American South, but we see them. They are named. We can see them as individuals.\" 20 Seeking justice: In 1870, Sojourner Truth petitioned Congress for land reparations. (National Portrait Gallery) \"Self-petitions\" from enslaved African Americans requesting their freedom, many of them written by white pro bono lawyers, provide yet more insight. Phillip Meredith, a 30-year-old black man, lists his enslaver of 30 years as \" General Robert Lee .\" A corroborating witness notes the general was \"formerly of U.S. Army now in Rebel service.\" Meredith's petition was approved. 21 A more heartrending story is told through the \"self-petition\" of Mary A. Prather on behalf of herself and her 3-year-old son, Arthur. \"Mary says she had permission\" from her enslaver to be hired out, according to testimony, but that permission was later rescinded, making her a fugitive and thus ineligible for emancipation under the act. Mary's and Arthur's names appear in the commissioners' report among those \" from whom certificates have been withheld .\" 22 Washington Childs wrote in his \"self-petition\" that he was 33 years old , 6 feet 2 inches tall, with \"a large hair mole on the right side of his chin.\" He indicated that he was hired out in Washington, DC, \"nearly or quite five years last past\" by his Virginian enslaver, who would have received all of his wages during that time. His enslaver provided a letter of support for Childs's emancipation to be presented to the commission. Included in the missive is a citation of an outstanding debt of $60 , along with the galling request that Childs pay it off by sending \"a barrel of good sugar & sacks of coffee and 2 bolts of cotton & [a] pound of best Tea, that is if you can send the tea & cotton by express.\" 23 His emancipation was granted, and his enslaver was not compensated. But the overwhelming majority of those who submitted compensation claims succeeded in getting funds-often in amounts lower than requested, but at times up to $788. The compensation given to white enslavers helped maintain their financial security and the continuation of white supremacy and power. 24 \"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young , the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber , the second largest,\" Gibbs told me. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory . She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe , \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" 25 E ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which applied only to the treasonous Confederate states, over which the Union had no jurisdiction. Slavery wasn't fully abolished until nearly three years later, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 26 Stolen land, stolen freedom: A sharecropper plowing in Montgomery, Alabama. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) In January 1865, the United States undertook the \"40 acres and a mule\" reparations program, distributing 400,000 acres of Southern coastal land confiscated from disloyal Confederates to freed black families in plots of \" not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground. \" (Union Gen. William T. Sherman, who issued the initial order , also authorized distribution of old Army mules.) Historian and former US Commission on Civil Rights chair Mary Frances Berry noted that by June of 1865, \" 40,000 freedmen had been settled \" on the land and were already \"growing crops.\" Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, cruelly reversed the policy, evicting the land's black occupants and returning their properties to the white Confederate enslavers who had attacked the Union. Many of those black folks would be forced into sharecropping, a Jim Crow form of slavery in all but name. 27 American history has since been marked by too many calls for reparations to list, each rebuffed in turn by the US government. In 1870, Sojourner Truth unsuccessfully petitioned Congress for land reparations, stating, \"I shall make them understand that there is a debt to the Negro people which they can never repay. At least, then, they must make amends.\" Walter Vaughan, a white slavery apologist who believed black dollars would ultimately fatten white Southern pockets, wrote an 1890 bill to give freed people pensions like those granted to Civil War veterans. Introduced in Congress by Nebraska Representative William J. Connell, Vaughan's \" ex-slave pension bill \" died before becoming law, as did eight other reparations proposals introduced between 1896 and 1903. During the same period, a formerly enslaved woman and mother of five named Callie House cofounded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. In 1915, the group sued the US Treasury for $68 million, the estimated amount of taxes collected on cotton between 1862 and 1868 . A lower tribunal and the Supreme Court cited government immunity in dismissing the suit. For her temerity, House was charged with mail fraud , convicted by an all-white jury, and sentenced to a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Nearly 50 years later, reparations advocate Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore secured enough petition signatures-over 1 million-to compel President John F. Kennedy to meet with her, but no legal remedies followed. The US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed a 1995 reparations lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a 2007 class action case against corporations that benefited from black enslavement. 28 In 2019 the House of Representatives held a hearing on HR 40 -the number refers to Sherman's unfulfilled promise of land-a bill that was introduced in every Congress from 1989 to 2017 by Michigan Representative John Conyers. Unceremoniously killed in committee for nearly 30 years, HR 40 would not compel federal payouts to the descendants of enslaved people but instead would merely impanel a commission to examine the impact of \" slavery and its continuing vestiges .\" In taking up the bill's sponsorship, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee noted that it would help illuminate the statistics that show the \"stunning chasm between the destinies of White America and that of Black America.\" For example, the median wealth of white families is currently estimated at $171,000; for black families, it is $17,600 -approximately a tenfold difference. Fewer than 10 percent of white families have zero or negative net worth, while nearly 20 percent of black households do. Discrimination against black people in mortgage lending, historically and today, has hobbled opportunities for homeownership , the source of two-thirds of equity for American households and one of the most reliable forms of intergenerational wealth . And while we're on the subject of black folks being denied property, it seems like a good moment to note that if those 40 acres and a mule had been distributed as promised, the land would be worth about $6.4 trillion today . 29 More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice! March 12, 2025 If there were an actual interest in ending those disparities, Congress would at the very least support studying the numbers. Instead, opponents of HR 40 argue against even investigating the issue. That opposition, including McConnell's dismissive remarks, demonstrates the ahistorical American self-mythologizing at the heart of the country's bitter opposition to slavery reparations. The Senate leader and his ilk are fighting an ideological war to defend the lie that slavery was a historical anomaly, an inconsequential blip on an American moral arc that always otherwise bends toward racial justice. It's an attempt to rewrite history, omitting how the denial of reparations shortchanged black freedom and omitting the policies of Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, and unstinting white terror against black success. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the highly influential 2014 Atlantic article \"The Case for Reparations,\" directly addressed McConnell-whose family enslaved black human beings -in his testimony on HR 40. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" Coates stated. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\" 30 R ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions. Yale, Brown, Harvard, William & Mary, and more than 50 other members of the Universities Studying Slavery consortium have acknowledged the role of black enslavement in their early funding, founding, construction, and maintenance. (The collective includes schools in Britain, which also gave reparations solely to enslavers; the taxpayer-funded payments of $3.9 billion ended only in 2015. ) To atone for their ties to slavery, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Georgetown University have all established reparations funds . In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\nEnslaved people are listed by name in the petitions, a rarity in documents from the era. That omission was intentional and institutional: Recording the names of the enslaved threatened to confer personhood, and the denial of humanity was the bedrock on which black chattel slavery rested. Erasure of black people from the American historical record is partly located in the practice of reducing the enslaved to nameless head counts or dollar amounts, an obliteration of black existence that continues to impede African American efforts at heritage and genealogical research. Even this tiny recognition of black humanity was conceded only in exchange for federal dollars. 13 The degrading reduction of black human beings to what were deemed salable traits is both the most salient horror in the petitions and the entire reason for the exercise. Petitioners described the old , the very young, and the sick as having \"no value,\" rendered worthless by a market that no longer had a way to exploit them. Just as horrifying are the price tags affixed by petitioners to enslaved people for whom they hoped to receive top dollar. Through descriptions of enslaved people's physical and mental characteristics, the petitioners provided justifications for their compensation claims, highlighting what the commissioners labeled \" their intrinsic utility to their owners .\" Ironically, these reductive descriptions provide rare glimpses of the human beings named, the lives they lived, and the circumstances they endured. 14 Linda Harris, for example, is described as a \" slave for life ,\" of \"olive brown complexion with full suit of hair, free spoken and intelligent.\" Her enslaver writes that Linda is \"honest\" and \"an excellent cook, washerwoman or nurse. During the past year she has had occasional attacks of rheumatism; and is at intervals troubled with weakness of the breast, but has never been compelled to abandon her usual duties.\" (As if, one thinks, she had a choice.)

Mary's and Arthur's names appear in the commissioners' report among those \" from whom certificates have been withheld .\" 22 Washington Childs wrote in his \"self-petition\" that he was 33 years old , 6 feet 2 inches tall, with \"a large hair mole on the right side of his chin.\" He indicated that he was hired out in Washington, DC, \"nearly or quite five years last past\" by his Virginian enslaver, who would have received all of his wages during that time. His enslaver provided a letter of support for Childs's emancipation to be presented to the commission. Included in the missive is a citation of an outstanding debt of $60 , along with the galling request that Childs pay it off by sending \"a barrel of good sugar & sacks of coffee and 2 bolts of cotton & [a] pound of best Tea, that is if you can send the tea & cotton by express.\" 23 His emancipation was granted, and his enslaver was not compensated. But the overwhelming majority of those who submitted compensation claims succeeded in getting funds-often in amounts lower than requested, but at times up to $788. The compensation given to white enslavers helped maintain their financial security and the continuation of white supremacy and power. 24 \"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young , the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber , the second largest,\" Gibbs told me. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory . She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe , \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" 25 E ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which applied only to the treasonous Confederate states, over which the Union had no jurisdiction. Slavery wasn't fully abolished until nearly three years later, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 26 Stolen land, stolen freedom: A sharecropper plowing in Montgomery, Alabama. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) In January 1865, the United States undertook the \"40 acres and a mule\" reparations program, distributing 400,000 acres of Southern coastal land confiscated from disloyal Confederates to freed black families in plots of \" not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground. \" (Union Gen. William T. Sherman, who issued the initial order , also authorized distribution of old Army mules.) Historian and former US Commission on Civil Rights chair Mary Frances Berry noted that by June of 1865, \" 40,000 freedmen had been settled \" on the land and were already \"growing crops.\" Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, cruelly reversed the policy, evicting the land's black occupants and returning their properties to the white Confederate enslavers who had attacked the Union. Many of those black folks would be forced into sharecropping, a Jim Crow form of slavery in all but name. 27 American history has since been marked by too many calls for reparations to list, each rebuffed in turn by the US government. In 1870, Sojourner Truth unsuccessfully petitioned Congress for land reparations, stating, \"I shall make them understand that there is a debt to the Negro people which they can never repay. At least, then, they must make amends.\" Walter Vaughan, a white slavery apologist who believed black dollars would ultimately fatten white Southern pockets, wrote an 1890 bill to give freed people pensions like those granted to Civil War veterans. Introduced in Congress by Nebraska Representative William J. Connell, Vaughan's \" ex-slave pension bill \" died before becoming law, as did eight other reparations proposals introduced between 1896 and 1903. During the same period, a formerly enslaved woman and mother of five named Callie House cofounded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. In 1915, the group sued the US Treasury for $68 million, the estimated amount of taxes collected on cotton between 1862 and 1868 . A lower tribunal and the Supreme Court cited government immunity in dismissing the suit. For her temerity, House was charged with mail fraud , convicted by an all-white jury, and sentenced to a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Nearly 50 years later, reparations advocate Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore secured enough petition signatures-over 1 million-to compel President John F. Kennedy to meet with her, but no legal remedies followed. The US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed a 1995 reparations lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a 2007 class action case against corporations that benefited from black enslavement. 28 In 2019 the House of Representatives held a hearing on HR 40 -the number refers to Sherman's unfulfilled promise of land-a bill that was introduced in every Congress from 1989 to 2017 by Michigan Representative John Conyers. Unceremoniously killed in committee for nearly 30 years, HR 40 would not compel federal payouts to the descendants of enslaved people but instead would merely impanel a commission to examine the impact of \" slavery and its continuing vestiges .\" In taking up the bill's sponsorship, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee noted that it would help illuminate the statistics that show the \"stunning chasm between the destinies of White America and that of Black America.\" For example, the median wealth of white families is currently estimated at $171,000; for black families, it is $17,600 -approximately a tenfold difference. Fewer than 10 percent of white families have zero or negative net worth, while nearly 20 percent of black households do. Discrimination against black people in mortgage lending, historically and today, has hobbled opportunities for homeownership , the source of two-thirds of equity for American households and one of the most reliable forms of intergenerational wealth . And while we're on the subject of black folks being denied property, it seems like a good moment to note that if those 40 acres and a mule had been distributed as promised, the land would be worth about $6.4 trillion today . 29 More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice! March 12, 2025 If there were an actual interest in ending those disparities, Congress would at the very least support studying the numbers. Instead, opponents of HR 40 argue against even investigating the issue. That opposition, including McConnell's dismissive remarks, demonstrates the ahistorical American self-mythologizing at the heart of the country's bitter opposition to slavery reparations. The Senate leader and his ilk are fighting an ideological war to defend the lie that slavery was a historical anomaly, an inconsequential blip on an American moral arc that always otherwise bends toward racial justice. It's an attempt to rewrite history, omitting how the denial of reparations shortchanged black freedom and omitting the policies of Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, and unstinting white terror against black success. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the highly influential 2014 Atlantic article \"The Case for Reparations,\" directly addressed McConnell-whose family enslaved black human beings -in his testimony on HR 40. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" Coates stated. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\" 30 R ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions. Yale, Brown, Harvard, William & Mary, and more than 50 other members of the Universities Studying Slavery consortium have acknowledged the role of black enslavement in their early funding, founding, construction, and maintenance. (The collective includes schools in Britain, which also gave reparations solely to enslavers; the taxpayer-funded payments of $3.9 billion ended only in 2015. ) To atone for their ties to slavery, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Georgetown University have all established reparations funds . In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\nLinda Harris, for example, is described as a \" slave for life ,\" of \"olive brown complexion with full suit of hair, free spoken and intelligent.\" Her enslaver writes that Linda is \"honest\" and \"an excellent cook, washerwoman or nurse. During the past year she has had occasional attacks of rheumatism; and is at intervals troubled with weakness of the breast, but has never been compelled to abandon her usual duties.\" (As if, one thinks, she had a choice.) Linda's estimated worth is given as $800. Her enslaver was paid $306.60 for her. 15 The petition: Linda Harris's enslaver received $306.60 for emancipating her. (National Archives via Civil War Washington) William Alexander Johnson, 22 years old, is described as 5 feet 8 inches tall and \" a skillful mechanic , very ingenious in every branch of mechanism...employed in making models for patents, in making and repairing mathematical instruments.\" His enslaver requested $2,000 for him; she was compensated in the amount of $657. 16 Twenty-three-year-old Margaret E. Taylor was the mother of 5-year-old Annie and infant Fanny, both of whom are described as being of \"mulatto color.\" Their male enslaver notes that \"both [were] born while their said mother was held to said service or labor by your Petitioner.\" He was given $569.40 for the woman and her children, with Fanny garnering just $21.90. 17 Gibbs told me that, in addition to the dehumanizing nature of the process, he was consistently struck by the way the descriptions counter the narrative that enslaved people were mentally feeble or lazy. \"Despite the claims of proslavery [advocates],\" he said, \"we're looking at people whom their masters described in many cases as worthy, competent, skilled.\" 18 Philip Reid is described in a petition as 42 years old, \"not prepossessing in appearance, but smart in mind,\" and formerly \"employed...by the Government.\" He was a skilled artisan who helped cast DC's Statue of Freedom and whose ingenuity succeeded in placing the bronze figure atop the Capitol, where it stands today. For his 33 weeks of labor without respite, Reid was paid $1.25 per day. He was allowed to keep only his Sunday wages; the rest went to his enslaver, Clark Mills. In his claim , Mills requested $1,500 in compensation for Reid. He received $350.40. 19 \"The primary drawback in consulting these records is that most of them were compiled by the slave owners, not by the slaves themselves,\" Winkle said. \"So this becomes a huge exercise in reading between the lines, so to speak, and certainly not taking this information at face value but analyzing it before putting the pieces together to try to create an authentic collective portrait of who these slaves were, how they lived their lives, and what they accomplished. And surviving slavery was an incredible accomplishment.\" He added that the petitions represent \"just over 3,300 slaves in the District of Columbia. I always say it's one-tenth of 1 percent of all the slaves in the American South, but we see them. They are named. We can see them as individuals.\" 20 Seeking justice: In 1870, Sojourner Truth petitioned Congress for land reparations. (National Portrait Gallery) \"Self-petitions\" from enslaved African Americans requesting their freedom, many of them written by white pro bono lawyers, provide yet more insight.

Unceremoniously killed in committee for nearly 30 years, HR 40 would not compel federal payouts to the descendants of enslaved people but instead would merely impanel a commission to examine the impact of \" slavery and its continuing vestiges .\" In taking up the bill's sponsorship, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee noted that it would help illuminate the statistics that show the \"stunning chasm between the destinies of White America and that of Black America.\" For example, the median wealth of white families is currently estimated at $171,000; for black families, it is $17,600 -approximately a tenfold difference. Fewer than 10 percent of white families have zero or negative net worth, while nearly 20 percent of black households do. Discrimination against black people in mortgage lending, historically and today, has hobbled opportunities for homeownership , the source of two-thirds of equity for American households and one of the most reliable forms of intergenerational wealth . And while we're on the subject of black folks being denied property, it seems like a good moment to note that if those 40 acres and a mule had been distributed as promised, the land would be worth about $6.4 trillion today . 29 More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice! March 12, 2025 If there were an actual interest in ending those disparities, Congress would at the very least support studying the numbers. Instead, opponents of HR 40 argue against even investigating the issue. That opposition, including McConnell's dismissive remarks, demonstrates the ahistorical American self-mythologizing at the heart of the country's bitter opposition to slavery reparations. The Senate leader and his ilk are fighting an ideological war to defend the lie that slavery was a historical anomaly, an inconsequential blip on an American moral arc that always otherwise bends toward racial justice. It's an attempt to rewrite history, omitting how the denial of reparations shortchanged black freedom and omitting the policies of Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, and unstinting white terror against black success. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the highly influential 2014 Atlantic article \"The Case for Reparations,\" directly addressed McConnell-whose family enslaved black human beings -in his testimony on HR 40. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" Coates stated. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\" 30 R ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions. Yale, Brown, Harvard, William & Mary, and more than 50 other members of the Universities Studying Slavery consortium have acknowledged the role of black enslavement in their early funding, founding, construction, and maintenance. (The collective includes schools in Britain, which also gave reparations solely to enslavers; the taxpayer-funded payments of $3.9 billion ended only in 2015. ) To atone for their ties to slavery, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Georgetown University have all established reparations funds . In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\nTwenty-three-year-old Margaret E. Taylor was the mother of 5-year-old Annie and infant Fanny, both of whom are described as being of \"mulatto color.\" Their male enslaver notes that \"both [were] born while their said mother was held to said service or labor by your Petitioner.\" He was given $569.40 for the woman and her children, with Fanny garnering just $21.90. 17 Gibbs told me that, in addition to the dehumanizing nature of the process, he was consistently struck by the way the descriptions counter the narrative that enslaved people were mentally feeble or lazy. \"Despite the claims of proslavery [advocates],\" he said, \"we're looking at people whom their masters described in many cases as worthy, competent, skilled.\" 18 Philip Reid is described in a petition as 42 years old, \"not prepossessing in appearance, but smart in mind,\" and formerly \"employed...by the Government.\" He was a skilled artisan who helped cast DC's Statue of Freedom and whose ingenuity succeeded in placing the bronze figure atop the Capitol, where it stands today. For his 33 weeks of labor without respite, Reid was paid $1.25 per day. He was allowed to keep only his Sunday wages; the rest went to his enslaver, Clark Mills. In his claim , Mills requested $1,500 in compensation for Reid. He received $350.40. 19 \"The primary drawback in consulting these records is that most of them were compiled by the slave owners, not by the slaves themselves,\" Winkle said. \"So this becomes a huge exercise in reading between the lines, so to speak, and certainly not taking this information at face value but analyzing it before putting the pieces together to try to create an authentic collective portrait of who these slaves were, how they lived their lives, and what they accomplished. And surviving slavery was an incredible accomplishment.\" He added that the petitions represent \"just over 3,300 slaves in the District of Columbia. I always say it's one-tenth of 1 percent of all the slaves in the American South, but we see them. They are named. We can see them as individuals.\" 20 Seeking justice: In 1870, Sojourner Truth petitioned Congress for land reparations. (National Portrait Gallery) \"Self-petitions\" from enslaved African Americans requesting their freedom, many of them written by white pro bono lawyers, provide yet more insight. Phillip Meredith, a 30-year-old black man, lists his enslaver of 30 years as \" General Robert Lee .\" A corroborating witness notes the general was \"formerly of U.S. Army now in Rebel service.\" Meredith's petition was approved. 21 A more heartrending story is told through the \"self-petition\" of Mary A. Prather on behalf of herself and her 3-year-old son, Arthur. \"Mary says she had permission\" from her enslaver to be hired out, according to testimony, but that permission was later rescinded, making her a fugitive and thus ineligible for emancipation under the act. Mary's and Arthur's names appear in the commissioners' report among those \" from whom certificates have been withheld .\" 22 Washington Childs wrote in his \"self-petition\" that he was 33 years old , 6 feet 2 inches tall, with \"a large hair mole on the right side of his chin.\" He indicated that he was hired out in Washington, DC, \"nearly or quite five years last past\" by his Virginian enslaver, who would have received all of his wages during that time. His enslaver provided a letter of support for Childs's emancipation to be presented to the commission. Included in the missive is a citation of an outstanding debt of $60 , along with the galling request that Childs pay it off by sending \"a barrel of good sugar & sacks of coffee and 2 bolts of cotton & [a] pound of best Tea, that is if you can send the tea & cotton by express.\" 23 His emancipation was granted, and his enslaver was not compensated. But the overwhelming majority of those who submitted compensation claims succeeded in getting funds-often in amounts lower than requested, but at times up to $788. The compensation given to white enslavers helped maintain their financial security and the continuation of white supremacy and power. 24 \"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young , the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber , the second largest,\" Gibbs told me. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory . She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe , \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" 25 E ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which applied only to the treasonous Confederate states, over which the Union had no jurisdiction. Slavery wasn't fully abolished until nearly three years later, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 26 Stolen land, stolen freedom: A sharecropper plowing in Montgomery, Alabama. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) In January 1865, the United States undertook the \"40 acres and a mule\" reparations program, distributing 400,000 acres of Southern coastal land confiscated from disloyal Confederates to freed black families in plots of \" not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground. \" (Union Gen. William T. Sherman, who issued the initial order , also authorized distribution of old Army mules.) Historian and former US Commission on Civil Rights chair Mary Frances Berry noted that by June of 1865, \" 40,000 freedmen had been settled \" on the land and were already \"growing crops.\" Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, cruelly reversed the policy, evicting the land's black occupants and returning their properties to the white Confederate enslavers who had attacked the Union. Many of those black folks would be forced into sharecropping, a Jim Crow form of slavery in all but name. 27 American history has since been marked by too many calls for reparations to list, each rebuffed in turn by the US government. In 1870, Sojourner Truth unsuccessfully petitioned Congress for land reparations, stating, \"I shall make them understand that there is a debt to the Negro people which they can never repay. At least, then, they must make amends.\" Walter Vaughan, a white slavery apologist who believed black dollars would ultimately fatten white Southern pockets, wrote an 1890 bill to give freed people pensions like those granted to Civil War veterans. Introduced in Congress by Nebraska Representative William J. Connell, Vaughan's \" ex-slave pension bill \" died before becoming law, as did eight other reparations proposals introduced between 1896 and 1903. During the same period, a formerly enslaved woman and mother of five named Callie House cofounded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. In 1915, the group sued the US Treasury for $68 million, the estimated amount of taxes collected on cotton between 1862 and 1868 . A lower tribunal and the Supreme Court cited government immunity in dismissing the suit. For her temerity, House was charged with mail fraud , convicted by an all-white jury, and sentenced to a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Nearly 50 years later, reparations advocate Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore secured enough petition signatures-over 1 million-to compel President John F. Kennedy to meet with her, but no legal remedies followed. The US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed a 1995 reparations lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a 2007 class action case against corporations that benefited from black enslavement. 28 In 2019 the House of Representatives held a hearing on HR 40 -the number refers to Sherman's unfulfilled promise of land-a bill that was introduced in every Congress from 1989 to 2017 by Michigan Representative John Conyers.

Included in the missive is a citation of an outstanding debt of $60 , along with the galling request that Childs pay it off by sending \"a barrel of good sugar & sacks of coffee and 2 bolts of cotton & [a] pound of best Tea, that is if you can send the tea & cotton by express.\" 23 His emancipation was granted, and his enslaver was not compensated. But the overwhelming majority of those who submitted compensation claims succeeded in getting funds-often in amounts lower than requested, but at times up to $788. The compensation given to white enslavers helped maintain their financial security and the continuation of white supremacy and power. 24 \"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young , the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber , the second largest,\" Gibbs told me. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory . She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe , \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" 25 E ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which applied only to the treasonous Confederate states, over which the Union had no jurisdiction. Slavery wasn't fully abolished until nearly three years later, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 26 Stolen land, stolen freedom: A sharecropper plowing in Montgomery, Alabama. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) In January 1865, the United States undertook the \"40 acres and a mule\" reparations program, distributing 400,000 acres of Southern coastal land confiscated from disloyal Confederates to freed black families in plots of \" not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground. \" (Union Gen. William T. Sherman, who issued the initial order , also authorized distribution of old Army mules.) Historian and former US Commission on Civil Rights chair Mary Frances Berry noted that by June of 1865, \" 40,000 freedmen had been settled \" on the land and were already \"growing crops.\" Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, cruelly reversed the policy, evicting the land's black occupants and returning their properties to the white Confederate enslavers who had attacked the Union. Many of those black folks would be forced into sharecropping, a Jim Crow form of slavery in all but name. 27 American history has since been marked by too many calls for reparations to list, each rebuffed in turn by the US government. In 1870, Sojourner Truth unsuccessfully petitioned Congress for land reparations, stating, \"I shall make them understand that there is a debt to the Negro people which they can never repay. At least, then, they must make amends.\" Walter Vaughan, a white slavery apologist who believed black dollars would ultimately fatten white Southern pockets, wrote an 1890 bill to give freed people pensions like those granted to Civil War veterans. Introduced in Congress by Nebraska Representative William J. Connell, Vaughan's \" ex-slave pension bill \" died before becoming law, as did eight other reparations proposals introduced between 1896 and 1903. During the same period, a formerly enslaved woman and mother of five named Callie House cofounded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. In 1915, the group sued the US Treasury for $68 million, the estimated amount of taxes collected on cotton between 1862 and 1868 . A lower tribunal and the Supreme Court cited government immunity in dismissing the suit. For her temerity, House was charged with mail fraud , convicted by an all-white jury, and sentenced to a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Nearly 50 years later, reparations advocate Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore secured enough petition signatures-over 1 million-to compel President John F. Kennedy to meet with her, but no legal remedies followed. The US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed a 1995 reparations lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a 2007 class action case against corporations that benefited from black enslavement. 28 In 2019 the House of Representatives held a hearing on HR 40 -the number refers to Sherman's unfulfilled promise of land-a bill that was introduced in every Congress from 1989 to 2017 by Michigan Representative John Conyers. Unceremoniously killed in committee for nearly 30 years, HR 40 would not compel federal payouts to the descendants of enslaved people but instead would merely impanel a commission to examine the impact of \" slavery and its continuing vestiges .\" In taking up the bill's sponsorship, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee noted that it would help illuminate the statistics that show the \"stunning chasm between the destinies of White America and that of Black America.\" For example, the median wealth of white families is currently estimated at $171,000; for black families, it is $17,600 -approximately a tenfold difference. Fewer than 10 percent of white families have zero or negative net worth, while nearly 20 percent of black households do. Discrimination against black people in mortgage lending, historically and today, has hobbled opportunities for homeownership , the source of two-thirds of equity for American households and one of the most reliable forms of intergenerational wealth . And while we're on the subject of black folks being denied property, it seems like a good moment to note that if those 40 acres and a mule had been distributed as promised, the land would be worth about $6.4 trillion today . 29 More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice! March 12, 2025 If there were an actual interest in ending those disparities, Congress would at the very least support studying the numbers. Instead, opponents of HR 40 argue against even investigating the issue. That opposition, including McConnell's dismissive remarks, demonstrates the ahistorical American self-mythologizing at the heart of the country's bitter opposition to slavery reparations. The Senate leader and his ilk are fighting an ideological war to defend the lie that slavery was a historical anomaly, an inconsequential blip on an American moral arc that always otherwise bends toward racial justice. It's an attempt to rewrite history, omitting how the denial of reparations shortchanged black freedom and omitting the policies of Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, and unstinting white terror against black success. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the highly influential 2014 Atlantic article \"The Case for Reparations,\" directly addressed McConnell-whose family enslaved black human beings -in his testimony on HR 40. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" Coates stated. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\" 30 R ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions. Yale, Brown, Harvard, William & Mary, and more than 50 other members of the Universities Studying Slavery consortium have acknowledged the role of black enslavement in their early funding, founding, construction, and maintenance. (The collective includes schools in Britain, which also gave reparations solely to enslavers; the taxpayer-funded payments of $3.9 billion ended only in 2015. ) To atone for their ties to slavery, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Georgetown University have all established reparations funds . In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\n\"The primary drawback in consulting these records is that most of them were compiled by the slave owners, not by the slaves themselves,\" Winkle said. \"So this becomes a huge exercise in reading between the lines, so to speak, and certainly not taking this information at face value but analyzing it before putting the pieces together to try to create an authentic collective portrait of who these slaves were, how they lived their lives, and what they accomplished. And surviving slavery was an incredible accomplishment.\" He added that the petitions represent \"just over 3,300 slaves in the District of Columbia. I always say it's one-tenth of 1 percent of all the slaves in the American South, but we see them. They are named. We can see them as individuals.\" 20 Seeking justice: In 1870, Sojourner Truth petitioned Congress for land reparations. (National Portrait Gallery) \"Self-petitions\" from enslaved African Americans requesting their freedom, many of them written by white pro bono lawyers, provide yet more insight. Phillip Meredith, a 30-year-old black man, lists his enslaver of 30 years as \" General Robert Lee .\" A corroborating witness notes the general was \"formerly of U.S. Army now in Rebel service.\" Meredith's petition was approved. 21 A more heartrending story is told through the \"self-petition\" of Mary A. Prather on behalf of herself and her 3-year-old son, Arthur. \"Mary says she had permission\" from her enslaver to be hired out, according to testimony, but that permission was later rescinded, making her a fugitive and thus ineligible for emancipation under the act. Mary's and Arthur's names appear in the commissioners' report among those \" from whom certificates have been withheld .\" 22 Washington Childs wrote in his \"self-petition\" that he was 33 years old , 6 feet 2 inches tall, with \"a large hair mole on the right side of his chin.\" He indicated that he was hired out in Washington, DC, \"nearly or quite five years last past\" by his Virginian enslaver, who would have received all of his wages during that time.

Included in the missive is a citation of an outstanding debt of $60 , along with the galling request that Childs pay it off by sending \"a barrel of good sugar & sacks of coffee and 2 bolts of cotton & [a] pound of best Tea, that is if you can send the tea & cotton by express.\" 23 His emancipation was granted, and his enslaver was not compensated. But the overwhelming majority of those who submitted compensation claims succeeded in getting funds-often in amounts lower than requested, but at times up to $788. The compensation given to white enslavers helped maintain their financial security and the continuation of white supremacy and power. 24 \"Let's look at the fortunes of the larger holders of enslaved people-for example, George Washington Young , the largest slaveholder in the district, or Margaret Barber , the second largest,\" Gibbs told me. \"Barber's farm, North View, is now the site of the US vice president's house and the Naval Observatory . She was able to use the money [from the act] and parlay it and invest it.\" Another, Ann Biscoe , \"had an employment bureau, essentially. She made good money leasing out the enslaved people who were under her control. When compensated emancipation came, she still made out fairly well.\" 25 E ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which applied only to the treasonous Confederate states, over which the Union had no jurisdiction. Slavery wasn't fully abolished until nearly three years later, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 26 Stolen land, stolen freedom: A sharecropper plowing in Montgomery, Alabama. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) In January 1865, the United States undertook the \"40 acres and a mule\" reparations program, distributing 400,000 acres of Southern coastal land confiscated from disloyal Confederates to freed black families in plots of \" not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground. \" (Union Gen. William T. Sherman, who issued the initial order , also authorized distribution of old Army mules.) Historian and former US Commission on Civil Rights chair Mary Frances Berry noted that by June of 1865, \" 40,000 freedmen had been settled \" on the land and were already \"growing crops.\" Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, cruelly reversed the policy, evicting the land's black occupants and returning their properties to the white Confederate enslavers who had attacked the Union. Many of those black folks would be forced into sharecropping, a Jim Crow form of slavery in all but name. 27 American history has since been marked by too many calls for reparations to list, each rebuffed in turn by the US government. In 1870, Sojourner Truth unsuccessfully petitioned Congress for land reparations, stating, \"I shall make them understand that there is a debt to the Negro people which they can never repay. At least, then, they must make amends.\" Walter Vaughan, a white slavery apologist who believed black dollars would ultimately fatten white Southern pockets, wrote an 1890 bill to give freed people pensions like those granted to Civil War veterans. Introduced in Congress by Nebraska Representative William J. Connell, Vaughan's \" ex-slave pension bill \" died before becoming law, as did eight other reparations proposals introduced between 1896 and 1903. During the same period, a formerly enslaved woman and mother of five named Callie House cofounded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. In 1915, the group sued the US Treasury for $68 million, the estimated amount of taxes collected on cotton between 1862 and 1868 . A lower tribunal and the Supreme Court cited government immunity in dismissing the suit. For her temerity, House was charged with mail fraud , convicted by an all-white jury, and sentenced to a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Nearly 50 years later, reparations advocate Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore secured enough petition signatures-over 1 million-to compel President John F. Kennedy to meet with her, but no legal remedies followed. The US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed a 1995 reparations lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a 2007 class action case against corporations that benefited from black enslavement. 28 In 2019 the House of Representatives held a hearing on HR 40 -the number refers to Sherman's unfulfilled promise of land-a bill that was introduced in every Congress from 1989 to 2017 by Michigan Representative John Conyers. Unceremoniously killed in committee for nearly 30 years, HR 40 would not compel federal payouts to the descendants of enslaved people but instead would merely impanel a commission to examine the impact of \" slavery and its continuing vestiges .\" In taking up the bill's sponsorship, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee noted that it would help illuminate the statistics that show the \"stunning chasm between the destinies of White America and that of Black America.\" For example, the median wealth of white families is currently estimated at $171,000; for black families, it is $17,600 -approximately a tenfold difference. Fewer than 10 percent of white families have zero or negative net worth, while nearly 20 percent of black households do. Discrimination against black people in mortgage lending, historically and today, has hobbled opportunities for homeownership , the source of two-thirds of equity for American households and one of the most reliable forms of intergenerational wealth . And while we're on the subject of black folks being denied property, it seems like a good moment to note that if those 40 acres and a mule had been distributed as promised, the land would be worth about $6.4 trillion today . 29 More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice! March 12, 2025 If there were an actual interest in ending those disparities, Congress would at the very least support studying the numbers. Instead, opponents of HR 40 argue against even investigating the issue. That opposition, including McConnell's dismissive remarks, demonstrates the ahistorical American self-mythologizing at the heart of the country's bitter opposition to slavery reparations. The Senate leader and his ilk are fighting an ideological war to defend the lie that slavery was a historical anomaly, an inconsequential blip on an American moral arc that always otherwise bends toward racial justice. It's an attempt to rewrite history, omitting how the denial of reparations shortchanged black freedom and omitting the policies of Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, and unstinting white terror against black success. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the highly influential 2014 Atlantic article \"The Case for Reparations,\" directly addressed McConnell-whose family enslaved black human beings -in his testimony on HR 40. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" Coates stated. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\" 30 R ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions. Yale, Brown, Harvard, William & Mary, and more than 50 other members of the Universities Studying Slavery consortium have acknowledged the role of black enslavement in their early funding, founding, construction, and maintenance. (The collective includes schools in Britain, which also gave reparations solely to enslavers; the taxpayer-funded payments of $3.9 billion ended only in 2015. ) To atone for their ties to slavery, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Georgetown University have all established reparations funds . In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\nWashington Childs wrote in his \"self-petition\" that he was 33 years old , 6 feet 2 inches tall, with \"a large hair mole on the right side of his chin.\" He indicated that he was hired out in Washington, DC, \"nearly or quite five years last past\" by his Virginian enslaver, who would have received all of his wages during that time.

In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\nE ight months after passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act, during his Second Annual Message to Congress , Lincoln proposed a gradual expansion of the policy to any state that freed its enslaved people by the year 1900 -a plan that would have condemned enslaved black folks to four more decades of backbreaking, brutally extracted labor and exploitation. Compensation for the formerly enslaved never even came up. Instead, Lincoln again floated the idea that freed black folks could be consensually expatriated to \"Liberia and Hayti.\" The plan, of course, was not enacted. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which applied only to the treasonous Confederate states, over which the Union had no jurisdiction. Slavery wasn't fully abolished until nearly three years later, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 26 Stolen land, stolen freedom: A sharecropper plowing in Montgomery, Alabama. (Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection) In January 1865, the United States undertook the \"40 acres and a mule\" reparations program, distributing 400,000 acres of Southern coastal land confiscated from disloyal Confederates to freed black families in plots of \" not more than forty (40) acres of tillable ground. \" (Union Gen. William T. Sherman, who issued the initial order , also authorized distribution of old Army mules.) Historian and former US Commission on Civil Rights chair Mary Frances Berry noted that by June of 1865, \" 40,000 freedmen had been settled \" on the land and were already \"growing crops.\" Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, cruelly reversed the policy, evicting the land's black occupants and returning their properties to the white Confederate enslavers who had attacked the Union. Many of those black folks would be forced into sharecropping, a Jim Crow form of slavery in all but name. 27 American history has since been marked by too many calls for reparations to list, each rebuffed in turn by the US government. In 1870, Sojourner Truth unsuccessfully petitioned Congress for land reparations, stating, \"I shall make them understand that there is a debt to the Negro people which they can never repay. At least, then, they must make amends.\" Walter Vaughan, a white slavery apologist who believed black dollars would ultimately fatten white Southern pockets, wrote an 1890 bill to give freed people pensions like those granted to Civil War veterans. Introduced in Congress by Nebraska Representative William J. Connell, Vaughan's \" ex-slave pension bill \" died before becoming law, as did eight other reparations proposals introduced between 1896 and 1903. During the same period, a formerly enslaved woman and mother of five named Callie House cofounded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association. In 1915, the group sued the US Treasury for $68 million, the estimated amount of taxes collected on cotton between 1862 and 1868 . A lower tribunal and the Supreme Court cited government immunity in dismissing the suit. For her temerity, House was charged with mail fraud , convicted by an all-white jury, and sentenced to a year in the Missouri State Penitentiary. Nearly 50 years later, reparations advocate Audley \"Queen Mother\" Moore secured enough petition signatures-over 1 million-to compel President John F. Kennedy to meet with her, but no legal remedies followed. The US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed a 1995 reparations lawsuit, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a 2007 class action case against corporations that benefited from black enslavement. 28 In 2019 the House of Representatives held a hearing on HR 40 -the number refers to Sherman's unfulfilled promise of land-a bill that was introduced in every Congress from 1989 to 2017 by Michigan Representative John Conyers.

It's an attempt to rewrite history, omitting how the denial of reparations shortchanged black freedom and omitting the policies of Jim Crow, redlining, mass incarceration, and unstinting white terror against black success. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the highly influential 2014 Atlantic article \"The Case for Reparations,\" directly addressed McConnell-whose family enslaved black human beings -in his testimony on HR 40. \"We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,\" Coates stated. \"It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.\" 30 R ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions. Yale, Brown, Harvard, William & Mary, and more than 50 other members of the Universities Studying Slavery consortium have acknowledged the role of black enslavement in their early funding, founding, construction, and maintenance. (The collective includes schools in Britain, which also gave reparations solely to enslavers; the taxpayer-funded payments of $3.9 billion ended only in 2015. ) To atone for their ties to slavery, Virginia Theological Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, and Georgetown University have all established reparations funds . In November 2019 legislators in Evanston, Illinois, voted to use taxes on legalized marijuana to pay reparations to a community \" unfairly policed and damaged \" by the War on Drugs. And in 2005, JPMorgan Chase apologized for its connections to black chattel slavery and established a $5 million scholarship fund for black students. In 2019 then-presidential hopeful Cory Booker introduced a reparations bill in the Senate that was cosponsored by fellow candidates at the time Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Amy Klobuchar, as well as current candidate Bernie Sanders. 31 Henrietta Wood, the woman who sued for reparations just five years after the end of the Civil War, won her case, although she received only a fraction of her original demand-in itself far less than she was owed, which was a price too great to be quantified. Her story remains a near singular example of US willingness to make some form of reparation for black enslavement. Like many who have studied the enslavement of black people in the United States and its destructive legacy on black lives, Kenneth Winkle believes there should be an effort to study reparations and determine some kind of corrective. 32 \"There must be recompense for descendants of slaves,\" Winkle says. \"I'm a historian, and I devote most of my thoughts to the past and probably too little to the present. And I'm not certain what that compensation can or should consist of-but there needs to be an official recognition of the injustice that Americans collectively inflicted, at the time of their emancipation, on about 4 million African Americans who survived to be able to enjoy their emancipation, and the government participated in committing that injustice.\" 33 What is so often labeled America's \"original sin\" is, in fact, a wrong this country continues to commit. Reparations would not only represent a genuine effort to redress the United States' long history of racial discrimination, white terror and anti-black lawmaking but also a recognition of the ongoing harm this country inflicts against its African American citizens. 34\n\nR ecognition of this fact has very slowly dawned on a smattering of institutions.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

If this is not the moment to finally come to terms with the United States' 401-year legacy of government-sanctioned, anti-Black oppression, then, pray tell, when will that moment be? Nearly every year since 1989, Congress has ignored a bill that would create a commission to study the effects of slavery on African Americans and explore possible remedies-including reparations. The current iteration of that bill, HR 40, was introduced by Representative Sheila Jackson Lee last year and languished in the House Judiciary Committee ever since, awaiting action in a chamber controlled by Democrats. What are they waiting for? There has never been a more promising period for action on this legislation than the one we are in now. Even before the recent wave of protests for Black lives swept the nation, the bill already had unprecedented support. As of today, 135 members of Congress have added their names as cosponsors-compared to the two cosponsors that the previous iteration of the bill had in 2014. Largely in response to the tenacity of African American New York Times reporter Astead Herndon , many Democratic presidential candidates explicitly expressed support for reparations when interviewed last year; The Washington Post reported that 15 of the candidates said the issue should be \"studied.\" The current uprisings have made the imperative for this conversation even more compelling. The United States is in the midst of a racial justice reckoning unlike anything it has seen since John Lewis, Amelia Boynton, and other activists tried to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., in March 1965. Those peaceful protesters encountered police mounted on horseback, who swung billy clubs into the skulls of marchers and shot tear gas at the assembled men, women, and children. The nationally televised broadcast of that attack-on what came to be known as Bloody Sunday-shocked the conscience of the country, and created the political will for the passage of the Voting Rights Act later that year. Related Article Since Emancipation, the United States Has Refused to Make Reparations for Slavery Kali Holloway Fifty-five years later, we are seeing marches, protests, and rallies in more than 2,000 cities and towns in every state in the country (and on six of seven continents), demanding justice for Black lives. The shift in public opinion has been dizzying: As recently as 2017, polls found that only 28 percent of white Americans supported the Black Lives Matter movement, while 51 percent opposed it. Today, 42 percent of whites say they support the movement.

Much of the legislative energy to date has been channeled toward police reform , an area that desperately needs to see radical change. However, our political leaders should not be limited in their imagination or courage when it comes to pursuing even more far-reaching measures to remedy systemic racism. As Nikole Hannah-Jones writes in her June essay for the New York Times , \" What Is Owed \": \"If we are truly at the precipice of a transformative moment, the most tragic of outcomes would be that the demand be too timid and the resolution too small.\" Current Issue View our current issue In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson did not stop at signing the Voting Rights Act. As Taylor Branch detailed in his 2006 book At Canaan's Edge , Johnson quickly followed that step by bringing forward historic and transformative legislation to change the country's immigration, health care, and education systems. That included the creation of Medicare, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and Title I federal funding for schools with a high percentage of low-income students, shifting the priorities of the nation and improving the lives of millions of people. The INA, in particular, finally ended America's racist immigration quotas-and with them the legacy of restricting US citizenship to \" free white persons .\" The results reshaped the very composition of the country. Trump and his white nationalist puppet master, Stephen Miller, are still working overtime trying to reverse its effects . Just as voting rights were only part of the picture in 1965, police reform is similarly only one aspect of a much larger and deeper problem. Policing in the United States has always been a form of social control of Black people, with roots tracing back to the slave patrols created in the early 1700s. The intersection of policing and the enslavement of African Americans is so embedded in American culture that it is still codified in the United States Constitution's Fugitive Slave Clause , which compels the return of an runaway enslaved person to their \"owner.\" Policing as social control of a racial group is not the only-or, frankly, the worst-legacy of slavery. Most of the structural problems in this country are caused by the gargantuan racial wealth gap that resulted from the expropriation of free labor from African Americans. That labor generated enormous economic profits for white people, who then continued to restrict Black access to wealth through decades of (explicit, then implicit) discrimination. As Harvard professor Sven Beckert wrote in his exhaustive 2014 book Empire of Cotton , \"It was on the back of cotton, and thus on the backs of slaves, that the US economy ascended in the world.\" Related Article Why JPMorgan Chase Should Give $1 Billion to Black Neighborhoods in Chicago Daniel Fernandez The consequence of this course of action has been to limit wealth and perpetuate high levels of poverty in the African American community. People living in poverty may not have money, but they still have needs. It is even possible that they could take extralegal actions to satisfy those needs, perhaps even going so far as to utilize a counterfeit $20 bill in a Minneapolis convenience store. That is what George Floyd was alleged-but not proven-to have done when those four police officers arrived on the scene, one of whom proceeded to kneel on his neck and kill him. To limit the focus of the current moment to outlawing choke holds and passing police reform would be the equivalent of seeking to change the conduct of security guards at the bank-while ignoring the fact that the bank itself is filled with ill-gotten plunder. The cause is just, and the country is clamoring for change. So what is Congress waiting for? There are 233 Democrats in the House of Representatives; right now, 98 of them have yet to cosponsor HR 40. In the Senate, Cory Booker has introduced a companion bill , but just 18 of the 47 Democrats and independents have signed on as cosponsors . What are they waiting for? Not only that: What are we waiting for? People of conscience across this nation are looking for ways to act on their values and manifest their desire to rectify this country's tortured racial history. One thing we can do is to lend our voices to HR 40: We can each pick an undecided member of Congress and call and e-mail them daily, until they either sign on as a cosponsor, or give an official statement explaining why they won't. You can also urge Congress to act by adding your name to the petition that my organization, Democracy in Color, and many allies are circulating. Many of us in the United States never thought we'd see a reckoning like the one happening now. When South Africa emerged from the shadow of apartheid, it modeled what a path forward could look like by establishing its Truth and Reconciliation Commission. That commission spearheaded a national dialogue that confronted the truth of South Africa's history, as a first step toward healing and justice. In this country, HR 40 could be a vehicle to do the same.

It is even possible that they could take extralegal actions to satisfy those needs, perhaps even going so far as to utilize a counterfeit $20 bill in a Minneapolis convenience store. That is what George Floyd was alleged-but not proven-to have done when those four police officers arrived on the scene, one of whom proceeded to kneel on his neck and kill him. To limit the focus of the current moment to outlawing choke holds and passing police reform would be the equivalent of seeking to change the conduct of security guards at the bank-while ignoring the fact that the bank itself is filled with ill-gotten plunder. The cause is just, and the country is clamoring for change. So what is Congress waiting for? There are 233 Democrats in the House of Representatives; right now, 98 of them have yet to cosponsor HR 40.

Not only that: What are we waiting for? People of conscience across this nation are looking for ways to act on their values and manifest their desire to rectify this country's tortured racial history. One thing we can do is to lend our voices to HR 40: We can each pick an undecided member of Congress and call and e-mail them daily, until they either sign on as a cosponsor, or give an official statement explaining why they won't. You can also urge Congress to act by adding your name to the petition that my organization, Democracy in Color, and many allies are circulating. Many of us in the United States never thought we'd see a reckoning like the one happening now. When South Africa emerged from the shadow of apartheid, it modeled what a path forward could look like by establishing its Truth and Reconciliation Commission. That commission spearheaded a national dialogue that confronted the truth of South Africa's history, as a first step toward healing and justice. In this country, HR 40 could be a vehicle to do the same. This is the moment for action.\n\nThe current uprisings have made the imperative for this conversation even more compelling. The United States is in the midst of a racial justice reckoning unlike anything it has seen since John Lewis, Amelia Boynton, and other activists tried to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., in March 1965. Those peaceful protesters encountered police mounted on horseback, who swung billy clubs into the skulls of marchers and shot tear gas at the assembled men, women, and children. The nationally televised broadcast of that attack-on what came to be known as Bloody Sunday-shocked the conscience of the country, and created the political will for the passage of the Voting Rights Act later that year.

The shift in public opinion has been dizzying: As recently as 2017, polls found that only 28 percent of white Americans supported the Black Lives Matter movement, while 51 percent opposed it. Today, 42 percent of whites say they support the movement.

As Harvard professor Sven Beckert wrote in his exhaustive 2014 book Empire of Cotton , \"It was on the back of cotton, and thus on the backs of slaves, that the US economy ascended in the world.\" Related Article Why JPMorgan Chase Should Give $1 Billion to Black Neighborhoods in Chicago Daniel Fernandez The consequence of this course of action has been to limit wealth and perpetuate high levels of poverty in the African American community. People living in poverty may not have money, but they still have needs. It is even possible that they could take extralegal actions to satisfy those needs, perhaps even going so far as to utilize a counterfeit $20 bill in a Minneapolis convenience store. That is what George Floyd was alleged-but not proven-to have done when those four police officers arrived on the scene, one of whom proceeded to kneel on his neck and kill him. To limit the focus of the current moment to outlawing choke holds and passing police reform would be the equivalent of seeking to change the conduct of security guards at the bank-while ignoring the fact that the bank itself is filled with ill-gotten plunder.

Not only that: What are we waiting for? People of conscience across this nation are looking for ways to act on their values and manifest their desire to rectify this country's tortured racial history. One thing we can do is to lend our voices to HR 40: We can each pick an undecided member of Congress and call and e-mail them daily, until they either sign on as a cosponsor, or give an official statement explaining why they won't.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Among the episodes in the history of anti-gay discrimination and violence in the United States for which the Mattachine Society is seeking an apology from the American government is the arrest of 1 million gay men (one every 10 minutes) from the end of World War II through the 1960s on a wide range of indecency charges, including sodomy, dancing, kissing, or holding hands. There's also the Lavender Scare , the mid-century witch hunt triggered by President Eisenhower's 1953 executive order that resulted in the firing of some 10,000 federal workers on the suspicion of homosexuality. That was far more than were dismissed during the Red Scare, the persecution of federal workers suspected of being Communist or of being under the influence of Communism. Americans know even less about the use during the 1950s and '60s of \"gay conversion therapy\" at federal institutions, like Washington, D.C.'s St. Elizabeths Hospital, the first federally operated facility intended to treat the mentally ill. While under treatment at St. Elizabeths, an unknown number of federal workers suspected of homosexuality were subjected, against their will, to barbaric and experimental therapies such as lobotomies and insulin-induced comas with the intension of erasing or altering same-sex attraction.

By the time the policy was repealed, in 2011, it had caused the dismissal of 13,000 gays and lesbians from their jobs. The Mattachine resolution introduced this month comes on the heels of other acts of \"gay reparation\" at the state and local level. In 2019, the New York Police Department offered an apology for the 1969 violent raid at the Stonewall Inn, the event that sparked the Stonewall Riots. Soon after, the San Francisco Police Department offered its own apology for the Compton's Cafeteria riot of 1966, an act of resistance against police brutality by the transgender community. In 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a clemency initiative that allows LGBTQ Californians convicted for \"vagrancy, loitering, sodomy or other laws used to prosecute people for having consensual adult sex\" to apply for a pardon. Newsom also issued a posthumous pardon to the late civil rights leader Bayard Rustin for his arrest in 1953 after being seen having sex with another man in parked car. Because Americans know so little about the profound history of anti-LGBTQ discrimination in the United States, it's not surprising that there has been never been a national discussion about gay reparations. As a result of this, misconceptions and outright myths abound about what gay reparations actually are. Current Issue View our current issue Based on the experience of nations like Spain, Britain, and Germany, gay reparations are best understood as policies intended to make amends for a history of systemic anti-gay discrimination. But the movement is not one-size-fits-all; nor is it driven by gay people demanding financial compensation simply for claiming an LGBTQ identity, as some foes of the gay community have contended . Instead, the gay reparations movement encompasses a small but eclectic constellation of approaches to repairing the damage done by state-sponsored anti-gay discrimination and violence, with each approach entailing its own policies and philosophical emphases for how to repair that damage. Among gay reparations, \"atonement\" is the most popular, and, arguably, the least controversial. It requires only an official apology from the government that conveys an admission of wrongdoing and a pledge to do better going forward. Britain 's Alan Turing Law , enacted in 2017, pioneered this approach. It granted an apology and a posthumous pardon to some 65,000 men convicted of homosexual offenses, of whom 15,000 were still alive. The law honors the memory of the brilliant mathematician credited with accelerating the end of World War II by cracking Germany's military codes. Turing was sentenced to chemical castration in 1952 for having admitted to a consensual sexual relationship with another man. He was also fired from his government job. Thrown into despair by the nation for which he had done so much for, Turing reportedly committed suicide in 1954. Britain has also apologized for exporting its homophobic laws to its former colonial possessions. Also prominent is \"rehabilitation,\" which seeks to restore the character and reputation of those persecuted for their sexual orientation and gender identity. In Spain , LGBTQ people are allowed to petition for \"moral rehabilitation,\" which includes expunging any records that may have resulted from a criminal prosecution. There's also \"compensation,\" which entails financial payment to the victims of anti-gay discrimination for the loss of wages and pensions that may have resulted from time spent in prison or in a mental institution because of homophobic laws and policies. Canada and Germany are two prominent examples. In both cases, the government established a fund to be disbursed to anyone claiming financial harm because of prosecution for a homosexual offense. Rounding out gay reparations are \"remembrance,\" or the commemoration of past events of anti-gay discrimination and repression, such as Germany's memorial to the homosexual men who perished in concentration camps (the so-called \"Gay Holocaust), and \"truth-telling,\" which demands a state-sanctioned narrative that speaks of systemic abuse toward the gay community. Two factors in global politics account for the seemingly sudden rise of the gay reparations movement. The first one is that \"reparations\" is now a better and more widely understood concept. A second and less apparent factor is the advent of what some have called the \" Age of Apology .\" This includes nations apologizing to other nations, but also governments apologizing to their own citizens for historical injustices. Ultimately, however, the main driver behind gay reparations is found within the gay rights movement itself and its struggle for \"full citizenship.\" Traditionally, scholars such as T.H. Marshall have defined citizenship as a legal status that emphasizes rights protected by the state and responsibilities to society at large, such as the right to vote and the chance to own property. But in recent years, a more expansive definition of citizenship has emerged that seeks to sketch the non-legal dimensions of citizenship, such as dignity and respect, and more generally a sense of belonging within the political community. It is this newer understanding of citizenship that is driving the gay reparations movement abroad and at home. Success for the Mattachine resolution in Congress is far from certain. A more modest resolution, the \" Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act ,\" or LOVE Act, introduced in 2017 that would compel the federal government to review employee terminations at the State Department during the 1950s and 1960s \"due to their actual or perceived sexual orientation\" went nowhere in a Republican-controlled Senate. But there's reason to hope. The current reckoning with racial injustice should remind Americans that racism and homophobia have always traveled hand-in-hand in American history, a point underscored by the propensity of white supremacists to label civil rights leaders \"homos\" and \"queers.\" Moreover, when it comes to gay rights, the United States is slower than many other democracies. By the time marriage equality became US law nationwide, some 20 nations had already legalized gay marriage. The call for gay reparations offers yet another reminder of how steep a climb the American struggle for LGBTQ equality continues to be.\n\nChampioned by the Mattachine Society of Washington, D.C., an organization that takes its name from the pre-Stonewall era group that sought to advance gay civil rights, the resolution was inspired by previous official apologies in American history, including the Acknowledgement and Regret for the Chinese Exclusion Laws (2012), an apology to Japanese-Americans sent to internment camps during World War II (1988), and the apologies issued to African Americans for slavery and Jim Crow by the US House of Representatives and the US Senate in 2008 and 2009, respectively.

As a result of this, misconceptions and outright myths abound about what gay reparations actually are. Current Issue View our current issue Based on the experience of nations like Spain, Britain, and Germany, gay reparations are best understood as policies intended to make amends for a history of systemic anti-gay discrimination. But the movement is not one-size-fits-all; nor is it driven by gay people demanding financial compensation simply for claiming an LGBTQ identity, as some foes of the gay community have contended . Instead, the gay reparations movement encompasses a small but eclectic constellation of approaches to repairing the damage done by state-sponsored anti-gay discrimination and violence, with each approach entailing its own policies and philosophical emphases for how to repair that damage. Among gay reparations, \"atonement\" is the most popular, and, arguably, the least controversial. It requires only an official apology from the government that conveys an admission of wrongdoing and a pledge to do better going forward. Britain 's Alan Turing Law , enacted in 2017, pioneered this approach. It granted an apology and a posthumous pardon to some 65,000 men convicted of homosexual offenses, of whom 15,000 were still alive. The law honors the memory of the brilliant mathematician credited with accelerating the end of World War II by cracking Germany's military codes. Turing was sentenced to chemical castration in 1952 for having admitted to a consensual sexual relationship with another man. He was also fired from his government job. Thrown into despair by the nation for which he had done so much for, Turing reportedly committed suicide in 1954. Britain has also apologized for exporting its homophobic laws to its former colonial possessions. Also prominent is \"rehabilitation,\" which seeks to restore the character and reputation of those persecuted for their sexual orientation and gender identity. In Spain , LGBTQ people are allowed to petition for \"moral rehabilitation,\" which includes expunging any records that may have resulted from a criminal prosecution. There's also \"compensation,\" which entails financial payment to the victims of anti-gay discrimination for the loss of wages and pensions that may have resulted from time spent in prison or in a mental institution because of homophobic laws and policies. Canada and Germany are two prominent examples. In both cases, the government established a fund to be disbursed to anyone claiming financial harm because of prosecution for a homosexual offense. Rounding out gay reparations are \"remembrance,\" or the commemoration of past events of anti-gay discrimination and repression, such as Germany's memorial to the homosexual men who perished in concentration camps (the so-called \"Gay Holocaust), and \"truth-telling,\" which demands a state-sanctioned narrative that speaks of systemic abuse toward the gay community. Two factors in global politics account for the seemingly sudden rise of the gay reparations movement. The first one is that \"reparations\" is now a better and more widely understood concept. A second and less apparent factor is the advent of what some have called the \" Age of Apology .\" This includes nations apologizing to other nations, but also governments apologizing to their own citizens for historical injustices. Ultimately, however, the main driver behind gay reparations is found within the gay rights movement itself and its struggle for \"full citizenship.\" Traditionally, scholars such as T.H. Marshall have defined citizenship as a legal status that emphasizes rights protected by the state and responsibilities to society at large, such as the right to vote and the chance to own property. But in recent years, a more expansive definition of citizenship has emerged that seeks to sketch the non-legal dimensions of citizenship, such as dignity and respect, and more generally a sense of belonging within the political community. It is this newer understanding of citizenship that is driving the gay reparations movement abroad and at home. Success for the Mattachine resolution in Congress is far from certain. A more modest resolution, the \" Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act ,\" or LOVE Act, introduced in 2017 that would compel the federal government to review employee terminations at the State Department during the 1950s and 1960s \"due to their actual or perceived sexual orientation\" went nowhere in a Republican-controlled Senate. But there's reason to hope. The current reckoning with racial injustice should remind Americans that racism and homophobia have always traveled hand-in-hand in American history, a point underscored by the propensity of white supremacists to label civil rights leaders \"homos\" and \"queers.\" Moreover, when it comes to gay rights, the United States is slower than many other democracies. By the time marriage equality became US law nationwide, some 20 nations had already legalized gay marriage. The call for gay reparations offers yet another reminder of how steep a climb the American struggle for LGBTQ equality continues to be.\n\nAmericans know even less about the use during the 1950s and '60s of \"gay conversion therapy\" at federal institutions, like Washington, D.C.'s St. Elizabeths Hospital, the first federally operated facility intended to treat the mentally ill. While under treatment at St. Elizabeths, an unknown number of federal workers suspected of homosexuality were subjected, against their will, to barbaric and experimental therapies such as lobotomies and insulin-induced comas with the intension of erasing or altering same-sex attraction.

Rounding out gay reparations are \"remembrance,\" or the commemoration of past events of anti-gay discrimination and repression, such as Germany's memorial to the homosexual men who perished in concentration camps (the so-called \"Gay Holocaust), and \"truth-telling,\" which demands a state-sanctioned narrative that speaks of systemic abuse toward the gay community. Two factors in global politics account for the seemingly sudden rise of the gay reparations movement. The first one is that \"reparations\" is now a better and more widely understood concept. A second and less apparent factor is the advent of what some have called the \" Age of Apology .\" This includes nations apologizing to other nations, but also governments apologizing to their own citizens for historical injustices. Ultimately, however, the main driver behind gay reparations is found within the gay rights movement itself and its struggle for \"full citizenship.\" Traditionally, scholars such as T.H. Marshall have defined citizenship as a legal status that emphasizes rights protected by the state and responsibilities to society at large, such as the right to vote and the chance to own property. But in recent years, a more expansive definition of citizenship has emerged that seeks to sketch the non-legal dimensions of citizenship, such as dignity and respect, and more generally a sense of belonging within the political community. It is this newer understanding of citizenship that is driving the gay reparations movement abroad and at home. Success for the Mattachine resolution in Congress is far from certain. A more modest resolution, the \" Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act ,\" or LOVE Act, introduced in 2017 that would compel the federal government to review employee terminations at the State Department during the 1950s and 1960s \"due to their actual or perceived sexual orientation\" went nowhere in a Republican-controlled Senate. But there's reason to hope. The current reckoning with racial injustice should remind Americans that racism and homophobia have always traveled hand-in-hand in American history, a point underscored by the propensity of white supremacists to label civil rights leaders \"homos\" and \"queers.\" Moreover, when it comes to gay rights, the United States is slower than many other democracies. By the time marriage equality became US law nationwide, some 20 nations had already legalized gay marriage. The call for gay reparations offers yet another reminder of how steep a climb the American struggle for LGBTQ equality continues to be.\n\nAlso prominent is \"rehabilitation,\" which seeks to restore the character and reputation of those persecuted for their sexual orientation and gender identity. In Spain , LGBTQ people are allowed to petition for \"moral rehabilitation,\" which includes expunging any records that may have resulted from a criminal prosecution.

But it was only after she finished high school, left her native Evanston, Ill., and returned as an adult-ready to buy a house in the historically Black neighborhood in which she grew up-that she delved deep into her city's history and fully understood the policies that had kept Black residents poor while enriching their white neighbors. Of course, this isn't the kind of history that's taught in school, even if today's students do sometimes learn unsavory truths about the American empire. Local history is different, perhaps because it can be especially uncomfortable to examine how that empire's economic plunder shaped our present-day communities. Yet experiencing such discomfort may be preferable to any alternative-and I write this as a white person. In 2017, Simmons ran for Evanston City Council and won. She was interested in the idea of reparations and began studying a bill that has been sitting in Congress for decades. HR 40 , as it's called-the number refers to a broken promise of the post-Civil War era that formerly enslaved people should receive 40 acres and a mule-would establish a commission to examine the legacy of slavery and how restitution could be made. Federal reparations will be necessary to address this country's vast racial wealth gap that's the cumulative result of economically oppressive policies since the plantation era. Yet Simmons also knew that the federal government was hardly alone when it came to committing such injustices-and here she had a visionary idea. \"I thought, I'll start with one in my community,\" she told me by phone. Specifically, she would seek reparations for harms caused by her own city's 20th-century housing policies , which effectively restricted Black residents to a single neighborhood known as the 5th Ward. As Evanston's Black population grew during the Great Migration -in which African Americans fled terror and oppression in the South-the 5th Ward became overcrowded, and the cost of housing ballooned. By 1940, when the Home Owners Loan Corporation of the Federal Loan Bank Board drew up a map denoting the \"risk\" of lending in certain places, it shaded the 5th Ward red. That nationwide practice, known as redlining , indicated that the area was ineligible for the sort of loans that would help white families build intergenerational wealth. Today, whites in Evanston on average enjoy property values twice that of their Black neighbors.

She then led the painstaking work of gathering community input about how such redress should be made. As a result, in early December, just weeks from now, the first reparations by a municipal government will be awarded to Black residents in acknowledgement of a long history of structural racism: housing grants of $25,000 to 16 Evanston families-money that can be put toward a down payment or used as mortgage assistance or for repairs on an existing home. This is just the beginning of reparations in Evanston, a small yet mighty step. Indeed, the truth is that imperial America isn't just a far-flung reality. It's as local as wherever you're reading this, which means the antidote to it can be local as well. An Empire Rebranded A year after Simmons unveiled the idea of reparations to her City Council colleagues, two residents of Amherst, Massachusetts (where I live), noticed that Black Lives Matter signs had proliferated around town following the murder of George Floyd, and guessed that the public might finally be in the mood to pursue reparations here, as well. In Evanston, the initiative was a response to a specific set of housing policies. Why, though, would reparations be warranted in mostly white Amherst? The answer, to use a term favored by genealogist Nicka Smith , was in the way this town had been, in essence, rebranded . Today Amherst is known for \"progressive\" politics and prosperity, but in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, white town leaders had systematically excluded African Americans from local housing and economic opportunities-even though, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the hard labor of enslaved people abducted from Africa had helped build the place. (Yes, there was slavery in Massachusetts .) The town's rebranding was no accident. In at least one case, local historians falsified a town tax chart to exclude the valuation of human chattel, attempting to expunge slavery from the record. More generally, the hard truths of Amherst's history were whitewashed in favor of a pleasant story about virtuous European-Americans. In this way, its rebranding mirrored that of the nation. As of 2019, the median income for white families in Amherst was $108,500, more than twice that of Black families. Current Issue View our current issue Nonetheless, over the past year, thanks to activists, the notion of redress for people of African descent found its way onto the local government agenda. (I participated in this effort as a researcher, examining town history and writing reports about what I found.) Last December, Amherst's town council passed a proclamation \"Affirming the Town of Amherst's Commitment to End Structural Racism and Achieve Racial Equity for Black Residents,\" and this spring, in a historic move whose implications have yet to be determined, the council voted in favor of establishing a reparations fund . It's worth noting that the people who initially brought the idea of reparations to Amherst's nearly all-white council were themselves white. Meanwhile, a committee composed almost entirely of residents of color have been in ongoing negotiations with the same body in an effort to modify local policing practices to address concerns about basic physical safety. \"If You Have Come Here to Help Me, You Are Wasting Your Time\" For years, I didn't understand this line: \"If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.\" Those words are from Lilla Watson , an Australian Aboriginal elder and activist, and I see now that they have everything to do with making reparations. But I always thought: I can't come to help you? Why not? In the early 1970s, Watson was a leader in protests against colonialism and the Australian version of apartheid, a time when some white Australians did indeed approach Aboriginal people to ask how they could help. Watson and others felt frustrated because those folks wanted to be given the answers rather than doing the hard work of coming up with answers themselves. For me, it took about 37 years (I recently turned 38), but eventually I saw that an inclination to \"help\" can be a way for would-be helpers to feel invulnerable-a way of saying, \" I'm fine. It's these other people who need help.\" Well, let me say this now: I'm not fine. The particular white culture in which I was born and raised is riddled with heart-splitting depression and, amid substantial affluence, a gripping fear of still not having enough. My father, who passed away suddenly when I was 20, used to only half-jokingly say, \"Money is how you keep score.\" Dad was also an avid community servant. But if a stubborn part of you believes money is the measure of life, even a great deal of community service won't be enough to make you feel whole. On my maternal side, my mom grew up in a house with a wall-sized case displaying trophies she and her siblings won-part of an unspoken family understanding that a way to earn love was to be very, very good at tennis. My dad hardly invented the idea that money is life's scorecard, a belief at the heart of the European-American origin story and a powerful motivation for imperialist plunder, past and present. Today, in this age of billionaires , it's quintessentially American to link your value as a human being to your job title, salary, or net worth. No surprise, then, that such insecurity lives and seethes in me. My own European ancestors came to America in poverty, fleeing persecution because they were Jewish. Keep in mind that Jews were not considered whites by many in this country until after World War II. Then, they were allowed to merge into the morphing concept of American whiteness in part thanks to public programs like the G.I. Bill and federal home loans granted to white people in Evanston and elsewhere (from both of which African Americans were largely excluded). In my own family, material success in America was first about survival, only later becoming a matter of affluence. Think of our story, in other words, as moving from poverty to imperialist scorekeeping in three generations. Lately, though, I've noticed that giving away even modest sums of money brings me a sense of relief. Yet I still feel so resistant to doing so! As a European-American, I've thoroughly absorbed the idea that security comes from hoarding resources. The truth seems to be the opposite: such hoarding makes me feel dead inside. A Different Kind of Treasure The city of Evanston is dedicating a new form of revenue, the sales tax on recreational marijuana, to funding its reparations program. And that's just the beginning of a long process, as significantly more resources will be needed to make meaningful redress to eligible families. Robin Rue Simmons is now in talks with several financial institutions about developing a new type of home loan (with low interest rates or other benefits) that could be part of reparative justice in Evanston and, ultimately, elsewhere. She points out that such institutions profited from anti-Black practices that contributed to today's racial wealth gap and she says she's optimistic that at least one bank \"will take the bold first step and be the example to their colleagues in the financial industry.\" She's right that this would represent a striking new direction for American capitalism. Or put another way, I'm not the only one who has to learn how to give money away. Some people cling to wealth far beyond what's necessary for material security for the same reason that my mom, as a child, learned to slay her opponents on a tennis court and win trophies she could take home to her parents. It's protection against the worst of all possible fates: being inadequate, worthless, unloved. In Brené Brown's bestseller Dare to Lead , which she penned as a resource for building more courageous institutional cultures, she writes: \"At the center of all our elaborate personal security measures and protection schemes lies the most precious treasure of the human experience: the heart.\" It makes sense that an investigation of local harms and local repair possibilities comes down to that. After all, you can't get much more local than your own heart. Redressing the harms of yesterday and today requires opening not just coffers but also hearts, while letting go of strategies for defense and deflection. It requires realizing that what's imperial is also local. Little will happen, after all, until a great many of us actually begin to feel the pain of our collective history. Only in experiencing the fullness of what's wrong can we possibly discern the fullness of what's needed to make it right. Simmons has now founded a nonprofit called First Repair , to help bring the lessons of Evanston to other cities and towns. So many municipalities (including Amherst) have contacted her about the possibility of local reparations that she's lost count. And when it comes to HR 40, two years ago it had fewer than 70 cosponsors in the House of Representatives. Today, it has 194. This should be cause for optimism, however modest. It was Martin Luther King Jr. who famously said , \"We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" Yet the curvature of that arc is not a foregone conclusion. How slowly history moves (or doesn't) in the direction of justice depends on the hearts of ordinary people.\n\nIn 2017, Simmons ran for Evanston City Council and won.

In the early 1970s, Watson was a leader in protests against colonialism and the Australian version of apartheid, a time when some white Australians did indeed approach Aboriginal people to ask how they could help. Watson and others felt frustrated because those folks wanted to be given the answers rather than doing the hard work of coming up with answers themselves. For me, it took about 37 years (I recently turned 38), but eventually I saw that an inclination to \"help\" can be a way for would-be helpers to feel invulnerable-a way of saying, \" I'm fine. It's these other people who need help.\" Well, let me say this now: I'm not fine. The particular white culture in which I was born and raised is riddled with heart-splitting depression and, amid substantial affluence, a gripping fear of still not having enough. My father, who passed away suddenly when I was 20, used to only half-jokingly say, \"Money is how you keep score.\" Dad was also an avid community servant. But if a stubborn part of you believes money is the measure of life, even a great deal of community service won't be enough to make you feel whole. On my maternal side, my mom grew up in a house with a wall-sized case displaying trophies she and her siblings won-part of an unspoken family understanding that a way to earn love was to be very, very good at tennis. My dad hardly invented the idea that money is life's scorecard, a belief at the heart of the European-American origin story and a powerful motivation for imperialist plunder, past and present. Today, in this age of billionaires , it's quintessentially American to link your value as a human being to your job title, salary, or net worth. No surprise, then, that such insecurity lives and seethes in me. My own European ancestors came to America in poverty, fleeing persecution because they were Jewish. Keep in mind that Jews were not considered whites by many in this country until after World War II. Then, they were allowed to merge into the morphing concept of American whiteness in part thanks to public programs like the G.I. Bill and federal home loans granted to white people in Evanston and elsewhere (from both of which African Americans were largely excluded). In my own family, material success in America was first about survival, only later becoming a matter of affluence. Think of our story, in other words, as moving from poverty to imperialist scorekeeping in three generations. Lately, though, I've noticed that giving away even modest sums of money brings me a sense of relief. Yet I still feel so resistant to doing so! As a European-American, I've thoroughly absorbed the idea that security comes from hoarding resources. The truth seems to be the opposite: such hoarding makes me feel dead inside. A Different Kind of Treasure The city of Evanston is dedicating a new form of revenue, the sales tax on recreational marijuana, to funding its reparations program. And that's just the beginning of a long process, as significantly more resources will be needed to make meaningful redress to eligible families. Robin Rue Simmons is now in talks with several financial institutions about developing a new type of home loan (with low interest rates or other benefits) that could be part of reparative justice in Evanston and, ultimately, elsewhere. She points out that such institutions profited from anti-Black practices that contributed to today's racial wealth gap and she says she's optimistic that at least one bank \"will take the bold first step and be the example to their colleagues in the financial industry.\" She's right that this would represent a striking new direction for American capitalism. Or put another way, I'm not the only one who has to learn how to give money away. Some people cling to wealth far beyond what's necessary for material security for the same reason that my mom, as a child, learned to slay her opponents on a tennis court and win trophies she could take home to her parents. It's protection against the worst of all possible fates: being inadequate, worthless, unloved. In Brené Brown's bestseller Dare to Lead , which she penned as a resource for building more courageous institutional cultures, she writes: \"At the center of all our elaborate personal security measures and protection schemes lies the most precious treasure of the human experience: the heart.\" It makes sense that an investigation of local harms and local repair possibilities comes down to that. After all, you can't get much more local than your own heart. Redressing the harms of yesterday and today requires opening not just coffers but also hearts, while letting go of strategies for defense and deflection. It requires realizing that what's imperial is also local. Little will happen, after all, until a great many of us actually begin to feel the pain of our collective history. Only in experiencing the fullness of what's wrong can we possibly discern the fullness of what's needed to make it right. Simmons has now founded a nonprofit called First Repair , to help bring the lessons of Evanston to other cities and towns. So many municipalities (including Amherst) have contacted her about the possibility of local reparations that she's lost count. And when it comes to HR 40, two years ago it had fewer than 70 cosponsors in the House of Representatives. Today, it has 194. This should be cause for optimism, however modest. It was Martin Luther King Jr. who famously said , \"We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" Yet the curvature of that arc is not a foregone conclusion. How slowly history moves (or doesn't) in the direction of justice depends on the hearts of ordinary people.\n\n\"I thought, I'll start with one in my community,\" she told me by phone. Specifically, she would seek reparations for harms caused by her own city's 20th-century housing policies , which effectively restricted Black residents to a single neighborhood known as the 5th Ward. As Evanston's Black population grew during the Great Migration -in which African Americans fled terror and oppression in the South-the 5th Ward became overcrowded, and the cost of housing ballooned. By 1940, when the Home Owners Loan Corporation of the Federal Loan Bank Board drew up a map denoting the \"risk\" of lending in certain places, it shaded the 5th Ward red. That nationwide practice, known as redlining , indicated that the area was ineligible for the sort of loans that would help white families build intergenerational wealth. Today, whites in Evanston on average enjoy property values twice that of their Black neighbors.

She then led the painstaking work of gathering community input about how such redress should be made. As a result, in early December, just weeks from now, the first reparations by a municipal government will be awarded to Black residents in acknowledgement of a long history of structural racism: housing grants of $25,000 to 16 Evanston families-money that can be put toward a down payment or used as mortgage assistance or for repairs on an existing home. This is just the beginning of reparations in Evanston, a small yet mighty step. Indeed, the truth is that imperial America isn't just a far-flung reality. It's as local as wherever you're reading this, which means the antidote to it can be local as well. An Empire Rebranded A year after Simmons unveiled the idea of reparations to her City Council colleagues, two residents of Amherst, Massachusetts (where I live), noticed that Black Lives Matter signs had proliferated around town following the murder of George Floyd, and guessed that the public might finally be in the mood to pursue reparations here, as well. In Evanston, the initiative was a response to a specific set of housing policies. Why, though, would reparations be warranted in mostly white Amherst? The answer, to use a term favored by genealogist Nicka Smith , was in the way this town had been, in essence, rebranded . Today Amherst is known for \"progressive\" politics and prosperity, but in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, white town leaders had systematically excluded African Americans from local housing and economic opportunities-even though, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the hard labor of enslaved people abducted from Africa had helped build the place. (Yes, there was slavery in Massachusetts .) The town's rebranding was no accident. In at least one case, local historians falsified a town tax chart to exclude the valuation of human chattel, attempting to expunge slavery from the record. More generally, the hard truths of Amherst's history were whitewashed in favor of a pleasant story about virtuous European-Americans. In this way, its rebranding mirrored that of the nation. As of 2019, the median income for white families in Amherst was $108,500, more than twice that of Black families. Current Issue View our current issue Nonetheless, over the past year, thanks to activists, the notion of redress for people of African descent found its way onto the local government agenda. (I participated in this effort as a researcher, examining town history and writing reports about what I found.) Last December, Amherst's town council passed a proclamation \"Affirming the Town of Amherst's Commitment to End Structural Racism and Achieve Racial Equity for Black Residents,\" and this spring, in a historic move whose implications have yet to be determined, the council voted in favor of establishing a reparations fund . It's worth noting that the people who initially brought the idea of reparations to Amherst's nearly all-white council were themselves white. Meanwhile, a committee composed almost entirely of residents of color have been in ongoing negotiations with the same body in an effort to modify local policing practices to address concerns about basic physical safety. \"If You Have Come Here to Help Me, You Are Wasting Your Time\" For years, I didn't understand this line: \"If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time.

Last December, Amherst's town council passed a proclamation \"Affirming the Town of Amherst's Commitment to End Structural Racism and Achieve Racial Equity for Black Residents,\" and this spring, in a historic move whose implications have yet to be determined, the council voted in favor of establishing a reparations fund . It's worth noting that the people who initially brought the idea of reparations to Amherst's nearly all-white council were themselves white. Meanwhile, a committee composed almost entirely of residents of color have been in ongoing negotiations with the same body in an effort to modify local policing practices to address concerns about basic physical safety. \"If You Have Come Here to Help Me, You Are Wasting Your Time\" For years, I didn't understand this line: \"If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.\" Those words are from Lilla Watson , an Australian Aboriginal elder and activist, and I see now that they have everything to do with making reparations. But I always thought: I can't come to help you? Why not? In the early 1970s, Watson was a leader in protests against colonialism and the Australian version of apartheid, a time when some white Australians did indeed approach Aboriginal people to ask how they could help. Watson and others felt frustrated because those folks wanted to be given the answers rather than doing the hard work of coming up with answers themselves. For me, it took about 37 years (I recently turned 38), but eventually I saw that an inclination to \"help\" can be a way for would-be helpers to feel invulnerable-a way of saying, \" I'm fine. It's these other people who need help.\" Well, let me say this now: I'm not fine. The particular white culture in which I was born and raised is riddled with heart-splitting depression and, amid substantial affluence, a gripping fear of still not having enough. My father, who passed away suddenly when I was 20, used to only half-jokingly say, \"Money is how you keep score.\" Dad was also an avid community servant. But if a stubborn part of you believes money is the measure of life, even a great deal of community service won't be enough to make you feel whole. On my maternal side, my mom grew up in a house with a wall-sized case displaying trophies she and her siblings won-part of an unspoken family understanding that a way to earn love was to be very, very good at tennis. My dad hardly invented the idea that money is life's scorecard, a belief at the heart of the European-American origin story and a powerful motivation for imperialist plunder, past and present. Today, in this age of billionaires , it's quintessentially American to link your value as a human being to your job title, salary, or net worth. No surprise, then, that such insecurity lives and seethes in me. My own European ancestors came to America in poverty, fleeing persecution because they were Jewish. Keep in mind that Jews were not considered whites by many in this country until after World War II. Then, they were allowed to merge into the morphing concept of American whiteness in part thanks to public programs like the G.I. Bill and federal home loans granted to white people in Evanston and elsewhere (from both of which African Americans were largely excluded). In my own family, material success in America was first about survival, only later becoming a matter of affluence. Think of our story, in other words, as moving from poverty to imperialist scorekeeping in three generations. Lately, though, I've noticed that giving away even modest sums of money brings me a sense of relief. Yet I still feel so resistant to doing so! As a European-American, I've thoroughly absorbed the idea that security comes from hoarding resources. The truth seems to be the opposite: such hoarding makes me feel dead inside. A Different Kind of Treasure The city of Evanston is dedicating a new form of revenue, the sales tax on recreational marijuana, to funding its reparations program. And that's just the beginning of a long process, as significantly more resources will be needed to make meaningful redress to eligible families. Robin Rue Simmons is now in talks with several financial institutions about developing a new type of home loan (with low interest rates or other benefits) that could be part of reparative justice in Evanston and, ultimately, elsewhere. She points out that such institutions profited from anti-Black practices that contributed to today's racial wealth gap and she says she's optimistic that at least one bank \"will take the bold first step and be the example to their colleagues in the financial industry.\" She's right that this would represent a striking new direction for American capitalism. Or put another way, I'm not the only one who has to learn how to give money away. Some people cling to wealth far beyond what's necessary for material security for the same reason that my mom, as a child, learned to slay her opponents on a tennis court and win trophies she could take home to her parents. It's protection against the worst of all possible fates: being inadequate, worthless, unloved. In Brené Brown's bestseller Dare to Lead , which she penned as a resource for building more courageous institutional cultures, she writes: \"At the center of all our elaborate personal security measures and protection schemes lies the most precious treasure of the human experience: the heart.\" It makes sense that an investigation of local harms and local repair possibilities comes down to that. After all, you can't get much more local than your own heart. Redressing the harms of yesterday and today requires opening not just coffers but also hearts, while letting go of strategies for defense and deflection. It requires realizing that what's imperial is also local. Little will happen, after all, until a great many of us actually begin to feel the pain of our collective history. Only in experiencing the fullness of what's wrong can we possibly discern the fullness of what's needed to make it right. Simmons has now founded a nonprofit called First Repair , to help bring the lessons of Evanston to other cities and towns. So many municipalities (including Amherst) have contacted her about the possibility of local reparations that she's lost count. And when it comes to HR 40, two years ago it had fewer than 70 cosponsors in the House of Representatives. Today, it has 194. This should be cause for optimism, however modest. It was Martin Luther King Jr. who famously said , \"We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" Yet the curvature of that arc is not a foregone conclusion. How slowly history moves (or doesn't) in the direction of justice depends on the hearts of ordinary people.\n\nThe town's rebranding was no accident. In at least one case, local historians falsified a town tax chart to exclude the valuation of human chattel, attempting to expunge slavery from the record. More generally, the hard truths of Amherst's history were whitewashed in favor of a pleasant story about virtuous European-Americans. In this way, its rebranding mirrored that of the nation. As of 2019, the median income for white families in Amherst was $108,500, more than twice that of Black families.

Some people cling to wealth far beyond what's necessary for material security for the same reason that my mom, as a child, learned to slay her opponents on a tennis court and win trophies she could take home to her parents.

In Brené Brown's bestseller Dare to Lead , which she penned as a resource for building more courageous institutional cultures, she writes: \"At the center of all our elaborate personal security measures and protection schemes lies the most precious treasure of the human experience: the heart.\" It makes sense that an investigation of local harms and local repair possibilities comes down to that. After all, you can't get much more local than your own heart. Redressing the harms of yesterday and today requires opening not just coffers but also hearts, while letting go of strategies for defense and deflection. It requires realizing that what's imperial is also local. Little will happen, after all, until a great many of us actually begin to feel the pain of our collective history.

Simmons has now founded a nonprofit called First Repair , to help bring the lessons of Evanston to other cities and towns. So many municipalities (including Amherst) have contacted her about the possibility of local reparations that she's lost count. And when it comes to HR 40, two years ago it had fewer than 70 cosponsors in the House of Representatives. Today, it has 194. This should be cause for optimism, however modest. It was Martin Luther King Jr. who famously said , \"We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" Yet the curvature of that arc is not a foregone conclusion. How slowly history moves (or doesn't) in the direction of justice depends on the hearts of ordinary people.\n\nThe particular white culture in which I was born and raised is riddled with heart-splitting depression and, amid substantial affluence, a gripping fear of still not having enough. My father, who passed away suddenly when I was 20, used to only half-jokingly say, \"Money is how you keep score.\" Dad was also an avid community servant. But if a stubborn part of you believes money is the measure of life, even a great deal of community service won't be enough to make you feel whole. On my maternal side, my mom grew up in a house with a wall-sized case displaying trophies she and her siblings won-part of an unspoken family understanding that a way to earn love was to be very, very good at tennis. My dad hardly invented the idea that money is life's scorecard, a belief at the heart of the European-American origin story and a powerful motivation for imperialist plunder, past and present. Today, in this age of billionaires , it's quintessentially American to link your value as a human being to your job title, salary, or net worth. No surprise, then, that such insecurity lives and seethes in me. My own European ancestors came to America in poverty, fleeing persecution because they were Jewish. Keep in mind that Jews were not considered whites by many in this country until after World War II. Then, they were allowed to merge into the morphing concept of American whiteness in part thanks to public programs like the G.I. Bill and federal home loans granted to white people in Evanston and elsewhere (from both of which African Americans were largely excluded). In my own family, material success in America was first about survival, only later becoming a matter of affluence. Think of our story, in other words, as moving from poverty to imperialist scorekeeping in three generations. Lately, though, I've noticed that giving away even modest sums of money brings me a sense of relief. Yet I still feel so resistant to doing so!

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nFor four decades, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has extolled the importance of \"personal responsibility.\" He has chastised those who \"make excuses for black Americans\" and argued there is a need to \"emphasize black self-help.\" He has denigrated affirmative action programs on the grounds that they \"create a narcotic of dependency\" where there should be \"an ethic of responsibility and independence.\" He bemoans the \"ideology of victimhood\" that allows the marginalized to \"make demands on society for reparations and recompense.\" In light of recent revelations that Thomas has been showered by billionaire Harlan Crow with over two decades' worth of getaways on superyachts and private jets and various other gifts, none of which he ever reported, the jurist's long con of principled advocacy for Black self-reliance and opposition to white largesse has finally run its course. Turns out, Thomas was never against reparations-he just wanted them for himself. He is and always has been precisely what he wrongly accuses Black folks of being. It's been a con run by a self-serving fabulist all along. In 1980, Thomas caught the attention of the incoming president, Ronald Reagan, with a speech in which he used the \"welfare queen\" stereotype against his own sister. \"She gets mad when the mailman is late with her welfare check. That is how dependent she is,\" Thomas told an audience of fellow Black Republicans. \"What's worse is that now her kids feel entitled to the check too. They have no motivation for doing better or getting out of that situation.\" A 1991 Los Angeles Times investigation found Thomas's sister was, in fact, an underpaid single mother who used the social safety net during a brief rough patch; her children weren't the entitled layabouts depicted by Thomas, either. A few years later, while serving as the second-highest-ranking Black official in the Reagan administration, Thomas observed that \"to be accepted into the conservative ranks and to be treated with some degree of respect, a black was required to become a caricature of sorts, providing sideshows of anti-black quips and attacks,\" adding that Black conservatives \"must be against affirmative action and against welfare. And your opposition had to be adamant and constant.\" Forty years later, it's hard not to think Thomas wasn't so much airing grievances as reassuring his white conservative compatriots that he understood the assignment.

Claiming he was \"humiliated\" by possessing a law degree that \"bore the taint of racial preference,\" he went on to become a prominent opponent of affirmative action-even suggesting that race-based policies represented the new slavery or Jim Crow, but for white people. Nonetheless, Thomas continued to benefit from his race long after his days at Yale. He was selected for a leadership position in the Office for Civil Rights in Reagan's Department of Education, during which time civil rights groups attempted to have him held in contempt for inadequately enforcing civil rights laws, and then was promoted to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, despite lacking almost any relevant experience. Though his legacy at the EEOC was mostly a shameful one-he allowed 13,000 age-discrimination claims to expire-he was named to the federal appeals bench by President George H.W. Bush. A mere 15 months later, he was nominated for the Supreme Court. For all his bluster about self-reliance, Thomas has evidently never refused an unearned promotion.

In a 1992 case involving the abuse of prisoners by guards, Thomas wrote that while excessive force may be \"deplorable,\" he wouldn't go so far as to label it unconstitutional. In a more recent dissent, he \"appeared to urge officials in Texas to execute [a man on death row] even while the plaintiff's efforts to obtain [potentially exculpatory] DNA evidence moved forward,\" as The New York Times reported. And in a 2019 case that overturned a death row conviction, citing a Mississippi prosecutor's overt \"discriminatory intent,\" Thomas dissented, not only voting to kill the man but opining that the lone upside of the majority opinion was that \"the state is perfectly free to convict [him] again.\" Yet Thomas has no such concerns about his own record of rule bending and breaking. There is his history of alleged sexual harassment, according not just to Anita Hill but also other EEOC staffers. Stories of Thomas's sexual harassment have continued to surface, as recently as 2016. And the current scandal over his financial disclosure omissions likely goes beyond the realm of ethics violations into potential illegality: Multiple court observers point out that he may have violated the Ethics in Government Act. There is also the matter of Thomas's wife, Ginni, who supported efforts to deny the outcome of the 2020 election. Thomas has refused to recuse himself in cases involving groups his wife is engaged with-and is now refusing to recuse himself from litigation over the January 6 insurrection. And while Thomas castigates Black folks for blaming their problems on racism, he seems to carry a full deck of race cards everywhere he goes. He insists that all public criticisms of him are the result of his status as a Black conservative who refuses to \"follow in this cult-like way something that Blacks are supposed to believe.\" For a party of people who constantly accuse Black folks of being \"race grifters,\" white Republicans seem loath to recognize those in their midst, doing their bidding. Some scholars have promoted the idea that Thomas has fused the philosophies of Malcolm X and Booker T. Washington, creating a Franken-philosophy rooted in the idea that the communal self-reliance that helped Black families survive during Jim Crow is the cure for what ails Black America today. But that seems too generous a reading. The truth is, Clarence Thomas has looked out only for himself, and Black folks are collateral damage along the way. I don't expect Thomas to face real consequences for his latest scandal. But at least the image-laundering con he has undertaken has come to its inevitable end.\n\nIn light of recent revelations that Thomas has been showered by billionaire Harlan Crow with over two decades' worth of getaways on superyachts and private jets and various other gifts, none of which he ever reported, the jurist's long con of principled advocacy for Black self-reliance and opposition to white largesse has finally run its course. Turns out, Thomas was never against reparations-he just wanted them for himself. He is and always has been precisely what he wrongly accuses Black folks of being. It's been a con run by a self-serving fabulist all along. In 1980, Thomas caught the attention of the incoming president, Ronald Reagan, with a speech in which he used the \"welfare queen\" stereotype against his own sister. \"She gets mad when the mailman is late with her welfare check. That is how dependent she is,\" Thomas told an audience of fellow Black Republicans. \"What's worse is that now her kids feel entitled to the check too. They have no motivation for doing better or getting out of that situation.\" A 1991 Los Angeles Times investigation found Thomas's sister was, in fact, an underpaid single mother who used the social safety net during a brief rough patch; her children weren't the entitled layabouts depicted by Thomas, either. A few years later, while serving as the second-highest-ranking Black official in the Reagan administration, Thomas observed that \"to be accepted into the conservative ranks and to be treated with some degree of respect, a black was required to become a caricature of sorts, providing sideshows of anti-black quips and attacks,\" adding that Black conservatives \"must be against affirmative action and against welfare. And your opposition had to be adamant and constant.\" Forty years later, it's hard not to think Thomas wasn't so much airing grievances as reassuring his white conservative compatriots that he understood the assignment.

Washington, creating a Franken-philosophy rooted in the idea that the communal self-reliance that helped Black families survive during Jim Crow is the cure for what ails Black America today. But that seems too generous a reading. The truth is, Clarence Thomas has looked out only for himself, and Black folks are collateral damage along the way.

(Paul Hennessy / NurPhoto / Getty)\n\nBlack votes in this country are worth less than white votes. Joe Biden won the Electoral College because Black voters in Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia turned out in significant numbers. But even with overwhelming Black support- 94 percent of Detroit voted for Biden! -the outcomes in Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania were worryingly close. 1 The Argument is a column where writers and thinkers propose a provocative idea that may not be politically realizable in the short term but that pushes one to think broader about a pressing issue of public importance. One core problem is the Electoral College. Wyoming, which has just 580,000 residents and is 93 percent white, gets three electors because of its two senators and one representative in the House. By comparison, Georgia's Fifth Congressional District-which includes Atlanta, has 710,000 residents, and is 58 percent Black-has no dedicated electors or senators and can only occasionally overcome the mostly white and conservative votes from elsewhere in the state. This devaluation of Black votes allows our political system to ignore Black lives, and the consequences are devastating. Unequal representation has led to unequal health care outcomes, which the Covid-19 pandemic has only worsened . Without sufficient voting power, Black communities receive substandard education , and politicians are free to appoint judges who sanction mass incarceration , abusive policing , and electoral disenfranchisement . 2 This is all by design. The Constitution's framers set up the Electoral College to protect the interests of slave states . Along with the Senate, the Electoral College was critical in the endurance of slavery and its continuation by other means. Abolishing this system would mean that ballots cast by Black voters-or any voters, for that matter-would count the same. 3 But there's another way to undo the damage of the Electoral College and other structurally racist political institutions: We can implement vote reparations by double-counting ballots cast by all Black residents. The poisonous legacy of slavery applies to Black people regardless of when we or our ancestors arrived in this country. Vote reparations should also extend to Native Americans. Slavery is rightly called America's original sin, but so too was the United States' genocidal seizure of land from its original inhabitants. Various legal forms of disenfranchisement have applied to them. It wasn't until 1962 that all Native Americans were allowed to vote, and even then they faced-and still face-electoral obstacles. These are not the only examples of American oppression; we should include in vote reparations others who have suffered similar disenfranchisement. 4 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis The Argument Cancel the Presidential Debates-Permanently Ed Burmila One of the largest objections to monetary reparations is the impracticality of implementing them on a scale that would meaningfully address the injustices.

Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, discussed a similar proposal in 2015 in The Washington Post . While his plan to make Black Americans' votes worth five-thirds has a poetic symmetry with the three-fifths clause of the Constitution, we shouldn't bind a remedy to the mathematics of the compromise that formalized and furthered the dehumanization of Black people. That bargain allowed the very people who stripped us of our rights to have their votes counted for more-even more than other white people-in Congress and the Electoral College. But it's not the only way politicians have legally denied representation to Black people. This country's history of poll taxes, literacy tests, gerrymandering, voter purges, and intimidation should all be addressed. Tying a remedy to the three-fifths compromise implies that clause was the heart of the problem. It wasn't and isn't. Counting Black votes twice keeps the point clear and provides redress for myriad forms of disenfranchisement deployed against Black voters. 6 Vote reparations would create possibilities to build what W.E.B. Du Bois called \"abolition democracy,\" or the practice of achieving a racially just society. Abolition democracy invites us to engage with abolition not as a finite goal but as a radical process of challenging injustices wherever and in whatever form they might appear. Vote reparations would empower us to replace oppressive institutions with life-affirming structures of economic, social, and political equality. And if our elected representatives did not prioritize this transformational work, we could vote them out. 7 Because white votes currently count more than Black ones, double-counting Black votes would restore electoral balance. Vote reparations would be a giant step toward remedying our nation's long history of denying and devaluing Black votes. To address systemic racism, we must transform how we choose our government. Even if vote reparations aren't instituted, Black voters will keep tirelessly dragging our states toward a more perfect union. But just imagine our country if our votes counted twice. 8\n\nThe Argument is a column where writers and thinkers propose a provocative idea that may not be politically realizable in the short term but that pushes one to think broader about a pressing issue of public importance.\n\nOne core problem is the Electoral College.

Despite the terrors and tortures of French colonialism, the Haitian revolutionaries won their independence from France in 1804 to become the first modern nation to permanently abolish slavery . Yet, in 1825, the French returned to Haitian shores to demand 150 million francs in exchange for recognition of Haitian independence-21 years after the fact-and to compensate enslavers for their lost \"property.\" Dozens of manuscripts and pamphlets from early-19th-century France show that what the French really wanted wasn't money at all, though. Rather they sought, in their words, to \"restore Saint-Domingue,\" which meant to bring back slavery. The French began planning the reconquest of Haiti soon after the Haitian Declaration of Independence on January 1, 1804, and threatened the new nation under all its first leaders from its founder, Emperor Jean-Jacques Dessalines (who was assassinated in 1806) to both King Henry Christophe (who ruled after Dessalines in the north until he committed suicide in 1820) and Alexandre Pétion who was simultaneously president over a republic in the south and west until 1818 when he died of natural causes. By the time Pétion and Christophe's successor, President Jean-Pierre Boyer, signed the indemnity in 1825, the French had been openly plotting for two decades to \"exterminate\" the Haitian populace in the name of restoring slavery. That history of planned genocide is essential to understanding the threat of violent warfare, not merely financial exploitation, that 19th-century Haitians lived with because, in the words of Dessalines, they \"dared to be free.\" Napoléon Bonaparte came to power in France in 1799, in the wake of the enormous slave rebellion in Saint-Domingue that forced the French to grudgingly abolish slavery in all their colonies in 1794. Though French President Emmanuel Macron recently remarked that Napoléon's \" life was an epiphany of freedom ,\" Bonaparte himself was pro-slavery and animated by the same prejudices against Black people as the monarchs of the ancien régime. Not only did Bonaparte send his brother-in-law Charles-Victor-Emmanuel Leclerc on an expedition to Saint-Domingue to bring back slavery in 1802, but the first consul also expressed explicitly racist beliefs during his rule.

I even think that for a time the masters must be given the right of life and death over their slaves,\" Rochambeau concluded. Although Haitians definitively won their independence in 1804, France refused to recognize the new nation, and the French populace, like French officials, never stopped scheming for the \"restoration of Saint-Domingue.\" In 1806, Saint-Domingue's former head of finance addressed a detailed plan for reinstating slavery to Napoléon, who had made himself an emperor. While neither ruling out deporting or exterminating the entire population, the official argued the first step was to assassinate Haiti's leader. \"As long as Dessalines exists,\" he wrote, \"we will never attain our goal.\" Current Issue View our current issue Gen. François-Marie Perichou de Kerversau, stationed in Saint-Domingue during the Leclerc expedition, also sent detailed reconquest plans to Napoléon. Like his predecessors, Kerversau spoke of the need to \"exterminate\" the entire population, including the children. No conciliations for the \"negroes\" should be made at all, Kerversau warned. \"They want to be free,\" but \"the honor of the French name, the security of the West Indies and indignantly outraged humanity cannot allow it,\" he said. \"The aura that once guaranteed the safety of the master and allowed one man to live in peace among two hundred slaves is gone,\" Kerversau concluded. \"The black man knows today that a white is only a man.\" Napoléon's Bourbon successors similarly did not drag their feet in coming up with schemes to reinstate slavery. In 1814, Pierre Victor, baron Malouet, minister of the marine and colonies under Louis XVIII, sent three spies to coerce Haiti's leaders to surrender. Malouet threatened that if they did not submit, the Haitian people would be \"treated as barbarous savages and hunted down like maroon negroes.\" One of the spies, Dauxion-Lavaysse, even sent a letter to King Henry that unabashedly revealed that France was ready \"to replace the population of Haiti, which...would be totally annihilated by the forces sent against it.\" Jean-Louis, Baron de Vastey , one of the most prominent officials in the Kingdom of Haiti, responded by lamenting that \"twenty-five years of misfortune and experience had failed to correct the irascibility of the ex-colonists.\" \"They have not ceased to provoke the cabinet of Louis XVIII, to lead it, like that of Bonaparte, into sending a similar expedition against us,\" Vastey wrote. \"First, they sent us spies, then commissioners, all of them ex-colonists, to insult us and offer us the choice between slavery or death; they conceived of plans of attack and extermination in their writings and pamphlets, which violate all the laws of religion, justice, morality, and humanity.\" It was only after realizing that Haitians would rather fight a war to the death than see the return of slavery and French rule-a Haitian newspaper reads, \"Since the French must come, let them come only once! the more there are, the more of them we will kill!\"-that the French settled for impoverishing them. Ange René Armand, Baron de Mackau , whom Louis XVIII's brother and successor King Charles X sent to deliver the ultimatum, arrived in Haiti in July 1825, accompanied by a squadron of 14 brigs of war carrying more than 500 cannons. The instructions given to Mackau reminded the French diplomat that his task was merely that of a messenger. \"My mission to the people of our former colony is not a negotiation,\" Mackau wrote. \"I am limited to explaining to them on what conditions His Majesty [of France] consents to grant their independence, fully and entirely.\" \"I lack the powers to make the slightest modification to the proposals of which I am the bearer.\" The directive, marked \"very secret,\" stated that if Haiti \"did not demonstrate gratitude for what His Majesty deigns to do for them,\" Mackau was to \"announce to the leaders of that government that henceforth they will be treated as enemies of France; that already a squadron is ready to establish the most rigorous blockade in front of the ports of the island; that this squadron will soon be reinforced by other vessels sent from our ports; and that the interruption of all maritime commerce will cease for Saint-Domingue only after this island will have submitted, without conditions, to the domination of France.\" France's most terrible weapon turned out to be economics. And the war of extermination was to come by means other than the cannon. With the threat of recolonization, re-enslavement, and genocide looming, on July 11, 1825, Boyer signed the fatal document , which stated, \"The present inhabitants of the French part of St. Domingue shall pay...in five equal installments...the sum of 150,000,000 francs, destined to indemnify the former colonists.\" The consequences of this economic violence continue to resound for today's Haitians. The French only released their territorial claim on Haiti after imposing a racist and inhumane freedom tax that brought poverty while preventing prosperity. The Times estimates that, while the total amount of the indemnity was reduced to 90 million francs in 1838, the Haitian government paid approximately 112 million francs , or about $560 million. Yet, in 2003, former Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide calculated that, adjusted for inflation, the French siphoned from Haiti the equivalent of $21 billion. The story of the indemnity is not only about the many possibilities foreclosed by this unjust debt. It is also about the legacy of slavery and the unquantifiable generational trauma wrought by France's material and moral war against Haitian independence. Without a doubt, the French owe Haitians full reimbursement of the indemnity, but I daresay they owe them far more in reparations for slavery and compensation for pain and suffering.\n\nDozens of manuscripts and pamphlets from early-19th-century France show that what the French really wanted wasn't money at all, though. Rather they sought, in their words, to \"restore Saint-Domingue,\" which meant to bring back slavery. The French began planning the reconquest of Haiti soon after the Haitian Declaration of Independence on January 1, 1804, and threatened the new nation under all its first leaders from its founder, Emperor Jean-Jacques Dessalines (who was assassinated in 1806) to both King Henry Christophe (who ruled after Dessalines in the north until he committed suicide in 1820) and Alexandre Pétion who was simultaneously president over a republic in the south and west until 1818 when he died of natural causes. By the time Pétion and Christophe's successor, President Jean-Pierre Boyer, signed the indemnity in 1825, the French had been openly plotting for two decades to \"exterminate\" the Haitian populace in the name of restoring slavery. That history of planned genocide is essential to understanding the threat of violent warfare, not merely financial exploitation, that 19th-century Haitians lived with because, in the words of Dessalines, they \"dared to be free.\" Napoléon Bonaparte came to power in France in 1799, in the wake of the enormous slave rebellion in Saint-Domingue that forced the French to grudgingly abolish slavery in all their colonies in 1794. Though French President Emmanuel Macron recently remarked that Napoléon's \" life was an epiphany of freedom ,\" Bonaparte himself was pro-slavery and animated by the same prejudices against Black people as the monarchs of the ancien régime. Not only did Bonaparte send his brother-in-law Charles-Victor-Emmanuel Leclerc on an expedition to Saint-Domingue to bring back slavery in 1802, but the first consul also expressed explicitly racist beliefs during his rule.

It is also about the legacy of slavery and the unquantifiable generational trauma wrought by France's material and moral war against Haitian independence. Without a doubt, the French owe Haitians full reimbursement of the indemnity, but I daresay they owe them far more in reparations for slavery and compensation for pain and suffering.\n\nAmy Wilentz\n\nWilliam P. Jones\n\nGerald Horne\n\nBonaparte once wrote, \"I am for the whites, because I am white. I have no other reason, and this is the right one.\" He thus rebuked the French revolutionaries for having dared to declare general emancipation. \"How could anyone have granted freedom to Africans, to men who had no civilization?\" he asked. It is hardly a surprise that during the Leclerc expedition we find Bonaparte's top generals exhibiting the same prejudices while using the logic of genocidal extermination.

I even think that for a time the masters must be given the right of life and death over their slaves,\" Rochambeau concluded. Although Haitians definitively won their independence in 1804, France refused to recognize the new nation, and the French populace, like French officials, never stopped scheming for the \"restoration of Saint-Domingue.\" In 1806, Saint-Domingue's former head of finance addressed a detailed plan for reinstating slavery to Napoléon, who had made himself an emperor. While neither ruling out deporting or exterminating the entire population, the official argued the first step was to assassinate Haiti's leader. \"As long as Dessalines exists,\" he wrote, \"we will never attain our goal.\" Current Issue View our current issue Gen. François-Marie Perichou de Kerversau, stationed in Saint-Domingue during the Leclerc expedition, also sent detailed reconquest plans to Napoléon. Like his predecessors, Kerversau spoke of the need to \"exterminate\" the entire population, including the children. No conciliations for the \"negroes\" should be made at all, Kerversau warned. \"They want to be free,\" but \"the honor of the French name, the security of the West Indies and indignantly outraged humanity cannot allow it,\" he said. \"The aura that once guaranteed the safety of the master and allowed one man to live in peace among two hundred slaves is gone,\" Kerversau concluded. \"The black man knows today that a white is only a man.\" Napoléon's Bourbon successors similarly did not drag their feet in coming up with schemes to reinstate slavery. In 1814, Pierre Victor, baron Malouet, minister of the marine and colonies under Louis XVIII, sent three spies to coerce Haiti's leaders to surrender. Malouet threatened that if they did not submit, the Haitian people would be \"treated as barbarous savages and hunted down like maroon negroes.\" One of the spies, Dauxion-Lavaysse, even sent a letter to King Henry that unabashedly revealed that France was ready \"to replace the population of Haiti, which...would be totally annihilated by the forces sent against it.\" Jean-Louis, Baron de Vastey , one of the most prominent officials in the Kingdom of Haiti, responded by lamenting that \"twenty-five years of misfortune and experience had failed to correct the irascibility of the ex-colonists.\" \"They have not ceased to provoke the cabinet of Louis XVIII, to lead it, like that of Bonaparte, into sending a similar expedition against us,\" Vastey wrote. \"First, they sent us spies, then commissioners, all of them ex-colonists, to insult us and offer us the choice between slavery or death; they conceived of plans of attack and extermination in their writings and pamphlets, which violate all the laws of religion, justice, morality, and humanity.\" It was only after realizing that Haitians would rather fight a war to the death than see the return of slavery and French rule-a Haitian newspaper reads, \"Since the French must come, let them come only once! the more there are, the more of them we will kill!\"-that the French settled for impoverishing them. Ange René Armand, Baron de Mackau , whom Louis XVIII's brother and successor King Charles X sent to deliver the ultimatum, arrived in Haiti in July 1825, accompanied by a squadron of 14 brigs of war carrying more than 500 cannons. The instructions given to Mackau reminded the French diplomat that his task was merely that of a messenger. \"My mission to the people of our former colony is not a negotiation,\" Mackau wrote. \"I am limited to explaining to them on what conditions His Majesty [of France] consents to grant their independence, fully and entirely.\" \"I lack the powers to make the slightest modification to the proposals of which I am the bearer.\" The directive, marked \"very secret,\" stated that if Haiti \"did not demonstrate gratitude for what His Majesty deigns to do for them,\" Mackau was to \"announce to the leaders of that government that henceforth they will be treated as enemies of France; that already a squadron is ready to establish the most rigorous blockade in front of the ports of the island; that this squadron will soon be reinforced by other vessels sent from our ports; and that the interruption of all maritime commerce will cease for Saint-Domingue only after this island will have submitted, without conditions, to the domination of France.\" France's most terrible weapon turned out to be economics. And the war of extermination was to come by means other than the cannon. With the threat of recolonization, re-enslavement, and genocide looming, on July 11, 1825, Boyer signed the fatal document , which stated, \"The present inhabitants of the French part of St. Domingue shall pay...in five equal installments...the sum of 150,000,000 francs, destined to indemnify the former colonists.\" The consequences of this economic violence continue to resound for today's Haitians. The French only released their territorial claim on Haiti after imposing a racist and inhumane freedom tax that brought poverty while preventing prosperity. The Times estimates that, while the total amount of the indemnity was reduced to 90 million francs in 1838, the Haitian government paid approximately 112 million francs , or about $560 million.

The French only released their territorial claim on Haiti after imposing a racist and inhumane freedom tax that brought poverty while preventing prosperity. The Times estimates that, while the total amount of the indemnity was reduced to 90 million francs in 1838, the Haitian government paid approximately 112 million francs , or about $560 million. Yet, in 2003, former Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide calculated that, adjusted for inflation, the French siphoned from Haiti the equivalent of $21 billion. The story of the indemnity is not only about the many possibilities foreclosed by this unjust debt. It is also about the legacy of slavery and the unquantifiable generational trauma wrought by France's material and moral war against Haitian independence.

The instructions given to Mackau reminded the French diplomat that his task was merely that of a messenger. \"My mission to the people of our former colony is not a negotiation,\" Mackau wrote. \"I am limited to explaining to them on what conditions His Majesty [of France] consents to grant their independence, fully and entirely.\" \"I lack the powers to make the slightest modification to the proposals of which I am the bearer.\" The directive, marked \"very secret,\" stated that if Haiti \"did not demonstrate gratitude for what His Majesty deigns to do for them,\" Mackau was to \"announce to the leaders of that government that henceforth they will be treated as enemies of France; that already a squadron is ready to establish the most rigorous blockade in front of the ports of the island; that this squadron will soon be reinforced by other vessels sent from our ports; and that the interruption of all maritime commerce will cease for Saint-Domingue only after this island will have submitted, without conditions, to the domination of France.\" France's most terrible weapon turned out to be economics.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

No charges will be brought against police officers directly for the killing of Breonna Taylor , a 26-year-old Black EMT and aspiring nurse, in Louisville, Ky., who was awoken and shot six times in her hallway during a botched drug raid . One former officer, Brett Hankison , was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment for shots fired through her neighbor's walls. This outcome shows, once again , how our system of law and law enforcement devalues and discards Black lives. Since its inception in the 1800s, policing in the United States has served to maintain the country's racial hierarchy, which deems Black people inferior and disposable. These racist origins and continued police involvement in racial oppression during Jim Crow and afterward, including through expanded surveillance, paved the way for systematic racial profiling in Black and Latinx neighborhoods from Boston to Los Angeles . Over and over again, it has had fatal consequences . Police departments across the country have targeted enforcement against Black, brown, and low-income communities, and this aggressive deployment of police has accompanied disinvestment in services and support for these communities that might more effectively reduce crime. Some conversations about how to deal with police violence ignore the structural elements of racialized violence embedded in the policing system. The police violence against Black people continues, with the recent shooting of Jacob Blake, in Kenosha, Wis. , and the killings of Trayford Pellerin , Anthony McClain , and Jonathan Jefferson , all since August. We need not only to provide justice and compensation to the victims but also to engage with more transformative solutions-moving resources away from the policing system as a form of reparative justice.

The United Nations guidelines for restoring rights in post-conflict countries, an operational framework for institutional reform, suggests \"effective reform efforts might also have to review the functioning of an entire public sector and consider merging, disbanding, or creating public institutions.\" US policing desperately needs institutional reimagining. The country would benefit from considering the UN recommendations to establish a well-staffed, independent commission to conduct a transparent and thorough assessment of the public's needs as well as review the job functions and integrity standards of police officers and policing institutions.

Related Article We Need Police Out of Our Schools-Now Jesse Hagopian But most of all, US federal, state, and local governments must substantially reduce the scope of policing to build up new institutions that foster equal opportunity and real public safety. This approach acknowledges that massive investment in policing systems disrupts the enjoyment of rights and access to everyday needs for communities of color. It acknowledges that there are alternatives to policing when dealing with many societal problems currently under police purview. For many of those now calling for defunding the system, that means shifting money to community-based systems that foster safety. Neighborhood peacekeeper programs, like Ceasefire in Chicago have proven successful in intervening and de-escalating conflict in communities without the use of force, conflict, or other coercion. The vision that underpins many of the calls to defund the police is of a future where everyone can enjoy their human rights regardless of their race, class, or gender identity, where communities have the resources they need to thrive, and where Black death is no longer a recurring viral spectacle. Current Issue View our current issue That vision recognizes that police violence is not bound to the discretion of individual officers but is part of the very structure of policing. To get there, we need to limit the scope of policing and what police are responsible for, as well as to redirect resources from policing to social services , affordable housing, equitable education, community-based health care systems, and local economic development. Police continue to kill people, disproportionately those who identify as Black, Latinx, and Native American. The number of shooting deaths this year is consistent with that of previous years. But abusive policing also shows up in other discriminatory ways, like longer traffic stops, more stops and searches, use of less lethal force, and higher rates of arrests in Black and poor communities. Under international human rights law, victims of serious human rights violations have a right to an effective remedy, which includes reparations for past harm. In the United States, these victims include Black communities that continue to endure systemic discrimination, enforced through policing, including countless instances of excessive and unnecessary use of force and other abuses. Through tragedy and lived experiences, communities of color have identified that more contact with the police increases the chances of being unfairly targeted, brutalized, or killed. So government reparations should be adequate, effective, and prompt, and should ensure that such actions are never again repeated. The struggle for human dignity, freedom, and rights requires a reimagining of public safety and discarding what causes harm and perpetuates inequality. Systemic racialized violence by police contributes to widespread harm, and to repair such harm, we should reevaluate our reliance on this taxpayer-funded institution. Members of Congress are looking to address the historic damage of institutional racism by passing HR 40 , a bill that would require investigation into the impacts of slavery and develop reparations proposals. Federal, state, and local governments can also achieve a reparative goal by redirecting investments from policing to communities, so that we never again have to convert a human life to a hashtag.\n\nSince its inception in the 1800s, policing in the United States has served to maintain the country's racial hierarchy, which deems Black people inferior and disposable.

History Suggests It Will Go Much Further.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Movement for Black Lives says, \"We seek not reform but transformation.\" Here's what that would mean.\n\nA protestor waves an American flag with the words \"Black Lives Matter\" painted on it during a Juneteenth rally at Cadman Plaza on June 19, 2020, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City.\n\nHuge numbers of Americans have been brutalized physically, emotionally, or financially by the coronavirus pandemic. And as the number of diagnosed cases trends ominously up, we have no idea what's next. Everyone with eyes to see knows the path that brought the United States to this dreadful place is a dead end. The question is whether America can change enough to head anywhere else.\n\nThe most promising direction isn't well-known outside of activist circles. In 2016 the Movement for Black Lives, made up of dozens of Black-led organizations, issued a six-part platform called \"A Vision for Black Lives.\" The introduction stated , \"Neither our grievances nor our solutions are limited to the police killing of our people,\" and much of it is devoted to economic issues. This year the MBL also released specific policy demands in response to Covid-19.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members. Join us.

Some who joined a movement because they hoped for comparatively modest reforms will find themselves bumping up against the limits of the current system, and learn from experience that everything has to change or very little will.\n\nAlready BLM has put on the table the concept of a redirection of public money from policing to health care, housing, schools, and jobs. But as of 2017, state and local governments - responsible for the great majority of expenditures on police and corrections - spent just $194 billion on them. This sounds like a lot of money, but it's less than 1 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product, and only one-fifth of the $1 trillion the U.S. spends on Medicare and Medicaid. Even if somehow all of that $194 billion were shifted to different uses, it wouldn't be enough for deep social change.\n\nWhile it's largely been forgotten now - on purpose - the civil rights movement during the 1960s faced a similar reality, and confronted it head-on. Because of this, the movement was never just about ending America's legal caste system; it always had a powerful economic component. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered the \"I Have a Dream\" speech at a 1963 rally that was officially named the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. One common sign at the march was \"Civil Rights Plus Full Employment Equals Freedom.\"\n\nAfter passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, King stated that they were the \"first phase\" of the civil rights movement, and the time had come for a \"second phase\" focused on economic equality. He helped promote a Federal Freedom Budget for All Americans , which called to \"wipe out poverty in a decade\" via universal health care, a government jobs guarantee, and much more.\n\nIn a famous 1967 speech , King was clear about what would be required to get decent lives for African Americans: \"We must honestly face the fact that the movement must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American society. ... The problem of racism, the problem of economic exploitation, and the problem of war are all tied together. These are the triple evils that are interrelated.\" When King was assassinated the next year, he was planning to lead a Poor People's Campaign to Washington, D.C., to get results via direct action.\n\nAmerica then successfully evaded and beat back these questions for 50 years. But they didn't disappear, they stayed right here. Now the coronavirus pandemic has simultaneously demonstrated how high the stakes are, and that all of society's supposedly iron-clad rules can be thrown out at a moment's notice. If there ever were a time when Americans might be ready to rewrite the basic handbook, it's now.\n\nThe MBL is currently revising and expanding all of the Vision for Black Lives platform , but here's where things stand now.\n\nThe first plank is called \"End the War on Black People.\" Among other things, it demands the demilitarization of law enforcement, an end to the death penalty, an end to the war on drugs, and an end to people with criminal histories being excluded from housing, education, and employment.\n\nThe second plank calls for reparations from \"the government, responsible corporations and other institutions that have profited off of the harm they have inflicted on Black people.\" It lists reparations in the form of free public college and a guaranteed minimum income for Black people, and mandated changes to public school curriculums to examine \"the social impacts of colonialism and slavery.\"\n\nThe third plank , \"Invest-Divest,\" demands a reallocation of public money from policing, incarceration, and the national military to, among other things, education, local restorative justice, and universal health care.\n\nThe fourth plank , \"Economic Justice,\" calls for a progressive restructuring of the tax code, federal and state job programs targeted at marginalized Black people, the restoration of the Glass-Steagall Act , and the right for workers in both the public and private sectors to organize unions.\n\nThe fifth plank, \" Community Control ,\" demands local control of law enforcement and schools. It also calls for participatory budgeting , an invention of the Brazilian Workers' Party, in which regular people directly debate how portions of government money are spent.\n\nThe sixth plank, \" Political Power ,\" calls for the release of political prisoners, public financing of elections, and protection of voting rights.\n\nThen there's the MBL's specific platform on Covid-19 policy, filled with so many obvious, lifesaving ideas that it's excruciating to realize none will be executed anytime soon.\n\nInstituting all or even some of these policies would transform the United States. In fact, the MBL platform acknowledges \"we seek not reform but transformation.\" Countries, like people, can sometimes change significantly. It generally happens when their current existence becomes too painful to endure. What we'll find out now is whether America has gotten to that point.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Ta-Nehisi Coates Revisits the Case for Reparations\n\nIt's not often that an article comes along that changes the world, but that's exactly what happened with Ta-Nehisi Coates, five years ago, when he wrote \" The Case for Reparations ,\" in The Atlantic . Reparations have been discussed since the end of the Civil War-in fact, there is a bill about reparations that's been sitting in Congress for thirty years-but now reparations for slavery and legalized discrimination are a subject of major discussion among the Democratic Presidential candidates. In a conversation recorded for The New Yorker Radio Hour, David Remnick spoke with Coates, who this month published \" Conduction ,\" a story in The New Yorker's Fiction Issue. Subjects of the conversation included what forms reparations might take, which Democratic candidates seem most serious about the topic, and how the issue looks in 2019, a political moment very different from when \"The Case for Reparations\" was written.\n\nThis conversation has been edited and condensed.\n\nTa-Nehisi, for those who may not have read the article five years ago, what, exactly, is the case that you make for reparations-which is a word that's been around for a long, long time?\n\nThe case I make for reparations is, virtually every institution with some degree of history in America, be it public, be it private, has a history of extracting wealth and resources out of the African-American community. I think what has often been missing-this is what I was trying to make the point of in 2014-that behind all of that oppression was actually theft. In other words, this is not just mean. This is not just maltreatment. This is the theft of resources out of that community. That theft of resources continued well into the period of, I would make the argument, around the time of the Fair Housing Act.\n\nSo what year is that?\n\nThat's 1968. There are a lot of people who-\n\nBut you're not saying that, between 1968 and 2019, everything is hunky-dory.\n\nI'm not saying everything was hunky-dory at all! But if you were speaking to the most intellectually honest dubious person-because, you have to remember, what I'm battling is this idea that it ended in 1865.\n\nWith emancipation and the end of the war?\n\nWith the emancipation, yes, yes, yes. And the case I'm trying to make is, within the lifetime of a large number of Americans in this country, there was theft.\n\nA lot of your article was about Chicago housing policy. It was a very technical analysis of housing policy. When people talked to me about the article-and I could tell they hadn't read it-\"So, Ta-Nehisi's making a case for\"-no, no, no, I said. First and foremost, it's a dissection of a particular policy that's emblematic of so many other policies.\n\nRight, right. So, out of all of those policies of theft, I had to pick one. And that was really my goal. And the one I picked was housing, was our housing policy. Again, we have this notion that housing as it exists today sort of sprung up from black people coming north, maybe not finding the jobs that they wanted, and thus forming, you know, some sort of pathological culture, and white people, just being concerned citizens, fled to the suburbs. But beneath that was policy! The reason why black people were confined to those neighborhoods in the first place, and white people had access to neighborhoods further away, was because of political decisions. The government underwrote that, through F.H.A. loans, through the G.I. Bill. And that, in turn, caused the devaluing of black neighborhoods, and an inability to access credit, to even improve neighborhoods.\n\nNow, your article starts with someone who lived through these racist policies, a man named Clyde Ross. Tell us the story of Clyde Ross. How did he react to the article?\n\nSo, Mr. Ross was living on the West Side of Chicago.\n\nHe started out in Mississippi.\n\nStarted out in Mississippi, in the nineteen-twenties, born in Mississippi under Jim Crow. His family lost their land, had their land basically stolen from them, had his horse stolen from him. He goes off, fights in World War II, comes back, like a lot of people, says, \"I can't live in Clarksdale[, Mississippi]-I just can't be here. I'm gonna kill somebody or I'm gonna get killed.\" Comes up to Chicago. In Chicago, all of the social conventions of Jim Crow are gone. You don't have to move off the street because somebody white is walking by, doesn't have to take his hat off or look down or anything like that, you know. Gets a job at Campbell's Soup Company, and he wants the, you know, the last emblem of the American Dream-he wants homeownership. Couldn't go to the bank and get a loan like everybody else.\n\nAnd he was making a decent wage.\n\nRead the author's short story in the 2019 Fiction Issue.\n\nMaking a decent wage-enough that he could save some money, enough for a down payment. And obviously he has no knowledge-none of us really did, at that point-of what was actually happening, of why this was. No concept of federal policy, really. And so what he ends up with is basically a contract lender, which is a private lender who says, Hey, you give me the down payment, and you own the house. But what they actually did was they kept the deed for the house. And you had to pay off the house in its entirety in order to get the deed. Although you were effectively a renter, you had all of the lack of privilege that a renter has, and yet all the responsibilities that a buyer has. So, if something goes wrong in the house, you have to pay for that. And so these fees would just pile up on these people, and they would lose their houses, and you don't get your down payment back. Clyde Ross is one of the few people who was able to actually keep his home.\n\nThere's such a moving moment in the piece where he's sitting with you and he admits, \"We were ashamed. We did not want anyone to know that we were that ignorant,\" and felt that his ignorance had extended to his understanding of life in America, in Chicago, which had seemed, to use the phrase of the Great Migration, the Promised Land.\n\nRight, right. And he felt like a sucker. And he felt stupid, just as anybody would. And I don't think he knew, on the level, the extent to which the con actually went. And then living in a community of people-and this was somebody getting a piece-but living in a community of people who were being ripped off. And they couldn't talk about it to each other because they wanted to maintain this sort of façade, or this front, that they owned their homes, not that somebody else actually held the deed. And so for a long time there was a great period of silence about it.\n\nDid Mr. Ross react to your piece?\n\nYeah, he did.\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nHe said reparations will never happen.\n\nSo, in the aftermath of the piece-piece comes out, fifteen thousand words in The Atlantic , tremendous interest in it. You said this about the piece, I think it was in the Washington Post . You said, \"When I wrote 'The Case for Reparations,' my notion wasn't that you could actually get reparations passed, even in my lifetime. My notion was that you could get people to stop laughing.\" What did you mean?\n\nWell, I mean, it was a Dave Chappelle joke , you know? And what the joke was was, if black people got reparations, all the silly, dumb things that they would actually do.\n\nMeaning?\n\nYou know, buy cars, buy rims, fancy clothes, as though other people don't do those things. And once I started researching not just the fact of plunder but actually the history of the reparations fight, which literally goes back to the American Revolution-George Washington, when he dies, in his will, he leaves things to those who were enslaved. It wasn't a foreign notion that if you had stripped people of something you might actually owe them something. It really only became foreign after the Civil War and emancipation. And so this was quite a dignified idea, and actually an idea there was quite a bit of literature on. And the notion that it was somehow funnier, I thought, really, really diminished what was a serious, trenchant, and deeply, deeply perceptive idea.\n\nIf you visited Israel between the fifties and a certain time, you would see Mercedes-Benz taxis all over the country, and you'd wonder. This is not a particularly rich country, at least not yet. This was reparations-this was part of the reparations payment from Germany to Israel in the immediate aftermath of the Holocaust, Second World War. What do reparations look like now?\n\nRight, because they gave them vouchers to buy German goods, right.\n\nWhat's being asked for? The rewriting of textbooks, the public discussion-what? In terms of policy, how do you look at it?\n\nSo first you need the actual crime documented. You need the official imprimatur of the state: they say this actually happened. I just think that's a crucial, crucial first step. And the second reason you have a commission is to figure out how we pay it back. I think it's crucial to tie reparations to specific acts-again, why you need a study. This is not 'I checked black on my census, therefore'-I'll give you an example of this. For instance, we have what I would almost call a pilot, less significant reparations program right now, actually running in Chicago. Jon Burge, who ran this terrible unit of police officers that tortured black people and sent a lot of innocent black people to jail over the course of I think twenty or so years. And then, once he was found out, in Chicago there was a reparations plan put together with victims, [who] were actually given reparations. But, in addition to that, crucial to that, they changed how they taught history. You had to actually teach Jon Burge. You had to actually teach people about what happened. So it wasn't just the money. There was some sort of-I hesitate to say educational, but I guess that's the word we'd use-the educational element to it. And I just think you can't win this argument by trying to hide the ball. Not in the long term. And so I think both of those things are crucial.\n\nAs of this moment, in 2019, there are more than twenty Democratic Presidential candidates running. Eight of them have said they'll support a bill to at least create a commission to study reparations. What do you make of that? Is it symbolic, or is it lip service, or is it just a way to secure the black vote? Or is it something much more serious than all that?\n\nUh, it's probably in some measure all four of those things. It certainly is symbolic. Supporting a commission is not reparations in and of itself. It's certainly lip service, from at least some of the candidates. I'm actually less sure about [this], in terms of the black vote-it may ultimately be true that this is something that folks rally around, but that's never been my sense.\n\nAre there candidates that you take more seriously than others when they talk about reparations?\n\nYeah, I think Elizabeth Warren is probably serious.\n\nIn what way?\n\nI think she means it. I mean-I guess it will break a little news-after \"The Case for Reparations\" came out, she just asked me to come and talk one on one with her about it.\n\nThis is five years ago, when your piece came out in The Atlantic ?\n\nYeah, maybe it was a little later than that, but it was about the time. It was well before she declared anything about running for President.\n\nAnd what was your conversation with Elizabeth Warren like?\n\nShe had read it. She was deeply serious, and she had questions. And it wasn't, like, Will you do X, Y, and Z for me? It wasn't, like, I'm trying to demonstrate I'm serious. I have not heard from her since, either, by the way.\n\nHave you talked to any candidates about it?\n\nNo.\n\nYou published your article five years ago. Barack Obama was President. We are now in a different time and place. How would you place the reparations discussion in this moment?\n\nYeah, I think people have stopped laughing, and that is really, really important. Does it mean reparations tomorrow? No, it doesn't. Does it mean end of the fight? No, it doesn't. But it's a step, and I think that's significant.\n\nNow, what would you like to see the outcome of a conversation, or the American equivalent of a South African study into American history, be?\n\nA policy for repair. I think what you need to do is you need to figure out what the exact axes of white supremacy are, and have been, and find out a policy to repair each of those. In other words, this is not just a mass payment. So take the area that I researched. The time I wrote the article-less every day-the time I wrote the article, there were living victims, and are living victims, who had been denied-\n\nWho were on the South Side and the West Side of Chicago.\n\nYeah! All over this country. People who had been deprived, who had been discriminated against. Set up a claims office. Look at the census tracts. Are those people actually still living there? You know, maybe you can design some sort of investment through resources. Maybe you can have something at the individual level, maybe you can have something at the neighborhood level, and then you would go down the line. You would look at education. You would look at our criminal-justice policy. You would go down the line and address these specifically and directly.\n\nIs your job to just break the glass on a subject, the way you did with reparations, or is it your job to then follow through the way a scholar would for years thereafter?\n\nThat's a great question.\n\nDo you feel your work here is done, and now I'm moving on to the next thing, as you have with any number of subjects? Or do you have to sustain it? Is that on you?\n\nI don't know. I really don't know. I would like to be able to move on. But I recognize that's not entirely up to me.\n\nIt's not.\n\nNo. Not at all. I just feel like, if you write an article on reparations that has the effect that it actually does, which I didn't expect, it's very hard to say. I have to conclude that I clearly have something to say, and a way of saying it, that can affect things. So, if that's the case, what is your responsibility now? What right have you to say, \"I'm done talking about this\"? \"Because I feel like it.\" I don't know that you get to do that. I'm actually, I feel myself to be very, very grounded in the African-American struggle, even though I'm not. I don't consider myself an activist. When I think about writing that article, I think about all the people before me who've been making the case for reparations from street corners-One Twenty-fifth, in Harlem-and couldn't get access to an august publication like that. And I think about how I got access, and it strikes me that you owe folks something. You don't get to just do what you want.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Black Families Seeking Reparations in California's Gold Country\n\nDuring the final years of the Great Depression, officials in California set out to build a state park to commemorate the centennial of the discovery of gold in 1848, an event that set off the largest mass migration in U.S. history and transformed the American West. They offered to buy plots of land from a dozen local families and businesses in Coloma, in the Sacramento Valley; this was where John Marshall, nearly a hundred years earlier, had famously found gold. He discovered the precious metal in rocks near a sawmill he was building for John Sutter-a Swiss German businessman and early settler of California-on the banks of the American River. Hundreds of thousands of people from around the world swarmed the Pacific Coast to mine for gold, sparking a vast economic boom.\n\nOne of the local landowners was Pearley Monroe, who worked as a janitor in California's State Capitol building, about fifty miles away. In the late nineteen-thirties, state officials offered Monroe twenty-five hundred dollars for \"the place of shifting gravel and flowing water where Sutter's Mill once stood,\" as a local paper put it. By the nineteen-thirties, Coloma had become a faded, rural town, with few economic prospects.\n\nA Black descendant of enslaved Americans brought to California during the gold rush, Monroe was proud of the family's land holdings. He declined the offer, hoping for a higher price. Monroe's grandparents had eventually settled as free citizens in Coloma, where they raised kids and fruit orchards and became prominent, suit-wearing members of the community. Monroe inherited his part of the Sutter's Mill property and bought the rest \"on speculation,\" according to a news report.\n\nAfter the state made its offer, Monroe, who had also spurned offers from gold-dredging companies and a local historical group, set his price at ten thousand dollars. By 1941, he had become known in the papers for his stubbornness. \"I would rather see the land turned into a park and swimming pool for my people,\" he told the Los Angeles Times . That same year, California's attorney general, Earl Warren-who would later become a famed Supreme Court Chief Justice-moved to condemn the property owned by Monroe and other local families under eminent domain. In 1942, a county judge fixed the government's price for Monroe's land at just over three thousand dollars, and forced him to sell.\n\nOfficials compelled a dozen or so other local families to sell their holdings as well, and established the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, just in time for the centennial, in 1948. The property seizures affected some Asian and white families. But two large Black families descended from enslaved people, the Burgesses and Monroes, lost significant amounts of land. Today, their relatives are demanding restitution from the California Reparations Task Force, which was established by Governor Gavin Newsom , in 2020, after the murder of George Floyd , to study racial injustice. On May 6th, the task force voted to formally recommend a large set of proposals to the California state legislature-which will soon have to make a decision regarding reparations.\n\nJonathan Burgess, a fire-battalion chief from Sacramento and a descendant of the Burgess family, has become a well-known advocate for reparations. He and Dawn Basciano, whose great-grandmother was Pearley Monroe's wife, showed me around the state park one afternoon last fall. They contend that their families were underpaid in the forced sales, and that more land has been lost through faulty record-keeping-and they want more recognition of the gold rush's rich, and largely ignored, Black history. \" Our history,\" Burgess said. \"I like to say 'our' history because we're all Americans.\"\n\nBurgess and Basciano described the arrival of their ancestors in California as they led me through the park's green lawns and reconstructed workers' shacks. According to family lore and historical records, which often ignored or omitted Black Americans, one of Burgess's forebears-Rufus Burgess-was brought to the Coloma area in 1850 as an enslaved person, probably with an owner who travelled by ship from New Orleans to San Francisco.\n\nEither way, those two years of slavery for Rufus Burgess were illegal, because, in 1850, California established itself as a free state. The gold rush, though, continued to draw plenty of fortune-seeking slaveowners who brought enslaved people with them to the rivers and mountains around Sacramento. Law enforcement was slack. \"Hundreds arrived before the state's constitutional ban on slavery went into effect in 1850, but many others came after,\" the historian Kevin Waite, author of \" West of Slavery ,\" has written. \"California . . . was a free state in name only.\"\n\nOnce freed, Rufus worked on local farms as a homesteader and started a successful blacksmith's shop on the site of what's now the Coloma Lotus Community Center. By the eighteen-seventies, he had purchased property of his own. He built a family home and was granted a deed to the African Church of Coloma. After the El Dorado County seat moved, in 1857, from Coloma to Placerville, about nine miles away, and took some white families with it, the town's nonwhite population grew steadily more powerful. \"The town was left to the Negroes and the Chinese,\" Jonathan Burgess told me. (Some Coloma residents dispute this claim, noting that several white families also remained in town.)\n\nWhen we arrived at a spot in the park where state officials had built a wooden replica of Sutter's Mill, Burgess seemed unimpressed. \"So this is the sawmill,\" he said, in a flat voice. \"There's a picture of my Uncle Marion down there,\" Burgess added, motioning into the distance. \"They credit my Uncle Marion, working with the Gallaghers and some other prominent families, and they said he dug his shovel down and hit the foundation of the sawmill. It's a great story, right?\"\n\nBurgess doesn't believe it. He doubts many of the state's official gold-rush accounts, including the traditional location of Sutter's Mill. Citing the curve of the river and the strength of the current, he believes the mill stood about two hundred yards upriver from where state officials say, behind the community hall on the site of Rufus Burgess, Sr.,'s blacksmith shop. If that was where Sutter's Mill was really situated-instead of the long-recognized spot on Pearley Monroe's old land-it would strengthen Burgess's claim that his family owned far more property in the eighteen-hundreds than the ten acres that the state claims they did.\n\nBut state officials backed up their assessment of the mill's location. Standing by California's replica of Sutter's Mill, Steve Hilton, a cultural-resources supervisor at the state park, later told me the official location is correct. He also showed me a nearby spot in the American River where, he said, a few timbers of the old mill sometimes resurface.\n\nOne reason for the confusing historical record is that California was a northern province of Mexico when Marshall found gold in 1848. Days after Marshall's find, the United States and Mexico signed a treaty that ended President James Polk's expansionist war with Mexico, and that granted a huge swath of territory, including California and much of the American West, to the United States. Soon after, the gold rush started in earnest. Prospectors dismantled Sutter's sawmill for scrap lumber. Marshall, despite his discovery, was out of a job. And the village of Coloma became a wild and dangerous frontier town, full of claim lawyers, gamblers, saloon owners, and other threats to a lucky miner's wealth.\n\nJonathan Burgess has written a children's book about the land controversies in Coloma that contains his corrections to the official state history, as well as what he admits are his own fictionalizations about Rufus. He and the state agree that the Burgess and Monroe families cultivated orchards on the riverside land in the late nineteenth century, but he feels the two Black families were shortchanged out of more than just their property when the state forcibly seized their land. \"If there's gold in the hills,\" Burgess said, \"there was gold beneath the orchards.\"\n\nThe Sacramento Bee , he pointed out, reported that several plots of land along the river were being sifted for gold by private dredging boats in the nineteen-thirties and forties. President Roosevelt had raised the price of gold to thirty-five dollars per ounce, up from about twenty. As a result, extracting small amounts of gold from rocks in the American River in Coloma was newly profitable. \"The General Dredging Co. is handling about 4800 cubic yards of material daily,\" reported the Los Angeles Times , in the summer of 1941. \"One dredge is working close to the lines of the Pearley Monroe property, where Marshall found gold in Sutter's millrace. The management of the company states that the historic site will not be disturbed.\"\n\nA local paper also noted that a dredging company had been trying to negotiate with Monroe to purchase his land when state officials began the process of seizing it through eminent domain. Burgess believes that timing was no coincidence, telling me, \"When Pearley refused to allow the dredgers to come and dredge, to get the remaining gold, eminent-domain proceedings happened shortly thereafter.\"\n\nFinally, Burgess cites an aerial photo from the late forties showing most of the plots around Pearley Monroe's land whitened by vast dredging trails. The photo, Burgess argues, proves that, five years after state officials forced Monroe to sell his land, boats had dredged both sides of the American River for gold tailings. He argues that the plots of land would be a source of generational wealth for his family if the state had not seized them.\n\nThe record-like everything else in this story-is complicated. Burgess has paperwork showing ownership dating back to some of Rufus's holdings in the eighteen-seventies. State records, though, show that the Burgess family possessed only ten acres of land in 1879. Burgess says those state documents are incomplete, citing fires that burned old census and property records. He finds it suspicious that the town's original 1873 property map, for example, has gone missing.\n\nToday, Jonathan Burgess and his twin brother Matthew spend most of their time in Sacramento, where they grew up. Both are media-savvy public figures: Matthew is an officer with the California Highway Patrol who ran for state senate, briefly, in 2022. The brothers used to own a food truck called Burgess Brothers Barbecue, and they've appeared on the Home Shopping Network to sell their B.B.Q. sauces and cornbread mix. In some ways, they are an American success story, but they also describe a deep sense of loss.\n\nJonathan and Matthew both remember driving down to Coloma on family trips and hearing about their ancestors and the land around Sutter's Mill. They also remember that, when they were kids-in the nineteen-seventies and eighties-there was a distinct lack of acknowledgment in the state park that Black families had existed, never mind thrived, in Coloma. Now several signs in the park show where the Monroes, Burgesses, and Gooches-another family descended from enslaved people-owned houses and land, most of which is now park property. Jonathan wants the unoccupied portion of his family's holdings back and turns up at every Reparations Task Force meeting in Sacramento.\n\nStories like the Burgess family's have received significantly more political and media attention since Governor Newsom created the Reparations Task Force three years ago. Reparations could mean anything from subsidized mortgages and tuition credits to direct payments to the descendants of enslaved people. Steven Bradford, a state senator who sits on the task force, and who is Black, told me that eminent domain has been used as a blunt tool for changing the racial makeup of neighborhoods throughout California's history. \"It's very few examples in the last hundred years where a park, a freeway, a road, or anything went through a white neighborhood,\" he said.\n\nThe Burgess brothers and Basciano have also been encouraged by the precedent-setting case of Bruce's Beach , in the city of Manhattan Beach, in which a clearly racist act of eminent domain was reversed two years ago by the County of Los Angeles and Governor Newsom. There, a Black family running a resort in the nineteen-twenties had its land and business ripped away by the white city officials, in a clear effort to change the racial makeup of the town.\n\nThe Coloma case is less straightforward. The Burgesses cannot produce a continuous paper trail connecting Jonathan's claim of massive Burgess landholdings in the eighteen-seventies to the nineteen-forties, when the eminent-domain proceedings began. \"Right now, there's no paperwork that has come up to show that we had more [land],\" Jonathan Burgess admitted. \"That is one-hundred-per-cent correct.\" Some of the dredged land in the aerial picture was owned by the Gallaghers, a local Irish American family. It's not obvious from the photo whether Pearley Monroe's land was dredged, and, given the limited historical record, it will be difficult to prove in court that dredging was the secret motive behind the state's eminent-domain land seizures.\n\nStill, Burgess has more old deeds than Black families tend to possess in California and across America. Burgess and Basciano can show direct lineage to people who should not have been enslaved in the first years of California's statehood, which means they should be eligible for general reparations under the task-force guidelines. But Burgess argues that he can also show proof of specific economic injustices. He believes the Monroes and Burgesses have enough deeds and other records to win direct restitution for property-similar to what was granted in the Manhattan Beach case. This outcome would entail a transfer of land from the park back to the families, or monetary compensation.\n\nThe Burgess case shows the immensity of the task facing California's state legislature. Should there be a minimum reparations payment to each Black family in California? Should some Black families in the state receive more than others? How long must a Black family have lived in California to be eligible?\n\nA recent, nonbinding report by state economists estimated it would cost eight hundred billion dollars-more than twice the state's current annual budget-to compensate Black residents \"for generations of over-policing, disproportionate incarceration and housing discrimination.\" But Steve Bradford, the state senator, said the focus should remain on the descendants of enslaved people. \"To conflate it with anyone else is not addressing the whole purpose of reparations,\" he told me. \"This was [for] folks who have direct lineage to chattel slavery here in the United States, brought to California, or folks who have been in California prior to 1900.\"\n\nThe task force will sift through all the paperwork and send a detailed report to the governor's office by July 1st. \"It's challenging,\" Bradford said. \"But we're making progress.\" Burgess, meanwhile, has warned that he might sue for direct return of the land, but hopes he won't have to do so. \"There's no reason to take a battle to court,\" he said. \"We know, unfortunately, our country's history, and California's history, which did not work towards the advantage of pioneer descendants of slaves.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "What We Talk About When We Talk About Reparations\n\nA century and a half ago, after the start of the Civil War, the federal government took up the question of reparations for slavery. The matter had been under discussion for years, both in the corridors of power and in the abolitionist movement, but it was only in 1862-with Congress dominated by Republicans after most Democratic members had joined the Confederacy-that it was possible to pass the Compensated Emancipation Act. It was the sole instance in which slavery reparations were authorized-and it compensated slaveholders in Washington, D.C., for the cost of emancipating their human chattel. The enslaved-the cornerstone of the South's economy, the collateral that allowed Northern lenders to profit from the cotton trade, the involuntary producers of the raw material around which the textile industry was built-were given nothing but a deeply compromised facsimile of freedom.\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates's magisterial essay in this month's Atlantic has reintroduced the subject of reparations. But it would be a mistake to assume that it ever completely disappeared between that earlier episode, when the federal government disbursed funds to whites to offset the inconvenience of democracy, and our present moment, in which white families earn on average two dollars for every dollar earned by black ones. Coates's sixteen-thousand-word story is a tour through the economic consequences of discrimination, which have compounded, over decades, into a kind of racial windfall for white Americans-so securely possessed that it is all but invisible, and incapable of being revoked by anything short of a massive redistributive program.\n\nDuring an interview earlier this week at Buzzfeed, Shani Hilton asked Coates why he thought the essay had attracted so much attention-it set new records for traffic at the Atlantic's Web site. Coates basically shrugged, and tossed the question to the audience. (\"Because you wrote the hell out of it,\" came one response.) But it is not a coincidence that this piece has resonated at this particular point in our history. As we near the end of the Obama administration, it has become possible to estimate the yield of the first black Presidency-and the dividends are far smaller than many had hoped.\n\nConsider the fact that when the President unveiled his My Brother's Keeper initiative, designed to help \"young men and boys of color facing tough odds reach their full potential,\" he took pains to explain that its funding would come entirely from private sources. It's not an indictment of Obama to observe that philanthropy, in this context, is effectively the opposite of reparations: it's money given voluntarily for social betterment, not issued as recompense for a wrong. But it does say a great deal about the moment he inhabits, defined in part by the ersatz sincerity of our repeated calls to \"move beyond race,\" even as the President is dogged by ludicrous charges that his health-care reform was an attempt at stealth reparations.\n\nEven in early 2008, at that heady moment when the thought of a black President became a real possibility, there was a cynical murmur among African-Americans that Obama's election-like so many other examples of putative racial progress-would be widely understood as a kind of gift to black people. Jonathan Chait, of New York , betrayed that tendency earlier this spring, in the midst of a heated debate with Coates on the subject of black pathology. Chait argued, from on high:\n\nIt is hard to explain how the United States has progressed from chattel slavery to emancipation to the end of lynching to the end of legal segregation to electing an African-American president if America has \"rarely\" been the ally of African-Americans and \"often\" its nemesis. It is one thing to notice the persistence of racism, quite another to interpret the history of black America as mainly one of continuity rather than mainly one of progress.\n\nThis kind of rhetoric is akin to an abusive husband who cites the number of times he stopped beating his wife as a testament to his own high character. The tendency, in selective recollections of history, is to choose the version that looks most like an alibi-and it is for this reason that the conversation Coates has restarted is not really about reparations. It is, more fundamentally, about acknowledging the bastard history that would warrant reparations in the first place.\n\nThe unspoken divide between black people and white people-whether over reparations, affirmative action, or the question of paying N.C.A.A. athletes-comes down to a question of history. In one version, that history appears as an incremental movement toward equality after a long night of discrimination; in the other, history looks like a balance sheet, and the cumulative debits of sanctioned theft, enforced poverty, and scant opportunity far outweigh the inconsistent credits of good will. Few whites recall, for instance, that General William Sherman, during his March to the Sea, issued orders mandating the redistribution of land seized from Confederates, in forty-acre parcels, to newly emancipated black families. But within black America, that fact-and the fact that the orders were revoked following Lincoln's assassination-is common knowledge, recalled with the bitterness of an outstanding debt.\n\nAbsent an understanding of this past, it's possible-even entirely reasonable-to conclude that affirmative action represents a full recompense for the social engineering that produced a disproportionately black underclass in the United States. To the extent that the history remains obscured, the narrative looks like a lineage of failed handouts to a feckless and troublesome population, never quite capable of pulling themselves up, and mired in their own self-defeating ways. These deletions in our own history deliver various national oddities, like an overwhelmingly white Tea Party movement that is fixated on government encroachment on liberty and yet has almost no regard for the concerns of African-Americans, whose history is defined by the government-sanctioned theft of their freedom.\n\nCongressional Republicans were certainly satisfied with themselves after passing the 1862 Emancipation Act: they had leveraged the power of government to end the scourge of slavery, and achieved it so cleverly that the phantom hope for compensation might entice slaveholding states to remain within the Union. Lincoln's reputation as the greatest American President has much to do with his eloquence, fortitude, and foresight-but a portion of the esteem for him is derived from the fact that his Emancipation Proclamation enabled generations of Americans to focus on that singular act of ending slavery, not the two and half centuries in which this government and the colonies that preceded it had allowed human bondage to persist. Michele Bachmann's statement that the founders \"worked tirelessly\" to end slavery was only factually wrong; emotionally it was a perfect rendering of the past to which most Americans-even those who know otherwise-subscribe out of emotional necessity.\n\nBarack Obama is also a tall and thin attorney who served in the Illinois legislature, but this isn't the only reason he can't escape a comparison with Lincoln. There is, in his two terms, a similar volume of work left undone, despite the apparent racial hallmarks of his Presidency. From the vantage point of 2014, history was seemingly lying in wait for Obama from the moment he was sworn in. The pattern established by emancipation-in which black progress was valued chiefly in proportion to its ability to assuage white unease, in which self-congratulation became a national motif-remains with us.\n\nThe battles of the civil-rights movement were enormously contentious and divisive until they began to achieve victories; at that point, they became a useful means of allowing the country to forget its complicity in the state of affairs that had made the movement necessary in the first place. We know, or ought to know, how this story invariably ends. It's worth recalling that Lincoln, in his initial draft of the Emancipation Proclamation, sought the repatriation of the freed slaves-thus rewarding black people who had helped save the Union with exile, while granting continued residence to the Confederates who tried to overthrow the government. In 2005, the United States Senate offered an apology for the decades during which it did nothing to halt the tide of lynchings that claimed the lives of nearly thirty-four hundred black people between 1880 and 1920. Yet that apology-which was tied directly to government inaction that facilitated terrorism directed at a subject population-was not accompanied by any order for compensation to the descendants of those victims. Once again, the point was not contrition, merely the appearance of it.\n\nWe are discussing reparations at this moment because in two years Barack Obama will leave the White House, having repaired the economic collapse that greeted his inauguration, but with African-Americans still unemployed at a rate twice that of whites, and struggling to see how this world differs from the status quo ante. Those who saw Obama's election as redemption for slavery were off by fourteen decades: his election was supposed to expiate sins much closer to the surface, and therefore far more difficult, and far too expensive, to confront.\n\nThe point of Coates's essay-and, ultimately, the point of this conversation, despite the political impossibility of enacting reparations-is a broader understanding of black poverty as the product of public policy and private theft facilitated by racism. The belief that blacks have been given too much is made possible by the refusal to countenance how much was actually taken away in the first place.\n\nPhotograph by Christopher Anderson/Magnum.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "California's Novel Attempt at Land Reparations\n\nMore than a hundred years ago, on a stretch of California coast now reminiscent of \"Baywatch,\" a young Black couple named Charles and Willa Bruce bought the first of two adjacent plots of beachfront property next to some barren dunes in Manhattan Beach, in Los Angeles County. The price was twelve hundred and twenty-five dollars. \"Beach culture\" didn't yet exist, and most Americans had no desire to live by the shore. The city was about an hour away from Los Angeles on surface roads, though a light-rail corridor had recently opened, to make the trip a little easier.\n\nOnly one other beach in L.A. County welcomed African-Americans at the time-Santa Monica had a segregated patch of sand called the Inkwell-and Black families drove for hours from around Southern California to sunbathe and swim at the Bruces' property. The Bruces built an overnight lodge and eventually developed a thriving resort. \"There was a restaurant on the bottom floor, a dance hall on the top floor. They had a bathhouse next door, then they had a novelty shop . . . and at the bathhouse they rented bathing suits,\" Duane Yellow Feather Shepard, a descendant of the Bruces who is also a clan chief of the Pocasset Wampanoag Nation, told me. Standing at the top of a sloping grass park, on a recent weekday morning, he pointed out locations to me. \"Down there on the lifeguard property,\" he said, gesturing toward a county-lifeguard headquarters, built in 1967, \"that's where our resort was, right on the Strand.\"\n\nA handful of Black homeowners built cottages on neighboring plots, and a community grew throughout the nineteen-tens and early twenties. Over time, Californians figured out that the seaside was a nice place to live. White residents in Manhattan Beach objected to summer and weekend crowds near Bruce's Lodge, as the Bruces' property came to be known, and there was talk of a \"Negro invasion.\" On a stretch of land owned by George Peck, a city founder and real-estate developer, unexplained \"No Trespassing\" signs appeared, which blocked patrons of Bruce's Lodge from walking directly down to the beach. \"They were fake 'No Trespassing' signs,\" Shepard said. \"They weren't authorized by the city. George Peck put those up there.\"\n\nIn 1920, a white real-estate broker named George Lindsey moved to Manhattan Beach and set up an office on the north end of town, near Bruce's Beach. The following year, he asked the city's board of trustees to \"take measures to discourage colored people from establishing homes\" in the area. At first, the board resisted, for fear of looking racist. But, in 1923, Lindsey circulated a petition that called for the city to condemn a rectangle of plots that encompassed Bruce's Lodge-and most Black homes in Manhattan Beach-for the sake of a public park. (Some plots owned by white families were included in the proposal, but they were undeveloped.)\n\nMeanwhile, the Bruces and other Black residents came under violent attack. Tires were deflated, a house was burned; someone lit a cross on a hill above a Black family's home. A suspected Ku Klux Klan member even tried to burn the Bruces' resort. Bob Brigham, a student at Fresno State College in the nineteen-fifties, wrote his graduate thesis on this persecution, and interviewed a member of the board of trustees from the era who remembered an arson attempt. This man \"recounted a night in the early 1920s when he followed a siren to Bruce's Lodge where someone (supposedly a Klansman) had set fire to a mattress under the main building,\" Brigham wrote. \"This produced lots of smoke, but the only fire was in the eyes of Mrs. Bruce as she greeted the white spectators.\"\n\nIn 1924, Manhattan Beach's board of trustees backed Lindsey's proposal and asked L.A. County to condemn the plots owned by the Bruces and other families. The city also passed an ordinance to acquire the rectangle of land through eminent domain, a rarely used legal power that allows governments to seize private property for public use. The Bruces and other Black landowners tried to block the condemnation through legal means, but the effort failed, and the Bruces eventually demanded seventy thousand dollars for their land and business, plus fifty thousand dollars in damages. The larger proceedings dragged on for years, but by 1927 all landowners in the rectangle were forced to sell and vacate their properties.\n\nThe buildings were razed. Charles and Willa Bruce eventually got fourteen thousand and five hundred dollars for their once thriving resort. They moved to what's now South Los Angeles, where they took jobs cooking in someone else's restaurant. \"They died within seven years,\" Shepard said. \"Willa was gone in seven years, from the stress-she had just lost her mind. And then, one year later, Charles Bruce passed away.\"\n\nFor decades, the expulsion of Black families from Manhattan Beach was largely ignored. The first significant effort to investigate it was Brigham's graduate thesis, in 1956. In the nineteen-eighties, Brigham taught me to drive a car at Mira Costa High School, in Manhattan Beach. He was also a history teacher, a typing teacher, and a wrestling coach, among other roles at the school and around town. He used to make sure that the Bruces' story landed in a local paper every now and then-which is how I learned about it, as a teen-ager. I talked to him about Bruce's Beach several years ago, as an adult, and used some of the material in a piece of historical fiction . He died in 2019, at the age of ninety-one, but colleagues and students remember him as a cheerful, shuffling, bifocal-wearing character with a knack for asking thorny questions. \"He was a strong advocate for many progressive issues, but an advocate whose gentle tone was much more effective than the polarizing rhetoric we commonly hear today,\" Dave Holland, a retired English teacher and running coach at Mira Costa, said.\n\nBrigham noticed the first hint of the Bruces' story when he moved to Manhattan Beach, as a boy, in 1939. He remembered passing the rectangle of appropriated land, which was strewn with trash. \"He told me about that, you know, him riding the bus with his mom, on Highland Avenue, past the site,\" Mitch Ward, the city's first and so far only Black mayor, who later worked to publicize the Bruces' story, said. \"And he would say, 'Mom, how come there's so many weeds down there? It's all overgrown. Why is it vacant?' And his mom told him, 'Sh-h-h, we don't talk about that. We just don't talk about that kind of stuff here in Manhattan Beach.' \"\n\nBut, for years, Brigham kept asking questions about the land. When he began interviewing local residents as a graduate student, city officials finally built a public park there-three decades after condemning the buildings it used to hold-perhaps out of fear that Bruce relatives might find ground in Brigham's thesis for a lawsuit. The land was graded and planted in 1956. First, it was called City Park, but in the nineteen-sixties it became Bayview Terrace Park, and then, in 1974, Parque Culiacán, to mark a sister-city relationship with Culiacán, Mexico.\n\nBrigham, though, wanted the name to reflect the park's history. He found an ally in Ward, who'd grown up in Arkansas before eventually moving to California. \"My office used to be on South Sepulveda, right behind Bob's home. Bob would ride his bicycle up and prop his bicycle outside my office and come in, and I would think, Here's Bob, you know,\" Ward recalled. \"He was soft-spoken, but he would be communicating things. I don't know how we started talking about Bruce's Beach.\" Ward had heard about Brigham's thesis in the nineteen-nineties, before meeting Brigham. \"I was like a sponge, trying to soak up Manhattan Beach's history.\"\n\nWard became mayor in 2006, after three years on the city council. During a push to rename the park, Ward met a surprising amount of resistance. \"We learned things about Bruce's Beach that people just didn't wanna hear,\" he said. \"So it was extremely difficult on the council to get it passed.\" The sister-city relationship had lapsed in 1989, but some opponents to the proposal argued that Culiacán, Mexico, might find the name change \"disrespectful.\"\n\nWard prevailed narrowly. A concrete monument with \"Bruce's Beach Park\" engraved on it was installed on the grass in 2007, along with a plaque, written by a civic group, that distorted the area's history and soft-pedalled the city's racism. \"In 1912, Mr. George Peck, one of our community's co-founders, made it possible for the beach area below this site to be developed as Bruce's Beach, the only beach resort in Los Angeles County for all people.\" Shepard and other activists have objected that Peck participated in the effort to eject the Bruces, even if he didn't stop them from buying the land in 1912.\n\nWard told me that Peck's descendants had allies on the city council. \"You had to give some people something in order for us to get that [winning vote of] 3-2,\" he said. \"To me, it was not about the words on the plaque. It was about the name and the recognition of the family. So the argument [now] about the plaque, I think that's a step forward.\"\n\nThe murder of George Floyd last year sparked a renewed push for the city to acknowledge its crimes against the Bruce family. A community organizer named Kavon Ward, who is not related to Mitch Ward, held a picnic and sit-in at the park. Her group, Justice for Bruce's Beach, demanded a return of the land to the Bruce family, and also reparations from the city for decades of lost income from the lodge. The appropriated land is a seven-thousand-square-foot slice of open seaside property now valued at about seventy-five million dollars. The city council created a task force to look into the history of the land, but ultimately decided against paying reparations to the Bruces' descendants for lost income on the family business. It acknowledged and condemned what had happened but refused to draft a formal apology, which carried an extra legal risk, according to sources within the mayor's office.\n\nSuzanne Hadley, the current mayor, has argued that the past, horrible as it might have been, is past, and that cash reparations would amount to an \"illegal gift of public funds.\" (With the current city council, Mitch Ward told me, the effort to change the park's name would be \"destined to fail.\") However, the city did offer three hundred and fifty thousand dollars for an art exhibit about the Bruces, and also called for a new, reworded plaque at the park. \"I know the city is only putting in three hundred and fifty thousand dollars for an art exhibit that no one asked for-the family doesn't want that,\" Kavon Ward said. \"I just find it pretty ironic that they would put money into an art exhibit but don't want to pay the family restitution.\"\n\nBut the city doesn't have the last word. Title to the property shifted in the nineteen-fifties from Manhattan Beach to the state of California, and in the nineties to Los Angeles County. The lifeguard station-run by the county-is still the only structure on the rectangle. A county supervisor, Janice Hahn, set out to return the property. She and the state senator Steven Bradford have now teamed up to release the land from certain restrictions to offer it to the Bruces' descendants. The proposal passed the county board of supervisors in April, and has no serious opposition at the state level. \"I hope it'll happen in a couple of months,\" Hahn told me, though passing both chambers of the California legislature may take until the end of 2021. The Bruces' descendants plan to lease it back to the county at market value, at least for now. \"The county will be the first in the nation to do this, so we feel like we can be a model,\" Hahn said.\n\nNo other government body in the U.S. has returned so much land to an African-American group. The federal government's initial and now infamous promise after the Civil War-\"forty acres and a mule\" to freed Black slaves in the South-was rescinded by President Andrew Johnson. \"We've had a long history of America taking land from African-Americans, but I don't know of any situation where they've given land back,\" Bradford told me. \"I think this is very much an unprecedented moment in America to show what government can do, if they're committed to doing the right thing.\"\n\nThe crude and illegal methods that Manhattan Beach officials used against the Bruces a century ago make it easier for government officials to act today. Using the ruse of creating a public park to evict the Bruces and other Black families resulted in a piece of largely vacant land-which, in turn, has allowed for a simple, almost elegant solution. As a model for other communities, though, it has limits. \"Here's the thing,\" Bradford said. \"Land was taken here under a false guise of building a park. It was just to displace African-Americans.\" He added that a municipality using eminent domain for \"a government need,\" such as a highway, was a different story, whether or not the displacement of those living there was fair. In the case of Bruce's Beach, the lack of need was proven by the city's own behavior. \"There was no need for a park here,\" he said.\n\nMitch Ward, the former mayor, agrees: \"It's a debt that Manhattan Beach owes to the Bruce family.\" He also thinks that Brigham would be pleasantly surprised by the transfer. A big historic result, emanating from his mild-mannered graduate thesis in 1956? \"I think Bob would be tickled pink,\" Ward said.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Letters from Our Readers\n\nParul Sehgal, in her review of Ta-Nehisi Coates's \"The Message,\" writes about how, in his 2014 essay \"The Case for Reparations,\" which argued for restitution to the descendants of enslaved Black Americans, \"Coates invoked German reparations to Israel after the Holocaust as a model. . . . He now acknowledges that they allowed Zionists to displace some seven hundred thousand Palestinians, forbidding them to return to their land and property\" ( Books , October 21st). I wish that Sehgal had investigated Coates's assertion more thoroughly before repeating it.\n\nThe Reparations Agreement between Israel and the Federal Republic of Germany was signed in September, 1952, and took effect in March, 1953, some five years after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and its displacement of Palestinians. Israel's initial claim against Germany, in 1951, was for $1.5 billion, the estimated cost of resettling half a million Holocaust refugees; the ultimate agreement was for some seven hundred million dollars, which was paid to Israel over the next fourteen years. By implying that there is a direct connection between German reparations to Israel and the displacement of Palestinians, Sehgal and Coates create a causality that ill serves both Palestinians and Holocaust victims.\n\nGeoff Kronik Brookline, Mass.\n\nAs one of very few women who handle literary archives in the book trade, I read Tad Friend's recent Profile of the book dealer Glenn Horowitz with dismay (\" Pivotal, Seminal, Rare ,\" October 28th). I wish that Friend had looked beyond Horowitz's gilded Hamptons doors; instead, by centering Horowitz's behavior as a paradigm in the rare-books field, the article obscures the concerted efforts of other dealers and collectors to create a culture of access and use around literary papers.\n\nHorowitz's practices, as described by Friend, are typical of a small cohort of quick-tongued, fast-fingered dealers who operate at the expense of their clients and are aging out of the trade. More than ever, literary papers can be a site of meaning-making for writers, dealers, buyers, curators, and librarians; a new generation of dealers and curators values less established writers as much as Pulitzer Prize winners, expresses a feminist ethos of book collecting, and champions collaboration over coercion in negotiations. We don't create fictitious prices, and we pay our clients and colleagues in a timely, ethical manner. Literary papers offer us the gift of understanding process over product, and relationships over individuality. Shouldn't archive placements happen in a similarly honest and expansive spirit?\n\nMary Catherine Kinniburgh Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nFriend's article could have focussed more on Horowitz's service to scholarship, something I experienced as the literary executor of the W. H. Auden estate. Whenever someone who had inherited an Auden manuscript insisted on holding on to it privately, preventing me from including it in the complete edition of Auden's work, I asked Horowitz to acquire it from the owner. Armed with a sheaf of hundred-dollar bills, he succeeded in every case, and the manuscript quickly went to the New York Public Library. One such manuscript was an unknown play that Auden had written, to be performed at a friend's birthday party. Only Horowitz's skill and tenacity made it available to the public.\n\nEdward Mendelson New York City\n\n•\n\nLetters should be sent with the writer's name, address, and daytime phone number via e-mail to themail@newyorker.com .

He told David Remnick that he had a more modest goal. \"My notion,\" Coates says, \"was you could get people to stop laughing.\" For Coates, to treat reparations as a punch line is to misunderstand their purpose. He argues that reparations weren't only meant to atone for the horror of chattel slavery but to address racial inequities and the economic impact that has persisted since emancipation, more than a century ago. \"The case I'm trying to make is, within the lifetime of a large number of Americans in this country, there was theft.\"\n\n\"The Case for Reparations\" was an intellectual sensation, and Coates did change the conversation; of the more than twenty candidates in the 2020 Democratic Presidential race, eight have said they're in favor of at least establishing a commission to study the subject. He points to Senator Elizabeth Warren, who sought out Coates to discuss his article years before she was considered a candidate. But Coates's own hopes for America truly making amends remain modest. \"It may be true that this is something folks rally around,\" he says, \"but that's never been my sense.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "A Reparations Movement Begat at Georgetown\n\nMélisande Short-Colomb knows her begats. Three years ago, she received a Facebook message from a genealogist, asking if she was related to the Mahoney family of Baton Rouge. Like a Biblical scholar ticking off Old Testament lineage, she typed out a list of her forebears-enslaved and free-going back seven generations. The genealogist had struck gold. For months, she'd been searching for descendants of the roughly three hundred slaves who had been sold by the Maryland Jesuits who owned Georgetown College, in 1838, for a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars, to save the school from bankruptcy. With the help of Short-Colomb and her begats, more than eight thousand descendants of these slaves were located. Now Georgetown University is trying to make it up to them. Last month, the student body voted to pay reparations to the heirs.\n\nShort-Colomb, who is sixty-five, with gray hair, is a rising junior at Georgetown. \"I'm not just one of the oldest students here and one of the few African-Americans,\" she said the other day. \"I'm also part of the reconciliation program.\" In 2016, the university began offering legacy status-a preference for admission, not a scholarship-to descendants of slaves owned by the Maryland Jesuits. One descendant has graduated, two are in graduate school, and three-including Short-Colomb-are undergraduates. \"I'm here to help the Jesuits atone for their sins,\" she said, smiling.\n\nShort-Colomb was hanging out in her dorm, Copley Hall. Her room, which she calls her \"tiny condo,\" has a single bed, a large bathroom with grab rails, and a desk piled with papers, books, and a few crystals. She's comfortable now, after what she calls the \"trauma\" of her first semester. \"I was overwhelmed by everything that the young white students seemed to take in stride, if not for granted,\" she said. \"The kids all had the same look-leggings, puffy jackets, athletic shoes, and ponytails.\" Short-Colomb, who had worked as a chef for twenty-two years, was used to wearing a uniform. \"I didn't know how to dress for college,\" she said. \"I looked strange walking around in my blue suède pumps.\" That day, she had on a sweatshirt, sandals, and ripped, wide-legged jeans.\n\nLast year, her window looked out on the school's Jesuit cemetery. She would sometimes end her day watching the sun set over it. \"I took a perverse pleasure in having survived the struggle of my ancestors,\" she said. \"I looked out at those Jesuit tombstones and was unapologetically grateful that they are dead and I am alive.\" She admitted feeling bitter when she sees the African-American groundskeepers, knowing that the university had built over the former burial sites of slaves. \"No brothers weeding and mowing their grounds,\" she said.\n\nThe university isn't bound by the student referendum to pay reparations, but the board of directors is expected to consider the recommendation in June. If it votes in favor, a reconciliation fee of twenty-seven dollars and twenty cents will be added to each undergraduate's tuition bill. Short-Colomb helped rally the votes. Standing in a grassy quad, she'd announced, into a megaphone, \"The dollar amount, symbolic of the two hundred and seventy-two Jesuit slaves sold, is only one-tenth of one per cent of the average tuition per semester.\"\n\nThe result of the student vote is controversial on campus. Some students say that the university should pay its own reparations rather than make students fund them. International students have objected to paying for a crime that they didn't commit. To the skeptics, Short-Colomb responds, \"You came here voluntarily, and you'll leave with the prestige of a degree from an esteemed university that would not exist but for the enslaved people who built it.\"\n\nLater that day, Short-Colomb cooked a gumbo dinner for her friend Richard Cellini, the founder of the Georgetown Memory Project. Cellini's venture, which receives no financial support from Georgetown, has identified eight thousand four hundred and twenty-five descendants, more than four thousand of whom are alive. He hopes to locate even more and reunite fifteen hundred families who were separated by the 1838 sale.\n\nCellini, who describes himself as a \"mustard-seed Catholic,\" said that he knew very little about slavery or African-American history until a couple of years ago, when students began protesting after a story about the Georgetown slave auction ran in the student paper. \"I could not stop thinking about the families ripped apart by that sale whose names had been in the university archives for years,\" he said. Ironically, written records exist only because the Jesuits insisted that their slaves be baptized.\n\n\"We'll save your soul while we sell your ass,\" Short-Colomb joked.\n\n\"History only answers the questions we ask,\" Cellini said. \"For more than a hundred and fifty years, no one from Georgetown or the Maryland Jesuits ever went looking for the people sold.\"\n\nFor Short-Colomb, it comes back to the begats. \"Knowing where you come from is the only way to know who you are,\" she said. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "When Black History Is Unearthed, Who Gets to Speak for the Dead?\n\nHerein lie buried many things.\n\n-W. E. B. Du Bois, 1903.\n\nWhen Deidre Barnes was a kid in North Carolina, horsing around in the back seat of the car with her little brother, her grandfather drove by the woods in a white neighborhood in Durham. \"You got cousins up in there,\" he called back from the driver's seat, nodding at a stand of loblolly pines in a tangle of kudzu. Barnes and her brother exchanged wide-eyed glances: they had cousins who were wild people? Only later, looking hard, did they spy a headstone: \"Oh, it's a cemetery .\" A few years ago, Barnes read in the newspaper that the place was called Geer. \"My grandmother's maiden name is Geer,\" she told me. \"And so I asked her, 'Do we have people buried there?' \"\n\nI met Barnes at the cemetery on a warm, cicada night, with Debra Gonzalez-Garcia, the president of the Friends of Geer Cemetery. \"When I was growing up, I could name five African Americans in history,\" Gonzalez-Garcia said. \"Five. Nobody else did anything.\" At least fifteen hundred people who did all sorts of things are buried in Geer Cemetery, including Deidre Barnes's great-grandfather, a grandson of Jesse Geer, a plantation owner who sold two acres of land to three Black freedmen in 1877. Gonzalez-Garcia and her team have been painstakingly reconstructing the cemetery's population from its two hundred surviving headstones and from burial cards recorded by the W.P.A. in the nineteen-thirties.\n\nThe movement to save Black cemeteries has been growing for decades, led by Black women like Barnes and Gonzalez-Garcia, who have families to care for and work full-time jobs but volunteer countless hours and formidable organizing skills looking after the dead and upending American history. They transcribe death certificates; they collect oral histories. They bring in community organizations-Keep Durham Beautiful helps out at Geer-and hand out rakes and shears and loppers to Scouts and college students, tackling poison ivy that's strangling trees. They hold tours, warning everyone to wear long pants, because of the snakes. They work with churches. They work with businesses: Durham Marble Works repairs broken headstones. Eagle Scouts installed Carolina gravel along what might once have been a carriage road. An archeological survey will be done soon, to make sure that, when you walk that road, you're not stepping on sunken graves.\n\n\"The people who started White Rock Baptist Church and St. Joseph's A.M.E.,\" Barnes told me, \"they're buried here.\" She and Gonzalez-Garcia seemed to know each epitaph, telling story after story about African American families who thrived in the early years after Reconstruction-getting college degrees, starting businesses-only to lose most of their gains to segregation and swindles. \"Olivia Tilley Wills,\" Gonzalez-Garcia said, pointing to a stone, amid the overgrowth. \"She was married twice. There was a big court case about her estate. She had investments.\"\n\nUnderneath America lies an apartheid of the departed. Violence done to the living is usually done to their dead, who are dug up, mowed down, and built on. In the Jim Crow South, Black people paid taxes that went to building and erecting Confederate monuments. They buried their own dead with the help of mutual-aid societies, fraternal organizations, and insurance policies. Cemeteries work on something like a pyramid scheme: payments for new plots cover the cost of maintaining old ones. \"Perpetual care\" is, everywhere, notional, but that notion relies on an accumulation of capital that decades of disenfranchisement and discrimination have made impossible in many Black communities, even as racial terror also drove millions of people from the South during the Great Migration, leaving their ancestors behind. It's amazing that Geer survived. Durham's other Black cemeteries were run right over. \"Hickstown's part of the freeway,\" Gonzalez-Garcia told me, counting them off. \"Violet Park is a church parking lot.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nWhat would it mean for the future of the United States to mark and honor these places? In 2019, the four-hundredth anniversary of the arrival of the first captive Africans in Virginia, members of Congress from North Carolina and Virginia, inspired by volunteer organizations like the Friends of Geer, introduced the African-American Burial Grounds Network Act. Last year, an amended version passed unanimously in the Senate. It doesn't come with any money, but if it's enacted it will authorize the National Park Service to coördinate efforts to identify, preserve, and interpret places like Geer, Hickstown, and Violet Park. Federal legislation might also provide some legal clarity. A few years ago, a Geer neighbor took down a giant tree; as it fell, it crushed a row of headstones. They're pinned there still. There's little the Friends can do about that: they don't own the land. \"Legally, this place is considered abandoned,\" Gonzalez-Garcia explained. \"The city hasn't traced anyone who's inherited the title.\" The Friends of Geer can't find a titleholder, either, and not for lack of trying. Their work is guided by the principle that descendants (\"people with bodies in the ground\") should decide what to do with the cemetery. They've so far found about fifty. They're still looking.\n\nMeanwhile, that same principle-that descendants decide-lies at the center of a widening controversy about human remains in the collections of universities and anatomical and anthropological museums. It has led to a proposal for another piece of federal legislation modelled on the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, NAGPRA , but for African American graves-an AAGPRA . This spring, in an essay published in Nature, three young Black archeologists called for, among other things, a halt to the unethical study of all human remains in the United States until those of people descended from Africans can be identified, and descendants found and consulted. Another group of Black archeologists argued that, on the contrary, suspending research would only further widen the gap between what scientists know about people of African and European ancestry, leading to worse public-health outcomes for African Americans, who are already adversely affected by a history of medical mistreatment and poor representation in everything from clinical trials to the human-genome project. Antiracist orthodoxy has it that everything's either antiracist or racist: there is no other position. This anguished disagreement reveals the limits of that premise.\n\nIt isn't merely an academic dispute. The proposed burial-grounds network and graves-protection acts are parts of a larger public deliberation, less the always elusive \"national conversation\" than a quieter collective act of conscientious mourning, expressed, too, in new monuments and museum exhibits. History gets written down in books but, like archeology, it can seep up from the earth itself, from a loamy underground of sacred, ancient things: gravestones tucked under elms and tangled by vines; iron-nailed coffins trapped beneath pavement and parking lots and highway overpasses. How and whether the debates over human remains get resolved holds consequences not only for how Americans understand the country's past but also for how they picture its future. The dispute itself, along the razor's edge between archeology and history, is beset by a horrible irony. Enslavement and segregation denied people property and ancestry. But much here appears to turn on inheritance and title: Who owns these graveyards? Who owns these bones? Who owns, and what is owed?\n\n•\n\nBury me not in a land of slaves.\n\n-Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, 1858.\n\nWhen I went to Geer Cemetery, dusty with Carolina gravel, I was about midway through a road trip from New Hampshire to Florida. I'd plotted a route that would take me through battlefields in today's history-and-archeology wars. I started out in Portsmouth, a brick city founded in 1652 along the Piscataqua River and the site of the northernmost African burial-ground memorial in the United States, and I ended in the Tampa Bay area, on the Gulf Coast, incorporated in 1866, where a half-dozen paved-over Black cemeteries holding thousands of graves have been found in the past two years alone, including under a parking lot at the Rays' baseball stadium, Tropicana Field.\n\nIn an interview Toni Morrison gave in 1989, she explained why she'd written \"Beloved,\" a novel whose title is an epitaph. \"There is no place that you and I can go to think about or not think about, to summon the presences of, or recollect the absences of slaves,\" she said. No marker or plaque, no museum or statue. \"There's not even a tree scored, an initial that I can visit, or you can visit, in Charleston or Savannah or New York or Providence or better still on the banks of the Mississippi.\" Three decades after \"Beloved,\" people everywhere are tending to markers.\n\nPortsmouth's Negro Burying Ground first appeared on a map in 1705 and disappeared only after 1902, but it had already been built over by the eighteen-teens. Primus Fowle, an enslaved artisan who operated the press that printed the New Hampshire Gazette , was buried there in 1791. The Gazette printed an epitaph: \"Now he's dead, we sure may say / Of him, as of all men, / That while in silent graves they lay / They'll not be plag'd agen.\" In October, 2003, construction crews working on a sewer line under Chestnut Street discovered eight coffins, which turned out to be a fraction of those buried there. In deciding what to do next, Portsmouth took as its model the New York African Burial Ground Project, an effort that began in 1992, after the remains of hundreds of people-at a site that held some twenty thousand-were found in lower Manhattan during excavations for a federal office building. Because these weren't Native American graves, no law explicitly applied to burial grounds which would prevent the government from continuing to excavate and build. Protests persuaded Congress to authorize funds for a memorial. Michael Blakey, a bioarcheologist then at Howard University, led the study of the remains and artifacts; he also pioneered a protocol for collaborating with the Black community, rather than leaving decisions to white property owners, government officials, and archeologists. Under NAGPRA , indigenous artifacts and remains were returned to Native nations designated as their \"culturally affiliated group.\" Blakey created an analogous group-rights category: what he called the \"descendant community.\"\n\nDescendants can be hard to find, for reasons that have everything to do with the atrocities of slavery, which stole people from their homes, separated children and parents, barred marriage, and assigned to people no family name except that of the people who claimed to own them. You can find Primus Fowle at Findagrave.com, but you can't find his family tree at Ancestry.com. Given the difficulty of identifying literal descendants, the New York African Burial Ground Project used a proxy-the local community of African Americans. Portsmouth's population is more than ninety per cent white. The city council appointed a committee, led by a local Black educator, that, in the absence of a descendant community, held public meetings and selected a memorial designed around the theme of honoring those who have been forgotten. Sometimes the people in charge of a site do nothing more than consult with a descendant community after the fact. In an article published last year, Blakey denounced some white archeologists working in this field for \"appropriating\" human remains and \"avoiding acknowledgment and redress of White racism, blinded to their own deep subjectivity and deaf to critiques of those who are not of their own White likeness and presumed neutral voice.\" (Blakey declined to speak with me.)\n\nIn 2003, just as Portsmouth's site was discovered, the New York remains were carried from Blakey's lab at Howard back to New York and reburied in a series of ceremonies called the Rites of Ancestral Return. The site is now a national monument. Here, too, Portsmouth followed New York's example: in 2015, the remains found in 2003 were placed in eight coffins and reburied in a vault beneath that block of Chestnut, now permanently closed to through traffic, at the unveiling of a memorial featuring eight golden silhouettes that appear to rise up from the ground. A trail of red bricks is inscribed with the words from a petition that African-born Portsmouth men submitted to the New Hampshire legislature in 1779, seeking emancipation and pleading \"that the name of 'slave' may no longer be heard in the land gloriously contending for the sweets of freedom.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nMore unknown sites are sure to turn up, especially if the African-American Burial Grounds Network Act passes. Still, not all African burial grounds in the North have disappeared. Last March, Keith Stokes, whose first African ancestor arrived in Philadelphia and moved to Newport, Rhode Island, in 1795, buried his mother beside seven generations of his family in an area now called God's Little Acre. (In 2019, the Newport site was awarded a fifty-thousand-dollar grant from the African American Cultural Action Fund, which is part of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.) What survives in God's Little Acre is a measure of what's been lost elsewhere. Its every headstone, including those carved by an enslaved eighteenth-century artisan named Pompe Stevens and dozens with engraved portraits-faces with strikingly African features-contains a record not found in any archive. As Stokes told me, \"It's a repository of African American heritage and history.\"\n\nVincent Brown, a colleague of mine who teaches in Harvard's departments of history and African and African American studies, has ancestors who were enslaved in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake. He coined the expression \"mortuary politics,\" to describe the uses to which mid-eighteenth-century and early-nineteenth-century diasporic Africans put the dead. Lately, there's a partisan politics to mortuary politics. \"I'd for sure rather have voting rights than Juneteenth,\" Brown told me. \"But who knows where that goes, because anytime someone is celebrating the dead it's not really about the past-it's about how we imagine the future.\" A century ago, when white supremacists destroyed Black cemeteries and erected Confederate monuments, they weren't so much honoring the Lost Cause as advancing their cause: segregation forever. A risk, in this fraught moment, is of getting strangled by their dead hands. White Tea Partiers dressed up like George Washington; Black Lives Matter activists demanded the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. The Trump Administration answered the New York Times' 1619 Project with its 1776 Commission. And then what? \"There's a strange overlap between people who don't want to think about the history of slavery and people who fixate on the politics of race only in terms of slavery,\" Brown said. Both assume that \"the conflicts of the past are necessarily the conflicts of the present and the future, as if somehow the descendants of the slaveholders and of the slaves are supposed to be aligned with their ancestors forever.\"\n\nIn Albany, a graveyard not on any map was found in 2005, on the onetime plantation of a cousin of Philip Schuyler, Alexander Hamilton's father-in-law. It held the bodies of African-descended people, mainly children and babies, all buried before 1790. Cordell Reaves, who is African American, was working for the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation when he learned about the Albany remains. Those bones went to the New York State Museum for analysis. \"What people ate, where people were from, where their ancestors hailed from, understanding the effect of the brutal physical labor they were forced to endure,\" he told me. \"That story is etched into their actual bones.\" For a long time, Reaves tried without success to get people interested in a reburial. In 2015, it finally came together: a Catholic cemetery donated plots; woodworkers built coffins, and artists and schoolchildren decorated them. The dead lay in state in the front hall of Schuyler Mansion before the multi-faith burial, in one of the best attended and most moving public-history events the state has ever hosted. Reaves wept. \"It was like lightning struck,\" he told me. All that night and the next day, people read poems, and sang, and danced. \"Something about this captured people,\" Reaves said, tearing up again. \"I'm not sure what it was. But I keep coming back to the word 'reconciliation.' \"\n\nHe's got a slightly different notion of what a descendant community might be. \"I looked out at the sea of people that were there,\" he said. \"This country is rooted in the story of enslaved people. This is everyone's history.\" You can be a cynic about all of this, Reaves admitted. It's one thing to pray for the dead; it's another to look after the living. But Reaves isn't cynical. \"It's a door,\" he said. \"You open it, some of them will walk through.\" The question is what lies on the other side.\n\n•\n\nGod has no children whose rights may be safely trampled on.\n\n-Frederick Douglass, 1854.\n\nSamuel Morton, a Philadelphia doctor, began collecting skulls in 1830. Determined to study the craniums of the world's five newly classified \"races,\" he directed faraway correspondents to dig up graves and ship him heads, eventually amassing nearly nine hundred, including, closer to home, those of fourteen Black Philadelphians. Morton is buried in Philadelphia's Laurel Hill Cemetery, under an obelisk inscribed, \"Wherever Truth Is Loved or Science Honored, His Name Will Be Revered.\" In 1854, three years after Morton's death, Frederick Douglass called his work \"scientific moonshine,\" but it took more than a century for scientists to disavow the notion of biological race. And yet calls for the return of those remains rest on a notion of race, too.\n\nChristopher Woods, a Sumerologist from the University of Chicago, is the first Black director of the Penn Museum, in Philadelphia. In April, not yet two weeks after he began his appointment, the museum issued a statement apologizing \"for the unethical possession of human remains in the Morton Collection\" and pledging to return them \"to their ancestral communities.\" Penn is not alone. In January, the president of Harvard issued a similar apology and charged a committee to inventory the human remains found in its museums, with priority given to those of \"individuals of African descent who were or were likely to have been alive during the period of American enslavement.\" As Evelynn Hammonds, a historian of science who chairs the Harvard committee, told me, \"No one institution can solve all these questions alone.\"\n\nBut Penn has other problems. Days after Woods's first apology, the museum issued another one, this time for holding on to the remains of a Black child killed by police in 1985 during a raid against the Black-liberation organization MOVE . (The police bombed the MOVE house, and eleven people, including five children, were burned to death.) The museum returned those remains to the families this summer. As for the rest of the remains, including the Morton collection, \"We want to do the right thing,\" Woods told me. \"We want to be able to repatriate individuals when descendant communities want that to be done.\"\n\nDuring the years when Morton was collecting skulls, much of Philadelphia's African American community was burying its dead in a cemetery on Queen Street that's now a playground called Weccacoe, for a Lenni Lenape word that means \"peaceful place.\" The day I stopped there, the playground was a tumble of sippy cups and strollers, water buckets and tubes of sunscreen, and toddlers playing pirates. Underneath lie thousands of graves.\n\nLink copied\n\nPennsylvania passed a gradual abolition law in 1780, and by the seventeen-nineties Philadelphia had a thriving free Black community, much of it centered on what is now the Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1810, the Bethel church trustees and the A.M.E.'s founder, Richard Allen, bought a city block on Queen Street. Until 1864, the congregation used the land as a burial ground and then, in 1889, strapped for cash, sold it to cover the cost of a new church. The burial ground became a park, and then a playground. Nearly half the city's population is Black, but the city's monuments and museums mostly commemorate Benjamin Franklin, the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution, and the drafting of the Constitution. Avenging the Ancestors, a coalition formed in 2002 to advocate for a slavery memorial in the city, has taken a broad view of the notion of a descendant community, describing its members as \"today's free Black sons and daughters\" of \"yesterday's enslaved Black fathers and mothers.\"\n\nIn 2010, Terry Buckalew, an independent researcher and aging antiwar activist, read in the newspaper that the city was about to renovate Weccacoe. \"They were going to dig it up,\" he told me. \"They were going to put in new trees, new light poles, and a sprinkler. And I said, 'Oh, no. The bodies are still there!' \" Three years later, the city conducted a ground-penetrating-radar survey and concluded that the site, the Bethel Burying Ground, contained at least five thousand bodies. Buckalew, who is white, has spent his retirement researching the lives of those thousands of Black Philadelphians. I asked him why. \"Reparations,\" he said. \"I firmly believe in reparations.\"\n\nReparations rest on arguments about inheritance and descent. But, if genealogy has a new politics, it has always been urgent. After Emancipation, people put ads in newspapers, desperately looking for their children, husbands, wives, and parents. \" INFORMATION WANTED of my mother, Lucy Smith, of Hopkinsville, Ky., formerly the slave of Dr. Smith. She was sold to a Mr. Jenks of Louisiana,\" Ephraim Allen of Philadelphia posted in the Christian Recorder in 1868. Today, reparative genealogical projects in search of descendants put out calls on social media and ask people to fill out Google Forms. One of the most successful, the Georgetown Memory Project, has been looking for direct descendants of two hundred and seventy-two enslaved people sold by the Jesuit Society that ran Georgetown in 1838, mostly to pay off debts. So far, the project, in conjunction with independent researchers and American Ancestors (the nation's oldest genealogical research organization, which established pedigrees for Mayflower descendants), has located more than eight thousand descendants. In 2019, after a student-driven referendum, the university announced a plan to provide four hundred thousand dollars a year in reparations, in the form of \"community-based projects to benefit Descendant communities.\"\n\nReparations hasn't been the dominant note sounded in Philadelphia over Bethel, perhaps in part because it was the A.M.E. Church that sold the burial ground. Still, there's been plenty of controversy, along with the usual and more than usual delays of a complicated city-planning process. But last year the Bethel Burying Ground Historic Site Memorial Committee selected a proposal by the award-winning artist Karyn Olivier, for a memorial titled \"Her Luxuriant Soil.\"\n\nOlivier, who teaches sculpture at Temple University, was born in Trinidad and Tobago in 1968. \"My ancestors were slaves, but not here,\" she told me. Olivier likes to work with soil: \"It holds history and holds loss and holds pain.\" But she took her title from a speech made by Richard Allen in 1817, before a meeting of three thousand free men of African heritage, who'd gathered to debate a proposal, mostly favored by Southern slaveowners, for resettling free Black men and women in West Africa. \"Whereas our ancestors (not of choice) were the first cultivators of the wilds of America,\" Allen said, \"we their descendants feel ourselves entitled to participate in the blessings of her luxuriant soil.\"\n\nOlivier's elegiac design incorporates features discovered during excavation of the site, including the inscription found on the only headstone that was unearthed: \"Amelia Brown, 1819, Aged 26 years. Whosoever live and believeth in me, though we be dead, yet, shall we live.\" A wrought-iron cemetery gate reading \"Bethel Burying Ground\" will mark the entrance to the park-half of which will still be a playground-where paving stones engraved with epitaphs will have something of the quality of Germany's Stolpersteine , or stumbling stones, marked with the names of those who were killed in the Holocaust. You won't trip over Olivier's installation; instead, inscribed into water-activated concrete, the words will appear, and disappear, with rain, snow, and a sprinkler system. The plan is to break ground in March. But it won't be very broken: the graves lie only inches deep.\n\nOlivier's work stands at the vanguard of a mournful aesthetic, closely associated with a Philadelphia-based non-profit called the Monument Lab, which, with a four-million-dollar grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, is reimagining the nation's public memory. In September, the Monument Lab released the results of a National Monument Audit as a prelude to opening ten field offices across the country-places in need of new monuments \"to transform the way our country's history is told in public spaces.\" The stops along my route began to appear to me to be gathered together by thread. The artist Sonya Clark, who teaches at Amherst College, has worked with the Monument Lab, and she also once collaborated with a carver named Nicholas Benson, who owns the stone-carving shop in Newport where Pompe Stevens etched headstones: Benson carved the word \"slave,\" in Italian, in Roman capitals in marble, then sent her the dust. Clark likes to work with dust the way Olivier likes to work with soil. \"To gather dust is to gather up all that is around us that is sloughed off,\" she told me. In 2019, Clark covered a floor with dust she'd collected from Philadelphia sites like Independence Hall and Declaration House, and-dressed as a charwoman named Ella Watson, photographed by Gordon Parks in 1942-got down on one knee with a bucket of soapy water and scrubbed the floor with a Confederate-flag hand towel, to reveal the words \"We hold these truths . . .\"\n\n•\n\nLet the people see what they did to my boy.\n\n-Mamie Till-Mobley, 1955.\n\nWashington, D.C., is a monument to the dead. But the \"national\" dead rest on top of the Black dead: Arlington National Cemetery started out as a Black burial ground, the former plantation of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee, seized by the Union during the Civil War. After Appomattox, James Parks, once enslaved, dug the graves of the white Union dead; the United States Colored Troops were buried in a separate section. In 1898, President William McKinley opened Arlington to the Confederate dead, declaring, \"In the spirit of fraternity, we should share with you in the care of the graves of Confederate soldiers.\" In 1914, Woodrow Wilson dedicated a thirty-two-foot monument to the Confederacy, on Jefferson Davis's birthday. Having admitted secessionists, Arlington remained racially segregated until Harry S. Truman integrated the military, in 1948. A bill introduced in 2020, the Removing Confederate Names and Symbols from Our Military Act, would, if passed, call for taking down the Confederate monument. But, like a lot of gestures made in 2020, nothing has yet come of it.\n\nLink copied\n\nWashington's newest monument is written on the ground across from the White House, where yellow painted letters spell BLACK LIVES MATTER . If a commitment to naming and marking the Black dead undergirds reparation efforts, it also informs the design of new monuments and museum exhibits. They cleave to the same dark themes-dust and soil, ancestors and descendants, death and resurrection-because the spectre and the spectacle of Black death lie at the heart not only of anti-Black violence but also of Black freedom struggles. The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, opened in Montgomery, Alabama, in 2018, suspends from its ceiling hundreds of steel coffins, memorials to victims of lynching. The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016, displays Emmett Till's glass-topped casket. In September, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History installed a single artifact in a vast hall at the entrance of the museum, a historical marker that, until recently, stood along the banks of the Tallahatchie River, where Till's body was found. It's a sign, evocative of an old headstone, that not long ago had been shot by vandals three hundred and seventeen times. Dimpled with BBs, pocked with shotgun blasts, riddled with the bullets of semi-automatic weapons, the sign now stands as a monument not to the past but to our violent national present. \"It is an object of such pain,\" Anthea Hartig, the museum's director, said to me. \"How do you memorialize when you're still in the middle?\" The historian Tsione Wolde-Michael, who co-curated the Till exhibit, is also the director of a new Center for Restorative History. \"There are very few historical moments that create openings like the one we have right now,\" Wolde-Michael told me. \"You have publics around the globe that are pushing not just museums but universities, and governments, all sorts of major institutions, to not just issue solidarity statements, but to create altogether new structures.\"\n\nLonnie Bunch III, the first Black secretary of the Smithsonian, has charged the National Museum of Natural History, down the block from the American-history museum, with assessing its human remains and sorting out individuals of African descent. Sabrina Sholts, a museum curator of biological anthropology, is leading that effort, from an office where a plastic skeleton, propped up in a corner, gathers dust. The audit is beset by a paradox: the people who collected these remains did so in order to invent \"race\" as a biological category, one that does not exist, but one that has to be used, somehow, to identify what remains can be considered those of African heritage. \"Our discipline, biological anthropology, helped reify race,\" Sholts told me. \"And now we need to explain to the public that race does not describe biological variation.\"\n\nHere's one way of thinking about this impasse. Democratic political struggle rests on the idea that ancestry is not destiny. But American history has betrayed that idea through centuries of state-imposed inequality, discrimination, and disenfranchisement. There is therefore no path to equality without measures aimed at repair: restorative history, reparations, the return of remains. But these measures sometimes advance the anti-democratic idea that ancestry is destiny. Politicians are trapped in this maze; you can hear them in there, screaming. Can archeologists and genealogists, curators and artists, and, not least, everyday people who volunteer in cemeteries find a way out?\n\nAmong the remains Sholts's committee will consider are thirty-three skeletons found in Maryland in 1979, during the expansion of a state road through what turned out to have been a slave cemetery at Catoctin Furnace, an ironworks. (Catoctin isn't far from Gettysburg, along a route taken by Civil War battleground tourists, where the highway signs read \"Hallowed Ground.\") \"It's an accident of history that we have these bones,\" Elizabeth Comer, the head of the Museum of the Ironworker, told me, but the museum is able to tell its visitors about those lives because of what has been learned from the remains by Sholts's curatorial colleague Doug Owsley. Owsley's study, along with sequencing done by the Harvard geneticist David Reich, is the kind of research that people calling for AAGPRA want halted, until a descendant community can be found and consulted. (Owsley says that the local African American community supports the research.) As for what to do with the Catoctin remains now, Comer, too, believes that it's up to the descendants, except that, after years of steadfast searching, she has yet to find any.\n\nWhy add only historical African Americans to a protected category? If collecting human remains without consent is wrong, which was NAGPRA's argument, why not include everyone? Sholts's answer is that no one is more powerless to give consent than a person held as property, so the work has to begin there. She sees this change of approach as generational, and she's a part of the new generation.\n\nAmong the leaders of that generational change are Ayana Omilade Flewellen, from U.C. Riverside, and Justin Dunnavant, of U.C.L.A., co-founders of the Society of Black Archaeologists. They're trying to build the kind of restorative justice-based structures in archeology that Tsione Wolde-Michael wants to build in history. In an essay that appeared this past April in American Antiquity , Dunnavant, Wolde-Michael, and others warned, \"The future of archaeology is antiracist, or it is nothing .\" The next month, Nature published an essay, by Dunnavant and others, calling for the creation of an AAGPRA , while acknowledging that \"centuries of displacement and sparse genealogical records for African Americans can mean that it is difficult to link a set of human remains to specific Black descendants.\" The sensible solution, they argue, is to define \"descendants both in genealogical terms and more inclusively, to welcome input from African Americans whose ancestors had a shared historical experience.\" According to guidelines established in 2018 by the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund, that shared historical experience is enslavement. For Dunnavant, it's also being Black in America. \"We need to do this research on behalf of the communities we are studying,\" Dunnavant told me. The Society of Black Archaeologists is calling for a national audit of all human remains.\n\nBut the universal keeps straining against the particular. The people whose remains were most likely to be taken without their consent are also the people whose lives are the least well documented in paper archives, the people about whom forensic and genetic analysis has the most to tell. That's why Henry Louis Gates, Jr., disagrees with aspects of the AAGPRA approach. Gates, who serves on the Harvard human-remains committee, has been studying the diaspora through historical records, genealogy, and DNA for decades. In 2006, he started a PBS series called \"African American Lives\" that spurred interest in genealogy in the African American community. Gates grew up in West Virginia, where he visited the \"colored\" cemetery. \"My grandfather and my grandmother were buried there,\" he told me. He hasn't had a strong emotional response to the African-burial-ground ceremonies he's seen, with kente cloth and African drumming. \"I'm deeply moved by the recovery of remains,\" Gates says, \"but I worry that sometimes an excess of kitsch substitutes for substantial reflection about the meaning and import of the burial sites.\" Although he believes in a notion of descent that encompasses shared historical experience, he thinks that decisions \"shouldn't be made exclusively by local Black families who happened to live there\" but through a process of collective deliberation involving genealogical descendants, representatives of the local Black community, scientists, and other researchers. For Gates, DNA research has the potential to repair some of the damage done by slavery: it can restore links that were severed when families were separated and genealogical evidence was destroyed. Otherwise, it's a Catch-22: not sequencing the DNA makes it harder to find the descendants to ask for their permission to sequence the DNA. \"This is magical stuff,\" Gates said. \"It's the only way to connect the dead to the living. It's the only way these dead can speak. Some people think they should be buried and sealed. I believe in respecting the dead. I also respect the living.\"\n\nFatimah Jackson, a professor of biology at Howard University, has been weighing the implications of AAGPrA for scientific research. (Jackson, like Blakey, is a former director of Howard's W. Montague Cobb Research Laboratory, which houses the largest collection of African American skeletal remains in the world-a collection that Cobb assembled to refute the work of people like Samuel Morton.) Suspending research, she argues, will affect public health, widening historical inequities and leaving the African American community even less well represented in databases that are essential to practices expected to be central to the future of medicine.\n\nLink copied\n\nWhat should be done when one kind of restorative racial justice conflicts with another? Jackson is unpersuaded by the contention that all people whose ancestors were enslaved ought to be called upon to decide what to do with their remains. \"Scientists know more about Neanderthals than modern humans recently out of Africa,\" she said. And she's skeptical of Dunnavant and his co-authors \"speaking for forty million people, or even for four people.\" She thinks their rhetoric of representation is misbegotten. \"What sampling method is that?\" she asks. \"Does he speak for Black America? Or do I speak for Black America? It's ludicrous.\" She also believes that, on balance, African Americans (who lately, like the rest of the country, have tended to cremate their dead) would want the research to proceed and that, meanwhile, if the scientific community needs to make an ethical assessment about future research, it should engage in a deliberative process, perhaps involving a series of conferences with Black lawyers, doctors, clergy, ethicists, and scientists.\n\nThat deliberative body sounds something like the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, called for by Congress in 1974 in the aftermath of revelations about the experiments done on Black men at Tuskegee. The commission-eleven scientists, ethicists, lawyers, and activists who deliberated for nearly four years-produced the landmark \"Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research,\" better known as the Belmont Report. It might be time for a new commission, on the Protection of Human Subjects, Postmortem. Still, it's easy to imagine that venture falling apart before it even starts, over the vexing question of who can speak for the dead.\n\n•\n\nWhy do you not propose a cemetery for the illustrious Negro dead?\n\n-Zora Neale Hurston to W. E. B. Du Bois, 1945.\n\nNear Richmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, Brian Palmer met me at East End and Evergreen Cemeteries with his little black dog, Teacake, named, he said, \"for the one good male character in Hurston's 'Their Eyes Were Watching God.' \" Palmer, an award-winning journalist, helped found Friends of East End, in 2017. \"I'm a descendant,\" he told me, hitching Teacake's leash to a carabiner dangling from a belt loop and waving to me across a locked gate. The cemeteries, both founded in the eighteen-nineties by African American citizens, are open only to descendants and, for now, only with advance notice. Between 2019 and 2020, the Enrichmond Foundation, a nonprofit that had no experience with cemeteries or with historical preservation, acquired both of them, an area that stretches across seventy-six acres. \"The state secretly anointed this white-led organization and said, We'll do what we want, and then we'll worry about the descendants,\" Palmer said. \"In my humble, grumpy-ass view.\"\n\nEnrichmond plans to develop a tourist site (Palmer calls it a \"recreation plantation\"), including a visitor center with an estimated price tag of $1.9 million, bike trails, and hundreds of feet of electrical, sewer, and water lines-all plans that could disturb unmarked graves. Last winter, members of Richmond's Black community formed a descendants council: they consider the site hallowed ground, and they have asked the governor to suspend the development's funding. But Enrichmond has enlisted its own group of descendants, including John Mitchell, a descendant of Richmond's celebrated Black newspaper editor John Mitchell, Jr., who is buried in Evergreen. Mitchell is also \"Enrichmond's Family Ambassador,\" and the man you've got to notify before you enter the cemetery. While Palmer and I were walking around with Teacake in tow, Mitchell pulled up in a pickup truck. He waved hello but eyed us warily. \"Brian has valid concerns about descendant representation,\" Mitchell later said. \"But twisting the words and actions of those descendants that chose to get inside this system is not productive.\"\n\nThe term \"descendant community\" comes from Michael Blakey's work on the New York African Burial Ground, but it also has roots in sites of conscience, where the terms are \"families of the missing\" or \"communities of mourners\"-labels that apply equally well to U.S. sites of mass atrocity, like Tulsa, where archeologists have been uncovering a grave believed to hold the bodies of hundreds of African Americans who were killed in the 1921 massacre. The human-rights scholar Adam Rosenblatt, the author of \"Digging for the Disappeared,\" is struck by the relationship between descendant communities and communities of mourners. \"These are the people who matter the most,\" he told me. \"But what it often too quickly translates into is the assumption that somehow those people are always going to agree with each other.\" Which, as a visit to East End and Evergreen makes clear, isn't necessarily what happens. Palmer, pointing out that the condition of these cemeteries is a consequence of disenfranchisement, argues for a democratic solution. \"There are people who still have deeds to their plots, people in the ground,\" Palmer said. \"Let's gather around a table. Let's vote. Isn't that what democracy is for?\"\n\nAfter Richmond, I travelled through the heart of the Confederacy, from cemetery to cemetery. The Oberlin Cemetery, in Raleigh, was one of the smallest, with about six hundred bodies interred beneath magnolias and oaks. Cheryl Williams's family is buried there, and she's the cemetery's steward, but she doesn't expect ever to lie in any grave. \"My family recently, we've been going with cremation,\" she told me. The Friends of Oberlin Village gives amazing tours. Williams said, \"We're at a time when people are ready to hear these stories and accept them as true history.\"\n\nBut in Charleston I wasn't so sure. The neighborhood around Bethel United Methodist Church, on Calhoun Street, sits atop graveyards, including Bethel's own, containing the remains of congregants, white and Black. The church grounds are covered in dug-up old headstones, lying in beds of pine needles and on patches of shaggy grass, some rescued by the church, others left by neighbors who came across them in their back yards. (\"Sacred to the Memory of Laurence Carnes,\" one 1805 stone reads. \"Disturb not his bones while they are mouldering in their Mother Earth.\") Behind the church is a house on a lot that city archeologists believe to be the not very restful resting place of more than fifteen hundred people. In the nineteen-forties or fifties, the owner began using headstones as paving stones, for a garden path. I found the new owner by a dumpster in the driveway. Earlier in the summer, when he filed for a construction permit, the city issued a stop-work order but then decided that it lacked the authority to halt the planned renovations. I asked him about the burials in his back yard. \"It's all over,\" he said, exasperated. \"It was sold in 1915.\" He threw up his hands. \"There is no story.\"\n\nEverything happening in the rest of the country is happening faster, and hotter, in Florida. \"It's just insane right now. It's crazy here,\" the anthropologist Cheryl Rodriguez said when we spoke about the state's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis. Rodriguez is the former director of the Institute on Black Life at the University of South Florida, in Tampa. In June, within a matter of days, DeSantis denounced the teaching of critical race theory, forbade the use of the 1619 Project in the state's classrooms, issued a requirement that state colleges and universities survey their students to reveal whether they have been indoctrinated into an antiracist agenda, and signed a law convening the Task Force on Abandoned African-American Cemeteries. I asked Rodriguez how the task force could possibly produce a report that doesn't document the very kind of discrimination that the Governor's other directives ban people from even talking about. She laughed, and said, \"Welcome to Florida!\"\n\nIn 2018, a Tampa Bay Times reporter named Paul Guzzo got a tip from an amateur genealogist named Ray Reed: he found death records for an African American cemetery called Zion, but he couldn't find its location. At first, chasing leads and digging through the archives, Guzzo thought there might be just a few bodies, but then he realized, \"Oh, shit, this is a big cemetery.\" Guzzo fell down a rabbit hole, and so did a lot of other people. He learned that part of Robles Village, now a predominantly Black public-housing community, had been built on top of Zion. People would call to tell him about another cemetery they knew had been paved over, Guzzo would investigate, the Tampa Bay Times would run another story. A local TV news station, WTSP, started a history series called \"Erased.\" All this breaking news galvanized activists, including Corey Givens, Jr., whose great-great-grandfather, a mason who helped build the St. Petersburg seawall, is buried somewhere under an overpass for I-175, outside Tropicana Field. The Tampa Bay Rays are scheduled to redevelop the site in 2027. \"All I'm saying is it should be Black descendants telling the mayor what we want to do to honor our Black ancestors, not him telling us,\" Givens told me. \"I want to bring some peace and justice to my family.\"\n\nThe Task Force on Abandoned and Neglected African-American Cemeteries, introduced by the state congresswoman Fentrice Driskell, passed Florida's legislature with unanimous support, and was signed into law this summer by DeSantis, even as he was doing things like banning the 1619 Project. Paul Ortiz, a historian at the University of Florida, and the president of the United Faculty of Florida, says, \"They're going to make sure you don't mention 1619-I mean, don't mention the date ?\" Ortiz is the author of a history of racial violence in Florida. Between 1882 and 1930, no state in the country had a higher rate of lynching than Florida; a state senator urged the nullification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments; and one governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward II, effectively proposed the deportation of all Black people. During the election of 1920, the Ku Klux Klan burned prospective voters alive in their homes, and Dade County Democrats published an announcement in the Miami Herald: \" WHITE VOTERS, REMEMBER! WHITE SUPREMACY IS BEING ASSAULTED IN OUR MIDST .\" In the face of this violence, Blacks fled the state. In 1860, the Black and white populations of Florida were roughly the same size; by 1930, whites outnumbered Blacks by more than two to one. Then came cars, and asphalt. The decades-long process of transforming Florida from the Jim Crow South into a Sun Belt Disney World involved not only destroying Black communities but also dismantling Black cemeteries, all but erasing the state's Black history. In 1945, Zora Neale Hurston wrote to W. E. B. Du Bois proposing that the N.A.A.C.P. buy a hundred acres of land in Florida, build a cemetery, and rebury the remains of the \"illustrious Negro dead.\" Du Bois wrote back, \"I have not the enthusiasm for Florida that you have.\"\n\nIf a way ahead is possible in this moment, if all sorts of people can be brought together through a door to sit down around a table and come up with something like a Belmont Report, Antoinette T. Jackson is the person to make it happen. Jackson, an anthropologist at the University of South Florida, is dazzling and unstoppable. In 2020, with funding from a university antiracism initiative, she started the African American Burial Grounds and Remembering Project. The project has brought a team of anthropologists, historians, activists, artists, poets, and storytellers to burial sites in both Tampa and St. Petersburg. (Cheryl Rodriguez is a principal investigator on Jackson's team.) They research genealogies, conduct oral histories, meet with community members and organizations, make art, tell stories, and perform poetry. A burial-grounds network? Jackson isn't waiting for federal legislation; she's doing this now. This spring, she founded the Black Cemetery Network, a research coalition that tweets using the hashtag #BlackGravesMatter.\n\nJackson, who was born in New Orleans, was an executive at A.T. & T. in Illinois when, on vacation in South Carolina, she heard stories she'd never heard before, and decided to become an anthropologist. \"I went to a rice plantation outside Charleston with my dad, and we were on a boat,\" Jackson told me. \"And something just hit me, and I knew, this is what you gotta do. Tell these stories.\" She took a leave of absence from her job, and went to graduate school. She wrote a pioneering book called \"Speaking for the Enslaved,\" about the efforts of African Americans to preserve their own heritage at antebellum plantation sites. \"Descendant knowledge needs to be on the same plane with archeological and historical knowledge,\" she told me. \"The same thing applies to the cemetery project.\" As a cultural anthropologist, she doesn't have the same attitude toward descendants as Justin Dunnavant's society of archeologists: she's not only looking for descendants with a legal claim; she's interested in the meanings people make out of places. \"One way to think about it is you network out, six degrees of separation,\" she said. \"There are the people who have people in the ground. There are the people who live on top. There are the people who own the land.\" Her work rests on all kinds of other work, including researching, unearthing, and reburying, but she has a particular gift for bringing people together around learning, the act of openhearted and honest inquiry.\n\nJackson and I got into her blue Volvo and drove across a city of pavement and palm trees. Zion, Tampa's first cemetery for African Americans, opened in 1901, at the center of a Black community on North Florida Avenue. It closed in 1920. In 1951, the Housing Authority of Tampa bought the land and then built Robles Park Village, a residential community for middle-class whites, a Sun Belt Levittown, one and a half acres of which is on top of more than eight hundred graves. Later, the housing authority opened Robles to Black residents, who now account for more than ninety per cent of the population there. Three months after Guzzo's story about Zion ran in the Tampa Bay Times , the housing authority conducted an environmental assessment. When it announced the results at a community meeting in Robles and the residents learned that they were living on the dead, people wept and screamed. Some left the room.\n\nThere is no plan to move the bodies, only a plan to move the living. Finding Zion led the housing authority to relocate all the tenants and accelerate a planned redevelopment that will expand low-income housing. The housing authority has convened the Zion Cemetery Preservation and Maintenance Society to decide what to do with the cemetery; there has been talk of a memorial and a genealogical-research center. Todd Guy, the Robles Village property manager, met Jackson and me in the parking lot and took us into his office to show us a new master plan for a mixed-income community, a lavishly illustrated, glossy, oversized book that looks as though it cost the moon. \"It is with great care and respect that we must now honor those buried within Zion and tell their story,\" it says. The Zion committee has two vacant slots, reserved for descendants. So far, committee members say, they have yet to confirm any.\n\nYvette Lewis, the head of the Hillsborough county branch of the N.A.A.C.P., wants more than a memorial at Zion. \"These people have been walked on all their lives, and now they want to rest and people still want to walk on them,\" she told me. She wants reparations: scholarships for African American families affected by the Robles Village discovery. Fentrice Driskell, the state representative, wants the whole community involved. \"In a place like Zion, if we can't find descendants it's got to be a community conversation,\" she said. \"Also, what about all the Black families who have lived in Robles over the years? What about sending these kids to college? Starting grants for Black entrepreneurs?\" But, here again, the particular strains against the universal: free college tuition and business grants are great ideas as remedies for economic injustice. Why stop at providing them to people whose families lived at Robles?\n\nJackson, Lewis, and Driskell all serve on that state task force. Its report is due at the beginning of 2022, around the time that reports and audits from committees at Penn, Harvard, and the Smithsonian are to be finalized. \"We don't want to be a road to nowhere,\" Driskell told me. \"We want the work to continue even after the task force sunsets.\" Jackson isn't worried. DeSantis? \"The Governor has sanctioned the importance of African American cemeteries,\" she told me, and smiled. \"We can go wherever we want with that.\"\n\nTodd Guy drove Jackson and me around the Robles housing project in a golf cart. We rumbled across crumbling pavement and past tipped-over trash cans and fading grass to a six-foot-tall chain-link fence that marks the perimeter of Zion. A Mylar banner, zip-tied to the fence, lists the names of the people known to be buried there, a makeshift memorial.\n\nBeyond a swinging gate marked \"Restricted Area\" lies a peach stucco ghost town. The families living on top of the cemetery have been moved out. The housing authority will relocate the remainder, about four hundred families, in the next year or two. \"The housing authority ran this place into the ground,\" Jackson whispered to me. She fears the worst. \"They'll move these people to someplace worse, make this place nice, and move other people in.\" Spanish moss drooped from an oak tree. The trees are protected, Guy explained. \"Even to prune the oaks, we have to have permission from the city,\" he said. \"We have to build around them.\"\n\nJackson looked around. A lone washing machine stood in a patch of grass. A white plastic bag fluttered on the ground. She appreciates the work that human-rights activists do at sites of conscience, but she doesn't think it fits a place like this. \"They define justice as if you build a memorial and you're done,\" she said. \" 'You've got justice. You have closure.' That's not justice. I don't want anything to get closed. I want an opening.\"\n\nIn Zion, a black screen door, unlatched, flapped in the wind. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the estimated cost of Enrichmond's planned tourist site.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Two Black Writers Debate Reparations\n\nAfter the Supreme Court effectively ended affirmative action in higher education , there's been a renewed focus on other efforts to address historic racism across American society. Celeste Headlee, host of Slate's Hear Me Out , recently discussed reparations with the Manhattan Institute's Coleman Hughes. Though he's Black and can trace his roots to slavery, the host of the Conversations With Coleman podcast adamantly rejects the idea of reparations and has testified against the concept before Congress. Headlee, who is also Black, supports the idea. A partial transcript of the conversation is reprinted below; it has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nCeleste Headlee: I found it interesting that when you testified before Congress, you began with a pretty impassioned statement saying that nothing that you said was meant to downplay the horrors of slavery. Why begin there?\n\nColeman Hughes: I begin there because an argument against reparations could easily be misconstrued as an argument that you don't care about slavery, or you don't think slavery was that bad. And I wanted to close the door to that interpretation of my view, right at the start.\n\nSo, give me the summary of your argument. You're not saying that enslaved people, especially at the end of the Civil War, shouldn't have been offered some kind of recompense-land or money-right? That's not your argument.\n\nExactly. My argument is precisely that they should have been given reparations in their lifetimes, in the second half of the 20 th century. [Ed. note: Presumably Hughes meant the 19 th century.] But once you miss the opportunity to give the actual victim reparations, the reparations claim does not survive forever. And it certainly doesn't survive down to their great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchild, which I think is the correct number of greats, in my case.\n\nYou know, people often say, \"Well, how come Black people didn't get reparations? ... The Jews got reparations after the Holocaust. The Japanese Americans got reparations for being interned in World War II.\" Well, I think that, to me, that's hypocrisy or a double standard, standing from today's vantage point, because they got reparations immediately-almost immediately after the atrocities in question. And they were actually paid to the people or their families. And so the truth is, [for] the great majority-almost all historical crimes against people, [against] races/ethnicities throughout the past, say, 300 years-no reparations have been paid for them. No reparations are ever going to be paid, and the claims have timed out.\n\nSo I think my position in Congress and my position today is the same, which is: I actually support reparations paid to living victims of the Jim Crow system in the South, or of segregation in general. This is happening in Evanston and outside of Chicago, where they're trying to identify specific individuals that were denied loans on houses because they were Black in the late '60s, and paying them specifically, or at most, their immediate family members. That I support. That's the kind of reparations I support, and is in line with my principles. What I don't support is reparations paid to descendants of slaves for slavery, which ended in 1865.\n\nThis is my favorite kind of conversation, because I so disagree with you.\n\nHere's the thing: I wonder if the comparison would hold up if they had promised Jews after the Holocaust reparations, and then refused to hand them over, which is what happened with African Americans. They were promised land; they were promised help. And then states in the federal government-partly because Abraham Lincoln was killed-simply didn't do it.\n\nThen there's also the fact that it wasn't just the Civil War that caused the trauma. If you go back through history-I mean, just in my own family history-there is story after story after story of people in my family earning land and having it stolen, sometimes through legal means and sometimes through means that were \"legal,\" but not at all ethical. There are many times when our family has paid much more for insurance, for homes, for things because of redlining, and that happened recently.\n\nWhere do you draw the line of when the harm was done? To say that they should have been paid right when the damage occurred?\n\nSo, to the first point: No, I don't think if the government made a promise in 1865 that was unfulfilled, that they therefore are on the hook for that promise. I mean, the people they promised that to are all dead, and they have been dead for a long time. That's extremely sad. It's extremely tragic. It was a miscarriage of justice at the time.\n\nI do not think that that means what was promised to those people should be given to their six-greats grandchild. And I think, frankly, that intuition is widely shared, right? Most of us literally don't know the names of our great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparents. To collect something owed to them is not something anyone-any typical or rational person-would expect, for the most part.\n\nAnd secondly, like I said, I actually support reparations paid to people in their lifetimes for harms that they or their immediate family members have incurred. And at that level, you might not even call it reparations. You may just call it damages, right? Like if laws are broken, if discrimination laws on the books are broken to your detriment, you can sue the state. And I completely support that. So if that's happened in your family, that's a quite a separate conversation, I think.\n\nWe're going to kind of dig a little deeply into all the different nooks and crannies of what systemic racism has cost African Americans. But what about the issue of simply not being able to move on? The fact that, even in political speeches, you'll hear African Americans talk about the 40 acres and a mule that were promised to them? There are really good records of land that had been taken from plantation owners in the South and given to African Americans after the Civil War ended, and they farmed it for a while, and were doing fine. And then it was taken after the federal government basically left the South and allowed the South to govern itself again. So what about this idea that reparations might help us at least close the book on that era, and focus our attention on our current situation?\n\nI think that that's naïve. I think, if it were true that reparations was going to help people move on, then it would seem to me that all of the national and state-level apologies-official apologies that have been made-would have helped some people move on.\n\nIn fact, they have had no impact whatsoever. Both houses of Congress officially apologized for slavery in 2008 and 2009. In 2004, the Senate officially apologized for the lynching of African Americans. At least eight different states-and slavery was, as you know, a states issue-have individually apologized for slavery. I have seen almost no one bring up those facts-other than me-in this conversation.\n\nAnd not only that, I've seen that make no dents at all, even though those were longtime requests from the community, the same community of people that want reparations. For years, people said, \"Please can we have an apology? Can we have national-level apology, a state-level apology?\"  The apologies come, and it makes no dent at all in the in the wound.\n\nAnd so what does that tell me? What that tells me is the wound of slavery, insofar as it is sincerely felt by people, it's not going to be healed by anything external.\n\nIt's difficult for me to think, \"Look, reparations won't help anybody because the damage happened so long ago.\" That's hard for me to really accept, because the damage is still happening.\n\nSo hold on: What do you mean by reparations? Do you mean a check? Or do you mean a package of specific policies? Because people have very different pictures.\n\nWhen I say reparations, I think it should be both, frankly, depending on the individual. But I think that the most impactful thing would be to get some actual anti-racist policies in place that dealt with inequities in the health care system, inequities in the education system, in the economic system in wages and small business loans, definitely in criminal justice and law enforcement. That would be the most impactful thing.\n\nThat's extremely complicated. Would I love it? Yes. Is it possible? I've been a journalist for too long to say yes to that. I think that aiming for some of that, and then also sending people a check to acknowledge the depth of the harm they have suffered, and the fact that they have not been able to enjoy the inheritance from their ancestors that they should have.\n\nFor example: the people whose businesses were burned out in Oklahoma, during that massacre . We [also] have the Eugene race massacre, the homes and the businesses that were destroyed in Detroit when they decided to build a freeway right through the African American part of town. Again and again and again, you see people who are not being able to build up generational wealth, because they were either murdered, it was stolen, their land was taken, destroyed-whatever it may be. So yes, some kind of recompense for the generational inheritance they lost out on, I think, is perfectly OK. But a combination of the two would be ideal.\n\nOK, so whatever anti-racist policies you think are good for the country and good for Black people: Why do you call those reparations? Is the implication that they would not be implemented but for slavery? Or is the implication that they would only go to Black American descendants of slavery as opposed to Black immigrants? Why not just support those policies without labeling them reparations?\n\nI don't think you have to label them reparations, but because it's combined with some kind of repair, monetary repair for the damage that's been done. You know, I've spent a long time looking at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that occurred in South Africa. Obviously, that didn't solve all their problems there. But I, when I think about reparations, I think about restorative justice. And whatever reparations look like, to me, they have to have some element of restoration in them.\n\nAgain, the disanalogy there is that what happened in South Africa happened between the actual individuals that experienced apartheid and the actual individuals that perpetrated it. Slave owners are dead and the slaves are dead. You know, we-alive today-could playact some truth and reconciliation-style interaction. But it's not genuine. The boat was missed; it's a tragedy. That doesn't mean that we ought to pretend that we're able to repair that today. I think we have to get on with the project of making life as good as possible for people today, based on the problems that exist today, not based on the problems that weren't solved 150 years ago.\n\nListen to the full interview.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Frank and his reparations bill, he left us a mess, that's what he did. I'ma have to be mayor a hundred more years to balance this budget. At least. [Laughing.] Imagine that. A white mayor. Spearheading a citywide reparations scheme? And you really can't call it anything other than that. Because that's what it is. Don't get me wrong, as a Black man, I'm all for gettin' paid for what I been through. But if that stack is just a steppin' stone for some white boy on his way to the Governor's Mansion? I'm good. I hope he's doing well for himself. He must not have liked this job all that much if he was willin' to throw it away so fast.\n\nSunlight cuts through the blinds of a tiny office. Bookshelves bend under the weight of monographs. More books cover the floor around a desk. Behind the desk sits a man with his glasses hanging around his neck, his mask pulled down. He wears a tweed jacket and periodically removes a handkerchief from his breast pocket to dab at his forehead.\n\nProfessor Mark Higgins, age 73, assistant professor at -- State University, former member of REPAIR Project Team :\n\nIt's impossible. It's actually impossible to pay reparations. You can look to other models across time and place-the recompense offered to slave owners, for instance, for their having been made bereft of their chattel; what Haiti has been forced to pay France for the temerity of having won its independence, etc.-but there's no real analogue for reparations paid to the truly injured parties for the totality of slavery. Some people like to point to what Germany did after the Holocaust, but the injury being addressed was the extermination of a people. The \"orbit of hurt\"-which sounds like a callous way of putting it, granted-is somewhat fixed in that example. Let's break down how exactly that plan, which looked so perfect and discrete on paper, truly unfolded.\n\nYou have the Luxembourg Agreement of 1952 and the Additional Federal Compensation Act of 1953. What did the Germans do? They paid the state of Israel for the cost of resettlement. Half a million Jewish refugees. That's what they paid for. On top of that, however, was the requirement that the moneys be used only to purchase goods produced within Germany. It's not until you get to the Federal Compensation Act of 1956 that moneys are being offered to German Jews who had suffered at the hands of the Nazi regime and their surviving dependents. There was a claim deadline of 1969. More groups became eligible in the interim with different pay schedules, but imagine the hundreds of lawyers and functionaries representing clients with divergent interests all vying for a piece of a finite pie trapped in red tape. By the time money gets to you, there's a nonzero possibility you're already dead.\n\nNow, a governmental authority could recompense people for lost property. Or, and this is something people latched onto later on, they could compensate victims for their slave labor. A few years ago, the Claims Conference and the German government announced that they would pay an amount to each of the survivors of Kindertransport. Guess what they were paid. Well, the ones who hadn't died by then. Guess. Two thousand and five hundred euros.\n\nI wrote this and much more in a report I submitted to the team behind the REPAIR Project, and I'm sure they listened, because they decided to add something more structural to that asinine personal compensation model. But they let me go ultimately.\n\nA burger restaurant. Former City Councilman Richard Perkins (age 42) and corporate lawyer Tommy DiSanto (53) sit on the patio, a plate of fries in front of each of them. Their black face masks hang from one ear as they eat. DiSanto was an inaugural member of the REPAIR Project Team. Perkins was the team ' s founder and leader.\n\nDiSanto : How did it start? I joined after I heard about it, right? Or did you reach out to me-\n\nPerkins : I think we reached out to you. Well, I reached out to you. Nobody was supposed to know about this at first. I don't think anyone was supposed to know about it, period. But, see, Tommy and I went to law school together and-\n\nDiSanto : And while Richie turned into a hotshot city politician on his way to the Governor's Mansion-hell, probably the White House with that jawline of yours-I was out here defending Halliburton. But, shit, this was easy pro bono for me.\n\nPerkins : Except, you couldn't tell anyone at the office why you had to take a sabbatical to do it.\n\nDiSanto : Because it was [air quotes] top-secret. But, yeah, I got brought in because whatever was being worked on needed to be founded on solid legal footing. Now, granted, I hadn't taken a peek at the Constitution since 1L, so I wasn't nearly the most qualified on that count, but Richie and I go back. What was it, that mixer they had all the students of color go to that one summer?\n\nPerkins : Yeah, the POC mixer. What were you even doing there? Your parents are from fucking Argentina.\n\nDiSanto [laughing]: Anyway, all I know when I say yes is that there's some social justice thing going on and there are scientists involved or whatever. Now, get this. I tell him, I tell Richie: \"I hate fucking math. Don't make me do math.\" And he tells me, \"Don't worry, I won't make you do any math.\" [Pause] I did so much fucking math.\n\nThey both burst out into laughter . But they turn away from each other to keep from spreading droplets .\n\nOpen on a darkened room. Cloaked in shadows. Against the far wall, the silhouette of a potted plant. The leaves are moving. There is an overhead fan at work. A dark shape sits in an armchair.\n\nRedacted, age 28, data scientist, member of REPAIR Project Team :\n\nI mean, it's kind of simplistic to call it the Reparations Algorithm, which is what everyone called it after the story blew up-because, of course. If you had an A.I. built to detect which moles on a body were evidence of malignant cancer cells, you wouldn't call that the Cancer Algorithm, would you? OK, maybe you would. Bad example. But people think it's just like you have this static E=mc 2 -type equation and you throw as much information at it as possible so that it, like, learns or whatever, then it spits out some intelligent decision. So they hear about the Reparations Algorithm and they immediately think, oh of course, a formula for figuring out reparations! Then they ask, well, what did you feed the formula? And then they expect you to say something like \"racism. We fed the formula 400-plus years of racism.\" Like it's that simple. There's nothing simple about racism.\n\nVoice of Wendy Guan, age 27, statistician, member of REPAIR Project Team :\n\nI don't know if I joined the Project at a late stage or early on, but I do know that our viability was tied directly to the release of funds resulting from the abolition of the city police department. During my interview, they were very vague about what exactly I would be doing, and they kept emphasizing the project's interdisciplinary nature. I think if they'd been a bit more forthcoming, I might've been too excited to be coherent. There was a real sea change happening throughout the country. Every industry, every locale, was experiencing a reckoning. I even saw in my own community the new ways in which anti-Blackness was being discussed and reckoned with. So to have the chance to be on the forefront of this new effort, this pilot project, and hopefully provide an example of what truly restorative justice looks like, I mean, who majors in statistics and expects to wind up there? Should we have expected what happened after? Maybe. But you have to understand the moment. It felt unprecedented. And, to be honest, I wouldn't take any of it back.\n\nOn a porch of a two-story house in the -- suburb, northwest of -- , there are two rocking chairs that allow their occupants to look out over a recently manicured lawn.

That's where it came from. They abolished the fucking police department, fired everybody. No job assistance, no more pension, nothing. The whole fucking thing was drained dry. And our union. Strength in numbers, right? It's all bullshit. Once the protests started, it was open season on us. Get this, you know those robot dogs that company out of Boston was making? You remember those, right? Well, they were gonna start mass-producing them to replace us. Fake dogs. Union didn't have any pull because those tech wizards were already angling for our jobs on the cheap and we lost all our bargaining power. And the way the defunding was set up, it was reverse seniority, so the younger, more diverse force got clipped first. Then when it was all us white devils left, we were easy pickings, far as the court of public opinion was concerned. I'm just over 50. Spent my life on the force. What the hell am I gonna do with the time I got left? Far as work, things had dried up, but with the virus, folks in hospitals were droppin' like flies. So I decided that was where I could help. Had to go to nursing school and everything. Paid out the ass to sit in a classroom with fuckin' kids my daughter's age. [Laughs.] But I did it. Got my degree, got my license. Now, I push a cart in a hospital. Social justice, right? I hope it's fuckin' bedlam over there without us.\n\nOn the corner of Willow and Main Street stand a group of anti-violence activists handing out cards listing candidates for an upcoming municipal election. On the back of each is a Know Your Rights checklist. Down Willow, grill smoke billows out from behind a church while older residents eat fried fish by the front entrance. Shaneika Thomas wears a mask with a clear mouth panel to enable the hard of hearing to lip-read.\n\nShaneika Thomas, age 27, crisis management systems worker :\n\nThis corner, right here? We used to practically sit on top of cops basically. Plainclothes cops would yoke up some kids here or across the street, and folks would get it on video. It would go viral, and we'd get on the cop's ass. But then he'd be back out as a white-shirt, terrorizing folks. You walk around this community and you have credibility just from having been here for long enough and from people seeing your face, so you can walk up to a group of dudes and be like, hey, \"if you're out here, and he's out here\"-meaning the cop-\"call this number.\"\n\nTwo mechanical, jet-black greyhounds with backward-jointed legs prance down the middle of the street. At each stop, they gather the nearest residents and eject thermometers that the residents use to take their temperatures. Some of the residents glance at their results. Another shakes the thermometer as if it ' s broken before trying again. Afterward, they all deposit the thermometers, coated in their saliva and DNA, into an attached pouch and drop the contained thermometer into an opening on the greyhounds ' backs.\n\nWhen the REPAIR Act went into effect, we got an infusion of cash because of where we were headquartered. But we weren't ready for that. We weren't nearly ready for that. All of a sudden, money was showing up, and people just figured it was City Hall redistributing what got freed up when they abolished the police department. At some point, I started doing the math and I realized, as big as the PD's budget was, this was more money than that. But we didn't have too much time to think on where exactly this money came from. We just knew that we got lucky and we had work to do.\n\nOf course, it didn't last, but I'm pretty proud of what we were able to do with what we had. I just wish some of that money went toward painting those dogs a different fucking color.\n\nInside a Dunkin ' Donuts on the corner of Arcade Street and Pine Street. Just outside the entrance is a waste bin and, above it, a one-time-use mask dispenser. At the top of the door frame is a scanner, taking note of the biorhythms and temperature of each entering and exiting customer.\n\nDenaun Smith, age 63, resident of -- :\n\nHell, I couldn't believe it. At first, we didn't know what the fuck was going on. But suddenly, they announce that [Redacted] High's getting what?! Millions of dollars just pouring in. Where did that money come from? How can I get a piece of it?\n\nLyle Brown, age 32, history teacher at [Redacted] High :\n\nIt wasn't millions . But it was ... a lot. Imagine my surprise when the principal calls me into his office and tells me how much money we've been given. And my immediate thought is, \"OK, I can finally afford to get enough pencils and pens and notebooks for my students!\" To be honest, I was just glad I could make sure the hand sanitizer dispensers in the hallways stopped running out.\n\nSmith : You could see it in the kids, though. That's true. It wasn't like they was walkin' around with Jordans or anything or like they was flashin' money around and whatnot. Matter of fact, I started seeing them less. Turns out they was spendin' more of they time at school.\n\nBrown : A visual arts program, a theater program. Hell, we pooled with another school and built an actual theater! Kids were using actual hand-held cameras to turn what would've been TikToks into Oscar-eligible short films.\n\nSmith : Those damn TikToks. If I'm keepin' it real witchu, I miss those kids. I mean, good for them stayin' out of trouble, but the neighborhood done changed when you ain't see them around. It's summer and ain't no 13-year-olds chillin' on they front stoop in the Fayetteville housing projects in quadruple-XL white tees and baggy jeans with they coco-mango-cherries and do-rags. A place loses its character when it ain't got that anymore.\n\nVoice of Wendy Guan : One of the first things I was told upon joining the project was that we were to focus as much as possible on tangibles. Essentially, we would look at discernible racial disparities-in housing, in education outcomes, in the number and location of grocery stories-and work backward. Our goal was to find a number. What number did we need to generate that would render all material things equal? Focusing on the racial wealth gap seemed like the most concrete way of going about things, and we operated on the assumption that housing was the most appropriate vector of analysis. So, our \"number\" would essentially be coded to a dollar amount. The data was relatively easy to come by. Much of it was public already. The tax assessor's office had home values, and then we could bucket them by ZIP code. But very quickly, we noticed something strange.\n\nRedacted : The tax assessor's office had been overvaluing homes in predominantly Black neighborhoods and undervaluing homes in predominantly white neighborhoods. And the reason they were doing this was to fund police brutality settlements. How do they get their money? Raise the property tax. The city was literally making poor people pay for every time a cop shot a Black kid.\n\nPerkins : Your average American city doesn't have the budget to pay $150 million or so in yearly settlements for officer misconduct. Yet another reason police are so expensive. What ends up happening is that the city issues a bond to a bank. Bank charges handling fees and interest that the city's on the hook for. But in return, the city now has the cash on hand to pay the victims and/or their families for the officer's misconduct. And the more money in the city budget that goes to that, the less there is for handling lead poisoning or funding schools.\n\nIn Stanley Quarter Park, children climb over a jungle gym while wearing surgical gloves and giggling behind single-use face masks.\n\nDr. Athena Davis, age 74, abolitionist and professor emeritus at -- University, member of REPAIR Project Team :\n\nChicago is illustrative, and I think a more appropriate analogue than Professor Higgins' Holocaust example. Between 1972 and 1991, some 125 Black Chicagoans-at least, that is the number of cases that are known-were tortured by police officers in a building on Chicago's South Side. Beaten, electrocuted, sodomized. Chained to boiling radiators. And they were tortured into confessing to crimes that led to prison sentences, sometimes to death row. Discrete instances of a harm. A bracketed period of time. A reparations bill eventually did make its way through the Legislature. It was revolutionary for a number of reasons, not just because it included an actual reparations fund. The amount was $5.5 million, a fraction of the $100 million that previous claims related to police torture had cost the city. But in the bill was an acknowledgement that torture had indeed taken place. There was to be a monument to the victims of police torture erected somewhere in the city. A psychological services center for survivors would be built. And there was to be a unit on police torture taught in eighth and tenth grade history classes throughout the city.\n\nInterviewer : You mentioned the racial wealth gap and housing earlier.\n\nVoice of Wendy Guan : Yes! In the aggregate sense, wealth is the value of your assets minus your debts. If we were going to focus on financial compensation, we needed something concrete as a ... prism for our analysis, so to speak. Economic disadvantages can harm your ability to accumulate wealth. And in the United States, at least, the surest way to accumulate wealth is through homeownership. And that is how we came to focus on a location-based analysis for the algorithm.\n\nRedacted : We'd programmed the algo to produce a number per ZIP code based on the values we input. That output would correspond to a scale we cooked up of dollar amounts. A lot of numbers we had to figure out beforehand. Tax assessments and foreclosure rates. Not just the number of schools, but also the number of school closures. Then there's the police part. It took forever, but through arrest records, we could trace the incarcerated back to where they had initially been arrested. We then took the settlement amounts from police brutality cases as well as the number of cases that went to trial but plaintiffs lost. Legal took care of that part. And together we extrapolated what the incarcerated might have lost in wages and married that to unemployment data. That was hell to disaggregate by ZIP code. But we had our inputs that we turned into superinputs, and then we could generate our output: the amount in dollars that would be apportioned to each ZIP code. It's \"If, Then\" with a super complicated \"If.\"\n\nOther than that, we had no idea where the money would go. But that wasn't up to us. All that decision-making was a bit above our pay grade. You gotta talk to the big guy about that, and I don't think anybody knows where he is. After everything that went down, Mayor Gaetz-or, rather, former Mayor Gaetz-kinda just vanished. Which ... I don't blame him.\n\nWhen we ran that algo for the first time for a single ZIP code, we thought there had to be a mistake. Double-checked the inputs, the superinputs, ran it again. And again. And again. We ran that algo maybe 300 times. Figured we broke the scale. But, no. That first dollar amount ... to make all things equal ... was just that huge.\n\nFormer City Councilman Richard Perkins and corporate lawyer Tommy DiSanto are finishing their lunch .\n\nPerkins : I put the team together to figure out if this reparations program was financially viable. Not just that, but whether these disbursements were something that we could keep going. This wasn't going to be a one-time check to Black folk. The REPAIR Act was sustained investment. Funds disbursed to individual households, but also location-based budget allocations for school districts. More schools and better schools. Investment in diversion programs and mental health programs. Increased sanitation. Infrastructure repair. Parks. Printer paper for libraries. Job training programs across industries. And it all had to keep going. I knew there wasn't gonna be enough money in the budget to suddenly make things right on the property end. So we co-opted the bond system. Instead of using it to finance police brutality settlements, we'd use it to fund our plan. It was gonna be impossible to get the mayor on board with this if we had to come up with a new system from whole cloth to base our funding on. But if we could use what was already there and flip it-we already had the data operation going from his campaign-then he could see where we were coming from and where we were going.\n\nDiSanto : I've never done so much math in my whole entire life.\n\nVoice of Wendy Guan : We were already thinking to the distant future. A city changes. The algorithm needed to be able to change with it.\n\nI was watching a little girl ride her bike the other day, and I think this provides the best example for what I'm trying to explain. I don't have to explain that a bicycle has two wheels or even that you ride the thing by pushing your feet to the pedals in a circular motion. The girl just knows these things. But figuring how to ride a bicycle-how to balance without falling off, how to deal with ruts in the road-that's a different kind of knowledge. Skill-based. You're learning . This little girl kept trying to get up this tiny, tiny hill. She would stall at the steepest part, then fall backward. Then, at one point, as she's trying to make her way up, she leans forward. Just a little bit, then a little more. Finally, after she crested the hill, she goes back to how she was sitting before. No one told her to do that.\n\nBefore, algorithms had been operating toward the knowing of a specific thing. \"Knowing that,\" so to speak. But machine learning is focused on knowing how . A basic algorithm recognizes the thing in front of it as a bicycle. But machine learning is what gets you up the hill. We had the algorithm for the initial disbursement, but we needed it to recognize that a city changes. Would our algorithm know what to do with a new refugee population moving into a targeted neighborhood? When the districts are inevitably redrawn, will it still operate with the same sophistication? If half of a ZIP code is replaced with luxury condominiums? What would the algorithm decide to do?\n\nWe didn't have the time or resources to program A.I. to do that, so we took those decisions on ourselves. How much of the dollar amount would go to schools? What to do with home valuations? Maybe ... maybe if we could've got the algorithm to handle all of that, things would have turned out differently. Maybe the algorithm could've decided better than us.\n\nThe REPAIR Act was signed into law in February of 20 - and disbursement of funds began on June 19 of that year, traditionally the holiday known as Juneteenth.\n\nSandra Ewing, 37, former resident of -- :\n\nThat first check come, I called my sister. She lives on the other side of town, and I asked her where this came from. She ain't heard nothin' 'bout a check, but pretty soon, I found out everyone on my block got one. Same amount, too. It wasn't unemployment. Wasn't a tax refund or nothin' either. You had a job or you didn't, you got a check. Found out just about everyone in my neighborhood got a check. There were a couple other neighborhoods like that too, but not everyone in the city got one. There was some letter in there about a new law got passed, but I just wanted to see what the catch was, you know what I mean? It was a blessing, though.\n\nFirst chance I got, stocked up on food and fixed the microwave. Still had money left over, so I got to have someone come through and deep-clean the apartment. Was supposed to be regular, because of city health regulations, but can't nobody in that building afford to completely sanitize their homes once every week. I figured the check was a one-off, so I was just focused on keeping my son, Jeremy, fed and safe.\n\nBut the checks kept coming, several months in a row. So I started socking some away, and suddenly, you turn around and look at your bank account just [blinks dramatically and laughs]. You know what I'm sayin'? I'm still countin' every penny I spend on this family, but I ain't gotta worry about eviction if suddenly the toaster break or there's a leak in the apartment that needs to be fixed or this or that or whatever thing. Your thinking changes. Before, I'm just trying to make it to the 1 st or 15 th without my boy starving. But then you get to thinking about things like moving, like Jeremy being in a better school. The schools here seemed to be gettin' some money, but it's nothing like what they got just outside the city. So I'm finally able to take some time off from work, after not having missed a day in 21 years. And I go looking at apartments. Condos. That sort of thing. Imagine that! Me! Shoppin' for condos!\n\nThe neighborhood was starting to change too. I think we figured out pretty quickly that the checks were comin' to specific neighborhoods. And, yeah, money was goin' to the community, but fixin' up a school building, making sure there are enough soap dispensers in the halls, improving the curriculum, the school lunch program, all that takes time. That's time a lot of us don't have. So I got out. Couldn't get out quick enough. Landlord saw the market and started jackin' up the price soon as he could. So we moved. Me and my Jeremy picked up and set out. He loves his new school, but the checks stopped coming. I'm working two jobs instead of three now, but it's getting harder to keep Jeremy in that school. We ain't even talking about college.\n\nThey're saying the checks back home stopped coming too. Money was comin' for about a year, then stopped. By then, everybody done up and moved, and now the rent's too high to move back. So we're stuck.\n\nProfessor Higgins : You need to understand that reparations are a national redemption project. A government can print money, as much as it wants. Don't listen to economists. They're wrong. But a place built on the backs of others needs all of its decision-makers to acknowledge the totality of the wrong. It goes beyond money. That's why the Project ended the way it did. Were reparations a simple game of numbers, all you'd need is the magic number, and you'd be fine. But everyone on that team was so besotted with the whole thing that they failed to see just what they were truly up against. For such a redemption project to work, you need this country to admit that it was wrong. And someone will always come along and see Black Americans being given their due and want nothing more than to destroy it. They can't countenance any other reality. I tried to tell this to Councilman Perkins' team. But no one wanted to acknowledge just how deep the problem went.\n\nAsking an algorithm to do what they wanted it to do would be to assume racism is logical. \"If, then.\" Now, racism has its own internal logic, sure, but it is the logic of nightmares. You can't automate its reasoning.\n\nCouncilman Perkins and his team thought others would see what this city did and want to follow suit. But I knew that others would see what this city did and want to turn it to dust.\n\nNine months after the REPAIR Act was signed into law, following a series of protests at the state Capitol led by prominent conservative activists, the governor released a statement disavowing the legislation. A recall effort against Mayor Gaetz was initiated, and, six months before the end of his term as mayor, Frank Gaetz was removed from office on the grounds of misallocation of government funds.\n\nThe City Council selected Councilmember Robert Caine to finish Gaetz ' s term. Caine was subsequently reelected.\n\nIn a modest backyard, a white man in rolled-up shirt sleeves packs the soil behind a fence from which light green sprigs poke. He does this with care for several silent minutes, rises, then dusts his hands off and walks up his back porch. The body scanner framing the back entrance beeps as he passes through, then announces his temperature in red analog numbers.\n\nThe inside of the sitting room is just as modest. Sunlight shines through the west-facing windows to bounce off the glass covering a table designed to look like a hollowed-out tree trunk, gilding half of the man sitting in the chair facing the camera in profile. He ' s still wearing the dirty overalls and the shirt sleeves from earlier. His gloves lie on his lap. The pose looks practiced.\n\nFrank Gaetz, 47, former mayor of -- :\n\nThis may sound trite and I don't mean it to, but writing the statement announcing the initiative was actually the most difficult part. I'm not discounting the work the team did. But it all falls apart if the statement isn't right. You only get one shot at this. I remember the presidential primaries. And the reason the socialist lost to the centrist among Black voters in South Carolina in 2020 was, as told to me by a Black Carolinian, that voting for the socialist would require the Black community to believe that white people were capable of doing something they've never done before: willingly and openly share in the economic bounty of this country. I needed to convince them that we were there. But I also needed to convince my white constituents. And if this whole effort was dressed in machine neutrality, if I could say \"blame the algorithm,\" then maybe we could get away with the whole thing. Maybe it would feel a little bit less like a heist.\n\nI was prepared to be the meat-shield here. If anything, it almost seemed like that was the point of the job. The team that Richie Perkins put together was formed sort of ad hoc. It was very Avengers. [Chuckling.] All of us from these different disciplines-lawyers, statisticians, historians, activists, politicians, even the medical professionals we consulted with-when they realized what Richie was doing, none of them balked. None of them thought it was impossible or too difficult. They all had the imagination for it. And it was my job to have the stomach for it.\n\nRichie had brought the team together on his own, and they worked in secret, then prepared a report that landed on my desk. Richie and I talked for a long time. About the contents, then about the rollout, about who would get what and when. Before I knew it, I'd bought in. I didn't even realize, but he'd converted me to the cause of reparations. And he knew it had to be me. It had to be the white guy.\n\nIt wasn't just that white constituents would listen to me with less resentment than they would feel if it were coming from a Black mayor. It was the righting of things. A white guy does it and it feels less like theft and more like penance.\n\nYou look at the state the country was in at the time, it seemed like everything was getting torn down. And there's me: young, rising star in the Democratic Party, not yet so progressive that the Establishment can't sink its claws into me, but not so far bought that I can't be pulled further to the left. And this opportunity lands on my desk in the form of this report. I used every bit of political capital I had to get the other city council members on board. Comptroller, all of them. Reminded me of that Supreme Court case, Brown v. Board of Education . You know why Chief Justice Warren worked so hard to get a unanimous decision? Anything less might've led the South to start another Civil War.\n\nSo there it is, all laid out there. How the dollar amounts were calculated. The mechanisms through which the funds should be disbursed. Further funding methods. All of it. And all I had to do was take credit.\n\nDuring the recall effort, the names of the participants behind the initial REPAIR report were leaked. As a result, statistician Wendy Guan ' s visa was revoked. She now lives in her native China.\n\nDeath threats were issued against Dr. Athena Davis and the team of data scientists with which she had worked after they were doxed.\n\nCouncilman Richard Perkins was charged with corruption and misuse of public funds. The charges were subsequently dropped. Shortly thereafter, he resigned from his position on the City Council.\n\nTommy DiSanto is currently a managing partner at Kittle & Loving and head of its pro bono practice.\n\nRedacted ' s whereabouts are currently unknown.

      "text": "The U.S. Stole Billions From Haiti. It's Time to Give It Back.\n\nHaiti is in desperate need after a devastating earthquake, a hurricane, a presidential assassination, and not enough vaccines to stop the delta variant. International aid is pouring in, which is all good, but not good enough.\n\nIt is time to ask about what Haiti is owed -not in terms of international benevolence or moral duty, but as a matter of basic legal rights and principles. Many think of Haiti as a debtor nation, but the fact is that former colonial powers might be the ones legally in debt to Haiti. And the basis for that debt is not just a generalized grievance about colonial domination, but something much more tangible: Haiti once had something of great value, and the United States took it. That something is a small, uninhabited, rocky island covered in a million tons of sun-baked bird poop.\n\nThe island of Navassa is about 30 miles off the coast of Haiti and is covered in centuries' worth of accumulated bird droppings-guano. Sometimes referred to as \" white gold ,\" guano is a potent fertilizer that in the mid-1800s was a scarce resource for which American farmers were desperate. Peru had large amounts of the stuff, but its near monopoly position and special deal with Britain meant that American farmers were priced out. In 1850, guano was $76 a pound-a quarter of the price of gold at the time. The situation was so dire that President Millard Fillmore devoted portions of his 1850 State of the Union address to the subject.\n\nTo solve the problem, the U.S. resorted to a kind of privatized colonialism. The Guano Islands Act of 1856 (which, incredibly, is still on the books) authorized American entrepreneurs to search the world and seize unclaimed islands anywhere that guano could be mined. The key implication was that the might of the U.S. Navy would back up Americans' claims.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, administration of the act was-pardon-a shit show. A State Department analysis in the 1930s concluded that many of the islands seized under the act actually already belonged to other nations, and the U.S. has quietly returned many of them over the years.\n\nNot so with Navassa. In 1857, Haiti was not yet mining the guano on the island in its backyard, but when American entrepreneurs claimed the island, Haitians protested. The U.S. responded by sending its navy to Port-au-Prince to tell the Haitians to stay away from Navassa.\n\nSuch behavior is not surprising. In 1857, the U.S. did not even recognize Haiti as a nation, even though it had become independent a half-century earlier (having been forced to literally purchase its freedom from France). The fact that Haiti emerged from a slave revolution was offensive and scary to many American politicians, who feared that recognizing Haiti would encourage enslaved people in the U.S. to think of their own revolution.\n\nHaiti, for its part, has continued to quietly maintain its claim to Navassa-the constitution of Haiti even says so. But Haiti's near-vassal state relationship with the U.S. over the past century-and-a-half has meant that no Haitian government has been willing to bring formal claims for the unlawful taking of its property.\n\nIn ordinary life, if someone takes your property and keeps it by threat of force, the law is supposed to provide a remedy-generally the return of the asset and monetary compensation for the opportunity costs of having not had use of the asset. Even if the government takes part of your land for public use, you're constitutionally entitled to just compensation. So why not Haiti? Some might object that historical injustices at a certain point become too attenuated or complex to remedy with money-that is a common argument against reparations for slavery, or the illegitimate conquest of inhabited territory, or pillaged art. Haiti has plenty of those larger claims as well .\n\nBut maybe we can start small, with the taking of that little island covered in bird droppings. Navassa is a tangible, transferable piece of real property that was taken from Haiti at a time when it was covered in one of the world's most valuable assets. Whether we call it a debt, damages, reparations, or an offer to settle a disputed claim, it is long past time for the U.S. to pay up.\n\nAnd how much is the bill? Some back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that it's pretty substantial. In 1857, it was estimated that there were a million tons of guano on Navassa, piled between one and six feet deep . Using conservative estimates (and assuming no further deposits by seabirds), the million tons would have been worth about $2 billion in today's dollars. And if that money earned a return rate of between 1 and 3 percent per year for 170 years, we'd be looking at between $10 billion and $260 billion. That wouldn't solve all of Haiti's problems. But it would be a step toward remedying what we've taken.\n\nJoseph Blocher and Mitu Gulati are faculty in the law departments of Duke and U. Virginia respectively.

      "text": "What Americans Need to Know About Reparations Ahead of This Week's Big Hearing\n\nOn Wednesday, a House Judiciary subcommittee will hold the first congressional hearing in more than a decade on the subject of reparations. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author of the 2014 essay \" The Case for Reparations ,\" and actor Danny Glover are scheduled to testify at the hearing, which will focus in part on H.R. 40, a piece of legislation that would establish a commission \"to study and consider a national apology and proposal for reparations for the institution of slavery, its subsequent de jure and de facto racial and economic discrimination against African-Americans, and the impact of these forces on living African-Americans.\"\n\nEarlier this week, four leading scholars joined Slate to discuss what they hope to see from the hearing, why they believe reparations are necessary, and what a successful reparations commission might hope to establish. Marcia Chatelain is an associate professor of history and African American studies at Georgetown University; she participated in the school's Working Group on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation . William A. Darity Jr. is a professor of public policy, African and African American studies, and economics at Duke University, who has written extensively on the economics of reparations. Stephanie E. Jones-Rogers is an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of They Were Her Property: White Women as Slave Owners in the American South . Roy E. Finkenbine is a professor of history at the University of Detroit Mercy. His work studying 18 th - and 19 th -century reparations cases was featured in Coates' essay.\n\nTheir conversation, which began with a discussion of what they hope to see in Wednesday's hearing, has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nMarcia Chatelain: I hope the committee hearing can do three things: 1) Make clear that the reparations movement has long existed, and that the question of recompense is based on 19 th -century deliberations about accountability. 2) Make clear that there are a number of financial tools and instruments available for us today to use as a vehicle for reparations. I think that this helps clarify the misguided notion that this is too difficult to do in the present. 3) Recognize that reparations do not end a conversation about the pervasive legacy of white supremacy, racism, and slavery in the United States. Rather, it provides an opportunity to deepen the discourse on breach and is a gesture toward repair for a problem that can never be fully reconciled.\n\nWilliam A. Darity Jr.: I would like the hearing to make it clear that a program of reparations must designate black American descendants of persons enslaved in the United States as recipients, that a primary goal of a reparations program must be elimination of the racial wealth gap, and that the injustices that form the basis for the reparations claim must include slavery, nearly a century of legal segregation in the United States, and ongoing racism manifest in police executions of unarmed blacks, mass incarceration, and employment discrimination.\n\nRoy E. Finkenbine: I'd hope to hear several things Wednesday. First, that reparations can come in many forms, including acknowledgment and apology for past wrongs, but that part of the suffering involved can also be monetized. The continuing racial wealth gap from slavery and other oppressions means that the past dramatically affects black Americans' well-being today. Black Americans, historically 12 percent of the population at any given time, had 1 percent of the national wealth in 1865, and 2 percent a century and a quarter later. Experts tell us that at the current rate it will be 228 years for racial wealth to be equalized. Second, all of this [wealth disparity] is inherited. Timothy Dwight [the president of Yale College from 1795 to 1817] noted that all Americans \"inherit ... [the] incumbrances\" of their ancestors when it comes to past oppressions. Even families like mine, which had little to do with slavery, segregation, etc., have historically benefited from white privilege. The impact is multigenerational. Third, reparations claims have historically been based on Western, democratic, and Judeo-Christian values. And fourth, reparations advocacy has a history dating back to the 18 th century. It's not new or strange.\n\nDarity Jr.: It's critical that the history of the reparations movement itself be brought into congressional deliberations. The black American demand for reparations is at least 150 years old.\n\nChatelain: I also hope that someone speaks to the viability and importance of direct cash aid, which is a controversial topic for some. In the conversations surrounding Georgetown's history of slaveholding, I hear that scholarships, admissions, and other mechanisms that are aligned with the university should serve as reparations. I think that these mechanisms-due to the narrow population a school like Georgetown admits and teaches-are fine, but I believe in actual financial compensation. The notion that reparation monies are earmarked for specific purposes is somewhat paternalistic, and it creates a framework for determining the \"right way\" for reparations to operate.\n\nDarity Jr.: Marcia is on point! It's peculiar that no one has complained about direct payments being made to Japanese Americans for unjust incarceration during World War II, or direct payments being made to the victims of the Holocaust. Somehow that issue always comes into play when reparations for black Americans are the topic of consideration. Ironic? Regardless, for both substantive and symbolic reasons, direct payments to eligible recipients must be an important part of a reparations program, particularly if a major objective is to eliminate the racial wealth gulf.\n\nStephanie E. Jones-Rogers: Members should also underscore that reparations are not about holding individuals responsible but rather redressing the myriad ways that the federal, state, and local governments-in the South and in the North-benefited from and upheld slavery and orchestrated circumstances that made slavery's perpetuation possible.\n\nDarity Jr.: Just a small proviso on Roy's comment about the 228-year projection. The study in question does not say black and white wealth will be equalized in 228 years; it says, under current conditions, it will take 228 years for blacks to reach the level of wealth currently held by whites. To close the racial wealth gap, we need to move the black share in national wealth from 2-3 percent to 12-13 percent. That should be a central objective of a reparations program for black Americans. That's also a great point from Roy on the importance of understanding the impact of black oppression on white advantage, regardless of whether individual whites come from families directly implicated in slavery or the slave trade.\n\nJones-Rogers: I also think it is vital that those speaking before the committee remind them/the public of the fact that the federal government had no problem with compensating slave owners for emancipation while not allocating a dime to the enslaved. The D.C. Emancipation Act of April 1862-which I discuss in my book and which Tera Hunter discussed in a recent op-ed in the New York Times -actually paid slave owners a set amount for eligible slaves if they applied for it and offered proof of ownership. In addition to this, Lincoln's September 1862 Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation called for compensating slave owners in all states that voluntarily agreed to emancipate black Americans.\n\nDarity Jr.: It is important to note, though, that D.C. is the only site where compensated emancipation actually was undertaken.\n\nJones-Rogers: Absolutely, William! My point was that the federal government was quite comfortable with the idea of compensating slave owners, even if slave owners and slave states refused such proposals for compensation.\n\nChatelain: Talitha LeFlouria's book about black women and convict leasing is an excellent illustration of the federal commitment to reparations to the South. The rebuilding of the South [after the Civil War] was an economically intensive effort to make Southerners whole and further linked Jim Crow to the needs of the state and private industry.\n\nI will say that having been an observer on the issue of reparations on my campus, the word reparations can inspire a lot of feelings of defensiveness and shame.\n\nFinkenbine: Contemporary white Americans say they'd support reparations for slavery if only black Americans had raised the issue at the time of emancipation. They conveniently forget 40 acres and a mule, the slave pension movement, and other claims.\n\nDarity Jr.: In our forthcoming book on reparations, From Here to Equality , Kirsten Mullen and I argue that a key dimension of a reparations program must be addressing historical memory. We need to ensure that young people receive an accurate and comprehensive curriculum on slavery, the Civil War, the Reconstruction Era, and the post-slavery world in America. We need a complete and detailed counterpoint to the false narrative that the United Daughters of the Confederacy has installed in our nation's schools.\n\nChatelain: You are all getting to the heart of the matter: a real lack of historical knowledge on slavery coupled with a deep contempt for accountability. In light of all my cynicism, I appreciate that this conversation, and its complexity, has so many people to help frame it.\n\nJones-Rogers: The ADOS (American Descendants of Slaves/Slavery) movement is a powerful one, even if many academics seem inclined to dismiss it. And I think that the broader discussion about/around reparations will ensure that the ADOS movement can't be ignored for much longer. Members argue that American descendants of slaves have not been the primary recipients/beneficiaries of the gains experienced by African-descended people in the U.S. since emancipation, and they call for policies/programs that will change this. H.R. 40 seeks to address the question of who will be eligible.\n\nDarity Jr.: The key point being made by ADOS is that blacks who have enslaved ancestors in the U.S. have a particular diaspora history that merits restitution from the federal government for a full trajectory of harms dating from slavery to the present moment.\n\nJones-Rogers: In my book, I talk about the important role that former slave-owning women, and their immediate descendants, played in constructing a narrative about their relationships to slavery in which they were depicted as maternal figures who cared for their \"black charges,\" individuals who were \"born\" into slave ownership and thus indirectly benefited from having access to enslaved people's labor, bodies, and the wealth they produced (many women hired the slaves they owned to others and pocketed the wages they earned), or flat out argued that African-descended people were uncivilized savages who benefited from slavery because it introduced them to Christianity and civilization. All of these ideas bubble underneath the surface of reparations debates, particularly those who argue against reparations. The hearing will expose some of these lies, I hope. Experts will hopefully speak about the lived experiences of enslaved African Americans and about the brutality of the regime.\n\nChatelain: When I tell my students the wealth gap statistics, they gasp. Then, I walk them through all the assets that can be passed down generations, and we talk about value.\n\nDarity Jr.: Again, I set as a key target elimination of the racial wealth gap. The idea of \"baby bonds\" was developed by Darrick Hamilton and myself. It's a universal program providing a federally funded trust account to each newborn infant. The amounts would be dictated by the wealth position of the child's family and become available to the child when they reach young adulthood. Sen. Cory Booker has a version that does set constraints on possible uses of the funds, but it is possible to design the program with no restrictions.\n\nBut, regardless, baby bonds are not reparations . Baby bonds center on getting everyone closer to the median level of wealth in the U.S., which is approximately $97,000 per household. (Black median wealth was estimated to be $17,600 in 2016.) But to close the racial wealth gap, you need to target the mean difference in net worth. At the mean, the average white household has $800,000 more in net worth than the average black household. Baby bonds cannot approach closing that gap, much as I like the proposal. Reparations are a must to achieve that goal.\n\nJones-Rogers: I have major concerns about just how far any of these conversations will go in large part because of the government's long-standing refusal to commit to protecting human rights more broadly and the government's recent refusal to embrace initiatives that seek to draw attention to the violation of African-descended people's rights more specifically.\n\nDarity Jr.: Michael Dawson and Rovana Popoff estimated that in 2000, 4 percent of white Americans were in favor of reparations for black Americans. In 2016, a survey indicated that percentage had risen to 15 percent-and a survey last year found that close to half of millennials and a majority of Democrats favor reparations. I think that a report from a commission activated by legislation akin to H.R. 40, if the right people are appointed as commissioners, can move a still larger share of Americans into the favorable column.\n\nFinkenbine: Those are hopeful numbers. One thread that I see throughout our chat is the need to better inform the public about slavery, segregation, and historic inequality.\n\nJones-Rogers: I'm kinda fascinated that this issue is being taken up in the way that it is in the Trump era. The 2020 election may provide us with the confluence of circumstances necessary to move the conversation in the direction of action rather than mere talk.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Racism Cannot Be Reduced to Mere Computation\n\nA historian of technology and race responds to Tochi Onyebuchi's \" How to Pay Reparations .\"\n\nTochi Onyebuchi's \"How to Pay Reparations\" spoke to me . Its themes rang virtually every note of my twentysomething-year-long career. In 1998, I made my first digital footprint with a signed online petition in support of reparations for the Tulsa race riots. I endured countless run-ins with Oklahoma good ol' boys while crisscrossing the state, working for candidates representing a perpetually losing political party. As an academic, I researched Black politicians and white racial resentment, and testified as an expert in federal court about cases of reverse redlining and housing discrimination. And as a historian of technology, I've chronicled-like Onyebuchi-the stories of hope and despair wrought by computing technology on Blackness and Black people, in the service of an ever-triumphant white racial order.\n\nAmerica has never seen an acceptable way forward on the question of reparations. If we even get past the \"whys,\" we get twisted and tangled up in the \"how-tos.\" But in \"How to Pay Reparations,\" REPAIR Project Team statistician Wendy Guan says that's precisely what algorithms, A.I., and machine learning are good for: showing us how . And that is where the hope, the wonder, the fantasy comes from in Onyebuchi's story. We learn that a team of data scientists, statisticians, politicians, and lawyers have finally developed a \"reparations algorithm.\"\n\nSome view reparations as white America's ticket to redemption from its original sin and Black America's salvation from a 400-year-legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, and structural racism. But no amount of computational power can save white America's soul, or restore Black Americans' long-foreclosed-upon and deferred dreams. The belief that it can is at best a delusion. At worst, it is another in a long line of sick and sadistic tortures designed to inflict Black pain and suffering by ginning up false hope in technologies that have always worked against us.\n\nThroughout the story-particularly beginning when Mayor Bobby Caine said: \"Imagine that. A white mayor. Spearheading a citywide reparations scheme?\"-I was reminded of James Evans, the patriarch of the Black family on the '70s sitcom Good Times . If Evans had walked in at the beginning of the show with a fat check, his ticket out of the ghetto, you'd best believe the family would be back to eating cold oatmeal in the same damned housing project by the end of the episode.\n\nWe live in a time when we conjure tools to surgically remove bias from A.I.-driven facial recognition systems by feeding it more representative training data-a time when we deploy A.I. models to optimize profit but also weed out discrimination in mortgage lending decisions ( though not so well ). Why does the resounding hope and tragic failure of Onyebuchi's so-called reparations algorithm seem so inevitable? Why are A.I. and its allied technologies so ill-equipped to produce a solution for reparations and racism? The answer lies in Onyebuchi's powerfully affective political docudrama.\n\nNeither reparations nor racism can be reduced to mere computation. When building the algorithm, Wendy was told to \"focus on the tangibles.\" We can quantify and model things like historical income disparities. Education outcomes. Geolocations of valuable institutions like grocery stores, hospitals, or banks. But Redacted, Onyebuchi's data scientist, said it best. When asked, \"What did you feed the algorithm?\" Redacted responded: \"They expect you to say something like 'racism. We fed the formula 400-plus years of racism.' Like it's that simple.\"\n\nExactly. How do you measure the loss of an Anthony Crawford , lynched because he was an uppity Negro? How do you measure who Mrs. Mary Turner might have been or what the baby in her belly might have grown up to do and be were their lives not stolen by a lynch mob's noose? How do you quantify being left behind? That's what happened to the Negro former farmworker whom civil rights activist Roy Wilkins was thinking of when he wrote, \"The computer is but one more signal that he has been kept at arm's length while the rest of America pressed forward into the computer era.\" But all of this-the violence, the economic toll, the psychological toll-is also nebulous and unquantifiable in the same way that we cannot account for, much less model, the moral turpitude, and the social, economic, and political loss of what might have been possible.\n\nSure, we can imagine designing an algorithmic system to sustain the direction and process of reparations by dynamically \"learning\" from future data. The problem is, there is no way to arm that algorithm to learn and account for America's racist past.\n\nBut what makes us think that A.I. won't be mobilized to work toward anything but the detriment, rather than the interests of, Black people, anyway? The threatening robot dogs that stalk Onyebuchi's neighborhoods-even if they are intended as pandemic surveillance, the residents know that they have other capabilities-already have analogues in today's world. Some of them come in the form of facial recognition systems that police use to locate and arrest protesters, or algorithms that utilize stereotypes about Black athletes' brain function to defraud them of compensation for head injury. Add these things to the now all-too-familiar credit scoring algorithms that deny Black and brown folks access to employment, recidivism algorithms that keep us locked up, and detainment algorithms that divide immigrant families, just to name a few? Nah. No hope in that.\n\nThe REPAIR Project Team devised its algorithm. Councilman Perkins made a plan and got it passed. And all an ambitious white mayor had to do was to step up and take the credit. And he couldn't even do that, much less convince white people to do something they had never done before-\"willingly and openly share in the economic bounty of this country.\" The story's ending, not to mention the criminal roll-up that scrolled through the credits, says it all. Change here requires a deliberate, revolutionary rebalancing of social, economic, and political power. To even think seriously about doing that requires an exercise of collective human will. And there is no algorithm for that.\n\nFuture Tense is a partnership of Slate , New America , and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Rep. James Clyburn on âthe Case for Reparationsâ\n\nPhoto by Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nIn the latest of my weekly Weigelcast interviews , I talk to Rep. James Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in Democratic congressional leadership. The impetus for the interview was Clyburn's new memoir, which covers his life from youth to the civil rights era to the work of a Democratic Congress under the first black president.\n\nBut, as always happens, some tape got left on the cutting-room floor. After talking a bit about the legacy of Jim Crow, I asked Clyburn if he'd read Ta-Nehisi Coates' much-praised cover story in the Atlantic , \"The Case for Reparations.\" He was finishing it up, he said.\n\n\"Most people are asked this question and get it wrong,\" said Clyburn. \"Most people believe that when the former slaves were granted 40 acres and a mule-most people believe they got it. They never got it. Congress, by law in 1872, made sure they never got 40 acres and a mule. That was a part of reparations, so the country has never committed itself to righting the wrongs committed on the slaves. Some, for whatever reason-and there are various and sundry reasons-were successful. Most of it had to do with who their parents were.\"\n\nClyburn told a story as a way of demonstrating the advantages that separated prosperous blacks from the people re-enslaved under Jim Crow. \"Robert Smalls, who served here in the Congress for 20 years, was very successful and created great wealth. How'd he do that? For one reason, he stole the USS Planter and delivered it to Union soldiers. He was rewarded financially for having done so, and he built that into significant wealth. There are some who believe he was the son of Peter McGee, the slave master, whose home he was raised in, and that that is why he was granted the opportunity to go to Charleston and work on the docks ... now, the money he made was coming back to Mr. McGee, but he had some experiences that allowed him to navigate the Planter once he stole it. You come to the conclusion that a lot has to do with happenstance of birth.\"\n\nTop Comment\n\n\"he stole a planter\"??? Dave, did you even think to ask yourself what this means?   He stole THE Planter. Capital P, because it's a name. He stole a gunboat--he stole the Planter. More...\n\n-Emthaphoros\n\nJoin In\n\nWas there a new need for a legislative or fiscal remedy? \"I've always said that affirmative action was a form of reparations. I've always said that and I believe that. The extent to which the courts have been getting rid of affirmative action was the same reason you had the court in 1872 taking away 40 acres and a mule.

      "text": "\"Where There's an Injustice, We Cannot Afford to Forget It\"\n\nOn a recent episode of Amicus , Dahlia Lithwick was joined by Judge Edward M. Chen and Don Tamaki to discuss the shameful legacy of Korematsu v. United States , in which the Supreme Court held that the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II was justified. Chen and Tamaki were members of the legal team that succeeded in clearing Fred Korematsu's name in 1983, almost 40 years after his conviction. They also discussed what lessons we can draw from the case about reparations and forgiveness today. A small portion of their conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, appears below.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: I want to ask you both whether there's a way to think about everything we're talking about with Korematsu and this larger conversation we're having right now in this country about reconciliation, about the possibility of getting back to truth, about the possibility of making amends and reparations and finding our way back to shared values. What do we learn from what you've learned about Korematsu, reparations, forgiveness, and working our way back?\n\nDon Tamaki: The lessons of the Japanese American incarceration, of course, focus on people losing their freedom and their property. But ultimately, I think what we're talking about is what is this culture, and you mentioned racism being a part of the founding of American history. And we're really talking about a culture that normalizes behavior. One of the great contributions of the Black Lives Matter movement is to shine a light on not just police brutality but systemic racism.\n\nAnd with one police shooting after another of young black men, it would barely evoke a shrug until the George Floyd killing. Why? Because it was normal. And again, the Korematsu case, when that happened, rounding up of these Americans was completely normal. That was so logical and so expected that by the time the case came up to the U.S. Supreme Court, of course you have to uphold it. That was the pressure of the day.\n\nAnd so, Ed talked about how this culture is accomplished. I think there are three parts to this playbook, and it's a playbook that tyrants have used since time immemorial. One, appeals to prejudice, two, fearmonger and scapegoat, and three, trafficking conspiracy theories, falsehoods, and alternative facts. And when you combine all of those three things, where facts don't matter, where the press is the enemy of the people, a culture that says Mexicans are drug dealers and rapists. Muslims are terrorists. Chinese bring disease. Any number of these things, once they become normalized and they grip the culture, then almost anything is possible. And we can look to Germany in the 1930s. We can look to contemporary countries now that are experiencing what's called populism, which is really authoritarianism and the rise of dictatorships. And the dangerous thing is we're seeing these elements of this thing infecting our own democracy. And it's happened in the past before, but never on this scale.\n\nJoseph McCarthy in the '50s was an example who understood demagoguery very well, but we've never had it at a presidential level. And what is going on now with not just certain people but large portions of the population, including our representatives, engaging in challenges to the election process where literally no facts exist to do that and not understanding the danger in the long run is very frightening. And I think it's on us really to raise that issue.\n\nJudge Chen, I wonder if you have a final, oh, maybe somewhat more optimistic or sanguine take- although, I'm with Don, I find us in a worrying moment-but just on the possibility of reconciliation correcting the record justice.\n\nEdward M. Chen: There are two things that come to mind. First, one of the lessons I think we've learned from Korematsu is that where there's an injustice, we cannot afford to forget it. And the fact that people continue to labor to bring about justice for 40 years after what happened in the '40s to Japanese Americans, really, this is an example where it's made a difference. That consciousness never died thanks to the work of Don and many others in the movement.\n\nAnd the fact that the court in Trump v. Hawaii in 2018 had to deal with Korematsu tells you that that tale was not over, that ghost was still there, that injustice still had to be addressed. And I think we've learned throughout history, both here in this country and elsewhere the value, for instance, of truth and reconciliation commissions and everything else. We cannot let an injustice just go away and be forgotten. We need to be reminded of it so that we can do better.\n\nSecond, and maybe this is coming from a partisan as a judge, but I have a deep and abiding faith in the courts, notwithstanding their imperfections, notwithstanding the many instances of terrible decisions that we can think about, whether it's Dred Scott , Plessy , or Korematsu . It is still the institution where at least as an ideal we're bound by the rule of law, that law matters more than who the people are before it. It's to be applied with equal justice. And that we put a premium on truth. And even though the court failed, I think, in the Korematsu case, that was not the ideal. The ideal remains that we seek the truth.\n\nAnd I think that's a model for society generally, where we act on accuracy and truth, where we abide by the notion that we're a nation of laws and not people, or that the laws are to be applied with equal application, equal justice. I think they still represent the beacon of hope for our society. I still have faith. I have to have faith because that's my job, but I still have faith in the courts, because what I see day in, day out, what I do, what my colleagues do with an earnest effort to go about to find the truth and to do justice.\n\nNow, it is true, there's an ongoing debate that's been going on for hundreds of years and will probably continue about the role of the courts, how much they should play in terms of oversight and checking the other branches, what the scope of review should be. Are there times when the courts should defer in certain situations? And those are fair debates. And again, that debate between Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sonia Sotomayor is a good illustration of that. And I think that discussion needs to go on. We need to be conscious of it, and we need to argue about it. And it is so critical, so critical to our society. But I continue to have faith in our courts as an institution, and that can sort of show us the right path in terms of how we can go about and become a fairer and more just society.\n\nUpdate, Jan. 4, 2021: The introduction to this post has been updated to include more background on the Korematsu case.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Throne of Blood\n\nIn Britain , as in the United States, the anti-racism protests that have erupted since the police killing of George Floyd in late May have reinvigorated campaigns for reparations for slavery. Having only recently acknowledged their historical links to slavery and the trans-Atlantic slave trade, British universities and London financial institutions are facing calls to make amends for past injustices and pay reparations to the descendants of enslaved people.\n\nBut one institution has remained silent: the British monarchy. Still, it's no secret that the history of the British royal family is intertwined with slavery.\n\nThe slave-trading initiatives endorsed by the English monarchy began with Queen Elizabeth I's enthusiastic support of John Hawkins' slaving expeditions in the 1560s. In three separate voyages backed by government officials, London merchants, and the queen, Hawkins raided African settlements on the West African coast and seized hundreds of enslaved captives from Portuguese ships. In defiance of Portugal's dominance over the European slave trade in Africans, Hawkins sold his cargo of African captives in the Spanish Caribbean. After his profitable second voyage, the queen honored Hawkins with a coat of arms and crest featuring a nude African bound with rope.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nDuring the reign of King Charles II, from 1660 to 1685, the Crown and members of the royal family invested heavily in the African slave trade. Seeking to bolster the wealth and power of the restored monarchy and to supplant the Dutch in the Atlantic trading system, Charles granted a charter to the Company of Royal Adventurers Into Africa, a private joint-stock company, less than six months after ascending the throne. The charter gave the Royal Adventurers a 1,000-year monopoly over trade, land, and adjacent islands along the west coast of Africa stretching from what was then known as Cape Blanco (western Sahara) in the north to the Cape of Good Hope in the south. The king lent the company a number of royal ships, including a vessel called the Blackamoor , and reserved for himself the right to two-thirds of the value of any gold mines discovered. Controlling English trade with West Africa-in gold, hides, ivory, redwood, and, ultimately, slaves-offered the prospect of a revenue stream that would enable the Crown to gain financial independence from Parliament.\n\nFrom its founding, the Royal Adventurers benefited from royal connections and the Crown's political and financial backing. More than half of the original beneficiaries of the first charter were peers or members of the royal family, including the king himself. The company's intimacy with the royal family proved particularly attractive to investors seeking to profit from a trading monopoly with West Africa and the sale and exploitation of African men, women, and children.\n\nIn 1663, the Royal Adventurers received a new charter explicitly granting the company an exclusive right among English traders to purchase enslaved captives on the West African coast and transport them to the English colonies in the Americas. Sponsored by the king's inner circle and politicians and courtiers expecting to use the African trade for personal profit, the fledgling company set out to deliver thousands of African captives to the English Caribbean. Upon disembarking, Africans who survived the horrors of the middle passage were sold to English buyers or to foreign traders looking to acquire slaves for transshipment to Spanish America. By March 1664, the company had delivered more than 3,000 enslaved men, women, and children to Barbados and 780 African captives to Jamaica.\n\nIn England, new coins minted from African gold, known as \" guineas ,\" entered circulation, stamped with an elephant-the distinctive emblem of the Royal Adventurers-under the monarch's head. The message to the public was clear: The king had successfully expanded English interests in Africa, enriching the mother country and strengthening its Atlantic empire.\n\nThe company's initial success was short-lived, however. In 1665, the Royal Adventurers ran into financial difficulties resulting from mounting unpaid debts owed by colonial planters who had purchased African captives from the company on credit. The arrival of a Dutch naval force intent on retaking forts on Africa's Gold Coast further eroded the company's tenuous position. Commercial rivalries with Holland over control of the African trade sparked the Second Anglo-Dutch War from 1665 to 1667. With the company's finances in tatters and its business disrupted, competing English merchants moved in, helping to sustain the supply of enslaved Africans to England's plantation colonies. Faced with insolvency, the Royal Adventurers was dissolved in 1671 in favor of a new monopoly trading company.\n\nBy the time King Charles II granted a charter to the reorganized Royal African Company of England in 1672, the demand for slave labor in the Americas had intensified. Ensuring a steady supply of African captives to England's Caribbean and North American colonies promised not only to generate profits for shareholders and the Crown but also to expand England's imperial footprint in the Atlantic world.\n\nAs English planters in the Atlantic colonies clamored for more enslaved Africans, English enslavers profited and the African slave trade expanded. \"The Royal African Company of England,\" notes historian William Pettigrew , \"shipped more enslaved African women, men, and children to the Americas than any other single institution during the entire period of the transatlantic slave trade.\" The company's seal captures how English enslavers, with Crown encouragement, eagerly harnessed the lives and bodies of Africans to generate commercial wealth and build an overseas empire. The seal shows an elephant bearing a castle, flanked by two enslaved African men. Surrounding the figures is the company's motto: Regio floret patrocinio commercium, commercioque regnum (\"By royal patronage commerce flourishes, by commerce the realm\").\n\nFrom its founding in 1672 to 1688, James, the Duke of York (the future King James II), served as the governor of the Royal African Company and its largest shareholder. James also held the position of Lord High Admiral, which enabled him to exercise punitive power over anyone who challenged the company's monopoly in West Africa or the English colonies. So intimately intertwined was the English monarchy with the slave trade that the company left a permanent mark of royal ownership on the bodies of the enslaved: Before their departure for the Americas, African captives were branded on the right shoulder or breast with the letters D.Y., for the Duke of York, or R.A.C.E., for the Royal African Company of England.\n\nThe Glorious Revolution of 1688-89 dethroned King James II and undermined the privileged position of the Royal African Company. With the company's royal patron out of the picture, English merchants seeking access to West African markets and colonial planters demanding greater numbers of enslaved Africans at lower prices eroded the company's attempt to maintain a monopoly. In 1698, Parliament opened the slave trade to all English traders; independent traders were required to pay a 10 percent duty to the Royal African Company to help maintain its African forts. When this act expired in 1712, an official era of free trade began. Millions of Africans were captured, torn from their families, forcibly transported across the Atlantic, sold to the highest bidders, and subjected to physical, psychological, and sexual violence by their enslavers.\n\nDuring the peak years of the Atlantic slave trade, between 1690 and 1807, European enslavers carried approximately 6 million enslaved Africans to the Americas; almost half of these captives arrived in British or Anglo-American ships. Protected by the Crown and Parliament, the slave trade became one of Britain's most profitable industries. The production of popular, labor-intensive agricultural products such as sugar, tobacco, cotton, and coffee in the Atlantic colonies hinged on the regular supply of African captives. The vast majority of enslaved African men, women, and children were destined for the sugar fields of Brazil and the Caribbean islands.\n\nAs the British Atlantic empire became more reliant on the labor of enslaved Africans, critics of the slave trade and colonial slavery were marginalized or dismissed as radicals. Meanwhile, enslaved men and women took matters into their own hands, struggling against slavery and racist colonial regimes from below. By running away, refusing to work, feigning illness, and rebelling collectively, over and over again, enslaved Africans and their descendants made it clear that their lives mattered. Some people of African descent who gained their liberty joined the transnational abolitionist movement and made both anti-slavery and anti-racism central to their mission.\n\nDuring the lengthy reign of King George III, from 1760 to 1820, Atlantic slave uprisings and a multiracial coalition of abolitionists transformed the British public's view of the slave trade at the same time the Crown supported its continuation. The pro-slavery views of the king and his sons bolstered the efforts of the London Society of West India Planters and Merchants to delay the abolition of the British slave trade for nearly two decades. George's third son, Prince William (the future King William IV), served in the Royal Navy as a teenager and was the first member of the royal family to visit Britain's North American and Caribbean colonies. While stationed in Jamaica, William witnessed colonial slavery firsthand and approved of what he saw. In 1799, William, now the Duke of Clarence, delivered his maiden speech in the House of Lords against the abolition of the slave trade. Printed by the pro-slavery lobby and widely circulated, his speech was viewed by many Britons as representative of the attitudes of the royal family.\n\nBut not all members of the royal family supported the slave trade. George's nephew and son-in-law Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, allied with the abolitionists in Parliament and became a vocal anti-slavery supporter. After the British Parliament outlawed the slave trade in 1807, Frederick served as the first president of the African Institution, an abolitionist organization founded to enforce the Abolition Act and promote \"civilization and improvement in Africa.\" William Frederick worked closely with leading English abolitionists such as Thomas Clarkson and William Wilberforce to influence the major European powers to follow Britain's lead and abolish slave trading.\n\nAlthough the Slave Trade Act of 1807 had made it illegal for British subjects to buy or sell African captives, demand for slaves remained high in the Caribbean, Brazil, the Spanish colonies, and the United States. After 1808, as the illegal slave trade flourished, European enslavers transported millions of enslaved Africans to the Americas, many in ships built, financed, or outfitted in Britain.\n\nIn the decades after the abolition of the British slave trade, enslaved and free people of African descent petitioned the Crown repeatedly, seeking royal intervention on their behalf in their quest for liberty and civil rights. These petitions largely fell on deaf ears. Even after Parliament passed the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, which ended slavery in the British Caribbean, Mauritius, and the Cape Colony (South Africa), enslaved people did not immediately receive their freedom. The negotiated settlement required enslaved men and women to continue to labor for their former masters as unpaid \"apprentices\" and also granted 20 million pounds in compensation to Britons with financial interests in slavery. Formerly enslaved people and their descendants received nothing, other than recognition of their status as free subjects of the British sovereign.\n\nAfter 1838, with both slavery and the apprenticeship system at an end in Britain's Atlantic empire, the British monarchy publicly supported the anti-slavery cause for the first time. In May 1840, Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's husband, accepted an invitation to serve as the president of the Society for the Extinction of the Slave Trade and for the Civilization of Africa. A month later, he delivered a brief opening speech at the first international anti-slavery convention held in London. According to eyewitness accounts, when the prince appeared onstage, the crowd of 5,000 or 6,000 people cheered wildly; his remarks could barely be heard above the tumult. \"Everyone seemed to link with his presence and feelings, those of her Amiable Majesty the Queen,\" Thomas Clarkson later recalled, \"and received him as tho' (independent of his own professions) he was conveying the feelings and sympathies of her much loved Majesty to her loyal and humane subjects.\"\n\nVictoria and Albert acquired an international reputation as humanitarian reformers yet simultaneously oversaw an expanding empire rooted in the racial subjugation and exploitation of subaltern populations in the Americas, India, Africa, and Asia and throughout the Pacific. A self-proclaimed anti-racist, Victoria became the patron of Sarah Forbes Bonetta (born \"Aina\"), an orphaned child of Yoruba descent and a princess of the Egbado clan in West Africa. After her parents were killed by King Ghezo of Dahomey, Aina was kept as a state prisoner until a Capt. Frederick E. Forbes arrived on board the Bonetta in June 1850 to advocate for the suppression of the slave trade. Forbes negotiated for Aina's release as a \"gift\" for the queen and transported her to England; there Aina was stripped of her Yoruba name and christened Sarah Forbes Bonetta. Later on in Victoria's life, her close friendship with Abdul Karim , her Indian secretary, led to friction in the royal family and scandalized the nation.\n\nVictoria's relationships with \"Sarah\" and Abdul-romanticized, respectively, in the PBS series Victoria and the film Victoria & Abdul -offer examples of how, since the 19 th century, the British Crown has sought to rehabilitate its reputation by distancing itself from slavery and racial prejudice-a rehabilitation that Prince Harry's marriage to the Black American actress Meghan Markle in 2018 has since tested. In recent days, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have argued that, in light of the Black Lives Matter movement, it's time for Britain to address its \"uncomfortable\" past. But the British monarchy continues to refuse to recognize its historic ties to the slave trade and racial oppression.\n\nOfficially acknowledging that the royal family both fostered and profited from the enslavement of millions, and affirming a commitment to reparatory justice as the Caribbean Community has urged the governments of Britain and Europe to do, is the very least the present-day British monarchy owes to the descendants of enslaved people.\n\nThe Crown's act of willful forgetting demonstrates how easy it was to overlook-then and now-the pivotal role played by the royal family in accelerating England's involvement in the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the development of an Atlantic empire built on the backs and blood of African and Indigenous people.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What White Catholics Owe Black Americans\n\nGeorgetown University's attempt to reckon with its history should prompt American Catholics to think about theirs.\n\nGuillaume Louyot/Thinkstock\n\nTwo years ago, Ta-Nehisi Coates reignited long-standing debates around reparations. His case for reparations details the moral and material debts Americans have accrued from centuries of profiting off of systemic racism. The country will never be whole, Coates argues, until Americans reckon with the fact that \"America begins in black plunder and white democracy, two features that are not contradictory but complementary.\" Reparations, in this formulation, involve a recognition of the nation's complicity in past and present oppression as well as concrete actions to rectify those historic wrongs, to pay down those debts.\n\nAs a scholar of Catholics in the United States and as a white Catholic myself, I am keenly aware of the fact that white Catholics-the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Catholic immigrants from Europe-are among the most forceful critics of reparations. None of my ancestors owned slaves, the counterargument goes, so why should I be held responsible for paying someone else's debt? Even if I could be connected to slavery , critics often add, be practical . What would reparations even look like 153 years after emancipation?\n\nI've thus been following recent events at Georgetown University with avid admiration. Georgetown, the oldest Catholic and Jesuit university in the United States, spent the past year confronting its complicity in the institution of slavery. University President John J. DeGioia convened the \"Working Group on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation\" in September 2015. It was already well-documented that past president and Jesuit priest Thomas F. Mulledy had authorized the sale of 272 enslaved people in 1838 to finance a failing college, slaves owned by Maryland Jesuits. The working group unearthed the extent to which this sale propelled Georgetown's future success, identified the descendants of the slaves sold to Deep South plantations, organized teach-ins to educate the Georgetown community on these legacies, and made recommendations to the president on how best to make amends for benefits reaped from the trade in flesh.\n\nRachel Swarns, who has covered this story closely for the New York Times since it started one year ago, reported on Georgetown's plans \"to atone for [its] slave past\" on Sept. 1. The steps Georgetown plans to take read as if they are a direct response to would-be naysayers of slave reparations. What would reparations even look like? Well, Georgetown plans to rename buildings that honor the presidents involved in the infamous 1838 slave sale after Isaac Hawkins, one of the 272 enslaved people sold, and after Anne Marie Becraft, a black religious sister and educator. And to establish an Institute for the Study of Slavery and Its Legacies. And to dedicate a public memorial to the enslaved who built the school. And to offer preferential admissions treatment to the descendants of those enslaved people. Dr. DeGioia discussed these recommendations in a formal apology he delivered on the behalf of Georgetown University to a room with descendants of slaves in the audience.\n\nThe R-word has been largely absent from the university's public statements. The working group and president seem to prefer the language of \"truth and reconciliation\" and \"atonement.\" Nevertheless, Coates noted in a tweet that \"Folks may not like the word 'reparations,' but it's what Georgetown did. Scope is debatable. But it's reparations.\" One can indeed criticize the nature and the scope of the restitution. Some descendants of the enslaved, for instance, have called for descendants themselves to have a more active role in the decision-making process and have argued for more extensive scholarship support, among other things. Yet it is hard to dispute that this is an attempt to make reparations. In fact, the working group specifically quoted Coates' contention that \"Reparations would mean a revolution of the American consciousness, a reconciling of our self-image as the great democratizer with the facts of our history.\"\n\nThis \"revolution of the American consciousness\" is at the heart of the case I want to make for reparations, a case I make precisely because I am a white Catholic. It would be all too easy to draw the wrong conclusion from Georgetown's reparations, modest though they may be. It is tempting to celebrate this moment in American Catholic history as a triumph, to enjoy some self-congratulation. We can all comfortably condemn the \"original evil that shaped the early years of the Republic,\" as Dr. DeGioia called it. But what about the evils of the centuries that followed? What of the present? How are white Catholics complicit in the crisis facing black women, men, and children today -when black people die at the hands of the police and the state in numbers reminiscent of Jim Crow-era lynchings, when we have to demand that black lives matter in the face of a society that insists otherwise? Do Catholics have a unique responsibility to make reparations for racial injustice in America? Even those Catholics who have no direct connection to the slave trade?\n\nThere are different ways to answer these questions. We could take a theological approach, perhaps quote Catholic social teaching that speaks of all human beings as members of the one mystical body of Christ or names racism as a moral evil. But plenty of Catholics don't attend church regularly, let alone read pastoral letters or theological treatises. What I want to do is talk about the history that white Catholics inherit here in the United States. I want to talk about the history I inherited from my mother and my grandparents and great-grandparents. Being \"Catholic\" today means many different things to many different people. But the story I'm going to tell is one we white Catholics share regardless of whether we consider ourselves \"devout\" or \"lapsed,\" cultural Catholics or \"practicing.\" It is our historical inheritance.\n\nThere are certain myths about American Catholicism, stories white Catholics have told (and continue to tell) themselves, that have aided and abetted attempts to exempt us from complicity in racial injustice in the United States. I've already hinted at one of them, the idea that Catholics can be absolved of America's \"original sin\" because most Catholics immigrated toward the end or after those 250 years of slavery.\n\nBettmann/Getty Images\n\nAnother counterargument, still compelling to many, is the fact that white Catholics have their own story of exclusion. Our people arrived after slavery, the story goes, and when we arrived we were persecuted. We were strangers in a strange land. Our churches and convents were burned, we couldn't get jobs, we were lampooned in political cartoons, and immigration restrictions were passed to stem the tide of our coming. The white Protestant majority considered us foreigners incapable of being true Americans. But this story is not a tragic but a triumphant one. Over the better part of a century, Catholics rose from despised foreigners to the most patriotic of Americans. By 1960 we even had a Catholic in the White House to show for it. This is the story that white Catholics like to tell ourselves-I know not only because I study Catholics but also because it is the story I told myself growing up. Considering this history, why indeed should the descendants of oppressed, working-class European immigrants owe anything to the descendants of slaves?\n\nThis story is not untrue, but it is incomplete. Catholics were considered outsiders for much of their history here in the United States. And, Catholics did , by and large, become indistinguishable from other Americans as far as things like education, occupation, and social status were concerned. But race and racism are almost always absent from this story. We white Catholics have tried to distance ourselves from the inheritances of our history here in America. We have hoped to hold onto an American identity untainted by the sins of racial injustice. What is missing from this story is the cost of our transformation, \"the price of the ticket,\" to borrow a phrase from James Baldwin. White Catholics count ourselves among the greatest beneficiaries of the American dream and thus dare not think, let alone speak aloud, the fact that our Dream was built on profits plundered from Black women, men, and children.\n\nOne hundred years ago, most Catholics in the United States were either immigrants or their children. Catholics were an immigrant working-class people who lived in inner-city ghettoes. And they were considered outsiders for precisely these reasons. Their religious identity marked them as separate, as did their ambiguous racial status, which was very much up in the air at the time. Italian Catholics like my grandfather and great-grandfather-along with other Catholic immigrants from southern and Eastern Europe-may not have been black, but they weren't quite white either.\n\nSo how did Catholic immigrants become white Americans? One historical moment provides clear insight into this question: the years following World War II. The distinguished service of Catholic soldiers in the first and especially the second World War placed American Catholic patriotism virtually beyond reproach. And, like many veterans returning from war, Catholics took advantage of the opportunities offered by the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (popularly known as the G.I. Bill). The federal government provided World War II veterans with financial support to attend high school and college, low-cost loans to buy new homes and start businesses, even unemployment compensation. Catholic college attendance skyrocketed. Catholics soon began to get middle-class jobs at nearly the same rate as their Protestant counterparts. And this rise in income also afforded Catholics the opportunity to move out of the isolation and poverty of the inner city and into their own homes in the suburbs-suburbs subsidized by the federal government. Federal policies facilitated Catholic achievement the American dream.\n\nThere are things typically left untold in this story, however. Not all Americans could avail themselves of the opportunities available to my grandfather and his Catholic classmates. The G.I. Bill was designed to accommodate Jim Crow segregation in the South. Black veterans who had just fought the same war for freedom halfway across the world now faced the indignity of being denied freedom at home. Only a fifth of the black veterans who applied for educational benefits actually received any. As the federal government subsidized white Catholic mortgages in the suburbs, they denied mortgages to black people and redlined real estate in black neighborhoods. As the federal government supported the children of Catholic immigrants in their quest to escape the inner city and achieve the elusive American dream, it denied the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of slaves those same opportunities. In a real sense white Catholics invested in institutionalized injustice, even if they were unaware that their rise out of ghettoes was predicated on the building of black ones. Whether or not individuals like my grandfather were conscious of their investment, the effect was the same: The descendants of Catholic immigrants reaped the profits of racism. (Ira Katznelson's ground-breaking book When Affirmative Action Was White: The Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America is among the best resources on this subject.)\n\nOf course, there are countless examples of white Catholics fully conscious of their attempt to enforce and maintain white supremacy in America. When, against all odds, black Americans fought for those very things that fueled the rise of Catholics-quality schooling and homeownership to name just two-white Catholics were often at the front lines of the resistance. When Martin Luther King came to Chicago in 1966 to fight against racist real estate practices, he faced mobs of white Catholics chanting \"white power,\" pelting him with bottles and rocks. King, who had been beaten and arrested and jailed across the South later said he had \"never seen anything so hostile and so hateful\" as what he'd seen in Chicago. When attempts were made to forcibly desegregate public schools and housing that isolated black Americans in poverty (in cities like Chicago and Boston and Yonkers), Catholics came out in droves to protest. White Catholics wrote letters to their archbishops insisting that they would withdraw their children from parochial school and refuse to donate to the church unless their bishops withdrew their support. Priests and laypeople banded together in neighborhood organizations to fight off what they perceived to be the \"invasion\" of their turf by black Americans. Black families who tried to achieve the same dream white Catholics had were welcomed with bricks and firebombs. White Catholics have left a catalog of hate in the historical record.\n\nWhat's the point of revising this history? My point is not to condemn white Catholics as irredeemable \"racists.\" History, as I'm trying to tell it, is more complicated. White Catholics received support for college education that was denied blacks. This didn't mean that my Italian Catholic grandfather didn't pour over his books and work late into the night to please his professors. White Catholics benefited from discriminatory housing policies that allowed them to buy homes while it locked blacks into blighted neighborhoods. This didn't mean that my grandfather didn't work overtime or worry about paying his mortgage to care for his wife and five kids. When we rush to simplistic, categorical judgments we can miss the fact that white Catholics were, after all, nothing more or less than human beings who lived and suffered and died like everybody else. But hard work and suffering, living and dying does not absolve us from responsibility. It's what makes us responsible in the first place.\n\nWhite Catholics share responsibility for making reparations for racial injustice because we share in its history. We invested in it and profited from it. We continue to invest in it and profit from it. White Catholics must acknowledge our shared history and embrace its consequences. This is what Coates has in mind when he maintains, \"we must imagine a new country. Reparations-by which I mean the full acceptance of our collective biography and its consequences-is the price we must pay to see ourselves squarely. ... What I'm talking about is a national reckoning that would lead to a spiritual renewal.\"\n\nA real reckoning with our past calls for nothing short of \"a radical revolution of values,\" to quote Martin Luther King. But that's just where the revolution begins. If the quest for reparations at Georgetown teaches us anything it is that a new country, imagined or otherwise, must make concrete commitments to close the values gap, as Eddie Glaude calls it , between how white and nonwhite peoples are valued in our society. In his address, Dr. DeGioia noted the \"substantial financial impact\" of the university's plans to atone for its complicity in slavery. It is well past time for white Catholics to reconcile ourselves to the fullness of our history and the consequences it has for us today. It is time for us to pay our debts. This country can no longer afford for us to forget.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

A movement to secure payments for descendants of enslaved people rages on.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nIllustration by KaCeyKal! for Vox\n\nPart of the Juneteenth issue of The Highlight , produced in partnership with Capital B .\n\nBorn into slavery, Henrietta Wood was legally freed in 1848 in Ohio when she was about 30. She only basked in that freedom for five years.\n\nIn 1853, a white sheriff empowered by the fugitive slave law abducted Wood and sold her back into bondage, taking her on a journey from Kentucky to Mississippi and finally to Texas, where she'd toil on a plantation through the Civil War. Though President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Wood did not regain her freedom until 1866, months after Union soldiers traveled to Texas on June 19, 1865 - Juneteenth - to enforce emancipation.\n\nWood - whose pathbreaking story was only recently surfaced - returned to Ohio and sued her abductor for $20,000 (worth more than $440,000 today). In the lawsuit, she claimed that because she had been abducted, sold back into slavery, and lost wages (about $500 per year), she was entitled to payment.\n\nAfter eight years of meandering litigation, 12 white jurors in a federal courtroom in Cincinnati found Wood's claim valid and assessed her damages at $2,500. The final decision was just a pittance compared with what Wood demanded, but 144 years later, it remains the largest known payment ordered by an American institution in restitution for slavery.\n\nWood's story was widely covered at the time for its singularity, but fell out of the news as white Americans tried to distance themselves from slavery and its aftermath. Yet the questions that Wood's victory raised then are the same ones hanging sullenly over America today.\n\n\"Who will recompense the millions of men and women for the years of liberty of which they have been defrauded?\" an 1878 New York Times article about the court's decision asked. \"Who will make good to the thousands of kidnapped freemen the agony, distress, and bondage of a lifetime?\"\n\nWhat the writer recognized was the growing call for reparations that began at the close of the Civil War and continues to this day. When slavery ended, the federal government promised to provide \" 40 acres and a mule \" - an idea proposed by Black leaders at the time - to nearly 4 million recently freed men and women. The effort would have redistributed land previously owned by the Confederates, giving the formerly enslaved a chance to own their own land and become economically self-sufficient - until the government, after Lincoln's assassination, reneged .\n\nThat early proposal helped establish the concept of reparations as compensation to be paid to Black Americans for slavery. When it was overturned, the struggle for reparations only grew. Activists such as Callie House led a movement after Reconstruction and into the early 20th century to demand pensions for poor and aging formerly enslaved people, suing the federal government and arguing that it owed ex-slaves $68 million. HR 40, a federal bill named after the federal promise more than 150 years ago for 40 acres of land, was introduced in Congress to task a commission to study and develop reparations proposals, but it has floundered in the House for more than three decades, leaving advocates wondering why America is still keeping freedom out of reach.\n\nAt the beginning of May, a coalition of organizers, including the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America (N'COBRA), Color of Change, and the Black Voters Matter Fund, sent a letter to President Joe Biden to demand that he create a federal commission by Juneteenth to study and develop reparations proposals for Black Americans. (The administration had not responded to the coalition by the time this article was published.)\n\nThe demand, the continued organizing for racial justice, and the recent recognition of Juneteenth as a day of national importance calling for solemnity as well as celebration, have all brought a new wave of urgency to the centuries-long reparations debate.\n\n\"We need something much more substantive than the Juneteenth federal holiday. We need reparatory justice, and we need it now,\" said Nkechi Taifa, the director of the Reparation Education Project, a nonprofit organization that teaches about reparations, and one of the signatories of the letter. \"Our communities are crying out for it. Our communities are demanding it.\"\n\nOver time, a more comprehensive reparations framework has emerged. In addition to cash payments, true reparations would be a program of \"acknowledgement, redress and closure for a grievous injustice\" including \"slavery, legal segregation (Jim Crow), and ongoing discrimination and stigmatization,\" economist William A. Darity and folklorist A. Kirsten Mullen argued in their 2020 book From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century .\n\nDecades of demands on the federal government to atone for the harm it inflicted on enslaved people - and the resultant racism, discrimination, and segregation that cripple the Black community today - haven't moved federal leaders to act, not toward acknowledgement nor apology, nor toward the kind of redress that economists say would be necessary to level the field for Black Americans.\n\nDarity and Mullen estimate that restitution in the form of direct cash payments would cost the American government $10 trillion to $12 trillion , or about $800,000 for each eligible Black household. The payments could eradicate long-standing racial disparities in wealth , health, income, education, incarceration rates, and overall quality of life, experts have argued.\n\n\"We don't have reparations right now because America isn't sorry. We have not had an adequate apology for slavery,\" said Edgar Villanueva, founder of the philanthropic organization Decolonizing Wealth Project, which funds reparative giving efforts. \"There's a deep-seated fear of even the word reparations and a related scarcity mindset around America's unwillingness to grapple with its history that connects back to colonization. So instead, we're experiencing the rewriting of history, the banning of books, and a fear of truth-telling.\"\n\nIf the federal government's commitment to reparations is doubtful, at the local level, a movement is gathering.\n\nAsheville, North Carolina's city council established a Community Reparations Commission in 2020. That year, Providence, Rhode Island's mayor signed an executive order to pursue a \"truth-telling and reparations process\" in the city; Burlington, Vermont, established a reparations task force; and Wilmington, North Carolina, considered doing the same . The following year also saw momentum: California launched its reparations task force in 2021, while separately, a group of mayors, Mayors Organized for Reparations and Equity, pledged to pay reparations to small groups of Black residents in their cities to show the federal government what is possible. Greenbelt, Maryland, voters approved a commission to study reparations, as did Detroit voters and the New York state assembly.\n\nOther forms of repayment that some have called reparations are worth noting. This year, in Evanston, Illinois, 16 Black families were selected at random from a pool of applicants to receive up to $25,000 in tax-free grants that can be used to pay for a home, pay off a mortgage or make home improvements. Almost 100 years after California seized a Black family's Bruce's Beach property via eminent domain, the state agreed to return it to the descendants of the family who owned it. Finally, a judge last month ruled that the three known living survivors of the 1921 Tulsa white mob massacre could move forward with their lawsuit seeking reparations, despite motions by the defendants, including the city of Tulsa, to dismiss the case.\n\nIf local leaders can find the space to grapple with reparations, why can't the federal government?\n\nAt a federal level, President Biden's evolving stance on reparations illustrates the country's glacial pace of change and glaring unwillingness to engage in the reconciliation that would bring healing and closure to the people it has harmed.\n\nIn a 1975 interview , he criticized the idea: \"I do not buy the concept, popular in the '60s, which said, 'We have suppressed the black man for 300 years and the white man is now far ahead in the race for everything our society offers. In order to even the score, we must now give the Black man a head start, or even hold the white man back, to even the race.\"\n\nAs Biden campaigned for the presidency in 2020, however, the nation saw what may be the largest uprising against systemic injustice after a white police officer murdered George Floyd in daylight, and he embraced the idea of studying reparations. But in the past two years, as he navigated his priorities and failed to garner enough congressional support to pass some of his biggest agenda items, his administration has put the idea out of view.\n\nBeyond the few local lawmakers and federal officials who already back HR 40, support for reparations in general remains low. In 2014, 68 percent of Americans polled by YouGov opposed financial payments to Black Americans as compensation for slavery, Jim Crow, and redlining, while only 15 percent supported them. Recent polling found similar results. In 2020, 63 percent of Americans polled by ABC News and the Washington Post opposed cash payments, while 61 percent were opposed in 2021. Yet in 2020, at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests, more people than ever (76 percent of Americans surveyed) agreed that racial discrimination is a big problem in the United States.\n\nSmaller-scale local programs help keep the reparations dialogue going - and may bring the country closer to a wider-scale reparations program - but they fall short of the country's national imperative.\n\n\"No amount of material resources can ever compensate for what Black folks went through. Whatever ends up happening is going to be a negotiated settlement,\" Taifa said. \"Whether [reparations make] a material difference or not, the fact is there's a debt that is owed and a debt that is due. If I choose to just keep the money under my pillow and never do anything with it, that's my right.\"\n\nMajor questions motivate the activists and thinkers pushing for reparations. Where would the descendants of enslaved Americans be if it weren't for the more than 200 years of forced labor? Does the United States want to live up to the ideals and exceptionalism it has touted for centuries?\n\nMore than any logistical quandary about reparations, these questions lie at the heart of the fight. They get to the center of what America represents and whether it has the power to truly change. \"Our national debt is already now up to around $26-27 trillion given the money we're spending on Covid,\" Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute, told CNBC in 2020 about paying reparations. \"And we're losing more money because we're not picking up the revenue because economic growth is so slow right now. This hardly seems the time to burden the economy with more debt, more taxes. Essentially what you want to do is stimulate economic growth for all our benefits.\"\n\nBut most reparations advocates agree that stimulus plans that stand to boost all Americans won't close the Black-white wealth gap. They note that the formation of the republic after slavery intentionally excluded the formerly enslaved and their descendants in the decades after. During the Reconstruction era, Blacks were routinely disenfranchised, while the New Deal and GI Bill later also failed to fully include Black people. Even the passage of civil rights legislation didn't open the door for America to fully grapple with racism.\n\nQuestions about who should be eligible for reparations and how much ought to be paid remain.\n\nSome believe that only descendants of people enslaved in the United States who can prove their lineage - that at least one ancestor was enslaved - can be eligible. (California's task force, for example, decided that only residents with direct lineage to people formerly enslaved in America should be eligible for reparations.) The plan mapped out by Darity and Mullen adds that eligible recipients must pass an identity standard - they must be able to prove that they self-identified as Black, Negro, or African American for 12 years prior to the enactment of a reparations plan.\n\nOthers believe that eligibility must be more inclusive, arguing that Black people who are third, fourth, and fifth generation in the United States could be part of the global network of enslavement that saw their ancestors enslaved in the Caribbean or South America. They, too, have suffered under American racism and discrimination. \"The system of enslavement was intertwined to the point that we do not know and could never know for certain if one's ancestor was not harmed by US enslavers and the US government based on a geographical North American residence of enslavement,\" N'COBRA activists wrote in a memo.\n\nThere's also discussion about the window for the reparations claim. Should 1619, the year enslaved people landed in Jamestown, Virginia, be the beginning date for the claim, or the year 1776, when America was founded?\n\nWhat would constitute reparations? Some have argued that reparations don't have to be direct cash payments but can take the form of programs like housing vouchers, as in the case of Evanston, Illinois, or educational grants, as in the case of Georgetown University. The university has said it would help the descendants of enslaved people pay off school debts, an effort to contend with the fact that its founding relied on stolen Black labor. Some warn, however, that these limited programs can muddy efforts to secure federal cash payments. \"Reparations seems to be all over right now, but as we have these discussions, we have to be cautious to not to water it down or let [reparations] be co-opted,\" Villanueva said.\n\nMany also believe that there is a grave need for a \"truth-telling\" effort that makes way for an apology: Without acknowledgment and a formal apology from the federal government, there can be no closure. Though Henrietta Wood got money that helped her raise her son at the turn of the century, she never received an apology from the man who re-enslaved her. Nor did she get an apology for being born into a system that reduced her to bondage. Instead, Wood's abductor tried to deny his crime and even boasted about growing famous for having bought one of the \"last slaves\" before the end of slavery.\n\n\"He cannot escape the law, which will follow him and his property into the remotest nook of the Republic,\" the New York Times wrote of Wood's captor.

Could reparations be the answer?\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe growing, and sometimes conflicted, calls for cash payments to achieve parity and better health outcomes, explained.\n\nby Julia Craven and Margo Snipe, Capital B\n\nIllustrations by Carlos Basabe for Vox\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Capital B .\n\nIn 1972, two social workers set Debra Blackmon's sterilization in motion.\n\nThe primary diagnosis in her medical records read : mental retardation severe . Soon, Blackmon would undergo a total abdominal hysterectomy, a procedure, sanctioned by the local government, to remove her uterus and cervix.\n\nShe was 14.\n\nSince 1929, the state of North Carolina had been signing off on forced sterilization for those they deemed unfit to have children. Through its eugenics programs, the state sterilized more than 7,600 people, under the notion that halting reproduction by \"mentally defective\" people would benefit society.\n\nWhile white people made up the majority of sterilizations prior to the 1960s, Black women were disproportionately targeted for the state-sanctioned surgeries in the later years of the program.\n\n\"It was heart-wrenching,\" says Bob Bollinger, the attorney who represented Blackmon and a handful of others with similar stories in separate legal cases against the state.\n\nAlthough 30 states have had sterilization laws on the books, North Carolina's program - which ran until 1974 - was one of the largest and most aggressive. Its victims were also the first to receive compensation, in an unprecedented reparations effort.\n\nIn 2013, state lawmakers set aside $10 million for one-time payments to the 1,500 to 2,000 victims they estimated were still alive. The compensatory funds covered those who had been sterilized through the state eugenics board's formal process, but left out many who had been involuntarily sterilized by local welfare departments that had bypassed the state board. Until they came forward seeking reparations, the legislature was likely unaware such individuals existed.\n\nBlackmon was among them. She'd never receive payment under the statute.\n\n\"We lost all the cases because of how the law was written,\" says Bollinger. North Carolina's reparations program was successful as far as it went, he said. \"It just didn't go far enough.\"\n\nThe effort was one of the most well-known examples of reparations paid to Black Americans as an attempt to right an egregious wrongdoing in health care - part of a growing movement calling for direct monetary payments, free health care, and increased accountability for how the medical system treats Black patients. While the larger reparations movement calls for restitution for centuries of unpaid forced labor and post-emancipation exclusion from wealth-building activities, health care reparations would specifically address past and present harms caused to Black people by the medical establishment.\n\nIt's estimated that around 8.8 million Black Americans died prematurely between 1900 and 2015 because of the racial health gap. One recent study found that household wealth was directly correlated to health outcomes. Advocates for a multi-pronged reparations package focused on monetary and political restitution for this harm say that such reparations would boost the health of Black communities.\n\nBut academics and public health experts have long disagreed on whether financial reparations alone are an approach that can adequately rectify centuries of ill treatment that has resulted in dismal health outcomes for Black Americans. Will they solve the health inequities ingrained in a system designed to perpetuate harm?\n\nBlackmon's story illustrates just how complex finding victims and appropriately compensating them can be.\n\nSubstantial evidence exists that enslavement negatively affected all aspects of Black life and laid the foundation for the health disparities Black Americans experience today. During enslavement, race was biologicalized, bolstering the belief that Black people were inferior. The enslaved were subjected to substandard housing conditions, poor sanitation, and food scarcity because of it. Combined with a lack of access to clean water and clothing, it placed them at a higher risk for respiratory diseases their immune systems had never before encountered and barred them from doing many of the things that make someone healthy, such as accessing adequate medical care. (Though they had their ways .) Much of what we know about modern medicine began on the plantation and set the tone for the poor health currently experienced by Black Americans.\n\nEnslavers went to great lengths to prevent physicians from treating enslaved Africans' ailments, frequently accusing them of \"malingering.\" It's not as if the doctors were helpful, however. Typically, their purpose was to get an enslaved person back to work. And if the required medical \"care\" was more intensive, it was often incredibly harmful to the enslaved.\n\n\"There were scientists and eugenicists who ... thought about Black people as an entirely different species,\" says Avik Chatterjee, an assistant professor at the Boston University School of Medicine.\n\nThe way that doctors and scientists thought and wrote about race was one of the many tools used to justify enslavement's continuation. \"It's not just that people in medicine and people in science were a part of a system, but they helped create the system that allowed for enslavement and oppression,\" says Chatterjee.\n\nCurrent misbeliefs that Black patients are more difficult, have thicker skin that is less prone to pain, or make up symptoms were cultivated during enslavement. Today, much of modern medicine does not protect Black Americans , who are at least three times as likely as white people to die from pregnancy-related causes, face disproportionate rates of chronic diseases, and often bear the most severe outcomes of infectious disease outbreaks. Black patients are underprescribed pain medication, excluded from experimental drug trials that could help manage an illness and provide fuller data for Black health outcomes, denied lifesaving medical procedures, or encouraged to undergo more harmful ones. Being Black is still a medical categorization via race adjustments, which allow medical providers to make clinical decisions based on a patient's race. (A well-known instance of this is eGFR measurements, a medical formula that helps determine the health of the kidneys, for which there is a higher bar for Black patients - a practice that frequently prevents them from receiving treatment, such as transplants, that can enhance or save their lives.) Currently, the life expectancy for Black Americans is 71.8 years versus 77.6 years for white Americans.\n\nMore from this series\n\nPoor outcomes among Black Americans are also compounded by inequities that seep into their environment and community, such as a lack of access to affordable housing and healthy foods, exposure to violence or toxic waste, and the unavailability of open-air green spaces. These factors, often referred to as social determinants of health, affect people's well-being. And they are often tainted by a history of racist social, economic, and housing policies.\n\nThese wrongs were never adequately addressed, leaving the playing field inequitable. That truth is the crux of the health care reparations movement.\n\nHealth care reparations became a substantial academic topic in the early 2000s. As Vernellia R. Randall, a law professor at the University of Dayton, wrote , a reparations package capable of eradicating the \"Black health deficit\" would entail a medley of transformative systemic changes focused on fixing the underlying causes of these disparities. They included, but weren't limited to, universal health care, repairing environmental racism, providing a living wage, and encouraging cultural competence among physicians.\n\nWhile other systemic factors would ideally be included in a health care reparations package, the general push for reparations is a separate endeavor, addressing economic, political, and housing discrimination resulting from enslavement.\n\nThe effort to redress the harms to sterilization victims in North Carolina is a prime example of health reparations. In the case of that state's reparations program, however, some of those who were directly affected were able to be located, but the program still missed people whose sterilization wasn't approved by the state board - people like Blackmon. The same issue could befall any program searching for the descendants of specific harms in medicine, says Chatterjee. Many would exclude Black Americans whose ancestors were used as test subjects for medical experiments without anesthesia and maimed by doctors like James Marion Sims or who died from smallpox in the early 20th century because of the barriers to quality care post-emancipation . It would also leave out Black patients currently dealing with the ramifications of the pseudoscience established during enslavement - such as doctors believing that they have \"naturally\" lower lung capacity .\n\nGrowing evidence like this is bolstering the movement in favor of broader health care reparations. \"Medical Reparations build on the longstanding call for slavery reparations by focusing on the specific debts owed to Black people in healthcare settings,\" reads a report from the Repair Project, an initiative designed to address anti-Black racism in science and medicine. \"It is a response to the health effects of racism writ large as legacies of slavery that persist today and that call for repair.\"\n\nBut the notion has not come without criticism.\n\n\"The US health care system needs a lot of work. It's broken. It needs fixing,\" said Darrell Gaskin, director of the Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions. \"Why try to put on a Band-Aid if all your pipes are leaking?\"\n\nGaskin supports compensation for patients who are victims of violence, like those who endured North Carolina's forced sterilization program and the Tuskegee experiment. \"I put that in the same category as if you went to a doctor, they made an egregious error, and you sued them for malpractice,\" he says.\n\nBut reparations, he argues, are a patch on a system that is inherently broken. On his list of potential solutions for health inequities, \"a check is at the very end.\"\n\nIt's the health care structure that must be rebuilt, Gaskin says. Paychecks are \"not necessarily fixing the system so that it stops injuring people.\"\n\nGaskin isn't alone in his reasoning. While many experts believe payouts should be included in a reparations package, since they would provide people with the quality of medical access that wealth brings , there is a strong agreement that cash won't provoke the systemic changes necessary to improve Black Americans' well-being.\n\n\"We see that [wealth] doesn't necessarily alleviate health inequities because, particularly in maternal outcomes, we see that Black women with graduate-level degrees and astronomical amounts of wealth still have poorer health outcomes than white women who haven't graduated high school,\" says Brittney Francis, a social epidemiologist at Harvard's FXB Center for Health and Human Rights.\n\n\"It's also a matter of revamping our educational system,\" she adds. \"It's no good paying [people] money if you still are going to go see a doctor who's educated in a system that uses a textbook saying that Black folks feel less pain.\"\n\nA solid reparations package, according to Francis, would also be multi-pronged and implement several key institutional changes. An educational component would better educate current and aspiring clinicians on their biases while eradicating anti-Blackness from the material they're taught. It would also include plans to improve the health literacy of Black Americans . And since \"it's estimated that\" only 10 to 20 percent of what determines health occurs in a clinical setting, such a package should include policies that bolster the infrastructure affecting other determinants of health.\n\nEven though cash payments would allow a family that relies on public transit to buy a car, for example, they wouldn't shorten the drive to the grocery store if that family lived in a community where disinvestment has left residents with no access to fresh foods . It wouldn't stop local governments from making zoning decisions that allow Black communities to become saturated with environmental pollutants. Money won't encourage cities to build more walkable communities or improve the air quality in neighborhoods bisected by highways - and it won't stop that same political devastation from happening again. If history serves as a predictor, should Black Americans use the funds to move into better-resourced, wealthier areas, the white residents would likely flee - taking the resources that prevent underinvestment with them.\n\n\"I don't think that folks would actually be able to reap the benefits that we think they'll be able to see,\" Francis says of reparations payments on their own. \"A lot of it will be maneuvering through the same systems, just with more money.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, as North Carolina was ending its forced sterilization program, the federal government reached a $10 million settlement with the surviving victims of the Tuskegee experiment and the families of those who died. As a part of that nonconsensual medical experimentation, nearly 400 Black men were intentionally denied syphilis treatment beginning in the 1930s.\n\nThe settlement, which came a year after the experiment ended, included monetary compensation and lifelong health care for participants and their immediate families.\n\nDespite the government's reparations effort, the experiment remains among the most infamous in American history, scarring Black patients, who have been left skeptical of the same medical system that abused their grandparents and continues to dismiss them . The trauma passed down generations partially explains why Black communities remain hesitant to engage in clinical research, where they are underrepresented, and why they're wary of medical care in general.\n\n\"You have to heal,\" says Monica Ponder, an assistant professor of health communication and culture at Howard University. \"You have to restore trust in the population when it comes to people feeling safe in their bodies and in communal spaces.\" Although she applauds the efforts to right historic atrocities, she says she continues to see Black Americans hurt by the health care system today.\n\n\"Why is it always about Henrietta Lacks or Tuskegee when harm happens almost every day?\" Ponder wonders. \"Why does it have to get to that point?\"\n\nWhat constitutes harm needs to be redefined, she said. \"Violence happens often in the health care system.\"\n\nHow reparations in health should look, in Ponder's eye, depends on how they will be defined. She describes the movement as being at a critical point, bursting with new avenues and opportunities to explore. In her mind, reparations should have been paid already as a means to bridge the gap between the bondage of slavery and equitable health outcomes.\n\nSome of those potential solutions include adding layers of accountability for doctors and hospitals by ensuring complaints are reviewed and penalties are enacted in real time, or addressing the racial disparities in incarceration rates for cannabis use, she said. They could also look like free access to physical and mental health care.\n\nBut that free care, says Ponder, must be safe.\n\nThis series on reparations is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to Canopy Collective, an independent initiative under fiscal sponsorship of Multiplier.

In this multimedia project, Vox explores how reparations have worked globally and what they might look like for Black Americans in the United States.\n\nThis four-part Vox Conversations series, hosted by Vox race and policy reporter Fabiola Cineas, explores what reparations might look like in America.

The original promise The history of the fight for reparations in America. Though reparations came to the forefront during the 2020 election in the wake of George Floyd's murder, activists have been fighting for repayment for slavery for decades. Fabiola talks with Nkechi Taifa, the founder and director of the Reparation Education Project.\n\n$14 trillion and no mules Paying the price. One of the typical questions asked during conversations about reparations is how to pay for them. Fabiola talks with economist William \"Sandy\" Darity and folklorist Kirsten Mullen about how reparations could be executed. The husband/wife team lays out a comprehensive framework in their book, From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century , for who would qualify, and how the federal government would afford the $14 trillion price tag.\n\nThe old Jim Crow Why slavery? Marxist scholar Adolph Reed Jr. argues that Jim Crow - not enslavement - is the defining experience for Black Americans today. Reed recounts his childhood in the segregation-era South in his book The South: Jim Crow and Its Afterlives . Fabiola speaks with Reed about his experience, his argument that reparations aren't necessarily a healing balm, and what policies and resources are needed to create a more equitable society.\n\nReaching reconciliation What good is piecemeal reparations? From Georgetown University, where school leadership once sold enslaved people, to Evanston, Illinois, where redlining kept Black residents out of homeownership, institutions and local governments are attempting to take reparations into their own hands. But do these small-scale efforts detract from the broader call for reparations from the federal government?\n\nFabiola talks with Indigenous philanthropist Edgar Villanueva, founder of the Decolonizing Wealth Project and creator of the Case for Reparations fund, about the reparatory justice efforts underway across the country and the role that individual donors might be able to play in reparations. Fabiola also speaks with activist Kavon Ward, who worked to restore Bruce's Beach, waterfront land in California, to the descendants of Black families who were pushed off the land by eminent domain. (Ward's work was funded by Villanueva's organization.) Ward and Fabiola discuss how jurisdictions are repaying Black people for what was taken from them - and if that repayment can be considered reparations at all.\n\nReparations could have tangible health benefits for Black Americans.

Missing Chapter: What New Zealand can teach the U.S. about reparations When the British colonized New Zealand, they left the country's indigenous Māori population with nearly no land; war and new diseases they introduced to the islands nearly killed off all Māori. Nevertheless, Māori managed to survive - and for decades they protested against the British crown's pillaging. By the 1970s, the crown could no longer ignore Māori's mass uprisings rallying for justice; it was forced to respond and established a tribunal to investigate how it violated Māori sovereignty over New Zealand.\n\nSince 1995, the British crown has been engaged in a process of land settlements with Māori - giving the tribes back land and cash, and offering apologies for their historical and modern-day thefts. By putting billions of dollars into this reparations program since the mid-1990s, New Zealand is leading the world with this kind of atonement and redress.\n\nIn this special episode of Missing Chapter, Vox reporter Fabiola Cineas traveled across New Zealand to explore how Māori are using the compensation to build a new future for themselves - and to investigate what the US can learn about reparations from their story.\n\nRead the feature story: New Zealand's Māori fought for reparations - and won\n\nThis series on reparations is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to Canopy Collective, an independent initiative under fiscal sponsorship of Multiplier.

But can these efforts be successful or enough?\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nIn Evanston, Illinois, where redlining excluded the city's Black residents from homeownership, 16 Black families - randomly selected from 600 who applied - were given tax-free grants this year to be used toward a home.\n\nCalifornia launched its reparations task force in 2021, to determine how the state can compensate Black Californians descended from those formerly enslaved.\n\nDozens of colleges and universities, including Georgetown, Brown, and Harvard, are facing pressure from students to examine their ties to slavery and give reparations. A judge ruled earlier this year that the three known living survivors of the 1921 Tulsa white mob massacre could go forward with their reparations lawsuit, despite a motion by the defendants, including the city of Tulsa, to dismiss the case.\n\nAdvocates continue to demand action on reparations from the federal government. But local governments and institutions aren't waiting to try their hand at reparative justice. Following the social justice uprisings of 2020, cities including Asheville, North Carolina , Providence, Rhode Island , and Burlington, Vermont , established reparations commissions and task forces. Voters in Greenbelt, Maryland and Detroit approved commissions to study reparations through ballot measures.\n\nWhile these efforts have been applauded as first steps, some reparations advocates worry that they aren't reparations at all.\n\nSince localities can't afford what experts say is the \"true cost\" of reparations , these smaller initiatives might only detract from the broader call on the federal government, and could weaken the case for wider reparations by allowing the federal government to dodge accountability, since they might argue that the local efforts are enough.\n\nOn the fourth and final episode of 40 Acres, a special four-part miniseries from Vox Conversations , I explore these ideas with Indigenous philanthropist Edgar Villanueva and activist Kavon Ward. Villanueva is the founder of the Decolonizing Wealth Project and creator of the Case for Reparations initiative, which funds reparatory justice projects across the country. (He is also on the board of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which provided a grant to Vox to support the miniseries project.)\n\nVillanueva, who is a member of the Lumbee tribe and whose philanthropy is rooted in Native American traditions and teachings, believes that money can be healing and that individual donors and institutions have a role to play in funding efforts aimed at reparations.\n\nOne effort he funded is Justice for Bruce's Beach , which called for the return of Bruce's Beach - a property California seized from a Black family almost 100 years ago via eminent domain - to the descendants of the original owners. The effort's leader, Kavon Ward, called for the state to return the property and eventually succeeded, launching the organization Where Is My Land, which is helping other Black families reclaim property that was stolen from them. I talked to Ward about how various cities and states are repaying Black people for what was taken from them and whether this should be considered reparations.\n\nBelow is an excerpt, edited for length and clarity. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow Vox Conversations on Apple Podcasts , Google Podcasts , Spotify , Stitcher , or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nIt's 2020 and Kavon Ward has set her sights on Bruce's Beach and returning that land to its rightful owners. The first step? Figure out who exactly had the power to return it.\n\nWe tried to figure out what we could do legally and legislatively, and then I thought, okay, so they need a lawyer. We introduced them to Public Counsel. Public Counsel is a nonprofit organization in DC that provides legal assistance for folks who can't really afford legal representation. They're essentially a conduit between the law firms and the families who can't afford attorneys. So we got them connected with them to help them get a lawyer. And then we tried to make changes, legislatively, thinking that the city of Manhattan Beach actually had the power to give the land back.\n\nTurns out, the city didn't have that power.\n\nThe Bruces owned the land, two plots of land. It's now a lifeguard training facility. And so once we learned that the city of Manhattan Beach actually had no control over that land because they had transferred it to the state of California and the state of California later transferred it to the county, we knew that our approach needed to be different and needed to shift.\n\nBut there were other roadblocks they hit along the way.\n\nOne of the things we decided to do was to have a march and a protest in front of Manhattan Beach City Hall and to march to Bruce's Beach. And that is when [Black Lives Matter] LA helped out. The national BLM founder, Patrisse Cullors, stepped in and decided to help us strategically. Once that happened, the city of Manhattan Beach, essentially, made me out to be a terrorist.\n\nAnd this is where things took a turn. Both for Kavon's life - and for the future of Bruce's Beach.\n\nI felt that it was a threat on my life. People impersonated me online, created false accounts, made it seem as if I was saying something that would make other people come after me.\n\nIt just got really, really, really bad to the point where I felt like I needed to purchase a firearm to protect myself and my daughter as a single mother at Manhattan Beach. The other white women in the group were anti-gun and they didn't like that. They were opposed to me getting a gun. Because they didn't take into account positionality, right? Like, they were white women for the most part, not living in Manhattan Beach, and with husbands. So they didn't have to worry about that type of threat on their lives. When I learned that they were going to leave the movement because I was going to purchase a firearm, I said, you know what? You guys leave. Then I started Justice for Bruce's Beach.\n\nAnd that's when even more work began.\n\nWe started a petition [and] started making more noise so that we could get the attention of the LA County Board of Supervisors, and Janice Hahn, who at the time represented that area. She heard the demands and she decided to step forward and and do what was right.\n\nAnd she committed to making sure that policy change was created so that the land could be transferred back to the Bruces. And that's where [California state] Sen. [Steven] Bradford stepped in and he created SB 796.\n\nIt took a lot of work to get this done. And the work wasn't initially funded. The money that helped Kavon came in the form of grants.\n\nThe folks who are part of Justice for Bruce's Beach and the organization Where Is My Land have been working for a long, long time to make this happen. And so long before our fund existed. I don't want to take too much credit there, but what I will say is we were honored to move two grants to this organization.\n\nThat's Edgar Villanueva. He's an Indigenous philanthropist and founder of the Decolonizing Wealth Project, an organization working to disrupt philanthropy through reparative giving.\n\nTheir Case for Reparations initiative has given millions to nearly two dozen organizations that are leading campaigns to achieve reparations.\n\nWhen we made the first grant to Justice for Bruce's Beach, I remember getting a video recording from Kavon Ward, who was just in tears and said this is the first time [they've] ever received funding. And so folks have been doing this work for free. Nobody is making a lot of money doing reparations organizing. But this work is deeply connected to healing and what people feel like they need spiritually to move forward and to right a wrong.\n\nOver and over it becomes clear that one thing is at the center of reparations: Money. Money owed. Money for losses. And even if capital isn't a cure-all, from Edgar's perspective, money can be medicine. Through disruptive philanthropic efforts, it can heal wounds.\n\nWe are up against a major paradigm shift that is needed, to understand that colonization actually is something that was very harmful, and the impacts of global colonization and colonization that's been happening on the land here.\n\nIt is the erasure of cultures. It is a genocide of peoples, and it's all deeply connected to wealth. And so when we talk about decolonizing wealth, it is acknowledging that the way that wealth has been built historically is deeply connected to this force of colonization.\n\nAnd so to decolonize, we are acknowledging the truth of how wealth has been acquired. And we are bringing an awareness of the harm of all of that, and the trauma of all of that. And we are beginning a process, of beginning to think about how we heal or repair that harm.\n\nA lot of this is colored by his own background. Edgar is Lumbee. They are the survivors of several Native American tribes who lived along the coast of North Carolina and were the first point of contact for Europeans in the late 1500s. For much of his life, Edgar says he had to assimilate to survive.\n\nAnd though being Native American meant dealing with an identity crisis for much of his life, Edgar arrived at a point where he launched a journey to decolonize himself and unlearn harmful stereotypes about his Native American heritage. That also meant starting on a journey to reclaim what he believes is his people's share of resources.\n\nAs a Native American working in the philanthropic sector, this is a $1 trillion industry. I always held these contradictions. There's so many contradictions, where this is a charitable sector, but I've always been pretty aware that the capital that I have access to is a byproduct of capitalism.\n\nPhilanthropy exists because rich people, rich corporations, were able to create foundations or funds, get major tax write-offs, and then some good things could happen without money. And so I could definitely offer critiques about whether or not philanthropy as it exists today in the United States should even exist or not.\n\nBut again, I'm an incrementalist in a lot of ways. And so I'm like, well, I have access to this money now. What's the best I can do with it? Well, I'm supporting people who have a vision for something far more radical and amazing. On the other side of all of this, there has always been a role for philanthropy in our communities as Native people, the way that we take care of each other, the reciprocity, the thought that if I ever needed something, I know my people will be there for me.\n\nI asked Edgar if he thinks philanthropy can really make a big impact without assistance from the government in this space. When we think about reparations, can we make a big impact without the federal government's help?\n\nYes, and no. Philanthropy has often, and maybe has always, played a role in being a catalyst for civil rights causes. There are lots of anecdotes looking back over history where donations and foundations have played a role in supporting advocates and organizers to see social change. But it is a small fraction of the amount of money and resources and power that is held by the federal government. I see philanthropy as a catalyst.\n\nThe fund that we've created, the Case for Reparations Fund, is fueled by foundations and donors who have supported us in moving $4 million so far. Those funds have been highly impactful, and the foundations that are taking on our reparative philanthropy lens have really shifted significant resources to communities in a whole new way.\n\nI had a lot of discomfort as a Native person, not being able to view institutional philanthropy or practice grant-making in a way that aligned with those values. Over time I got physically sick because of the contradictions. I didn't even know if I could do this work. I felt like I was a part of something that was not having as much of an impact as it should because there wasn't a truth-telling process around what was really happening.\n\nSome folks say that philanthropy is sort of like reputation laundering in some ways. And the only approach I know to move forward is to tell the truth about it, right? There's a lot of things we cannot undo, and this wealth is here now. Part of this is really coming to terms with history, and we've all inherited this history that we've got to take ownership of. We need to tell the truth. We need to numb the pain. We need to sit in grief around that. And then we need to think about, well, what can we do today with all of this wealth in the form of repair?\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nOpenly talking about reparations for the descendants of enslaved men and women is a notable shift for Democrats. But the conversation has often lacked substance.\n\nby P.R. Lockhart\n\nFor much of the 150 years since the official end of slavery in the United States, talk of the need for reparations has existed. In 2019, that discussion has become a full-blown political debate among politicians, presidential candidates, and academics over what it would look like to apologize and provide restitution to the people harmed by slavery and its legacy. Now that discourse is headed to the halls of Congress.\n\nOn June 19, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties is holding its first congressional hearing on reparations in more than a decade. It will include testimony from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, actor Danny Glover, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), among others, and will \"examine, through open and constructive discourse, the legacy of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, its continuing impact on the community, and the path to restorative justice.\"\n\nThe hearing - held on Juneteenth, a holiday commemorating the day black men and women in Texas were informed of the end of slavery - is seen as a potential step toward a vote on HR 40 , legislation calling for a formal study of reparations for African Americans that was repeatedly introduced (but never passed) in the House of Representatives by former Rep. John Conyers for close to three decades. Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee reintroduced the bill in January .\n\nWhen 2020 presidential candidates first began discussing reparations in February and March, it marked a turn in a primary contest in which black voters and their continued concerns about the economy are expected to play a significant role . That the attention to reparations has remained so prominent in the months since speaks to a series of changes that have occurred in recent years - namely, the increased academic understanding of and public attention to the ways the history of slavery and discrimination have fueled disparities like the racial wealth gap , which shows that the median white household is 10 times wealthier than the median black one.\n\nThese changes, coupled with a wave of grassroots activism around racial inequality and economic injustice, have helped produce a shift in mainstream attention to reparations. In addition to initially answering questions on the topic from the New York Times and the Washington Post earlier this year, candidates have continued to be pressed for their exact stance on the issue. Even outside of politics, students at Georgetown University made national headlines in April when they voted to create a reparations fund supporting the descendants of the 272 slaves once owned by the school.\n\nSo far, several candidates have expressed some level of support for reparations: Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro have called the issue important or acknowledged how history supports calls for restitution. Other candidates have said they support studying the issue further.\n\nBooker has been running on a policy that would help close the racial wealth gap, introducing a companion Senate bill to HR 40 calling for the federal government to study reparations. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has argued that instead of reparations, his focus on policies helping distressed communities in general would particularly aid black communities. However, in April, Sanders said that he would sign a reparations bill if it came across his desk during his presidency and has since signed on to Booker's reparations legislation.\n\nThe candidate most fervently backing reparations, though, is Marianne Williamson , a self-help guru and spiritual adviser who wants to set aside $200 billion to $500 billion for a reparations program.\n\nThese 2020 discussions are only beginning to touch on the longstanding debate about what the United States owes to the descendants of enslaved men and women - a population that has been systematically denied wealth and opportunity in a country built with the stolen labor of their ancestors.\n\nSurveys of black voters in recent years have found that this group is dealing with high levels of racial anxiety and are looking for candidates who can speak directly to issues of race and justice, including economic justice. Reparations have not been listed as a priority by black Americans in recent polling , but the current debate could change that. The debate also provides important insight into how candidates talk about race and inequality.\n\n\"I think the reparations discussion helps to open up a broader conversation of about the fact that centuries of discriminatory policies have prevented mobility among black communities,\" says Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a group that works to engage and mobilize black voters.\n\nThe mere willingness of some Democratic candidates to say they support reparations reflects a shift from recent years. President Barack Obama did not endorse reparations or support creating a reparations program. In 2016, Sanders and Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic nominee, also did not support reparations. (Sanders in particular was criticized for focusing his opposition on the fact that reparations were \"divisive\" and would not pass Congress.)\n\nThe issue was, and still is, politically unpopular, particularly among white voters .\n\nIt's clear that the Democratic Party is being pushed to have difficult conversations about race and racism - but where did this conversation about reparations come from? And what does it say about the party as a whole?\n\nProponents of reparations say their argument is straightforward: America - through more than 200 years of slavery - built its wealth through the labor and very existence of the black men and women enslaved in chattel bondage.\n\nThe century that followed emancipation saw the creation of policies that discriminated against black people and largely excluded them from wealth building, creating an inherited disadvantage for future generations.\n\nReparations, its supporters argue, provides redress for both the original sin of slavery and America's subsequent failure to address generations' worth of accrued disadvantage in black communities.\n\nThough the idea of reparations has been around since the Civil War, the current debate about reparations moved further into the national popular conversation in 2014 when journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote \" The Case for Reparations \" for the Atlantic, arguing that reparations would drive a \"national reckoning that would lead to spiritual renewal.\"\n\nAt the time, it was a provocative argument - clearly intended to prompt a conversation about the moral necessity of reparations. Coates's article is well worth reading in full , but an important part of his argument is about housing policy and the extraction of wealth from black households, two of the most visible ways the accrued disadvantage of black people has manifested.\n\nCoates explains:\n\nBlack families, regardless of income, are significantly less wealthy than white families. The Pew Research Center estimates that white households are worth roughly 20 times as much as black households, and that whereas only 15 percent of whites have zero or negative wealth, more than a third of blacks do. Effectively, the black family in America is working without a safety net. When financial calamity strikes - a medical emergency, divorce, job loss - the fall is precipitous.\n\nAnd just as black families of all incomes remain handicapped by a lack of wealth, so too do they remain handicapped by their restricted choice of neighborhood. Black people with upper-middle-class incomes do not generally live in upper-middle-class neighborhoods. [New York University sociologist Patrick] Sharkey's research shows that black families making $100,000 typically live in the kinds of neighborhoods inhabited by white families making $30,000. \"Blacks and whites inhabit such different neighborhoods,\" Sharkey writes, \"that it is not possible to compare the economic outcomes of black and white children.\"\n\nCoates openly acknowledges that his case follows a larger academic movement that has existed for decades , one that in recent years has been further advanced by economists like Duke University's William Darity and Ohio State's Darrick Hamilton - both of whom look at the relationship between racial inequality, wealth, and the need for reparations.\n\nMore broadly, a growing body of research has outlined the extent of the disparities between black and white Americans in terms of income , health outcomes , quality of schooling , homeownership - and perhaps most significantly for economists, a continued decline in wealth among black Americans.\n\nCollectively, the disparities, and the argument that they are the result of a history of slavery and racial discrimination, have fueled a new wave of activism around racial inequality and increased calls for reparations from black activists. In 2016, the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of dozens of activist groups working on racial justice, included reparations in its policy platform .\n\nMore recently, online calls for reparations have been driven by a grassroots movement of black activists specifically advocating on the behalf of American descendants of slavery (or ADOS, as the movement is called).\n\nIn an interview with Vox earlier this year, Antonio Moore and Yvette Carnell, the co-founders of and most prominent voices in the current ADOS movement, explained that they believe that ADOS should be seen as a specific identity.\n\nOn its website , the movement says that it \"seeks to reclaim/restore the critical national character of the African American identity and experience, one grounded in our group's unique lineage.\"\n\nWhen it comes to reparations, Moore says, \"we're not having an abstract conversation about what whiteness and blackness makes you feel. We're having a very detailed conversation about what the data means for black people.\"\n\n\"We are talking about repairing black communities,\" he adds.\n\nOn Twitter, and through online radio programs and YouTube channels, Moore and Carnell have argued that policy - and politicians - need to focus more on specific issues affecting black Americans descended from slavery in the US. They call for reparations as part of a larger \" black agenda \" that looks at things like ending mass incarceration, investing in historically black colleges and universities, and increasing federal investment in small businesses.\n\nBut this movement has also faced criticism - not for its call for reparations, but for how it discusses immigration and black identity . Critics have argued that some ADOS activists are openly xenophobic and that the movement endorses an unnecessarily limited definition of \"blackness,\" dismissing the ways slavery and colonization have affected other groups in the African diaspora.\n\nWhen I asked Moore and Carnell to respond to these criticisms earlier this year, they said that the movement was \"seeking to establish that there was a specific debt to a specific group of people.\"\n\nTaking a step back, it's helpful to look at the arguments supporting reparations that have been laid out over the decades , especially since these proposals differ in a lot of ways from how the 2020 candidates have discussed reparations in the past few months.\n\nWhile it is true that \"reparations\" as a concept can refer to multiple things, in this specific context, it refers to demands for a formal apology for centuries of slavery and discrimination and subsequent restitution for black people descended from men and women enslaved in the United States.\n\nThis debate is by no means new. Demands for reparations were made during the Civil War through Union Army Gen. William T. Sherman's Special Field Order 15 issued in January 1865.\n\nThat proposal called for a massive land redistribution giving roughly 40,000 formerly enslaved people 40 acres of land each, the basis for the \"40 acres and a mule\" terminology that is often invoked in modern discussions of reparations. However, this redistribution was short-lived, with President Andrew Johnson rescinding the order and returning the land to white owners later that year .\n\nThere are examples of individual people and some coalitions seeking compensation for their enslavement in the form of \" ex-slave pensions \" in the immediate decades following the Civil War, but the era of Reconstruction that followed did not see any concerted federal effort to apologize for slavery or provide any sort of payment to formerly enslaved people. Congressional bills seeking financial compensation never received any serious legislative action.\n\nAfter the Civil War, systems of convict leasing and sharecropping continued to exploit black labor while allowing white society to hoard the wealth created by that work. Communities that later succeeded in building black wealth - places like Tulsa, Oklahoma's \"Black Wall Street\" in the early 1920s - were met with outright violence or were subjected to \" whitecapping,\" a type of threat used to scare black people into relocating.\n\nWell into the 20th century, a combination of federal policy and private industry regulations allowed not only for Jim Crow in the South but for the limited ability of black people to access wealth-building programs like the New Deal and the GI Bill. Black people were also exposed to discriminatory housing practices like redlining , and pervasive residential and educational segregation further compounded earlier injustices.\n\nThis history led to some reparations advocacy in the years following the civil rights movement, most notably in the form of a document called the \" Black Manifesto ,\" a call for $500 million in reparations to be paid by white-led churches. Written by James Forman, a black civil rights activist who later served as foreign minister for the Black Panther Party, the document noted that its demand was an effort to see justice after centuries of coerced and uncompensated black labor.\n\nForman, like other supporters of reparations, argued that slavery created a system where black people were forced to provide the labor that built a country they were virtually excluded from participating in. The end of slavery did not produce an effort to fully incorporate this group into American life, but instead ushered in a century of exclusion through federal policy - an exclusion that made black people an American underclass.\n\n\"Racist white America has exploited our resources, our minds, our bodies, our labor,\" Forman wrote in the manifesto's opening. \"For centuries we have been forced to live as colonized people inside the United States, victimized by the most vicious, racist system in the world.\"\n\nTo remedy the specific harms of this large-scale dehumanization and denial of wealth, advocates say a large-scale investment - one that comes with an apology for the harms committed and a commitment to further mending these harms through payments and directly targeted policies - is needed.\n\nThere isn't a single model for what a reparations plan would look like, a point that some reparations critics have used to argue that a reparations program simply wouldn't work. But it is helpful to look at the work of economists, like Duke University's Darity and Ohio State's Hamilton , who see reparations as a crucial way to address a significant gap in wealth between black and white Americans.\n\n\"The major financial objective of a reparations program is to close the racial wealth gap,\" Darity told Vox in March. The universal programs that some candidates have advanced \"won't come close to that,\" he says.\n\n\"There are three goals of a reparations program,\" he explains. \"The first is acknowledgment, the second is redress, and the third goal is closure.\" So far, candidates have largely focused on the first point.\n\nDarity has been researching reparations and America's racial wealth gap for years, providing more information on how far black Americans' wealth lags behind other groups and on how slavery and systemic discrimination played a role in creating this situation.\n\nWhen reparations are discussed, the biggest questions raised revolve around what a reparations program would look like, who would benefit, who would pay, and how it would be funded. The best way to determine this would be for the government to formally study reparations, and it is possible that the recent congressional hearing is a small step toward this. But if there is an interest in examples from recent scholarship, it is helpful to look at Darity's work, which provides one possible road map for reparations and addresses some of the above questions.\n\nLooking at who would qualify for reparations, Darity argues that restitution should be limited to people who can trace their roots back to at least one ancestor enslaved in the US, adding that claimants must also have identified as black, African American, colored, or Negro on legal and government documents at least 10 years before a reparations program takes effect.\n\nWhen it comes to what a reparations plan would look like, Darity has argued that exclusively offering cash payments without addressing the underlying structures that have restricted black people from building wealth would fail to correct the issue.\n\nInstead, he has looked at what he calls a \"portfolio of reparations\": a combination of individual payments and race-targeted proposals like vouchers for financial asset building, free medical insurance or free college education for black people, or a trust fund exclusively for black Americans.\n\nHe also calls for an education program that would teach Americans the complete story of slavery and its aftereffects, which he says would help the country understand the harms done. (To read more of Darity's work, these two papers are a good start.)\n\nDarity is currently working on a book about reparations in America, and he has argued the US would need to spend several trillion dollars to begin its process of atonement for centuries of bondage, violence, and discrimination against black Americans (estimates from other economists and researchers range from $6.4 trillion to $14 trillion ).\n\n\"The damages to the collective well-being of black people have been enormous,\" Darity has noted in his research. \"Correspondingly, so is the appropriate bill.\"\n\nWhile experts do not exclusively focus on the direct cash payments framework, that practice does have some precedent, and some form of direct payment has been supported by Darity and other scholars like Georgetown's Marcia Chatelain and Roy E. Finkenbine, a professor of history at the University of Detroit Mercy, whose work was cited in Coates's 2014 essay.\n\nIn 2014, shortly after Coates's essay was published, Vox's Dylan Matthews explained how cash payments have been used in previous reparations programs implemented in the US and other countries:\n\nThe six clearest antecedent programs are those set up by Germany to compensate victims of the Holocaust, by South Africa to compensate victims of apartheid, by the US to compensate victims of Japanese internment during World War II, by the state of North Carolina to compensate victims of its forced sterilization programs in the mid-20th century, by the federal government to compensate victims of the Tuskegee experiment, and by Florida to compensate victims of the Rosewood race riot of 1923.\n\nMatthews notes that the Germany program, which gave more than $7 billion to Israel but largely focused on providing individual reparations to survivors of the Holocaust, is perhaps the closest analogue to a reparations program for descendants of enslaved people in the US. That program had paid out nearly $89 billion as of 2012, less than half of the more than $240 billion the Israeli government assessed as the economic cost the Jewish people suffered from the Holocaust.\n\nComing back to the Democratic primary, we should be clear and note that none of the prominent candidates who have expressed some level of support for reparations are talking about the policies or proposals outlined above. The New York Times's Astead Herndon and the Washington Post's Jeff Stein first got candidates on the record on reparations in February, but here's where things stand now.\n\nHarris expressed some support for reparations early in February but then gave conflicting accounts of her exact stance on passing race-specific reparations policies. Instead, she points to her previously proposed LIFT Act , telling the Grio , a black news outlet, \"If you look at the reality of who will benefit from certain policies, when you take into account that they are not starting on equal footing, it will directly benefit black children, black families, black homeowners because the disparities are so significant.\"\n\nThe LIFT Act is a plan that would provide a tax credit to working singles making $50,000 or less and families making $100,000 or less, expanding the safety net for the middle class. Harris argues that this policy, which Darity says is far too small and not targeted enough to qualify as reparations, would particularly benefit black families. (You can read an analysis of the LIFT Act and other anti-poverty programs by Dylan Matthews here .)\n\nIn March, Harris told NPR \"that the word, the term reparations, it means different things to different people,\" before saying that she sees reparations as the \"need to study the effects of generations of discrimination and institutional racism and determine what can be done, in terms of intervention, to correct course.\"\n\nIn June, Harris signed on as a co-sponsor of Sen. Cory Booker's legislation calling for a formal commission to study the impacts of slavery and make recommendations on possible reparations programs.\n\nWarren, who has said that Native Americans should also be \" part of the conversation \" on reparations, has not offered a specific reparations policy but has pointed to the importance of several of her proposals, including her American Housing and Economic Mobility Act .\n\nThe act would create a housing program that would offer special financial aid to first-time homebuyers in communities affected by redlining , a form of housing discrimination that classified predominantly black communities and homebuyers as \"hazardous\" and undesirable, a designation that led to extremely high - if not outright prohibitive - costs of loans to black homebuyers.\n\nWarren's plan has been praised by some economists who argue that it could put a \" substantive dent \" in the racial wealth gap, but again, the program is not targeted enough to be called reparations. Warren has declined to say if she supports financial compensation for the descendants of enslaved men and women but recently threw her support behind a congressional bill to study reparations, saying that it's time for a \"full-blown conversation about reparations\" during a March 18 CNN town hall in Mississippi.\n\n\"This is a stain on America and we're not going to fix that, we're not going to change that, until we address it head on, directly,\" she added.\n\nWarren has also signed on as a co-sponsor of Booker's reparations study bill.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Williamson is arguably the strongest supporter of reparations in the 2020 field. She's said that reparations are a necessary payment America must make to the descendants of enslaved people, and has also proposed creating a panel that would be in charge of overseeing her proposed $200 billion to $500 billion allocation for reparations. (When asked about this allocation earlier this year, Darity explained that the amount was too small to truly enact a full-fledged reparations program.)\n\n\"Reparations won't end everything, but it will be a profound gift. It implies a mea culpa,\" Williamson told CNN in April . \"It implies a recognition of a debt owed and therefore, it carries not only economic power but spiritual force - whatever it costs, it's time to do this.\"\n\nCastro has said that reparations is a discussion \" worth having \" and has criticized those dismissing direct financial payments to the descendants of slaves. So far, he has not offered a proposal for a reparations program but has instead expressed support for a task force that could study why reparations are needed and how to go about implementing them, a proposal very similar to the HR 40 legislation.\n\nEven before introducing the Senate companion to HR 40 in June, Booker has touted his proposed \"baby bonds\" program , which would give every child a $1,000 savings account that would be added to annually, with federal contributions to the account increasing as parental income decreases. He specifically cites this program as addressing the racial wealth gap. Darity and Hamilton have backed similar programs, and argue that the proposal is one of the more powerful race-neutral ways to help close the racial wealth gap for future generations.\n\nBut unlike Booker's program, the economists prefer that baby bonds be tied to parental wealth , not income. A spokesperson for Booker told NPR in March that the program could be seen \"as a form of reparations\" because its focus on low-income families would disproportionately help black children. However, this still does not meet the race-specific standard needed to qualify as reparations.\n\nBooker has since cautioned that discussions of reparations \"cannot become just a political box-checking exercise,\" saying that the issue must be discussed seriously.\n\nSanders, who was criticized for opposing reparations during the 2016 presidential race and has said that \"there are better ways to do that than just writing out a check\" when asked about direct cash payments to the descendants of enslaved people earlier this year, has at times asked his competitors to clarify what they mean by \"reparations.\"\n\nHe argues that programs aimed at the poor more broadly can help address inequality. While his support for universal programs over specific race-based ones is in line with many of the Democrats competing against him, Sanders has faced criticism from those who see his comments as part of a larger difficulty in discussing race .\n\nSanders has also endorsed Rep. Jim Clyburn's (D-SC) 10-20-30 anti-poverty program , which calls for at least 10 percent of some federal resources be invested in communities where 20 percent or more of the population has been below the poverty line for 30 years.\n\nIn June, Sanders joined Harris, Warren, and Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar in co-sponsoring Booker's reparations study legislation.\n\nIn March, O'Rourke made headlines when he said that he did not support direct cash payments as a form of reparations. But during an appearance at the National Action Network conference in April, the former Texas Congress member said he supported Lee's bill creating a commission to study the matter, adding that he changed his opinion after speaking to social justice advocate Bryan Stevenson.\n\n\"Until all Americans understand that civil rights are not just victories, but the injustices that have been visited and continue to be visited on people, we will never get the change we need to live up to the promise of this country,\" O'Rourke said.\n\nIn June, O'Rourke said that he supported reparations during a campaign stop in South Carolina , telling a local audience that white Americans must understand the history and impact of slavery in the United States.\n\nThe New York senator is another candidate whose support for studying reparations was announced at the National Action Network conference in April. In addition to backing Lee's bill in the House, Gillibrand has said that politicians should \"not only study the problem,\" but should also look at other measures that would help black communities, things like affordable housing and pursuing environmental justice.\n\nShe has also said that she backs \"actionable\" plans to close the racial wealth gap, throwing her support behind a set of policy proposals published by Ohio State University's Kirwan Institute and the Institute for Policy Studies earlier this year.\n\nGillibrand has also joined other Senators in co-sponsoring Booker's Senate version of HR 40.\n\nDuring a March 17 interview with Meet the Press , Klobuchar said the country needed to invest in communities harmed by racism, adding that a reparations program \"doesn't have to be direct pay for each person.\"\n\n\"What we can do is invest in those communities, acknowledge what's happened,\" Klobuchar said. \"And that means better education. That means looking at - for our whole economy - community college, one-year degrees, minimum wage, child care, making sure that we have that shared dream of opportunity for all Americans.\"\n\nKlobuchar is another co-sponsor of Booker's reparations study legislation.\n\nDuring an appearance at the National Action Network conference in April, the former Colorado governor said that he supported Lee's HR 40 bill. He also said that \"a great country should acknowledge its mistakes,\" and there should be a presidential apology for slavery.\n\n\"Slavery is the nagging, unrelenting shame of America that continues to deny the true promise of the country to too many of its citizens,\" he said. \"We must own our past and acknowledge the shame, the sin, the injustice, and the ongoing consequences of enslaving an entire race of people.\"\n\nSince entering the presidential race, Buttigieg has said that he is \"supportive of the concept\" of working to address and acknowledge the continued impacts of slavery but that he does not back a direct financial payment to the descendants of enslaved people.\n\n\"I haven't seen a proposal for a cash transfer that people would be able to come together around and view as fair,\" he said in March . \"But I absolutely believe that we need to have some kind of accounting for the persistent racial inequities today that are there by design because of part and present racism.\"\n\nButtigieg says he supports HR 40 and has also called for being \"intentional\" with policies that can help black communities. In June, he announced a proposal called the \" Douglass Plan \" that would reduce mass incarceration, increase access to credit, and grow the number of black-owned small businesses. During an appearance at the Black Economic Alliance Forum in South Carolina, Buttigieg said the country \"can't take racist policies and replace them with neutral policies.\"\n\nBiden has not taken a formal stance on reparations this election cycle, telling the New Hampshire news outlet WMUR that \"we should take action to deal with the systemic things that still exist in housing and insurance and a whole range of things that make it harder for African-Americans.\"\n\nHowever, Biden has criticized reparations at other points of his political career, saying in 1975 that \"I do not buy the concept, popular in the '60s, which said, 'We have suppressed the black man for 300 years and the white man is now far ahead in the race for everything our society offers. In order to even the score, we must now give the black man a head start, or even hold the white man back, to even the race.'\"\n\nHe has not publicly said if his views on the matter have changed since then.\n\nIt's clear there are lots of priorities in the Democratic Party, from climate change to universal health care to racial justice. Whether Democrats are enthusiastically or reluctantly dipping their toe into the discussion around reparations, it is certainly now part of the conversation.\n\nRhetorically, it's a big shift - the fact that HR 40, merely a mandate to study the idea of reparations, has languished without a vote for decades shows that there's long been little political will to look at reparations at the federal level.\n\nThe fact that some candidates are not openly dismissing reparations shows progress in their attention to race and racism, but it is also true that as of now, beyond the significant amount of support for a congressional study, they aren't really discussing reparations as a policy issue.\n\nInstead, in the months since the reparations discussion emerged in the presidential race, many candidates have cited their support for studying reparations before pivoting into discussions of economic policies that would disproportionately help, but are not exclusively targeted at, black Americans.\n\nCritics of the conversation have argued that reparations are simply not possible, pointing to polls have shown that there's limited support for reparations, especially among white Americans. A 2016 Marist poll found that 68 percent of American adults oppose providing restitution to the descendants of enslaved Africans, and that white Americans are far more likely than black Americans to oppose reparations.\n\nA 2014 YouGov poll found similar results, and a majority of white respondents in that poll said that the legacy of slavery was \"not a factor at all\" in the wealth gap between black and white Americans, something that historical data refutes.\n\nBut it's also true that approval for reparations has been rising in recent years according to some polls. In 2000, polls found that just 4 percent of white people supported reparations; by 2016 that number was 15 percent. And more recently, surveys of young adults have found that 29 percent of white Americans younger than 37 support reparations.\n\nIn recent months, some opponents of reparations, like New York Times columnist David Brooks, have announced that they've changed their minds on the issue . But the renewed debate has also fueled more criticism of the topic, and some writers have argued that reparations have still not been precisely defined and continue to mean different things to different groups.\n\nOther critics argue that reparations are too complicated to execute, would strain race relations and be too divisive , and are too costly to hand out. And others argue that reparations are a slippery slope, opening the door to other minority groups demanding redress for historical injustices. As George Will put it in the Washington Post in March: \"There must be some statute of limitations to close the books on attempts to assign guilt across many generations to many categories of offenders.\"\n\nAnother argument that has been particularly frequent in conservative circles is that America is just too far removed from slavery to justify a reparations program.\n\nThis is similar to a claim made by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell one day before the congressional reparations hearing . \"I don't think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago for whom none of us currently living are responsible is a good idea,\" McConnell told reporters. He then pointed to the passage of civil rights legislation and the election of President Barack Obama as reasons why reparations were no longer needed.\n\nThese are not new complaints. But activists and economists who have been involved in reparations advocacy and research argue that in a country where civil rights and anti-discrimination policies have never been popular at the moment of their enactment, these arguments reflect both a limited political imagination and a lack of awareness and understanding of recent research into reparations.\n\nBeyond that, proponents of reparations argue the debate shows a continued refusal to acknowledge that slavery and what came after it - failed promises of Reconstruction and decades of Jim Crow policies, exclusion from federal programs, redlining, and a large gap between white and black wealth - are the result of a debt that the American government has never truly addressed.\n\nIf political candidates discussing reparations are serious, they \"should move away from the language of emphasizing that the problem of the racial wealth gap can be solved by universal policy,\" Darity said earlier this year. \"They have to be willing to say that they endorse a large-scale program that would be specifically targeted at the historical injustices that have confronted black descendants of those enslaved in the United States.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Dylan Matthews\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates' long, deeply researched and beautifully written case for reparations to African-Americans for slavery and Jim Crow has ignited a long dormant conversation about what, exactly, the US government owes to a population it abused for centuries, and which still faces pervasive discrimination and economic disadvantage to this day.\n\nIn thinking about how an American reparations program would be structured , it's helpful to review the unfortunately rare instances when historical injustices actually were addressed through reparations. It's important to distinguish between reparations that go directly to individuals and families affected from those that go to the treasury of a victimized country. The latter has been a common practice for millennia; Rome demanded payment from Carthage after the first two Punic Wars, the Axis powers paid war reparations after both World Wars, and Iraq is still paying off its reparations to Kuwait. But that's a very different phenomenon from what Coates is proposing; while Germany paid significant reparations to the Soviet Union after the second World War, it's unlikely any victims of Nazi war crimes during the war actually saw that money.\n\nThe six clearest antecedent programs are those set up by Germany to compensate victims of the Holocaust, by South Africa to compensate victims of apartheid, by the US to compensate victims of Japanese internment during World War II, by the state of North Carolina to compensate victims of its forced sterilization programs in the mid-20th century, by the federal government to compensate victims of the Tuskegee experiment, and by Florida to compensate victims of the Rosewood race riot of 1923.\n\nThe closest analogue to reparations for slavery and Jim Crow is probably the reparations that West Germany agreed to pay after the Holocaust. A major component was the $7 billion (2014 dollars) West Germany agreed to give to the then-young state of Israel. Coates goes into the Israeli debate around the reparations in some detail; Menachem Begin, then the leader of Israel's conservative opposition and later its first right-of-center prime minister, opposed the deal on the grounds that it appeared to forgive Germany in exchange for money. But the deal eventually went through, and the consequences for Israel's well-being were astounding. Here's Coates:\n\n\"By the end of 1961, these reparations vessels constituted two-thirds of the Israeli merchant fleet,\" writes the Israeli historian Tom Segev in his book The Seventh Million. \"From 1953 to 1963, the reparations money funded about a third of the total investment in Israel's electrical system, which tripled its capacity, and nearly half the total investment in the railways.\"\n\nIsrael's GNP tripled during the 12 years of the agreement. The Bank of Israel attributed 15 percent of this growth, along with 45,000 jobs, to investments made with reparations money.\n\nBut that was actually a tiny fraction of Germany's total reparations payments, which totaled nearly $89 billion as of 2012, and largely went to individual survivors. The terms of the reparations, most of which are negotiated by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (which negotiated about $70 billion of the total), are constantly evolving, with some payments made on a one-time basis and others as monthly pensions of varying amounts. The Conference has a good breakdown of the various funds, and how much they've paid out, here .\n\nIn 2005, an Israeli government report put the economic cost of the Holocaust - in terms of lost income, unpaid wages, and seized property - at somewhere between $240 billion and $320 billion. Even the extensive reparation efforts undertaken to date do not come close to equalling that. Obviously, further compensation for the loss of loved ones and pain and suffering incurred would push that figure much, much higher.\n\nOne of the duties of South Africa's post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission, besides investigating human rights abuses committed by the apartheid government, was recommending reparations and other policies to redress those abuses and aid victims of the former regime. The commission recommended about $360 million in reparations, to be distributed in six annual payments to victims identified by the Commission, but in 2003 president Thabo Mbeki announced in 2003 that he would authorize only $85 billion, to be given in one-time payments of $3,900 (above the average annual salary in the country at that time). The recipients numbered 16,397 as of 2012, a tiny fraction of the actual number of people victimized by the regime.\n\nThe forced internment of 120,000 Japanese-Americans in camps during World War II resulted in about $3.1 billion in property loss and $6.4 billion in income loss, in 2014 dollars. If you account for the possibility that that money might have been invested and gotten above-inflation returns, the economic losses are even larger.\n\nCongress made two attempts at reparations, the Japanese-American Claims Act of 1948 and the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 . Between 1948 and 1965, the former authorized payments totaling $38 million (which comes to somewhere between $286 to $374 million in 2014 dollars), which didn't come close to matching the economic loss. The latter offered survivors $20,000 each in reparations. By 1998, 80,000 survivors had collected their share, for a total payout of $1.6 billion (between $2.3 billion and $3.2 billion today). There is no accounting by which either measure adequately repaid internees for their economic losses, let alone compensated for pain and suffering.\n\nMost Americans states practiced one or another form of eugenics during the 20th century, with forced sterilizations of \"unfit\" people being a prime instrument. The targets were largely but by no means entirely mentally or developmentally disabled; poor black women on welfare were especially likely to be victimized in this manner. The Supreme Court gave the practice a green light with 1927's Buck v. Bell , and eventually 33 states adopted the practice, forcibly sterilizing about 65,000 people total through the 1970s. Oregon forcibly sterilized people as late as 1981 , and its Board of Eugenics (renamed the \"Board of Social Protection\" in 1967) was only abolished in 1983 .\n\nVery few states have acknowledged or apologized for these policies, and only one, North Carolina, has set up a reparations program. The state sterilized about 7,600 people, most of whom are no longer living, but last year passed a $10 million reparations program that should give the more than 177 living victims somewhere in the range of $50,000 each. The payments should be made within a few years. Some victims have objected , saying this doesn't come close to remedying the injustice. As one victim, Elaine Riddick Jessie (who was sterilized at age 14 after being raped and giving the resulting son up for adoption), put it, \"If I accepted it, what kind of value am I putting on my life?\"\n\nCalifornia, which sterilized by far the largest number of people of any state, has yet to pay out reparations.\n\nAfter the end of the Tuskegee experiment - in which 399 black men with syphilis were left untreated to study the progression of the disease between 1932 and 1972 - the government reached a $10 million out of court settlement with the victims and their families in 1974, which included both monetary reparations (in 2014 dollars, $178,000 for men in the study who had syphilis, $72,000 for heirs, $77,000 for those in the control group and $24,000 for heirs of those in the control group) and a promise of lifelong medical treatment for both participants and their immediate families. According to the CDC , 15 descendants are still receiving treatment through the program today.\n\nIn 1923, the primarily black town of Rosewood on the Gulf Coast of Florida was destroyed in a race riot that, by official counts, killed at least six black residents and two whites (though some descendants of the town's residents have claimed many more were killed and dumped in mass graves ). In 1994, the state of Florida agreed to a reparations package worth around $3.36 million in 2014 dollars, of which $2.4 million today would be set aside to compensate the 11 or so remaining survivors of the incident, $800,000 to compensate those who were forced to flee the town, and $160,000 would go to college scholarships primarily aimed at descendants.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nGiven the Court's Republican supermajority, this case is unlikely to end well for trans people.\n\nLearn about saving, spending, investing, and more in a monthly personal finance advice column written by Nicole Dieker.\n\nThe latest news, analysis, and explainers coming out of the GOP Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe economy's stacked against us.\n\nA Texas judge issued a national ruling against medication abortion.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAdolph Reed on why talk about reparations is counterproductive.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nThe past decade has seen a resurgence of discussion about reparations for slavery. But Marxist scholar Adolph Reed believes the reparations conversation is a \"waste of time.\"\n\nOn the third episode of 40 Acres, a special miniseries of Vox Conversations , Reed, who has long pushed back against what he calls race reductionism - the tendency to use only race to explain Black people's life outcomes - told me that reparations wouldn't address the societal inequalities it seeks to tackle.\n\nReed, a political scientist and professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania, comes to this conversation as a member of the last age cohort for which Jim Crow was a lived experience. He recounts his upbringing in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and New Orleans in his new book The South: Jim Crow and Its Afterlives . In the episode, Reed explains how the regime enforced racism and upheld white supremacy, defining the boundaries of his daily life, from what stores he could shop in to what rides he could get on at the amusement park.\n\nThe fundamental purpose of Jim Crow, he said, was to secure and stabilize ruling class power. All Black people were unequal, but some were \"more unequal and unprotected than others,\" he wrote in the book. These differences in social position would shape Black politics after Jim Crow, Reed argues. He believes that Jim Crow, and not slavery, is the formative Black experience that has had the most impact on modern life.\n\nYet despite the atrocities he experienced under what he calls the \"petty apartheid\" of Jim Crow, and the fact that most of his grandparents were born not much more than a generation away from slavery in the United States, Reed is not interested in reparations. Reparations would not address wealth disparities since the racial wealth gap only concerns people rich enough to accumulate wealth in the first place, Reed told me. Instead, policies that aren't race-based, like increasing the minimum wage, would better serve Black Americans and include other Americans, too.\n\nAnd despite new Pew research showing that 77 percent of Black American adults support reparations, Reed insists that Black people are not interested in \"elaborate programs of separate development,\" as he wrote in the book.\n\nI talk to Reed about what it was like to grow up under a segregationist regime and watch it crumble. We talk about the politics that have replaced Jim Crow, solutions to current-day inequality, and why he believes reparations won't ever be a reality for Black Americans who are descendants of people enslaved in America.\n\nBelow is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so subscribe to Vox Conversations on Apple Podcasts , Google Podcasts , Spotify , Stitcher , or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nIn your book, The South: Jim Crow And Its Afterlives , you say that Jim Crow is the formative Black American experience for contemporary life. And you say that Jim Crow is that formative experience over slavery, actually. So why do you feel that that's the case with Jim Crow?\n\nI think there are a couple of reasons, at least. One's pretty prosaic, and that's that the Jim Crow order was between slavery and now, right. I'd say the 60 years after emancipation that were moments within the production of American society, that most of us know it and have grown up in it and have family members before us who grew up in it. And that means industrialization, the Great Migration, the transcendence or displacement of an agrarian-based economy, urbanization of the society and of Black Americans in particular.\n\nThe experiences of segregation, the descent of the wall of segregation and the struggle against it and its overcoming, are more immediately formative of Black Americans' lives, practices, and self-understandings than slavery was, or is.\n\nAnd why do you think popular history is trying to bring slavery out to the forefront and get Black Americans, I think, to think more deeply about slavery and look at slavery as the foundation of what our experiences are today?\n\nYeah, that's a very good question. For at least the first two-thirds of the 20th century, it had been possible for us to assume that most Black Americans came together around at least one common objective, and that's overcoming racial inequality and discrimination. But as my good friend and comrade professor Willie Legette has said often, \"The only thing that hasn't changed about Black politics since 1965 is how we think about it.\"\n\nAnd what's happened is, with passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act - and not just passage of those laws, but the development of an anti-discrimination apparatus that followed from their passage - for racial inequality that it might have seemed to be prior to that. What that means also is that interest differentiation among Black Americans, as well as class and income differentiation among Black Americans, has extended, some would say radically, since 1965.\n\nI believe that people who have political interests in sustaining a view that a one-size-fits-all way of talking about Black politics also have an interest in wanting to make slavery the uniformly shared Black condition.\n\nRacial inequality gets reduced to racial disparities. And so much of arguments that focus on racial disparities as the principal, if not the sole actionable forms of inequality. For instance, Michelle Alexander's book The New Jim Crow hinges on an analogy that even she has to acknowledge doesn't work. And that is that the carceral state is like the Jim Crow order.\n\nWell, it's not, it wasn't, couldn't be.\n\nAnd the same thing with arguments that the 13th Amendment didn't do what the 13th Amendment did, and arguments that the essential condition of Black Americans hasn't changed since 1865, or since 1619.\n\nThe assertions that nothing has changed for Black people since Jim Crow or since slavery shouldn't be read literally. They should be read as rhetoric.\n\nThat rhetorical move is in fact an acknowledgment that things have changed, and a call on the listeners to demonstrate that this bad thing that happened, this outrage that happened, was an atavism, right? And a call on all of us to do better.\n\nYou belong to the last cohort for which the Jim Crow regime is a living memory. Why do you think that's so important to recognize that and acknowledge that right now?\n\nWell, yeah, to be honest, to be completely honest in a way that I wasn't totally forthcoming about in a book, when the two friends and I whom I mentioned talked about this for a number of years, what animated our ongoing discussion was the really shoddy character of both a lot of the scholarship and the personal memoirs and the popular constructions of what the era was like and what it was about.\n\nAnd I had no illusions about changing that, but I thought the least we could do is get another perspective out there. One that's a little more grounded.\n\nYeah. Because you mentioned that these photos and images that we have - because my generation certainly learned about it this way, too - through the photos of the water fountains, the segregated restrooms. What do you feel is missing from those images of the Jim Crow era?\n\nYeah. Look, I mean, those things were real. When I describe it as petty apartheid, it produced indignation, and people sometimes forget that the point was never \"separate but equal.\" The point was separate and unequal. But what's missing is that these were more than inconveniences, certainly, but they weren't a deep structure of the segregation order. And that's why taking into account where it came from is helpful.\n\nThe dominant planter-merchant-capitalist class had lived in what even I thought for a long time was irrational anxiety about the prospects of poor working-class whites and Black free people forming electoral alliances that would challenge [the] absolute prerogative, like a ruling class.\n\nBut it wasn't irrational anxiety, because there were enough instances of that kind of political alliance having won victories here or there, to keep it real. And it just sent the message to the ruling class that it was time to take radical action to stop this stuff. And then Jim Crow was the institutionalization of that new regime.\n\nAnd among other things that people don't ever think about is ... the ways that whites were affected by Jim Crow.\n\nBecause it was not a social order that whites imposed upon Blacks. It was a social order that some white people imposed on everybody else, Black and white. But by disenfranchising Blacks - and, depending on the state you were in, maybe up to a quarter of the white voting population - you took away the potential for political alliances based in the working class and among poor people and farmers. So even those whites who were still able to vote had to make their choices within a context that was heavily skewed to favor the agendas of the ruling class.\n\nSo what came to replace the Jim Crow order? And I'm curious what parallels you see between today's order and what existed during Jim Crow.\n\nWe're still evolving away from it, right? After 60 years now, practically, of the upwardly mobile Black and white people going to the same schools, living in the same neighborhoods, belonging to the same club, going to the same coffee shops, what one would expect sociologically is that while race discourse remains as an organizing principle for factions and alliances, you would expect we would have evolved much more toward a governing regime that's more seamlessly interracial. And I think we by and large have. I think that, depending on circumstances and context, everybody in the elite level has an interest in emphasizing race to one degree or another and in some context.\n\nAn old joke about the Hyde Park neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, near the University of Chicago, was [it was] a place where Black and white lock arms against the poor.\n\nAnd I think that's more what the governing order in most cities and in the country is at the moment.\n\nWhat is the problem with asking the federal government for reparations for slavery, Jim Crow, and ongoing discrimination?\n\nBlack people are concerned about the same stuff that other working people are concerned about: economic security, health care, housing jobs, education. And there's no way we're gonna get those just for Black people. And I think the effort to do so may as well be a recruitment campaign for the KKK.\n\nI've been asking the same question for more than 20 years now: How do we propose to develop a political coalition that can prevail on a reparations campaign? And nobody's given me an answer yet, because in a democracy - even a nominal democracy like this one - prevailing would depend on generating, if not an absolute majority coalition, at least a big enough plurality to encourage public officials to follow through on the demands. And there's no way we can do it. The nature of the demands undercuts the capacity to build a coalition that could pursue them.\n\nBut aren't we the closest we've ever been? Especially if you look at HR 40 , the amount of lawmakers who have signed on is unprecedented. And we do have a diverse coalition of people calling for Biden to just go ahead and for example, create a reparations task force by executive order. Has Biden responded? No, but some people argue that this is a sign of hope, the fact that reparations advocates have gotten this far.\n\nWell, I don't think they've gotten that far. HR 40 has been there for a while. It's also the case that people sign on to bills that they know have no chance of passing all the time. And sometimes they sign on to them because they know they have no chance of passing, but even if HR 40 were somehow magically to pass, what it would do is authorize a study commission or a task force or something. And, I mean, that's no closer to the reparations than we are right now. It's a symbolic move.\n\nAnd it's not a moral question. It's not a question of who deserves what, right? I mean, that's a question that you talk about at church on Sunday. That's not a question for politics.\n\nBut what about examples, like the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act ? That was something that took many, many tries to get passed; finally got passed this year. I think other symbolic things - like maybe Juneteenth legislation that Biden recently passed to make that a federal holiday - a lot of these things have been in the works for a long time, and people thought that these things could not get anywhere.\n\nRight. But none of them takes a dollar out of the federal budget or any taxpayer's pocket. And that's the crucial difference. I know how these things go. I've seen 'em over and over. And, in fact, I saw this in the 2020 campaign. What it got to was, \"Well, how about if we just call this reparations?\" Right? And that to me seemed like an expression of what's really counterproductive about symbolic politics. Because a commitment is more toward winning support for something that you can somehow twist around and call reparations than it is to winning anything concrete.\n\nThe 40 Acres Vox Conversations series explores where the reparations debate stands now and where it is headed.

And how would the United States, with its inflation woes and mounting debt, pay for them?\n\nFor the second episode of the \"40 Acres,\" a special four-part miniseries on Vox Conversations , I talk to the husband and wife duo, economist William \"Sandy\" Darity and folklorist Kirsten Mullen, about the reparations framework they outline in their book From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century .\n\nDarity and Mullen's reparations framework is based on three elements: acknowledgment, redress, and closure.\n\nFirst the United States would need to recognize and admit the grievous wrongs it has committed against Black Americans, and those who benefited from those wrongs must acknowledge the advantages they've gained as a result.\n\nDarity and Mullen's plan for redress involves compensation to eliminate the racial wealth gap and disparities in income, health, education, incarceration, and more.\n\nOnly then would the United States be able to arrive at closure - the point at which Black people and white people can come to terms over the past and unite to create a transformed United States.\n\nThe accompanying price tag, as Darity and Mullen calculated it, is $14 trillion. I talked to Darity and Mullen about how they arrived at this figure and how the US could pay for it.\n\nOur conversation also explored their proposed guidelines for eligibility - only Black Americans who have identified as Black for at least the past 12 years, and who can prove that they are descended from people formerly enslaved in the US. And we discussed piecemeal reparations efforts happening across the country, like the housing vouchers doled out to a few Black homeowners in Evanston, Illinois, which they believe take away from the federal government's responsibility. Ultimately, Darity and Mullen show how America's unfulfilled promise of land has left Black Americans far behind.\n\nBelow is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so subscribe to Vox Conversations on Apple Podcasts , Google Podcasts , Spotify , Stitcher , or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nWhy are you focusing on the racial wealth gap in [the context of reparations]?\n\nI think it's important to distinguish between wealth and income. Wealth can take the place of income, but income cannot take the place of wealth.\n\nYou know, we think of income as one's earnings. It's a consequence of actions. It's a consequence of work, time spent producing services or materials for a fixed fee. Wealth, on the other hand, is a stock of assets. These are things that are happening while you're sleeping. Interest that's being earned on investments, on trust accounts, or you're receiving rents, or you're receiving mortgage payments from some other individual for property that you own or control. Wealth is the thing that gives individuals a reserve, a cushion. Wealth is a thing that makes it possible for you to move into a neighborhood with high amenities, to put your kids in private primary and secondary schools, elite colleges, if you choose.\n\nWealth is a thing that makes it possible for individuals to obtain high-quality medical care or legal counsel. Wealth is a thing that allows you, if you choose, to participate in the political process. We know that it's really important in this country to not only vote, but if you're able to, also support the political process financially. But not everybody can afford to do that. You know, it's mostly people who have wealth who have this opportunity to participate in our political life in this way.\n\nAnd relatedly, should there be a cap, an income cap on reparations? Like should the wealthiest Black Americans who would be eligible for reparations be [considered]?\n\nYou know, this is not a poverty relief program. Reparations is about a debt that the federal government owes to all Black American descendants of US slavery. When you think about reparations payments that have been made in the past, internationally, but also domestically, they didn't say, \"Oh, this person is too wealthy to receive reparations.\" So, no, you know, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan - all these people would absolutely be eligible for reparations. Now they could decide that they did not want to accept them if they chose, but they should not be excluded from reparations.\n\nAnd, you know, they could make the decision to take their reparations payments and use them for whatever purpose they have in mind. One possibility would be to make a donation to the charitable organization that they prefer to support.\n\nIn your reparations framework, you've arrived at about $840,000 for each eligible Black household. How did you arrive at this number?\n\nWe calculated that number on the basis of the estimate of the difference in average wealth between Black and white households that's reported in the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, which is the most recent survey that was taken to provide information about household net worth.\n\nWe arrived at the figure of $840,900, which is the exact difference between white average household net worth and Black average household net worth. If you multiply that figure across the total number of Black households, that differential - that gives you a figure in the vicinity of $14 trillion.\n\nThe 40 Acres Vox Conversations series explores where the reparations debate stands now and where it is headed.

We were driving through our Jersey City neighborhood and I was six months pregnant.\n\n\"You want to make all the decisions!\" he screamed while angrily speeding down the road. When I tried to explain to him that he may not understand what it takes to care for a little black girl's hair, he bellowed, \"You tryna say I'm gonna be a bad father?\"\n\nViolent, angry outbursts became normal in our interactions once I became pregnant. In an instant, the father of my children would go from being the warmest, most dedicated man to a monster. Then, after every eruption, he pretended like it never happened or promised it was the last time.\n\nIt never was.\n\nOn his first Father's Day, he became enraged after waking up to find me absent from our shared bed. I had slipped out earlier that morning to buy us groceries to make a big breakfast.\n\n\"Tell me who you were with!\" he screamed.\n\nThe father of my children has raged in front of my family, my neighbors, my friends, and even strangers. He uses aggression and manipulation to control me.\n\n\"Abuse is never okay,\" my therapist told me when I shared these stories.\n\nI nodded in response. But the phrase triggered a cascade of confusing thoughts. If abuse is never okay, why does popular culture repeatedly refer to black women as \"bitches,\" \"hoes,\" and \"thots\"? If abuse is never okay, why do the police abuse black people, sometimes even kill us, and then resort to victim-blaming or gaslighting to excuse their behavior? If abuse is never okay, why does America continue to abuse its black citizens?\n\nAbuse is all I've ever known as a black woman in this country. I alone do not have the power to fight against it. It's a cycle that will take more than me to end it.\n\nThese cycles are what black people are trying to eradicate when we talk about the need for reparations. Reparations are not just about righting the wrong of slavery itself, they are also about addressing the longstanding systemic racism that continues to impact the lives of black people to this day. It is this legacy of abuses against black people that has resulted in a complex, racist system that wreaks havoc on black lives and makes our relationships tragically set up to fail.\n\nNormalizing abuse is what often happens when you exist in racist, misogynistic American society as a black woman. I have been sexualized and degraded ever since the age of 11 when I became a part of the statistic that 60 percent of black girls are sexually assaulted before the age of 18. I have never known stability because my family had to constantly move in search of a home after being priced out of neighborhoods in Florida, New Jersey, and New York by gentrification. My mother had to work three jobs just to make ends meet, like countless black single mothers do, and I pretty much raised myself. I never had the chance to celebrate honor rolls, dean's lists, or professional successes because they felt so small next to giant stacks of unpaid bills and obligations that can barely be met .\n\nBlack women face the highest rates of domestic violence and intimate partner violence compared to any other demographic. We are also the most likely to suffer serious injury or die at the hands of our partners. A 2003 study analyzed the prevalence of domestic violence in the black community and found intimate partner violence in black relationships is not only more common, but also more violent than among white couples. The University of Maryland and Indiana University researchers explained that \"the anger, hatred, and frustrations of African American men, caused by institutional racism, are being displaced onto their wives and lovers.\"\n\nAs a black woman, I've spent my life battling both covert and overt racism and misogyny, a wretched combination, inside and outside of my own home. Sometimes I believe it is this perfect-storm combination that makes me an easy target for abusive relationships.\n\nAbuse doesn't have to ever be \"okay\" for it to be normal. It just has to be a fact of life.\n\nAbuse was a fact of life for my kids' father as well. His parents used corporal punishment as a form of discipline as long as he could remember. They beat him with belts, belt buckles, tree branches, and wires. They made him kneel on graters for hours at a time. And while studies have found that black parents are twice as likely as white parents to use corporal punishment, they also highlight the truth that this is a practice adopted from white Europeans during slavery.\n\nIn other words, slavery is not \"just in the past.\" What black people adopted as a result of enslavement continues to haunt us and torment our physical and psychological well-being beginning in childhood and well into adulthood.\n\nMy kids' father was raised in the poor, urban part of Jersey City where violence was the norm - an area \"ghettoized' by discriminatory New Jersey banking policies that made it practically impossible for minorities to get loans for \"good\" (i.e. white) neighborhoods. For his Haitian immigrant parents, purchasing an affordable home was their taste of \"The American Dream.\" They left their homeland - a country forced to pay the modern equivalent of $21 billion in reparations in 1825 to former French slave owners after Haitians won their freedom from the colonial power, consequently making it the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere - just to realize that dream . For their son, who had to navigate the trauma of living in the \"hood,\" like getting stopped and frisked by police since grade school and getting jumped over false accusations, it was more of a nightmare. He learned to always be suspicious and on edge.\n\n\"Anyone can just flip on you,\" he used to explain about growing up never knowing the difference between friends and enemies.\n\nI witnessed it myself. About two years ago, a friend of his showed up at our home threatening him with a gun. He was angry because his car got repossessed while my partner was holding onto it for him while he visited family for two weeks.\n\n\"You let them take my car!\" the friend screamed, even though he had not paid his car note in months.\n\nI don't know why his friend couldn't make the payments, but I do know that black men are the most likely to be unemployed, underemployed, or deemed unemployable \"convicts.\" I also know how hard it is to take personal responsibility for your own circumstances when they always feel so outside of your control. I know his anger was misdirected and may seem illogical, but it likely has a valid source.\n\nBlack people have been dominated and oppressed by white supremacy that constantly evolves and becomes more clandestine over the centuries. From slavery, Black Codes, Jim Crow, CIA and FBI attacks on Civil Rights era leaders, redlining, the school-to-prison pipeline, health care inequality, employment discrimination, mass incarceration, lead poisoning our water systems, and police violence, we often forget that it is these unknown destructive forces in our lives that should be the source of our scorn. It is no surprise that we sometimes take out our anger on one another.\n\nFor black people, the call for reparations begins with the desire for white people to grapple with the atrocity of slavery. Can white people imagine how truly infuriating it is to know the only people who received reparations when slavery came to an end were white slave owners? Like slave-holding French colonizers, American slave owners received $300 per freed slave after Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862. And yet, Americans readily dismiss the country's need to atone for its original sin.\n\nBut the need for reparations, just like the white history of oppressing and discriminating against black people, does not end there. Many scholars argue that reparations are the only remedy to address the substantial black/white wealth gap that no education, job, or income will ever close. For millions of black people living in poverty, reparations may be the only way to ensure the affordability of proper mental health services. Or the only way the segregated school system, in which zip code and property taxes often correlate with educational opportunity, can finally give black children access to high-quality learning. For those in redlined \"ghettos\" or those with subprime mortgages that are disproportionately dealt out to people of color, reparations may finally give them access to homeownership in good neighborhoods, or they may finally be able to afford to build, maintain, and protect their own.\n\nAmerica will remain separate and very unequal if there is no commitment to addressing its racist abuse. Families like mine will continue to be torn apart by deep-seated trauma because we lack the resources to do anything about it. We need to heal from centuries of trauma. We need to rebuild our communities and mend our relationships with one another. We cannot do so while buried in debts and hardship.\n\n\"Abuse is a choice,\" my therapist often reiterates.\n\nThat has been the hardest fact for me to confront: that abuse is knowingly and intentionally inflicted. For a long time, I allowed myself to believe my partner was \"out of it\" when behaving the way that he was, a lie I told myself to explain why a man who claimed he loved me could treat me the way he did. I battled with the same cognitive dissonance for all of my life over my relationship with America.\n\n\" If only I work harder, \" I told myself.\n\nI tried to work harder. Per the suggestion of our counselors, we attended individual therapy once a week and couples therapy once a month. Things seemed to be looking up - until we received the first bill. We were shocked that, despite the fact that we both had insurance, the co-pays amounted to $400 a month. For a new family already buried in student loans and struggling to find affordable housing, paying that amount was unsustainable. After a few months, we stopped going. And the relationship, like my relationship with the country, remained abusive and one-sided.\n\nBut I hold out a little bit of hope. My kids' father has agreed to seek therapy again. Meanwhile, talk of reparations has come up in the 2020 presidential campaign. Most Democratic candidates, at the very least, agree that the government should move forward with Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee's H.R. 40 bill put forth to establish a commission to study slavery and the oppressive discriminatory practices that followed, to begin to find a solution. Maybe America is finally ready, like my partner, to take the first step on the long journey to righting its wrongs against people who share my hue.\n\nIn the next couple of years, two of the most important relationships in my life will either move forward - strengthened by true reconciliation, where amends are made - or wither away, leaving behind a damaging continued legacy of abuse and hurt.\n\nI am a black woman who is tired of unkept promises: from lovers, from bosses, from political candidates, from society as a whole. I am ready for my abusers to make good on their promises of \"change.\" Because I can't live like this. And I refuse to blame myself any longer.\n\nTiffanie Drayton is a freelance writer who proudly shares the beauties and hardships of being a black woman.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nLawyer and activist Nkechi Taifa explains why reparations is a policy issue \"whose time has come.\"\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nThe conversation about reparations for slavery started not long after slavery ended. More than 150 years later, reparations for slavery, Jim Crow, and ongoing racial discrimination still do not have broad popular support - but activists are keeping the age-old conversation alive.\n\nThe Democratic primaries for the 2020 election briefly seemed like a breakthrough. Candidates for the presidency spoke out about reparations - many expressed approval , while others deflected - and America's duty to provide redress for centuries of injustice. After the mass racial justice uprisings of that year in response to the police killings of unarmed Black Americans, talk about reparations only grew. When Joe Biden secured the presidency, his administration promised to launch a study of reparations. Yet, almost two years into his presidency, he hasn't - nor has he even uttered the word about it.\n\nIn May, a coalition of human rights organizations and social justice groups urged Biden to issue an executive order to create a commission to study reparations, bypassing HR 40, the bill first introduced in 1989 that would create the commission. The Biden administration has not responded.\n\nFor the next four weeks on Vox Conversations , through a new series called 40 Acres , I'm having conversations with activists, scholars, and a philanthropist that explore what reparations mean right now and where the fight is going.\n\nI reached out to one of the letter's signatories - Nkechi Taifa, a lawyer, scholar, activist, and longtime reparations advocate - for the latest episode of Vox Conversations and for the first episode of the series . Taifa has pushed for reparations for 50 years. She helped found N'COBRA - the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America - in the 1980s, the organization that helped the late US Rep. John Conyers write HR 40, and is the founder of the nonprofit organization the Reparation Education Project.\n\nIn our conversation, Taifa starts with the 1970s, when she first learned about reparations, and explains how the idea moved from the \"radical fringe\" to the mainstream.\n\n\"Reparations was radical and fringe, but it was on the platform of just about any and every organization that was dealing with Black folks back then in the '60s and '70s,\" Taifa told me.\n\nAt a time when racial justice progress is facing backlash, Taifa makes a renewed case for reparations: \"Everything that's going on today leaves me very, very hopeful that it will in fact happen in my lifetime. I'm confident that there will be a national reckoning on race in America, and that reckoning will not be complete until there is reparatory justice,\" Taifa said.\n\nBelow is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so subscribe to Vox Conversations on Apple Podcasts , Google Podcasts , Spotify , Stitcher , or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nWhat are reparations?\n\nReparations are what is owed for human rights abuses, usually in the aftermath of war or other gross injustices, such as enslavement, but also to the descendants of those who were adversely impacted.\n\nIn the context of Black people in this country, I always say that reparations are for injustices, not just for the enslavement era but for its living legacies that continue down through to today. It involves the historic acknowledgment of historic wrong and a recognition that the injury continues. It involves a commitment to redress. It also involves all the culpable parties, whether it's the United States government, state and local governments, academic or religious institutions, corporations, private estates - any entity that was culpable and [that] has accrued unjust enrichment from the era.\n\nWhat was it like to advocate for reparations back [when you helped found N'COBRA in the '80s], when there was so much pushback to like ideas like affirmative action? And we still see pushback to affirmative action today. Can you talk about any kind of pressure you faced to not be talking about reparations?\n\nOh, yeah. I was constantly laughed at and ridiculed. They would say, \"There go Nkechi again!\" Never did I dream that the seeds that I was planting back in those days where I was ridiculed and ostracized - that I just might be able to stand under the shade of those trees that were planted with those seeds.\n\nSo, you know, it's like, how do you keep your eyes on the prize? Or keep struggling when it seems like all the odds are against you? You do it because there's just a profound sense within you and within your bones for justice.\n\nYou say that reparations is an idea whose time has come. My question is why now? And why do you feel like there's so much conversation about reparations right now?\n\nI call George Floyd the Emmett Till of the 21st century. Emmett Till served to galvanize not only people in this country, but [also people] across the world, to see the injustices that were happening here.\n\nI think the election of Donald Trump had a lot to do with this. The blinders were stripped off of people's eyes that, well, maybe we're not quite in this kumbaya moment that we thought we were in. [With] the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, people saw raw, naked violence by white people who seemed to have a continuous strand of the mentalities from the past. I think masses of Black people are waking up and saying, \"Well, reparations needs to be part of this mix as well.\" This is now an issue whose time has come.\n\nThe 40 Acres Vox Conversations series explores where the reparations debate stands now and where it is headed.

      "text": "What America owes: How reparations would look and who would pay\n\nSome say reparations are needed to restore economic balance.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Richard Givens, a Black man, toiled as a laborer in a box mill in Greensville County, Virginia.\n\nHe earned $300 for the entire year in 1939, according to U.S. Census records, an income Givens had to use to support a family of eight.\n\nThat seemingly paltry sum (worth only approximately $5,500 today) was even anemic for the time -- less than the median salary for non-white men ($460) and about a quarter of what white men made at the time ($1,112), according to data from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.\n\nThat economic gap for Givens, like many of his Black contemporaries, existed 75 years after the end of slavery and persists today. Many say that the existence of that gap has been perpetuated by systemic racism in America -- a combination of laws and institutions that perpetuate inequality -- and necessitates reparations to address those wrongs.\n\nSince the end of slavery, Black Americans have been in a fervent and mostly futile race to catch up economically to their white counterparts. The Black-white wealth gap has been and remains vast -- the net worth of the average white family is 10 times greater than the average Black family, according to a 2016 report from the Brookings Institute.\n\nMoreover, median wealth of Black families remains less than 1/10 of white families in 2020, the Senate Joint Economic Committee found in its report, The Economic State of Black America in 2020 .\n\nFor over 200 years, colonial America and then the U.S. was a slave state, then, an apartheid state -- with Jim Crow laws in the South and actively racist practices such as redlining -- financial institutions denying mortgages to people of color, or providing mortgages to them only in limited areas usually with homes and properties of low value.\n\nAdvocates and experts argue that ongoing systemic racism has placed Black Americans at a disadvantage in everything from obtaining an education to being paid fair wages, purchasing homes, starting businesses and passing down generational wealth -- all components needed to achieve robust economic health.\n\nSome advocates and experts say reparations are the answer. They would not only help eliminate wealth differences caused by systemic racism, but are also \"a form of compensation that would amount to healing,\" William \"Sandy\" Darity, an economist and professor at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy told ABC News.\n\nThe topic is controversial. While arguments have been made that reparations to Black descendants of enslaved people could help restore economic balance in the nation, there is the outstanding question of how much should be paid out and to whom.\n\nSo what exactly is owed? That depends on which economic expert you ask.\n\nDarity and co-author Andrea Kirsten Mullen have a new book, \"From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the Twenty-First Century,\" that analyzes past estimates for reparation amounts and offers new ones.\n\nUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign economist Larry Neal estimated in 1983 that America owed $1.4 trillion in reparations for Black descendants of enslaved people. Neal based this figure on the amount of wages earned by non-enslaved workers between 1620 and 1840, subtracting costs related to the care of slaves (food, housing, care, etc.).\n\nAccording to Darity and Mullen, that 1983 figure compounded at 4%, 5% and 6% interest by 2019, would be $5.7 trillion, $8.1 trillion and $11.4 trillion, respectively, as per their calculations.\n\nThey also suggest there was a major flaw with Neal's calculation: it doesn't take into account the 20 years before the Civil War.\n\nRoger Ransom, a former economics professor at the University of Virginia and the University of California, and Richard Sutch, who was a professor emeritus of economics at the University of California, before his death in 2019, based their calculation on the profit from slavery between 1806 and 1860. Their method, compounded at interest rates of 4%, 5% and 6% in 2018, would amount to $14 billion, $19.7 billion, and $27.7 billion, Darity and Mullen figured. But they also cited flaws with Ransom and Sutch's methodology. They argue that the calculation doesn't account for the first 30 years of slavery in the country, it omits profit from the slave trade, and charges the enslaved for their own maintenance costs, resulting in \"the lowest bill for black reparations among those we examine,\" Darity and Mullen write in their book.\n\nOne of the more complex calculations is by Thomas Craemer, a professor of public policy at the University of Connecticut. He multiplied the \"prevailing market wage\" by the number of hours enslaved people worked (assuming a 24-hour work day) between the years 1776 and 1865. That model, calculated for 2019 at 4%, 5% and 6% interest rates, works out to $16.4 trillion, $17 trillion and $17.7 trillion, respectively.\n\nThe problem with Craemer's calculation, according to Darity and Mullen, is that it relies on \"the market wage for non-slave labor\" rather than \"the hypothetical non-slave labor wage that would have prevailed in the absence of captive enslaved Africans.\" This yields a slightly lower calculation as per Darity and Mullen.\n\nTherefore, Darity and Mullen came up with their own calculation based on net worth. They cite the gap in mean household wealth by race, which was $795,000, according to the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances.\n\n\"If the average black household consists of 3.31 persons,\" Darity and Mullen write in their book, \"the mean shortfall in wealth for individual black Americans would have been approximately $240,000.\"\n\nNext, they multiplied $795,000 by the U.S. Census Bureau's estimate of 10 million Black households, arriving at a reparations bill of $7.95 trillion.\n\nThey also offer an alternative calculation. The Black population comprises about 13% of the American population. The nation's total household wealth reached $107 trillion by the second quarter of 2018. Thirteen percent of that amount is $13.91 trillion. As Black Americans are estimated to hold at most, 3% of the nation's wealth, according to Census data, that amounts to $3.21 trillion.\n\nEliminating the difference in household wealth, \"would require a reparations outlay of $10.7 trillion\" or, $267,000 per person for the 40 million eligible Black descendants of slavery , Darity and Mullen write.\n\nEligibility, Darity said, can be established through genealogical research to find out if one's ancestors were held as chattel, a task some say is impractical, including Congressman Jim Clyburn, one of the highest-ranking House Democrats who said in an interview that he feared reparations \"would lead to contested debates about who would be eligible due to the sprawling family trees that have evolved in the generations since slavery was abolished.\"\n\nCritics of reparations have also argued that the conversation leaves an entire group of people, Black American-born descendants of immigrants, some of whose families have been in the U.S. for generations -- and many whose families may have survived decades if not centuries of institutional racism -- excluded.\n\nAs the nation grapples with allegations of systemic racism, the ongoing wealth gap and other persistent and mounting inequities between Black and white Americans -- including disparate health outcomes and police brutality -- academics and activists say the federal government needs to face a reckoning for its culpability in these ongoing issues.\n\n\"You often hear individuals say, I didn't own any slaves, and to them I always say, 'Well, you may not have but the federal government permitted it and endorsed it, facilitated it,'\" Andre Perry, an economist and fellow at the Brookings Institution, told ABC News. \"Therefore, the federal government has a responsibility of paying that back.\"\n\n\"The policies that facilitated slavery were at fault,\" Perry added. \"The damage was caused by policy failure. Policies should drive the remedy.\"\n\nLooking abroad, despite many of the individual perpetrators of the Holocaust being long gone, Germany has paid out billions of dollars to survivors , their families and eligible heirs.\n\nPerry also noted that there are historical precedents for the U.S. federal government compensating victims of its past mistakes, and so-called \"reparations\" have happened before, just not for Black Americans.\n\nThrough the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, the government admitted to a litany of wrongdoings in its internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. As part of a reparations package, the government paid $20,000 to every living survivor of the internment camps and issued an apology that acknowledged a \"grave injustice\" that was \"motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.\" In total, $1.6 billion was paid out to more than 82,250 eligible claimants. Adjusted for inflation, that figure would top $3.5 billion in 2020.\n\nNkechi Taifa, a lawyer and reparations advocate with the National African American Reparations Commission (NAARC), told ABC News that when that bill was passed, \"it came from taxpayer dollars.\"\n\n\"I had nothing to do with the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II,\" she said. \"But my tax dollars helped to pay for that reparations settlement.\"\n\nTaifa also noted a much darker historical precedent, referencing 1860s legislation that paid reparations to slave owners for their so-called loss of \"property.\"\n\n\"Reparations were paid out after the Civil War, they just weren't paid to Black people,\" Taifa said. \"They weren't paid to the formerly enslaved people. They weren't paid to the victims, they were paid to the slave owners for the loss of their property.\"\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln's emancipation bill in 1862 provided payment to slave owners up to $300 for each enslaved person who was freed. Adjusted for inflation, that figure would be approximately $8,000.\n\nThere has been a history of pushback for reparations at the federal level.\n\nBlack Republicans like Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina are not in favor of reparations, but instead, favor policies like opportunity zones. On his website, Scott claims opportunity zones are incentives that aim to \"lift entire communities out of poverty by attracting private dollars to the corners of our country that have been left behind as the American economy has surged forward.\"\n\nBlack Democrats have also been skeptical of reparations including Rep. Clyburn, who said in an interview with the Post and Courier , that reparations would be \"difficult to implement.\"\n\nAnd some have argued that social programs like Medicaid, Social Security and other welfare benefits are a form of reparations, while not specifically targeted at Black people, write Darity and Mullen in their book.\n\nTaifa called all the arguments for why the federal government shouldn't pay reparations now, because of cost, logistical difficulties or the amount of time that has passed: \"hogwash.\"\n\n\"I say that because whose fault is it that this much time has passed that has not been addressed?\" she said. \"The demand for reparations has been going on ever since the enslavement era.\"\n\nPerry added that historically in the U.S, \"when there's white suffering, we find the money.\"\n\n\"We will sell debt, we will do a number of things to find the revenue,\" he added.\n\nTaifa cited how Congress rallied some $2 trillion extremely quickly in the CARES Act to respond to the COVID-19 crisis as an example of how lawmakers are able to find the money when they need to.\n\nAt the local level, one city has found a creative way of raising reparations funds. Evanston, Illinois said earlier this year that it plans to use the $10 million collected by the city in legal marijuana sales to provide Black residents with housing and economic development benefits.\n\nUltimately, Perry said he doesn't think the issue is a matter of where the money will come from, but rather, \"it's about political will.\"\n\n\"We shouldn't prohibit policy simply because it's hard to implement,\" he said. \"They said the same thing about integration, about women's rights -- that it's too hard, that the culture won't allow it, that the blowback will be too severe.\"\n\n\"Resistance is more about ignorance,\" he said. \"Not about facts.\"\n\nDarity and Mullen in their book state, \"The invoice [for reparations] should go directly to the U.S. Congress.\"\n\n\"The culpable party,\" Darity said bluntly, \"is the United States government.\"\n\nDarity and Mullen also propose in their book several ways the federal government could fund reparations without imposing new taxes. One way, they discuss is by funding through deficit spending.\n\nDeficit spending -- defined as the government spending more than it collects -- Darity and Mullen write, would require no change in tax rates, and if reparations provide a stimulus, could actually generate a tax revenue to fund the program.\n\nThey also suggest that the Federal Reserve could fund reparations in much the same way it funded investment banks during the Great Recession.\n\nBecause of the bailout by the Federal Reserve, Darity and Mullen make the argument that \"there can be no doubt that the Fed has vast capacity to provide the funds required for a properly designed and financed reparations program.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as increasing evidence emerges of private sector culpability or complacency in the slave trade, many are also calling on these entities which still exist today to pay reparations.\n\nA slew of banks, life insurance companies and even universities have been thrust into the spotlight recently after evidence emerged they were involved in the slave trade.\n\nGeorgetown University admitted in recent years to selling 272 slaves in 1838 to pay off debts and ultimately keep the school open. In 2019, the private university announced the creation of a fund it said could generate $400,000 a year in scholarships to benefit the descendants of these people .\n\nIn 2005, JPMorgan Chase admitted that two of its predecessor banks in Louisiana had links to the slave trade, The Associated Press reported . The investment banking giant issued an apology and set up a scholarship fund for Black students from the state.\n\nTaifa said she has been fighting for entities that \"were culpable and benefited unjustly\" from the slave trade era to \"come up with a settlement or negotiation.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the nation's wealthiest Black man, billionaire Robert Smith called on companies that profited off the slave trade to consider paying reparations.\n\n\"I think corporations have to also think about, well, what is the right thing to do?\" he told Reuters.\n\nProposals for what reparations should look like vary widely. Many advocates are calling for direct payments, others are arguing for tax cuts, and some say they should come in the form of investments in Black communities, scholarship funds or other collective investments.\n\nThe HR 40 bill that was introduced in the House last year by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Tex., calls for the creation of a commission to study and develop reparation proposals. Senator Cory Booker, D-NJ, introduced a partner bill in the Senate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly expressed her support for the bill during at an event at Howard University last year. The late Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., first proposed the bill that would become H.R. 40 in 1989.\n\nDespite support expressed from some high-profile members of Congress, the legislation tracking site GovTrack.us assigned it a 4% chance of being enacted in 2019, citing methodology by AI researchers and data engineers at the firm Scopos. This was calculated, however, before the police killing of George Floyd set in motion a new racial reckoning in the U.S.\n\nThe progressive political organization Democracy in Color said in a July 2020 poll conducted through the online platform Civiqs that 50% of Americans support H.R. 40, an uptick from 2019 when only 31% said they supported it.\n\nTaifa said \"beyond anything else it absolutely and completely, any and every reparation settlement must include an official apology.\"\n\nShe said she is fighting for monetary reparations but thinks that efforts should go beyond just payments, such as pardons for Black people who were disproportionately targeted during the problem-plagued \"War on Drugs,\" educational scholarships, investments in Black community development and more.\n\n\"Our reparation settlement should be creative,\" she said. \"The harm was multifaceted and the relief should be as well.\"\n\nPerry added that as an economist he thinks the \"most prominent form of reparations should come in the form of a check.\"\n\n\"This is about a debt that is owed,\" he said. \"This about compensating for labor and damage, so it should come into the form of a check\" to descendants of enslaved people.\n\nIn their book, Darity and Mullen also suggest direct payments and said they could be disbursed over time. They also suggest \"a portfolio of reparations\" which could be trust funds available for eligible Black Americans to apply for grants for homeownership, education, establishing businesses or purchasing financial assets.\n\nSome localities are also \"trying to figure out ways how they can create policies that address the policy violence inflicted on Black Americans over the over the course of centuries,\" Perry said.\n\n\"So, it might come in the form of investments in Black communities, new zoning practices, educational scholarships, business loans,\" he said.\n\nMost importantly, to Taifa, reparations can \"go a long way toward the racial healing that we need, the closing of a shameful chapter in this history and also the allowance for the victims themselves, those parties, to decide just what they want.\"\n\n\"When I say 'they,' I'm talking about we, Black people, really want as a future here, a political future, economic future, a cultural future in the light,\" Taifa added.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Rep. Cori Bush says $14 trillion reparations bill will 'eliminate the racial wealth gap'\n\nThe bill notes the White House and Congress were built by enslaved Black people.\n\nFor the first time, the extensive history of the enslavement of Africans, post-Jim Crow discrimination and other racially charged subjects has been entered into the congressional record -- and repairing the lasting damage these institutions caused will have a hefty price tag, according to one Democratic lawmaker.\n\nIn 23-page legislation introduced Thursday, Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., called on Congress to adopt several measures aimed at righting historic wrongs, including urging the federal government to issue federal reparations to Black Americans and other reparatory justice efforts. A minimum of $14 trillion would be needed \"to eliminate the racial wealth gap that currently exists between Black and White Americans,\" the resolution argues.\n\n\"The United States has a moral and legal obligation to provide reparations for the enslavement of Africans and its lasting harm on the lives of millions of Black people in the United States,\" H.R. 414 declares.\n\nJoining her at the press conference on Wednesday was Eric Miller, one of the attorneys for 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre . The Greenwood District of Tulsa, known as the \"Black Wall Street,\" was burned to ashes by white mobs on May 31, 1921. The last survivors of the massacre filed a lawsuit suing the city of Tulsa and local government entities and will find out within days whether or not their lawsuit will be able to proceed.\n\n\"There's a huge amount of history that hasn't been uncovered,\" Miller told ABC News.\n\n\"We want to get the opportunity to paint the picture, just as Congressman Bush is painting a picture of exactly what happened,\" he added, noting he wanted to \"call out [the] names\" of the \"hundreds of pictures of people engaged in the massacre.\"\n\nThe resolution also calls for further momentum on the state and local levels.\n\nThe Missouri congresswoman told ABC News that she is one of an estimated 40 million people in the U.S. who are descendants of enslaved Africans -- and argued in her resolution that the federal government \"must compensate descendants of enslaved Black people and people of African descent in the United States to account for the harms of chattel slavery, the cumulative damages of enslavement, and the epochs of legal and de facto segregation.\"\n\nThe resolution explores the history of enslaved Africans dating back to 1565 and notes that many of the early presidents of the U.S. enslaved Black people. Standing outside of the Capitol, Bush told ABC News her resolution doesn't shy away from the history of the nation's capital, stating that the White House and the Capitol were both built from the labor of enslaved Black people.\n\nThe U.S. benefited from over 222 million hours of forced slave labor, or the equivalent of roughly $97 trillion worth of work, between 1619 and 1865 during the end of slavery, the resolution estimates. But unlike the white enslavers, Bush notes, \"those who were stripped of their dignity and made to work without compensation, they weren't repaid.\"\n\nWhile Bush's bill focuses on reparations, it also takes aim at modern political topics, dinging states for their restrictions on \"teaching of the ways in which racism has shaped the law and way of life in the U.S.\" and arguing that present-day disparities stem from historical inequities.\n\n\"The reason why the United States is where it is economically is because of enslavement,\" Bush told ABC News.\n\nHer effort follows a similar bill from Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., reintroduced on Thursday, which called for the creation of the \"United States Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation.\" That bill, Lee said, would create a \"Commission [that] will examine the effects of slavery, institutional racism, and discrimination against people of color, and how our history impacts laws and policies today.\"\n\nBush and Lee's bills aim to be companions to H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act. That bill was named for a promise made shortly after the end of the Civil War wherein Union leaders promised formerly enslaved families \"40 acres and a mule\" -- a promise that was never fulfilled. H.R. 40, has been introduced in every legislative session since 1989.\n\nThe centuries-old promise languished in Congress for decades until H.R. 40 passed out of the House Judiciary Committee in 2021. It has since failed to come to a vote in either the House or Senate.\n\nThe resolution remains unlikely to be brought up for a vote in the Republican-led House, and members of the GOP slammed the proposal as \"shameful.\"\n\n\"While American families of all backgrounds struggle with rising prices, border chaos, rampant crime, a flood of fentanyl, and record debt -- this is what House Democrats are focusing on,\" Rep. Tom Tiffany, R-Wis., tweeted Friday of Bush's resolution. \"It's shameful.\"\n\nWhile the proposal likely won't get a vote this Congress, Bush told ABC News she hopes her bill will help build momentum for other reparations efforts, particularly those on the state and local levels.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "College campuses see growing reparations movement\n\nOver 95 universities are officially studying their ties to slavery.\n\nUniversities across the country are studying their relationship to slavery and are being called on by students to address their histories by making symbolic and financial reparations.\n\nDuring the colonial era the wealth of universities, in the form of endowments and benefactors, was inextricably tied to the slave trade, numerous university presidents owned enslaved people and famous alumni such as John C. Calhoun championed the cause of slavery. Enslaved people were owned by universities and worked on campuses until the abolition of slavery.\n\nNow, students at those institutions are organizing. They are focusing on erecting monuments, taxing endowments, creating divestment campaigns and offering alternative campus tours that highlight the university's history of slavery. Students are also pushing schools to identify and support descendants of people enslaved by the universities.\n\nAt Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, senior Carina Sandoval was \"really hopeful\" when she cast her ballot last year in the student referendum, which asked students whether they thought the university should make efforts to identify descendants of people enslaved by the institution and make some form of reparations to them.\n\nMore than 80% of the student body who voted said yes to both measures, yet Sandoval said the university did not respond.\n\n\"A number of my co-organizers and I have been increasingly disillusioned with the referendum process, as it feels like a stalling tactic by the university,\" Sandoval told ABC News. \"In any case, it's made it clear that campaigning exclusively within the university alone is ineffective.\"\n\nAccording to a landmark 2006 report on Brown's history, early trustees of the university owned enslaved people, and the first building on campus, University Hall, was built by enslaved people. The Brown family, for whom the university is named, were slave traders, the report states.\n\n\"We always welcome the opportunity to engage in a direct and positive dialogue with students, and the question of reparations remains an important one that will continue to prompt exploration on campus,\" a university spokesperson said in a statement provided to ABC News.\n\nSandoval and more than a dozen other students are part of a group called \"Coalition for University Accountability,\" which formed two years ago with the goal of educating students about the history and legacy of slavery at the university and passing two bills in the city government, both of which would tax the university.\n\nOne bill would allow the city to tax the university's property \"notwithstanding any charter provision,\" because the university is tax-exempt in the state constitution.\n\nA Boston Globe analysis found that taxing Brown's properties would give the city an estimated $48 million annually.\n\nAnother bill would enable the city to tax the university endowment, which is $6.9 billion, at a maximum rate of 2%. The bill also states that the revenue can \"be used only for the host's public school district.\"\n\nGabe Mernoff, a senior at Brown who grew up in Providence and is a member of the \"Coalition for University Accountability,\" said the idea of taxing the university specifically is something \"you hear about all the time from people\" in the city.\n\n\"We want Brown to not only be a good neighbor, but a neighbor that actively uses its resources and its vast wealth to promote social justice in Providence and Rhode Island,\" said Mernoff.\n\n\"[It's] wealth originally has been built on injustices like slavery and other forms of exploitation in subsequent centuries and today it's gentrifying a lot ,\" he added.\n\nA spokesperson for the university said in a statement, \"Brown continues to believe that taxes imposed through legislative efforts impede the efforts of higher education institutions,\" adding that \"legislative efforts such as these tend to overlook that Brown provides extensive contributions to the community we call home in significant areas that meet public need and offset the need for greater public resources.\"\n\nOn other campuses, student organizing has focused on increasing the payments many universities make voluntarily to local municipalities to compensate for the university's tax-exempt status. These payments, called PILOT, or payment in lieu of taxes, represent a small fraction of what they would presumably \"owe.\"\n\nLast year, Yale University agreed to increase its annual PILOT payments, which were approximately $13 million, by $10 million over the next five years.\n\nLocal organizer Remidy Shareef cites a multi-year organizing campaign, undertaken by community members, teachers' unions, graduate and undergraduate students, with the slogans \"Pay Your Fair Share\" and \"Yale Respect New Haven,\" as the reason for this decision.\n\n\"When you're facing a 40-plus billion-dollar multinational corporation, it takes a lot of power,\" said Sharif. \"Our community was building that power and applying that pressure, but we also needed those allies on the inside.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the university issued a statement saying, \"for decades, Yale has regularly increased its voluntary payments to New Haven. Our most recent increase is the largest yet,\" adding that \"these contributions reflect the continued evolution of our strong commitment to, and partnership with, our hometown.\"\n\nThe most recent data published by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy shows that 70 universities across the country make PILOT-type payments.\n\nAnother strategy that is being used by student organizers is calling for universities to divest endowments from certain industries.\n\nAt Harvard University, where the administration recently announced a $100 million reparations fund , student and community organizers have been focused on getting the university to divest from the prison industry.\n\nThe Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign filed a lawsuit against the university in 2020, alleging that the university had engaged in \"untrue and misleading advertising\" because \"at the time that President Drew Faust publicy [sic] promised to understand and adress [sic] Harvard's complicitly [sic] with slavery, Defendant Harvard Corporation was invested in and profiting off of the continued enslavement of mostly Black and brown peoples in prison,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nThe case was dismissed last year, with the court deciding that the six Harvard students who filed the lawsuit \"lack[ed] standing to challenge the investment decisions at issue in this suit.\"\n\nIn the most recent update from the Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery implementation committee, Harvard professor and committee chair Martha Minow said, \"we are immersed in listening to many people, gathering ideas, and moving ahead on the task of advising the president and other senior administrators, and developing suggestions for further work.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Harvard University declined a request from ABC News to comment specifically on the subject of divestment.\n\n\"Universities typically dramatically overstate the limitations on what they can use their endowments for,\" said Charlie Eaton, professor of sociology at the University of California, Merced, and author of \"Bankers in the Ivory Tower.\" \"If the university has a will to use its endowment toward racial equity it will,\" said Eaton.\n\nIn 2015, both Columbia University and the University of California system announced they were divesting their endowment from the private prison industry.\n\nAt the University of Chicago, student and community organizers have demanded $1 billion in \"reparations\" from the university to the South Side of Chicago, as part of a multi-pronged campaign asking the university to respond to its historical ties to slavery and allegations of gentrification.\n\nCurrent and former doctoral students have sought to highlight the link between the current organization, wealth and status of the University of Chicago and what is called the \"Old University of Chicago,\" which was founded by Illinois senator and slave owner Stephen A. Douglas, making the case that Douglas' original endowment, generated from enslaved laborers, made the university possible.\n\n\"The University of Chicago has developed deep partnerships with our community and the City of Chicago,\" a spokesperson for the University of Chicago said in a statement. \"We are continuing to make far-reaching contributions to address community priorities and enhance the quality of life on the South Side.\"\n\n\"The University of Chicago that exists today was founded in 1890,\" the spokesperson for the university said. \"The earlier university was founded by Douglas in 1856 and financially collapsed in 1886, with no endowment and its land and buildings foreclosed by creditors.\"\n\nThe student organizers, calling themselves \"University of Chicago Against Displacement,\" also have joined with community organizations to demand a community benefits agreement , a legal contract between a real-estate developer and organizations representing residents, from the city of Chicago.\n\nThe focus of the coalition is preventing gentrification and displacement they say will be caused by building of the Obama Presidential Library in the South Side, which is currently under construction.\n\nThe city of Chicago did not respond to repeated requests from ABC News for comment.\n\nUniversities have taken down monuments to slave owners closely affiliated with the university, and erected monuments that memorialize the histories of enslaved people within the university. More than 95 universities have joined the \"Universities Studying Slavery\" consortium, organized by the University of Virginia.\n\nAt the University of Mississippi, Columbia University, the University of Alabama and Harvard University, visitors can go on alternative campus tours that are meant to highlight the university's history of slavery.\n\nUniversities have published reports on their own historical ties to slavery comprising hundreds of pages, and Georgetown University has begun offering special consideration in the admissions process to descendants of enslaved people owned by the Maryland Province of Jesuits after the university officially apologized in 2017 for the sale of 272 enslaved people in 1838 to fundraise for the school.\n\nIn 2019, Georgetown students voted to create a reparations fund that would serve the descendant community. The school responded by creating a reconciliation fund, which receives minimum funding of $400,000 a year and is dedicated to \"support[ing] community-based projects to benefit the Descendant community,\" a spokesperson for the university said. It has also funded a charitable foundation, run by a board that includes descendants.\n\n\"We are committed to continuing to understand and respond to our involvement in the institution of slavery and ensure that our community members engage with this history and work toward racial justice,\" the spokesperson added.\n\n\"There is a tradition among students going back, at least to the 1960s, of promoting racial justice,\" said Robert Cohen, professor of History and Social Studies Education at New York University. \"This issue of reparations, and [reckoning with the] history of slavery on the university campus, is consistent with that.\"\n\nOlivia Henry, a third-year student at Georgetown University, said she has personally connected with descendants of enslaved people sold by Georgetown University and visited the plantation in Louisiana where their ancestors labored.\n\nHenry is involved with organizing a school supply drive for Maringouin, Louisiana, where many of the descendants live, coordinating teach-ins for fellow students to learn about Georgetown's history, and advocating for the construction of a memorial on campus.\n\n\"The reparations are not meant to be in any way, shape or form a cop-out for meaningful engagement with the descendant community. They are a part of Georgetown and if they want access to Georgetown's resources that should be part of their disposal,\" said Henry.\n\n\"It takes sending that first message [to descendants], and just kind of hoping that people respond. And if they don't, there's no requirement for people to talk to me,\" said Henry. \"But I'm trying to have that door open.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "What to know about California's approval of recommendations for historic reparations\n\nThe reparations report will reach state legislators by the end of June.\n\nA California reparations task force has voted to approve recommendations on one of the most significant reparations campaigns for African Americans in modern U.S. history. However, some critics have questioned whether the proposed reparations are sufficient to address systemic issues in the Black community.\n\nThe task force was established through a bill authored by then-Assemblymember Shirley Weber, currently California's first African American Secretary of State, according to task force chair Kamilah Moore. The bill was signed into law in September 2020 by Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe task force's next and final meeting will be on June 29 when the report will be released to the California legislator. Its supporters hope the report will be the foundation of a state bill, which could go to the legislature for a vote by the end of 2023 or early 2024.\n\nThe task force's report follows the United Nations' guidelines to remedy victims of international human rights violations, Moore told ABC News.\n\n\"The task force hasn't necessarily endorsed any particular dollar amounts,\" Moore said. \"We just endorsed a methodology that the economists and public policy experts we hired used to calculate the total losses in the areas of health harms, the devaluation of black businesses, housing segregation, mass incarceration, and over policing and unjust property takings.\"\n\nAccording to Moore, the task force proposed for eligible Californians to receive atonement under international law's five forms of reparations: compensation, restitution, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition.\n\nMoore cited reparations for Japanese Americans who endured internment camps during World War II and remedies for Holocaust survivors in Germany as examples used in the task force's proposal to state legislators.\n\nShe said all African Americans in California who can trace back an enslaved or freed ancestor in the United States dating back to the late 19th century would be eligible.\n\nMoore said $1.2 million is the most economists determined a resident could get if they were at the life expectancy mark of 71 years of age, or older, and endured more acute forms of racism for longer periods of time. She said some media outlets have reported misleading news, including claims that the task force is pushing for every Black Californian to receive $1.2 million.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center , 77% of African Americans support reparations for the descendants of enslaved people.\n\nBut at least one prominent critic says reparations do little to address persistent issues faced by the community, such as poverty and gun violence.\n\nBob Woodson, a Black civil rights activist and founder of the Woodson Center, which aims to reduce crime and violence, said he believes that reparations would serve as a distraction from other issues.\n\n\"It really deflects attention away from the critical problems,\" Woodson said. \"That is the moral and spiritual freefall that is consuming, not just Black Americans - that the highest death rate for our young people is homicide.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the leading cause of death for Black men under 44 years is homicide, at 26.1% for men ages 20-44 and 35.1% for those 19 and under.\n\nBut Andre Perry, senior fellow at the Brookings Institute who studies majority-Black communities and has done studies on reparations, says it is dangerous to separate these disturbing statistics from the root cause.\n\n\"Wealth is a predictor of many behaviors,\" Perry said. \"People who are low wealth or have negative wealth, are much more likely to exhibit risky behaviors like violence.\"\n\nWoodson said he was concerned about the economic toll the reparations payments would inflict on the state and its residents.\n\n\"For us to be taking seriously a discussion about whether or not a state should go bankrupt, almost, paying Blacks for reparations as if that would solve the problem,\" Woodson said.\n\nPerry pointed out that states often create emergency funds when necessary and the same could be done for reparations.\n\nMoore offered a suggestion from a state lawmaker to make payments in installments for a set number of years.\n\nShe said the economic loss faced by Black Americans in California due to systemic discrimination over the years is staggering. The amount calculated by the task force's economists is $800 billion, she said.\n\nOn the federal level, Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri announced a nationwide reparations bill on Wednesday that calls for $14 trillion to help close the wealth gap between African Americans and white Americans.\n\n\"The United States has a moral and legal obligation to provide reparations for the enslavement of Africans and its lasting harm on the lives of millions of Black people,\" Bush said at a press conference on the steps of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhen asked how the government would pay out the sum of $14 trillion, Bush said she is engaged in talks to find the answer.\n\n\"We're still having those kinds of conversations,\" the congresswoman said at the press conference. \"We're working with this administration, we're talking with other members of Congress... but I'll say this, if we can continue to fund these endless wars, or we can continue to put trillions of dollars into forever wars... we're talking about things that are happening now.\"\n\n\"The most important thing - our descendants,\" Andrea Jordan of Sacramento, California, said when describing what she would do with compensation through reparations. \"To be able to leave that tangibles for them and otherwise I would not be able to do.\"\n\nJordan told ABC News of the toll inflicted on her grandfather after laws were passed decades ago in Mississippi to take his land.\n\n\"He understood as a man and as a Black man what they had done,\" Jordan said. \"He was a mean person because of what they had done and died with a frown on his face from what he knew that he was not able to leave [for his family].\"\n\nJordan believes African Americans deserve reparations.\n\n\"We started with such a deficit that our entire life couldn't even dig us out of it. So, this would even the playing field. And it's long overdue,\" Jordan said. \"This country is drenched in our blood.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "California apologizes for role in perpetuating slavery amid push for reparations\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  September 27, 2024 / 1:41 PM PDT / CBS San Francisco\n\nCalifornia has formally apologized for its role in perpetuating slavery in the state with the signing of a bill Thursday by Gov. Gavin Newsom, even as a larger push for reparations faces challenges.\n\nThe governor was joined by members of the California Legislative Black Caucus for a signing ceremony at the Capitol Thursday. AB 3089 , authored by Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer (D-Los Angeles), acknowledges the state's complicity in the human chattel slavery of the nation's past and its legacy of ongoing harm to generations of Black Californians.\n\nThe bill passed with unanimous bipartisan support in the legislature. California joins a handful of other states that have issued formal apologies for slavery.\n\n\"The State of California accepts responsibility for the role we played in promoting, facilitating, and permitting the institution of slavery, as well as its enduring legacy of persistent racial disparities,\" said Newsom in a prepared statement . \"Building on decades of work, California is now taking another important step forward in recognizing the grave injustices of the past - and making amends for the harms caused.\"\n\nThe new law also requires the state to install a plaque memorializing the apology in a public and conspicuous location in the State Capitol.\n\n\"This is a monumental achievement born from a two-year academic study of the losses suffered by Black Americans in California due to systemic bigotry and racism,\" said Jones-Sawyer in a press release . \"Healing can only begin with an apology. The State of California acknowledges its past actions and is taking this bold step to correct them, recognizing its role in hindering the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness for Black individuals through racially motivated punitive laws,\" said Jones-Sawyer.\n\nCalifornia became a state in 1850, declaring itself a free state which outlawed slavery. But in practice, it allowed slaves to be brought into the state and continued to enforce fugitive slave laws , with the state Supreme Court declaring the anti-slavery law was simply a \"declaration of a principle.\" The state also opposed civil rights laws, enacted racial barriers such as poll taxes and literacy tests, prohibited interracial marriage, and openly sanctioned widespread segregation and discrimination against Black Californians.\n\nThe bill signing came a day after Newsom vetoed a Senate bill to help Black families reclaim or be compensated for property seized by the state through eminent domain. SB 1050 did not have an enforcement mechanism because another bill to create a reparations agency to review the claims did not pass. Newsom said in his veto message that SB 1050 \"tasks a nonexistent state agency to carry out its various provisions and requirements, making it impossible to implement.\"\n\nReparations advocates have been at odds with members of the state's Black Caucus during the process of passing bills that would implement recommendations from California's Reparations Task Force . Lawmakers are grappling over the advance of reparations policies that could include cash payments and other compensation without incurring a blowback from voters and a ballooning budget. A 2022 national poll showed 61% of those surveyed oppose the government issuing monetary reparations to descendants of enslaved people.\n\nAccording to economists from the task force, descendants in California have lost over $500 billion in wealth due to factors like over-incarceration, shortened lifespans, and the devaluation of Black-owned businesses.\n\nThursday's bill-signing ceremony included other bills prioritized by the California Legislative Black Caucus that address systemic racism. Among them is one requiring the state to review books in banned prisons, another protecting the right to wear \"natural and protective\" hairstyles in competitive sports, a bill that addresses food and medical \"deserts\" in communities of color, and a bill to enforce an existing law requiring perinatal health care workers to complete anti-bias training.\n\nCarlos E.

Another would require the installation of signage near Wall and Pearl Streets, to mark the site of New York's first slave market.\n\n\"As so many places across the country are choosing to ignore and suppress our history rather than teach it, it's vital that New York City grapple with and learn from the parts of our past we too often try not to think about,\" said Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. \"The wealth of Wall Street banks was built on the backs of the human beings sold on that very spot, and we have a moral obligation to accurately acknowledge not only this slave market's tragic history, the pain of enslaved people in our city, and the role slavery had in New York's economy, one which has echoed painfully across generations.\"\n\nEstablishing the ongoing legacies of slavery in New York City is part of the bill Councilmember Crystal Hudson introduced, which calls for a \"truth, healing and reconciliation process.\" It would also protect and acknowledge those affected, and recommend changes to prevent the recurrence of injustices.\n\n\"The harm slavery caused Black Americans continues to be felt today,\" Hudson said.\n\nCouncilmember Farah Louis' bill mandates a study on reparations, both monetary, and non-monetary.\n\n\"Financial restitution is not what we're doing right now. It's about having a conversation, putting together a committee,\" Louis said. \"They should trust the process.\"\n\nCity Council Speaker said the legislation should've happened a long time ago, and the bills \"rightfully wraps justice into one package.\"\n\n\"In this surrounding area, people of African descent were brought to these shores, sold, trafficked and worked to build this city that we so love,\" Brooklyn NAACP president L. Joy Williams said.\n\n\"I want reparations in my lifetime,\" 94-year-old Crown Heights resident Ammiebelle Bush Olatunji said at City Hall. \"It means everything.\"\n\nThe bill now heads to Mayor Eric Adams' desk.

      "text": "What the California reparations panel says - and how likely its proposals are to go into effect\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nMay 8, 2023 / 6:24 PM EDT / MoneyWatch\n\nA group of scholars and lawmakers in California just voted to advance a plan to offer reparations to descendants of enslaved people in the state. Coming at the end of a two-year-process, the momentous proposal is the first state-level attempt to grapple with the lingering effects of slavery and racist laws. It also comes with a price tag of billions of dollars and potential payouts of $1.2 million for older residents, according to some media calculations.\n\nBut the process is just beginning. California's task force must now hand over its findings to lawmakers, who will be charged with turning the recommendations into a bill. Here's what else to know about this weekend's decision.\n\nThe reparations task recommended that the state make a formal apology for its role in perpetuating slavery and its racially discriminatory laws. Topics for the apology include censure of the state's first governor, Peter Burnett, who was an \"avid white supremacist\"; the state's enforcement of the federal fugitive slave law; the state's delay in ratifying of the 14th and 15th Amendments, which formally ended slavery, and its prohibition against interracial marriage, according to the report.\n\nThe task force also made a series of sweeping proposals relating to reparations, including:\n\nThe task force also approved several possible calculations for establishing financial harm caused to descendants of enslaved or free Black Americans, detailed below.\n\nPeople who are descendants of enslaved people or free Black people who were in the U.S. before 1900 would qualify for reparations in this proposal.\n\nThe task force \"voted to recommend that only those individuals who are able to demonstrate that they are the descendant of either an individual enslaved in the United States, or an individual who was present in the United States prior to 1900 be eligible for monetary reparations,\" the report reads.\n\nThe task force decided on eligibility in March 2022 in a contentious 5-4 vote. Some members of the panel suggested making reparations universal to all 2.6 million Black residents of the state, arguing that the legacy of slavery, state-sanctioned racism and terror harm all Black people, including those who immigrated more recently. They also note that tracing one's lineage to an enslaved person would be difficult as individuals enslaved were deprived of documentation and frequently forced to move around.\n\nAdvocates for a descent-based reparations system, who prevailed in the vote, argued that this framework would have the best chance of surviving legal challenges before the current conservative Supreme Court, which has been rolling back race-based laws and policies.\n\nA race-based plan could invite \"hyper-aggressive challenges that could have very negative implications for other states looking to do something similar, or even for the federal government,\" task force chair Kamilah Moore said last year.\n\nThe report does not offer an overall economic figure for reparations. Rather, it gives several calculations as examples of how economic damages from slavery and discrimination can be documented, noting that the estimates are preliminary.\n\nFor instance, an eligible resident of the state could receive about $13,600 per year to account for the shorter life span of Black Americans that results from disparate health impacts; $2,400 per year to account for disparate policing (unless that year was 2020, in which case the figure jumps to $115,300); $3,400 per year for housing discrimination and a lump sum of $77,000 for the devaluation of business, the report notes. (The task force said it didn't have enough data to calculate harms from property confiscation.)\n\nThe task force names five categories of harm affecting African-Americans: Health harms, mass incarceration and disproportionate policing of African Americans, housing discrimination, confiscation of property and devaluation of African-American businesses.\n\nUnder this rubric, the cost of reparations could go into the hundreds of billions of dollars, while lifetime residents of the state could be eligible for over a million each. CalMatters reports that an eligible 71-year-old \"who has lived in California all their life could be owed about $1.2 million.\" A 19-year-old who moved to the state five years ago would be owed about $150,000, according to the outlet.\n\nThe task force makes clear the figures are just a starting point, calling the number \"a very cautious initial assessment,\" and said that more research \"would be required to augment these initial estimates.\"\n\nThe reparations report is not yet a law, but rather a series of recommendations that now go to lawmakers for their consideration. \"Any reparations program will need to be enacted by the legislature and approved by the Governor,\" the CalMatters website says.\n\nMany of the proposals are likely to spark heated debate.\n\n\"There's no way in the world that many of these recommendations are going to get through because of the inflationary impact,\" Roy L. Brooks, a professor and reparations scholar at the University of San Diego School of Law, told the Associated Press. Other observers note that the prospect of a recession and California's looming budget deficit could dampen enthusiasm for reparations.\n\nThe task force is scheduled to meet one last time, on June 30 , to formally accept the report and hand it off to legislators.\n\nTwo Democratic lawmakers on the task force, Sen. Steven Bradford and Assemblyman Reginald Jones-Sawyer, are expected to lead efforts to make the recommendations law, the Los Angeles Times reports .\n\nAt the federal level, a bill to study the effects of slavery and the possibility of reparations has stalled. Rep. Barbara Lee, a Democrat from California, has called for states and the federal government to pass the legislation, saying, \"Reparations are not only morally justifiable, but they have the  potential to address long-standing racial disparities and inequalities.\"\n\nSeveral localities have attempted their own reparations-styled programs, with mixed results. San Francisco's board of supervisors is considering a proposal to give financial reparations to the city's Black residents, including a $5-million-per-person lump-sum payment. In 2021, the Chicago suburb of Evanston created a program offering $25,000 for homeownership or home repair to eligible Black households, selected via lottery.\n\n© 2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "The fight for reparations has stalled in Congress. Here's what they look like in state and local governments\n\nLouis Weathers had a stable job and was married when he decided to buy a home in the Chicago suburb of Evanston in 1959 - but high interest rates and White real estate agents who seemed adamant about keeping him and other Black residents out of certain neighborhoods nearly discouraged him.\n\nMore than six decades later, the 87-year-old received a payout to make up for the discriminatory housing practices that he and other Black residents experienced between 1919 and 1969.\n\nAfter three years in the making, Evanston gave Weathers and 15 other Black residents $25,000 each in May to put toward a down payment on a home, mortgages or home repairs.\n\nLike Weathers, generations of Black Americans have faced disparities in housing, transportation, business and other areas. And as descendants of enslaved people many say they have not been compensated for their labor and the lingering effects of systemic racism.\n\nRecent federal reparations efforts have stalled in Congress, but cities like Evanston are working to atone for the harms caused by slavery and institutional racism - and address the racial wealth gap .\n\nLast week, Detroit's city council unanimously approved how it would structure the city's first reparations task force . Meanwhile in Massachusetts, the Amherst Town Council approved the creation of a fund to allocate a total of $2 million in reparations over the course of about a decade.\n\nThe push for reparations has gained momentum on the heels of the national uprising in the aftermath of George Floyd's killing in 2020, which rekindled the Black Lives Matter movement. Kamilah Moore, of the California Reparations Task Force, said she sees reparations \"as fulfilling the promises made to her ancestors\" in the mid-19th century following the abolition of slavery. The federal government now has the chance to live up to those commitments, she said.\n\n\"You can't talk about a racial reckoning in this country without mentioning reparations,\" she said. \"Reparations are comprehensive enough to address all of the ills that still impact the African American community.\"\n\nFrom cash payouts to issuing extensive reports and building a bureaucratic system to examine what reparations could look like, here is what some local and state governments have done so far:\n\nRobin Rue Simmons, a former Evanston alderman who introduced the idea to the city in 2019, said the Restorative Housing Reparations Program was created to remedy some of the harm caused by the city's historical anti-Black housing policies. When it was approved last year, it was considered the country's first reparations program.\n\nRelated article Evanston, Illinois, approves the country's first reparations program for Black residents\n\nSince it was founded in 1860s, the city \"created systems to segregate, limit, deny, and control Black citizens,\" who were denied equal access to many areas, including schooling and housing. In the early 20th century, real estate agents developed a practice of informal racial zoning, almost exclusively offering Black residents housing on the city's west side, according to a 2020 report commissioned by the city that details how the city perpetuated discriminatory practices toward Black residents.\n\nThe report also highlights that Evanston banks typically refused mortgage loans to Black residents seeking to buy homes in predominantly White neighborhoods.\n\nWhen the city's Restorative Housing Reparations program opened online applications in September, officials received more than 600 applications. In January, Weathers and 15 others were chosen at random from the first 122 applications submitted by eligible Black residents.\n\nThe program's payments were funded by donations and money collected by the city from cannabis sales taxes .\n\nWeathers says he was \"elated\" when he learned that he would receive a payout and decided it could help current and future generations of his family. Instead of using the money for himself, he transferred his payout to his 60-year-old son, Michael Weathers, to put toward his mortgage.\n\n\"It was a no brainer,\" he said.\n\nRose Cannon, a long-time Evanston resident, said she was initially excited when she heard about reparations efforts coming to Evanston, but grew to be against them once the conversation shifted from direct cash payments to a housing program.  For her, conflating housing equity efforts with reparations minimizes the larger reparations movement.\n\n\"When you use the term reparations, we would like for it to be associated with the full repair of human beings, to close the racial income gap,\" Cannon said. \"Housing can only be a portion of it, maybe a silo of it.\"\n\nThe current program, Simmons said, is the city's initial reparations effort and was informed by a mass of research that led them to identify the legacy of discriminatory housing practices.\n\nFollowing more work to address housing disparities, Simmons said the city is expected to focus its reparations efforts on economic development and education initiatives. A committee has recommended grants for Black businesses and the establishment of a Black history museum in the city, she added.\n\n\"It's not so much that the initial 16 recipients are going to completely transform the life circumstances for all of Black Evanston, but the fact that it has happened means that we can expand it and we can build on it and do more,\" Simmons said. \"Not just in housing, but in other areas as well.\"\n\nCities like St. Paul have taken steps to build a bureaucratic system to examine what a reparations package for Black Americans could look like.\n\nAfter the city apologized last year for its role in the institutional and structural racism experienced by its Black residents, officials established an advisory committee to create a framework for a reparations commission.\n\nA year later, the advisory committee has released a report recommending direct cash payments to eligible Black residents and the establishment of a permanent reparations committee focused on implementing reparations to address racial disparities in housing, healthcare, education, employment and more.\n\nAs far as funding, the report identified various sources, including the city's funding under the American Rescue Plan, sales taxes and philanthropic donations.\n\nTrahern Crews, a member of the St. Paul city council's reparations legislative advisory committee, partially influenced reparations efforts in Minnesota's capital city.\n\nRelated article Their ancestors were enslaved workers. Now they're getting $2,100 a year in reparations\n\n\"The fact that [Evanston] led on [reparations] and they were so bold to actually do it, let our city council know that this is something that can happen, and it can happen in our lifetime,\" Crews said.\n\nAlthough Minnesota was a free state, Black Americans were enslaved at St. Paul's Fort Snelling and used for free labor by the US Army. Following the abolition of slavery, they faced forced segregation, redlining, housing discrimination, and the destruction of Saint Paul's Rondo neighborhood - the city's center of Black business and cultural life. It was destroyed to give way for the construction of an interstate highway, the advisory committee's report says.\n\nYohuru Williams, another member of the committee, said the task force decided to take a more \"holistic approach\" to reparations because the damage of institutional racism is uneven and impacts different descendants of slavery in varying ways.\n\n\"It may be inflicted in one way for one set of descendants,\" said Williams, a history professor and founding director of the Racial Justice Initiative at the University of St. Thomas. \"It could have been unfair labor practices that resulted in unequal acquisition of wealth. For others, it was outright slavery.\"\n\nOne of the largest reparations efforts in the nation is taking place in California, where a statewide task force is expected to become \"a model for partners across the nation.\"\n\nIn 2020, California became the first state in the country to establish a state reparations task force and nearly two years later, the panel released its first report last month outlining the state's involvement in slavery and how it continues to harm Black Americans.\n\nIn the 500-page interim report, the task force detailed how California perpetuated institutional racism in connection to slavery and state-sanctioned discrimination, as well as how the federal government perpetuated these harms.\n\nChairperson Kamilah Moore said the report is the most extensive issued by the government on the African American community in more than 50 years. One of the report's main goals, Moore said, was educating California residents about the state's role in maintaining the institution of slavery.\n\nCalifornia entered the Union as a free state in 1850, but was only free in name as the state government supported slavery early on, according to the report. California had a fugitive slave law harsher than the federal Fugitive Slave Act.\n\nRelated article California issues its first in-depth report detailing how the government has harmed Black Americans\n\nThe task force's report outlines how Black Americans have been harmed, including by slavery and political disenfranchisement, and in labor, housing, education, the criminal justice system, and arts and culture. The panel included preliminary recommendations for each category but said a final report will be issued next year.\n\nSome of those recommendations include updating language in the state's Constitution; removing racial bias and discriminatory practices in standardized testing; compensating people deprived of profits for their work; investing in and creating free healthcare programs; and apologizing for acts of political disenfranchisement.\n\nBrandon Greene, the director of the racial and economic justice program at the ACLU of Northern California, said the report is extremely comprehensive and hopes officials consider direct cash payments as the center of their reparations efforts.\n\n\"Reparations to me explicitly is giving money for harm,\" Greene said. \"If reparations is giving me a million dollars, I can do whatever I want with it. If I want to buy a million dollars' worth of Jordan's, I can do that.\"\n\nWith several state and local governments leading the push for reparations, Moore and others said they hope the federal government is empowered to advance H.R. 40, which was first introduced in Congress in 1989 and proposes the creation federal commission to study reparations and recommend remedies for the harm caused by slavery and the discriminatory policies that followed abolition.\n\n\"The federal government is not off the hook,\" Moore said. \"I hope that people use this report as leverage to fight for reparations on a federal level.\"\n\nCNN's Nicole Chavez contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Reparations have become the latest target for conservative activists. Advocates say they are prepared to fight back\n\nFollow:\n\nA conservative group's lawsuit against a reparations program in Evanston, Illinois, that provides some Black residents with cash payments and housing assistance, has left advocates for reparations worried this could be the first of many attacks on their efforts to redress the harms of slavery, segregation and systemic racism in the United States.\n\nThe complaint, filed against the city last month by Judicial Watch, claims Evanston's program violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, and asks the court to declare the city's \"use of race as an eligibility requirement for participation in the program to be unconstitutional.\"\n\nThe argument follows a legal strategy frequently employed by conservative activists to attempt to undercut programs dedicated to addressing racial disparities in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nAs the nation prepares to observe Juneteenth - the federal holiday on June 19 that commemorates the end of slavery in the US - reparations advocates tell CNN they are bracing for potentially more lawsuits against their programs, but stand firm in their commitment to finding ways to rectify the centuries of racism Black Americans and their families have endured.\n\nUnder the Evanston reparations program, Black residents who lived in the city between 1919 and 1969 - as well as their direct descendants - can apply for up to $25,000 in housing assistance, CNN previously reported. The program was established in 2019 and amended last year to provide the option of a direct cash payment.\n\nRobin Rue Simmons, chair of the Evanston Reparations Committee, said the \"lawsuit comes as no surprise and Evanston is prepared to defend this case.\"\n\n\"This is not just an attack on Evanston,\" Rue Simmons said in a statement to CNN. \"This is an attack on the movement for reparations. This is an attack on the overall movement for the advancement of reparatory justice, racial equity, and civil rights.\"\n\nJudicial Watch's lawsuit was filed on behalf of six people whose parents or grandparents lived in Evanston during the 50-year period the program covers but do not identify as Black or African American.\n\n\"At no point in the application process are persons in the first and second groups required to present evidence that they or their ancestors experienced housing discrimination or otherwise suffered harm because of an unlawful Evanston ordinance, policy, or procedure or some other unlawful act or series of acts by Evanston between 1919 and 1969,\" the lawsuit states. \"In effect, Evanston is using race as a proxy for having experienced discrimination during this time period.\"\n\nJudicial Watch President Tom Fitton told CNN in an interview that he believes Evanston's reparations program is a \"brazen violation of the constitution and federal law.\"\n\n\"Generally speaking, you can't treat people based on race and provide benefits to some and not others based on generalized complaints of historic racism,\" Fitton said. \"The courts frown upon it.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the city of Evanston previously told CNN officials will not comment on pending legislation but will \"vehemently defend\" its reparations program.\n\nRelated article Evanston's groundbreaking reparations program challenged by lawsuit from a conservative activist group\n\nJustin Hansford , a commissioner for the National African American Reparations Commission, rejected Judicial Watch's interpretation of the legality of reparations programs.\n\n\"Jim Crow was based on race, redlining was based on race, housing segregation was based on race,\" Hansford said. \"In all those situations you had a community that was harmed based on race. So now when you're trying to give that community justice, you are going to naturally give it to the same group.\"\n\nFitton said it's possible he may file lawsuits against other reparations programs. The Evanston lawsuit comes as states and cities across the country have formed commissions t o explore how reparations can be distributed and who should receive them.\n\nThe push for reparations and a making Juneteenth a federal holiday gained momentum following the racial reckoning in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder in 2020.\n\nBut four years later, reparations and other race-based programs such as internships and scholarships across the country are continuing to face roadblocks following the gutting of affirmative action.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Oklahoma Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit that argued that the remaining survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre should be compensated by the city for damages, dealing a blow to their ongoing fight for reparations.\n\nAnd earlier this month, a federal appeals court blocked the Black-owned venture capitalist firm Fearless Fund from awarding grants exclusively to Black women entrepreneurs.\n\nSome reparations leaders say they have taken more race-neutral approaches to their programs with hopes of avoiding legal battles. Kamilah Moore, chair of California's Reparations Task Force , said her commission recommended that the state's program be \"lineage based\" meaning residents who apply for it would have to provide proof that their ancestors were enslaved or free African Americans who lived in the U.S. prior to 1900.\n\nMoore said the commission believes their lineage-based approach is constitutional.\n\n\"That's not to say there may not still be a challenge to lineage-based programs by these same groups,\" Moore said. \"But as lineage-based reparations advocates we are confident in our position from a moral, ethical and legal perspective.\"\n\nThe task force has also recommended payments to residents based on the harms suffered from inequities such as housing segregation, mass incarceration, over policing, devaluation of Black businesses, and health disparities.\n\nRelated article Oklahoma Supreme Court dismisses lawsuit brought by survivors of Tulsa Race Massacre\n\nThe recommendations have been packaged in bills that are awaiting full approval from the California State Legislature, she said.\n\nIn New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed legislation in December to establish a reparations commission that would study the lingering effects of slavery on New York residents and make recommendations for how the state could address \"longstanding inequities.\"\n\nJennifer Jones Austin, a member of the New York commission and CEO of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, said they are looking to take a more holistic approach to reparations that may include individual payments, investment in Black communities and redressing laws to advance equity and equal opportunity for Black people.\n\nJones Austin said she expected there would be legal challenges to reparations efforts given all the recent attacks on policies and programs created to repair the harms Black Americans have suffered.\n\nShe said she worries New York could be targeted but is confident the commission is doing everything possible to work within the law.\n\n\"You have to make sure you are dotting your I's and crossing your T's in any work you do that is controversial especially when it comes to money,\" Jones Austin said. \"It does make the work more challenging.\"\n\nAreva Martin, a civil rights lawyer and reparations advocate, said she was not surprised by the lawsuit against Evanston. Martin said she believes conservatives have been emboldened by the gutting of affirmative action and are using the decision to sue other race-based initiatives.\n\n\"Anybody would be naive to not be aware of these very calculated and very orchestrated and planned attacks,\" Martin said. \"But what I want people to know and what I want the message to be is that we are not going away. We are not going to shrink, we are not going to cower, we are not going to be intimidated.\"\n\nHansford said he hopes the lawsuit against Evanston motivates supporters to rally around reparations programs.\n\n\"It's a call to arms,\" Hansford said. \"We know this is just the opening salvo in a long running struggle. People around the country should realize how real the reparations movement has become.\"\n\nCNN's Justin Gamble and Andy Rose contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

      "text": "Black Americans are getting support for reparations from other multiracial groups\n\nAmy Iwasaki Mass knows the power of apology and reparations. She was in the first grade when her family and more than a hundred thousand other Japanese Americans were rounded up by the federal government and sent to internment camps in response to Japan bombing Pearl Harbor in 1941.\n\n\"They didn't have their guns out protecting us from the outside. They had guns pointing at us,\" the 88-year-old California native recalled to CNN. \"It was a pretty scary time.\"\n\nFour decades later, in 1981, she testified before the congressional committee on wartime relocation and internment of civilians - part of a Japanese American redress and reparations movement .\n\n\"Although we may be seen by others now as model Americans, we paid a tremendous psychological price for this acceptance on the surface,\" Mass said in her interview with CNN. \"Our scars are deep and permanent.\"\n\nJapanese Americans eventually won redress, with the US government granting an apology and $20,000 to those citizens who were incarcerated during World War II. Mass is part of a growing wave of multiracial support for Black American reparations - with many Jewish and Japanese organizations among them.\n\n\"When we were having trouble, Black people were being good to us,\" Mass said. \"It's not the race. It's just human beings.\"\n\nDeep blue, liberal California - and separately the city of San Francisco - has formed panels to examine reparations as a way for these governments to contend with systemic discrimination that historically held Black people down and pushed them out.\n\nMore than 200 multiracial organizations have signed on to show support for California's reparation proposals, including bar associations, philanthropies, academic organizations, and social services and civil rights groups, said Don Tamaki, a member of the California Task Force to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans .\n\n\"There is no equivalence really between four years in a concentration camp and 400 years of systemic exclusion and discrimination,\" Tamaki said. \"But I do think Japanese Americans as a group do understand what it's like to be excluded on the basis of race.\"\n\nPassage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 gave affected Japanese Americans the $20,000 payment and a formal letter of apology from President Ronald Reagan.\n\nMass said she is thankful for her payment, but the apology has the largest meaning for her.\n\n\"If we didn't get reparations, if we felt we are still being put down by the government, I think that for me it would be hard to fight,\" Mass said while looking at family photos from their time in the concentration camp in Heart Mountain, Wyoming. \"The fact that I got the letter from the president ... that was very important.\"\n\nTamaki's parents - natives of the San Francisco Bay Area - were also in an internment camp. Among an album of family pictures, he has a copy of the $20,000 redress check his mother received. Also among his keepsakes is a mailing tube addressed to his father from the University of California, Berkeley. His father was about to graduate when he and other Japanese Americans were rounded up at gunpoint, he said, and forced to live at Tanforan Racetrack in San Bruno, California. The university dutifully sent his degree to \"Apt. 5\" at the racetrack.\n\n\"That address was a horse stall into which the Tamaki family was forced to live for several months before being shipped to Topaz concentration camp in the Utah desert,\" he wrote to CNN in an email. \"Metaphorically, the diploma was the promise of America; but the mailing tube encircling and constraining that promise was the reality for Japanese Americans.\"\n\nTamaki believes there's a \"growing realization\" among other demographics that while slavery ended in 1865, the bias didn't go away, instead morphing into different forms of discrimination that ultimately kept a target on Black Americans and quickly enveloped other people of color who all benefited from the Black civil rights movement of the 1960s.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the Black civil rights movement, would I be a lawyer? Probably not. Would my parents still be living in segregated communities and me too? Probably,\" Tamaki mused. \"I mean all of the changes that happened in American society that in the modern era began to cause at least legally enforced segregation to end was a result of the Black civil rights movement and I think there's a sense that African Americans opened the door and everybody else walked through it and there's a certain truth to that.\"\n\nJust the talk of reparations is serving as an opportunity for other people to learn about how Black Americans have been impacted by decades of discriminatory practices, said Timothy Alan Simon, a native San Franciscan and the chair of the California African American Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThat's especially evident when it comes to affordable housing.\n\n\"I can remember coming up in the 50s and 60s seeing communities that once upon a time had significant Black populations and now they no longer exist. I think there's a real economic and cultural and moral impact that faces cities that are dealing with gentrification and outward migration,\" Simon said to CNN.\n\nThe data supports his claim. Black people have left the city by the bay. In 1970, 13% of the population in San Francisco identified as Black. That number stood at 5.7% as of July 1, 2022, according to US Census figures.\n\n\"San Francisco has lost the brilliance to a large extent, the cultural value, the economic contribution and innovation - all that's come out of the African American community and other cities in the Bay Area,\" Simon added, noting that the city is not as family-friendly as it was when he was growing up, due in part to the tech boom that attracted people from all over the world for high-paying jobs, leading to soaring prices in a housing market without enough supply.\n\n\"In terms of attracting families back to San Francisco, without the proper housing stock, it's just simply not going to happen.\"\n\nWhile the California reparations task force says it won't recommend an amount for individual compensation, it did hire a panel of experts including economists to calculate what Black Californians have endured. Through their formula, they determined that an eligible person could be owed up to an estimated $1.2 million.\n\nThe task force created to consider reparations recommendations has also called for restoring historical sites, supporting education and offering free legal aid and other services.\n\nOther recommendations include updating language in the state's Constitution, removing racial bias and discriminatory practices in standardized testing, compensating people deprived of profits for their work, investing in and creating free health care programs, and apologizing for acts of political disenfranchisement.\n\nIt is not yet clear how and if the state Legislature will put all or some of the recommendations into place . The task force next meets at the end of June.\n\n\"We think America should know how horrendous the harm is when you put an economic number on it,\" Tamaki said, adding that the task force is suggesting more than 100 proposals for California to address longstanding issues such as health harms, mass incarceration and over policing as well as housing discrimination.\n\nRelated article Reparations task force votes to approve recommendations for the payments of reparations to Black Californians\n\nTamaki and Simon agree that arguments against reparations fail to acknowledge the cost of being part of a society.\n\n\"We pay for wars. We pay for public works projects. We pay for human caused harms - whether they be lead poisoning or pollution. We recognize these things as collective obligations,\" Tamaki explained.\n\nAdded Simon, \"I think that argument, 'Well, I wasn't here at that time so therefore, I shouldn't contribute to the public trust to try to correct the wrongs' ... It's a very narrow and not worldly view, in my opinion. You're paying for things whether you like it or not. That's called being a citizen.\"\n\nTamaki agrees that the work to repair the damage done to Black Americans is expensive and arduous, but it must begin at some point.\n\n\"It's really an American issue that until we address this, this country is going to continue to churn and recycle this sort of toxic bias that continues to happen,\" Tamaki explained. \"I think each time that America has owned its wrongs, acknowledged them, repaired them, it's gotten better.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

But Americans disagree on how to handle its legacy.\n\nWhile nearly 75% of black respondents in an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll said they believe the US government should pay reparations to the descendants of enslaved black people, just 15% of white participants supported the idea.\n\nOverall, about 29% of the people questioned support reparations, or payment to African Americans whose family members were slaves, according to the poll conducted in September of nearly 1,300 black, white and Hispanic Americans.\n\nRelated article People are again talking about slavery reparations. But it's a complex and thorny issue\n\nReparations have been adopted as a talking point among Democratic presidential hopefuls. But there's little consensus among average Americans.\n\nThe underwhelming support for reparations is most evident among the white people who were questioned, and just over half - 54% - said they believe the history of slavery continues to impact black Americans \"a great deal.\"\n\nMeanwhile, 83% of black respondents said slavery still deeply affects them.\n\nMore - but still less than half of those polled - said the government should issue an official apology for slavery.\n\nAge was indicative of participants' beliefs, too:  Those over 60 were the least likely age group to support reparations at 16%, compared to 45% of 18- to 29-year-olds.\n\nThe renewed interest in reparations was the impetus for this poll, Jennifer Benz, research scientist and deputy director of the AP-NORC Center, told CNN.\n\nThe government has taken small steps toward formally addressing the concept this year. The House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties held a hearing on reparations on Juneteenth , the June 19 holiday that celebrates the end of slavery.\n\nBut the day before the hearing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he opposed paying reparations , arguing that \"none of us currently living are responsible\" for what he called America's \"original sin.\"\n\nMany Democratic candidates for president have voiced support for reparations, but few of them have explained how they'd implement it or what forms it would take. Marianne Williamson is one of the only candidates to propose direct cash payouts to descendants of slaves, suggesting up to $500 billion in payments.\n\nWhile the poll can't account for differences in beliefs among different race and age demographics, Benz said that over time, as the demographics that support reparations occupy a larger segment of the population, \"support may also continue to increase\" for those measures.\n\nTo supporters of reparations , the idea that slavery's impacts are not widely felt some 150 years after it was abolished is a pervasive myth.\n\nSlavery has molded institutions like capitalism, health care, culture and politics and created persistent wealth gaps between black and white Americans, said Chuck Collins, author and program director at the Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nRelated article A New Jersey religious college will set aside nearly $28 million for slavery reparations\n\n\"People say 'slavery was so long ago' or 'my family didn't own slaves.' But the key thing to understand is that the unpaid labor of millions - and the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow laws, discrimination in mortgage lending and a race-based system of mass incarceration - created uncompensated wealth for individuals and white society as a whole,\" he told CNN in April .\n\nCollins said he's found that the median wealth of a white household is 41 times greater than the median wealth of a black family - $147,000 versus $3,600.\n\n\"Immigrants with European heritage directly and indirectly benefited from this system of white supremacy. The past is very much in the present.\"\n\nThere's no equation for reparations, but various academics, lawyers and activists have guessed - based on formulations on the total value of slave labor to the US economy over about 250 years - that the payments would fall anywhere between $17 billion and $5 trillion.\n\nIt's unclear who or what would pay for reparations, but some have suggested that federal and state governments, private companies and wealthy families who owned slaves could be made to pay, since all supported and benefited from slavery.\n\nRelated article Democrats are taking reparations seriously -- and that's a big deal\n\nReparations could take on different forms, too: They could be delivered as land or through special social programs instead of direct payment, and some politicians have discussed developing tax credits for low-income families and \"baby bonds\" to pay for children's college tuition, but neither of those measures would be exclusive to black families.\n\nSome institutions have already taken measures to repent for ties to slavery: Seminaries in New Jersey and Virginia have pledged millions of dollars in reparations to the descendants of slaves who worked on their campuses.\n\nCNN's Doug Criss contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Reparations for slavery are back on the table. Here's how likely it is lawmakers take action on them and what it could mean.\n\nWhile the world is scrambling to find new solutions to racial injustice in America, an old one has bubbled to the surface again: reparations for slavery.\n\nReparations - the notion of offering remuneration to Black Americans whose livelihoods have been impacted by the legacy of slavery - has become a hot topic in the 2020 presidential election and recent protests over police brutality and racial injustice.\n\nThe notion of reparative justice for slavery has been around for more than 300 years, but only in the latter half of the 20th century did it begin building political momentum. In 1987, the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America was founded, and two years later, former  Rep. John Conyers of Michigan introduced a bill in Congress calling for reparations. Conyers, a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, continued to reintroduce the bill each year until he resigned in 2017.\n\nIn January 2019, Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee took up Conyers' mantle and introduced HR 40 , a bill that would establish a committee to study and develop reparations. Among other initiatives, the commission would identify the role both federal and state governments played in supporting the institution of slavery and the discrimination in public and private sectors against freed slaves and their descendants. Congress has been holding hearings on the bill for more than a year. Last July, Ta-Nehisi Coates - who wrote a landmark article on the topic in The Atlantic in 2014 - and Coleman Hughes, then an undergraduate columnist, debated the measure during a congressional hearing.\n\nThe most recent calls for reparations were made following the police killing of George Floyd. In early June, after a week of protests and calls for police reform, BET founder Robert Johnson told CNBC that Black Americans should receive reparations to the tune of around $14 trillion.\n\nJohnson, who became the country's first black billionaire in 2001, told the network that \"wealth transfer is what's needed\" to right the wrongs of inequality.\n\nIn a June 30 story for The New York Times, Nikole Hannah-Jones argued that to truly embody the belief that Black lives matter, the government must compensate Black Americans.\n\n\"Reparations are a societal obligation in a nation where our Constitution sanctioned slavery, Congress passed laws protecting it and our federal government initiated, condoned and practiced legal racial segregation and discrimination against black Americans until half a century ago,\" she wrote.\n\nBut despite a renewed interest in addressing the cultural and financial cost of slavery and an increased acknowledgment of the historical and social precedences for reparations, more people are against establishing a system of reparations than are in favor. According to an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in early June, 73% of Americans do not believe that the federal government should financially compensate Black people who are descendants of slaves.\n\nProponents say they're necessary to right hundreds of years of oppression. The negative financial impact of slavery, say Rashawn Ray and Andre M. Perry, authors of the Brookings Institute policy paper \"Why we need reparations for Black Americans,\" grows exponentially over time, making it more and more difficult for Black Americans to quash systemic and institutional inequalities .\n\n\"Today, the average white family has roughly ten times the amount of wealth as the average Black family. White college graduates have over seven times more wealth than Black college graduates,\" they wrote.\n\nAnd those inequalities are only exacerbated during times of crisis.\n\n\"Whenever we have an economic shock, you see Black people have a harder time recovering because of historical discrimination connected to the wealth gap,\" Perry told The New York Times . \"Now you see how easily we found money to give out when white people were suffering because of COVID and you scratch your head.\"\n\n\"Reparations are a tangible recognition by the United States that a wrong has been done to a specific group of people,\" Sheena Howard, an activist and communications professor at Rider University, told Insider.\n\nHoward believes reparative justice would require not only financial compensation, but also an acknowledgment that the United States or individual states \"have held a debt\" owed to Black Americans.\n\nThe call for reparations began even before the system of slavery ended.\n\nIn 1783, a free Black woman named Belinda Royall petitioned the state of Massachusetts to pay her for the 50 years she was a slave to her master Isaac Royall, who had fled the colonies and died in England. Belinda was awarded an annual payment of slightly more than £15 from her former master, an amount of around $2,300 in 2020 dollars.\n\nThen in 1865, following the end of the Civil War, Union General William T. Sherman issued Special Field Order No. 15, which provided emancipated slaves with 40 acres of land.\n\nBut President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated before the order could be put into effect. When Vice President Andrew Johnson, a former slave owner, became president, he overturned Sherman's directive.\n\n\"Like indentured servants, some enslaved workers received freedom dues on their release from bondage: access to land, tools, sometimes cash,\" Naomi R. Williams, a labor studies professor at Rutgers University, told Insider.\n\nBut many former slaves were consigned into a predatory sharecropping system in which they worked land that was leased to them for a portion of what was grown on the land, setting in motion a generations-long struggle to catch up with white Americans.\n\nThe US has applied a system of reparations to prior historical injustices - including the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII, the seizing of land from Native Americans during westward migration, and the forced sterilization of poor people of color through the 1970s.\n\nSpecific cohorts of Black Americans have, at times, received reparative benefits. In 1973, the US government issued a $10 million settlement to the surviving victims of the Tuskegee Experiment, a gruesome 40-year study in which 600 Black men were denied treatment for syphilis so that doctors could study the physical and psychological impact the disease had on the body over time.\n\nIn 1923, the Black community of Rosewood, Florida, was ransacked by a group of white supremacists after a white woman falsely claimed a Black man assaulted her. White vigilantes pillaged the town and burned it to the ground, leaving six confirmed deaths, though people estimate that more than 30 people were killed.\n\nThe state of Florida awarded ancestors of the community $2.1 million and educational scholarships for their descendants.\n\nSlave labor contributed untold billions to the South during the years of the Confederacy - by one estimate, the value of slave labor in the US by 1860 was around $3 billion .\n\nBut proponents of reparations believe that Black Americans should be compensated not only for unpaid wages during the era of slavery, but for the enduring systemic loss of financial opportunity due to the injustices of slavery that have persisted for decades.\n\nSeveral figures have been thrown out, but most proponents agree that the cost would be in the trillions. HB40 suggests that $14 trillion could be necessary. The point of the bill is to figure out how much it would cost.\n\nUsing the value of the original promise of \"40 acres and a mule,\" Duke University economist William A. Darity Jr. estimated that reparations would cost between $10 and $12 trillion .\n\nDarity's figure could erase the $800,000 net worth gap between white and Black households.\n\nWhere would this money come from? Funds could be pulled from federal and state governments, private businesses that benefited largely due to slavery, and could include wealthy families that owned slaves.\n\nSome individual institutions - like Georgetown University, which employed and sold slaves in the 1800s - are independently enacting reparations programs. The school now offers several hundred thousands of dollars in scholarships to the descendants of around 280 slaves who were sold by the school's founding Jesuits .\n\nBut money,  Coates argued in his article \"The Case for Reparations,\" is only part of the solution. Coates believes reconciliation for the evils of slavery - along with Jim Crow, redlining, and other racist policies - must be an ongoing project. Social programs should be built that would pour equity into the Black community in an effort to create actual equality in healthcare, property ownership, education, and more.\n\n\"Injustice and unequal treatment in the criminal justice system, healthcare, employment, education, housing, and every institution in the nation, continue to harm Black people in the United States,\" Williams, the Rutgers professor, told Insider.\n\nLee's HB40 is currently backed by 128 Democrats , though neither the House nor Senate version of the bills currently have Republican co-sponsors.\n\nWhen asked at a town hall whether he supported reparations, presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden equivocated and said it \" depends upon what it was, and will it include Native Americans as well ,\" which some interpreted as a more progressive stance than former President Barack Obama, who in 2010 said \"reparations would be an excuse for some to say 'we've paid our debt' and to avoid the much harder work\" of making a more equitable society.\n\nBut despite increased political will, there may be no easy road to making reparations a reality.\n\n\"The real obstacle, the obstacle that we have never overcome, is garnering the political will - convincing enough Americans that the centuries-long forced economic disadvantage of Black Americans should be remedied, that restitution is owed to people who have never had an equal chance to take advantage of the bounty they played such a significant part in creating.\" Hannah-Jones wrote in the Times. \"When, then, will this nation pass a stimulus package to finally respond to the singularity of black suffering?\"\n\nJump to"

The eligibility will be tied to former enslaved and free Black persons living in the US during the 19th century, which can be traced through US census records.\n\nTwo of the task force members were appointed by the California Senate and two others were appointed by the California Assembly.\n\nIn 2020, Newsom signed a bill, AB 3121, which established a two-year plan to create a task force to study and develop reparations plan recommendations for the descendants of slavery.\n\nThe task force - comprised of politicians and economists - is expected to release a reparations proposal, including individual payouts and an apology, sometime in June 2023.\n\nUnder the initial plan, Black Americans from all backgrounds were eligible to receive reparations. Now, Black immigrants and their descendants will not be eligible. According to Black Alliance for Just Immigration, that will exclude roughly 178,000 people in California.\n\nWhile California joined the US under the Compromise of 1850 - never having slavery as an institution or economic vehicle - it did have a fugitive slave law that kept persons in bondage so long as they were transported back to a southern state that had slavery as an institution.\n\nCalifornia is the only state in the nation that has passed a US slavery reparations study bill.\n\nJump to"

When pressed by The Telegraph on whether Cumberbatch's family would be pursued, Comissiong did not rule it out.\n\nHe said: \"This is at the earliest stages. We are just beginning. A lot of this history is only really now coming to light.\"\n\nDavid Denny, a leading campaigner for reparations and the general secretary of the Caribbean Movement for Peace and Integration, told The Telegraph: \"Any descendants of white plantation owners who have benefitted from the slave trade should be asked to pay reparations, including the Cumberbatch family.\"\n\nCumberbatch's ancestor, Abraham Cumberbatch, bought the Cleland plantation in the 18th century. According to The Telegraph, it housed some 250 slaves until slavery was abolished in 1834.\n\nPer The Daily Mail, the Cumberbatch family made a fortune from the plantation. After slavery was abolished, the family received a payment of £6,000 from the British government - a sum worth approximately $1m in today's money.\n\nThe actor has spoken publicly about his family's slave-owning history. He told The Telegraph in 2018: \"We have our past - you don't have to look far to see the slave-owning past. We were part of the whole sugar industry, which is a shocker.\"\n\nCumberbatch previously portrayed a slave owner in the Oscar-winning 2013 movie \"12 Years a Slave.\"  He also portrayed William Pitt the Younger in the 2006 movie \"Amazing Grace\" about the battle to abolish slavery in Great Britain.\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail, Cumberbatch viewed the role in \"Amazing Grace\" as a \"sort of apology\" for his family's role in the slave trade.\n\nThe newspaper also reported that Cumberbatch's mother once advised him not to use the family's last name professionally in case it made him the target of a campaign for reparations.\n\nCumberbatch did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Here's why reparations have suddenly become a hot button issue ahead of the 2020 presidential race\n\nThe topic of reparations for slavery has emerged as a major issue since the start of the year as Democratic presidential candidates gear up for 2020.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties will hold the first hearing in more than a decade focused specifically on reparations. The legislation, introduced earlier this year by Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, would establish a commission to study the impact of slavery and lingering discrimination against black Americans, as well as propose reparation recommendations.\n\nWhile Lee's bill isn't the first focused on reparations (former Democratic rep. John Conyers of Michigan had proposed a similar bill for decades , up until his 2017 resignation) the idea has only recently gained traction in mainstream politics, with 2020 hopefuls now beginning to weigh in on whether they support reparations for black Americans impacted by the legacy of slavery and racial discrimination.\n\nMost candidates initially responded that the country needs to accept that black Americans face systemic discrimination and a gaping income and wealth gap, without explicitly saying they would support any policy providing black Americans with economic reparations.\n\nThis tension came into sharp relief in February when Sen. Bernie Sanders, a 2020 frontrunner, said he was confused by the definition of reparations.\n\n\"We're going to do everything we can to put resources into distressed communities and improve lives for those people who have been hurt from the legacy of slavery,\" Sanders said during a CNN town hall in response to a question from the audience.\n\nWhen pressed on whether he'd specifically support reparations, Sanders asked, \"What does that mean? What do they mean? I don't think it's clear.\"\n\nSanders was opposed to reparations in 2016, calling the concept \" divisive .\" Critics have called his position hypocritical given his calls for a political \"revolution.\" However, in April, Sanders told Rep. Al Sharpton that, if the House and Senate did pass Lee's bill, he would sign it.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren has also spoken out in support of Lee's bill, writing in a March tweet that \"I believe it's time to start a national, full-blown conversation about reparations. I support the bill in the House to support a congressional panel of experts so that our nation can do what's right & begin to heal.\"\n\nOther contenders, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Beto O'Rourke, have signaled their support for the bill, while Sen. Cory Booker brought forth a Senate companion to the legislation. His platform has centered on an ambitious \"race-conscious solutions\" to aid working-class Americans and reduce economic inequality.\n\nFor instance, he proposed a \"baby-bond\" program , which would give every child born in the US a set amount of money each year. That money would be placed in an \"opportunity account\" that would grow with additional government cash transfers every year, calibrated to the child's family income and wealth.\n\nThe child wouldn't be able to touch the money until they turn 18. At that point, funds could be used only for \"wealth-building\" purposes, including paying school tuition and purchasing a home.\n\nThe policy would disproportionately benefit black youth , who would be given more money than their white counterparts, respective of existing wealth disparities between black and white families. While the average white child would end up with about $16,000 in their account, the average black kid would get $29,000, according to a recent study by Columbia University researchers.\n\nSimilarly, Harris is running on her LIFT the Middle Class Act , which would give tax credits to families making less than $100,000.\n\nIn a February interview with The Grio , Harris said her approach wouldn't exclusively aid black Americans in the way reparations would. But she said her policies would \"directly benefit black children, black families, and black homeowners because the disparities are so significant.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and say I'm going to do something that only benefits black people - no,\" Harris said. \"Because whatever benefits that black family will benefit that community and society as a whole and as a country.\"\n\nWhen pressed about reparations during an interview that month with the radio show \"The Breakfast Club\" she did signal her support, saying \"we have got to recognize, back to that earlier point, people aren't starting out on the same base in terms of their ability to succeed and so we have got to recognize that and give people a lift up.\"\n\nShe suggested in a March interview with NPR that reparations could take on the form of mental health treatment for black Americans.\n\n\"I think that the word, the term reparations, it means different things to different people,\" Harris said. \"But what I mean by it is that we need to study the effects of generations of discrimination and institutional racism and determine what can be done, in terms of intervention to correct course.\"\n\nJulian Castro, another presidential hopeful, has been particularly outspoken on the issue of reparations. In February, he said that the US must \"resolve its original sin of slavery\" through reparations specifically directed at \"descendants of slaves.\"\n\n\"It is interesting to me that under our Constitution and otherwise, that we compensate people if we take their property. Shouldn't we compensate people if they were property sanctioned by the state?\" Castro told MSNBC , adding that he supports a task force to address the issue.\n\nMarianne Williamson , a self-help guru and author, is the only 2020 presidential candidate so far to make an explicit case for reparations. She's unveiled a proposal to give $100 billion to black Americans.\n\nThe issue of reparations could be one that sways black voters, who made up a quarter of all Democratic votes cast in the 2016 primaries and caucuses.\n\nIn South Carolina, one of the first primary states, black voters make up 60% of the primary electorate. A 2016 Point Taken-Marist poll found that about 60% of black respondents were in favor of reparations.\n\nBut many, such as Sanders, have said reparations proposals don't poll particularly well among older and white Americans. They fear that reparations could encourage white, Latino, and Asian Americans to resent black Americans.\n\nThe progressive group Data for Progress found last year that while the concept had net positive support among Americans younger than 45 years old, the concept was 39 points under water with Americans older than 45. The Marist poll found that 80% of white respondents were opposed to reparations.\n\nWriter Ta-Nehisi Coates prompted a national discussion about reparations with his widely read 2014 essay in The Atlantic , titled \"The Case for Reparations,\" in which he called on Congress to create a commission to assess the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow laws, and anti-black racism.\n\nIn an interview earlier this month with the New Yorker , Coates was asked about his reaction to the 2020 candidates' support for reparations. \"What do you make of that? Is it symbolic, or is it lip service, or is it just a way to secure the black vote?\" asked editor David Remnick. \"Or is it something much more serious than all that?\"\n\n\"Uh, it's probably in some measure all four of those things,\" Coates responded. \"It certainly is symbolic. Supporting a commission is not reparations in and of itself. It's certainly lip service, from at least some of the candidates. I'm actually less sure about [this], in terms of the black vote - it may ultimately be true that this is something that folks rally around, but that's never been my sense.\"\n\nCoates and actor Danny Glover are set to testify before this week's House panel.\n\nSince his essay was first published, prominent Democrats have shifted on the issue - at least rhetorically. President Barack Obama opposed reparations when he ran for president. But by the end of his eight years in the White House he said reparations might well be justified, if not politically feasible.\n\n\"Theoretically, you can make, obviously, a powerful argument that centuries of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination are the primary cause for all those gaps,\" Obama said in a 2016 interview with Coates .\n\nHe went on, \"I have much more confidence in my ability, or any president or any leader's ability, to mobilize the American people around a multi-year, multibillion-dollar investment to help every child in poverty in this country than I am in being able to mobilize the country around providing a benefit specific to African Americans as a consequence of slavery and Jim Crow.\"\n\nFollow INSIDER on Facebook .\n\nJump to"

      "text": "'More hopeful than ever:' Biden's lead on racial equity is a promising signal for reparations, experts say\n\nLast month, Evanston, Illinois became the first U.S. city to pay reparations to its Black residents. The Evanston City Council voted 8-1 to provide $400,000 in housing assistance and mortgage relief to eligible residents through the City's Local Reparations Restorative Housing Program.\n\n\"This historic vote is the culmination of nearly two years of community input, conversation, and hard work, but it follows decades of harmful policies and practices that impact Black Evanston families to this day,\" 5th Ward Ald. Robin Rue Simmons said in a press release .\n\nIt continued: \"While we acknowledge we have a long way to go to repair all of the damages done by racism, we also know this program will make a real and lasting difference in the lives of some of those harmed by past injustices and will set the stage for additional reparative measures in the future.\"\n\nReparations were promoted as a means to redress or repair inequalities against by Black people in America, namely those who are the descendants of slaves. They would address the wealth gap between Black and white Americans that, in the fourth quarter of 2020, left white households with a total net worth that was over 20 times that of total wealth held by Black households; the high poverty rate for Black Americans, which was nearly 19% compared to 7.3% of white Americans in 2019, according to US census data; the low homeownership rate of about 43% in comparison to 73% of white Americans; and racial disparities in healthcare and incarceration .\n\nBefore reparations emerged as a key debate issue during 2020 during the Democratic primary, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee introduced Legislation H.R.40 in January 2019 that would fund a commission to study and develop proposals for providing slavery reparations to African Americans.\n\n\"The commission would study and consider a national apology and proposal for reparations for the institution of slavery,\" the legislation reads. Additionally, the bill would address the \"fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity\" of slavery.\n\nBut after the death of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, protests that consumed the summer of 2020 heightened the call for reparations to Black Americans who were already hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLegislation around reparations gained more momentum in mainstream politics as Democrats worked to confront racial inequality, according to The Hill. But it faced strong resistance from many Republications and few black leaders who dismiss the idea as \"impractical.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Tim Scott, the only African-American Republican in the Senate, told Fox News last June that reparations for Black Americans are \"not the right approach\" to help level the playing field in response to BET's founder Robert Johnson saying $14 trillion in reparations would help end the riots and lootings following Floyd's death.\n\n\"I don't think reparations help level the playing field, it might help more eruptions on the playing field,\" Scott said. \"The conversation about reparations is not a conversation I have ever been in support of and I do not support now,\" Scott said.\n\nRashawn Ray, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Insider that now is the time for reparations.\n\n\"Reparations are to make amends and repair a wrong by providing restitution to the descendants of enslaved Black Americans,\" said Ray.\n\nExperts say reparations could cost the US government trillions of dollars - anywhere between $10 and $13 trillion. Trevor Smith, a writer and communications specialist who conducts research on the history of reparations within the US, told Insider that reparations would cost around $12 trillion for Black Americans.\n\n\"A reparations package that would fulfill the broken promise of 40 acres and a mule to Black Americans would cost around $12 trillion, giving each descendant of the enslaved $254,782,\" Smith wrote in an op-ed.\n\nProposals for reparations have included cash payments, tuition remission, student loan forgiveness , down payment and housing restoration grants, and small business grants.\n\n\"These are wealth-building strategies to tackle social institutions that are most persistent at creating and maintaining racial disparities,\" Ray wrote in an op-ed for Insider .\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden was a proponent of studying reparations, and the White House confirmed last month that President Joe Biden continued to back a study of the issue.\n\nIn a March episode of \"Axios on HBO,\" White House senior advisor Cedric Richmond said it's feasible for President Joe Biden to move forward on combating racial inequities while Congress studies reparations for slavery.\n\n\"We have to start breaking down systemic racism and barriers that have held people of color back and especially African-Americans who were enslaved,\" said Richmond. \"We have to do stuff now to improve the plight, status, future, and empowerment of Black people all around the country.\"\n\nShortly after taking office, Biden issued several executive actions aimed at advancing racial equity, which included a directive for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to initiate a plan \"to redress racially discriminatory federal housing policies that have contributed to wealth inequality.\"\n\n\"He understands we don't need a study to take action right now on systemic racism, so he wants to take actions within his own government in the meantime,\" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki.\n\nAndre Perry, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Insider the executive actions are a good step to address the issues and damages brought on by an unfair government.\n\nPerry said he's \"more hopeful than ever\" for reparations to be implemented now that Biden is in office.\n\nRay told Insider that he's also hopeful that reparations might be done by Biden and although \"executive actions are rarely ever enough, they are a start to allocate and shift resources to address the issue.\"\n\n\"There will never be enough to make up for the racial wrongs of the past and present. But the federal government has the largest role to play,\" Ray said.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "In 1870, a Black woman sued her enslaver for reparations and won\n\nHenrietta Wood was born into slavery to the Tousey family in Kentucky between 1818 and 1820. About a decade later, she was sold for $700 to a merchant, Henry Forsyth , in Louisville. According to some reports , the Louisville merchant physically and mentally abused her.\n\nFor debt reasons, Wood was sold again as a teenager to a French immigrant, William Cirode, between 1835 and 1848 in New Orleans, where she worked as a housemaid. When Cirode abandoned his family due to legal issues, his wife, Jane, moved back to Cincinnati, where she rented out Wood as a domestic servant.\n\nFearing debt collectors, Jane Cirode declared Wood free at an Ohio courthouse in 1848. This legally meant Wood could work as a free Black woman. She remembered that period of her life as a \" sweet taste of liberty .\"\n\nBut freedom was short-lived. Five years later, Zebulon Ward, a Kentuckian deputy sheriff who Cirode's daughter and son-in-law, Josephine and Robert White, hired to capture Wood in Kentucky, kidnapped her. Wood was once again enslaved \"illegally\" for 16 years through the Civil War.\n\nFollowing Wood's return to Cincinnati in 1870, she sued Ward for $20,000 in damages and lost wages, estimating that her cost of labor was worth $500 for every year she was enslaved.\n\nThough she faced many hurdles, Wood ultimately won her case eight years after filing the lawsuit. In 1878, an all-white jury voted in Wood's favor , a historic victory in the history of reparations.\n\nBut Ward was ordered to pay only $2,500 - a fraction of the original amount Wood requested, yet still the largest sum a US court had ever awarded for reparations. What was $2,500 in 1878 would be worth over $75,000 today .\n\nWood died in Chicago in 1912. Her story is one of the few victories in the history of reparations in America.\n\nIn an April 1878 article about Wood's lawsuit, The New York Times suggested that more formerly enslaved Americans may ask for reparations. \"The United States Government may be asked to make good the loss of those whose property was suddenly clothed with the right of manhood,\" The Times wrote. \"But who will recompense the millions of men and women for the years of liberty of which they have been defrauded? Who will make good to the thousands of kidnapped freemen the agony, distress, and bondage of a lifetime?\"\n\nWood used the money from the lawsuit to move to Chicago with her son. The money helped him buy a home and attend college. In 1889, Wood's son became one of the first Black men to graduate from what would later become Northwestern University's School of Law.\n\nIn his book, \" Sweet Taste of Liberty: A True Story of Slavery and Restitution ,\" W. Caleb McDaniel, a professor at Rice University, wrote that Wood's case stood as proof of the lasting impact reparations could have: \"It was about what former slaves were owed ... as well about the real differences restitution could make.\"\n\nDanielle Blackman, a descendant of Wood, told the Seattle Times that Wood's story inspired her to pursue college and, in the face of racial discrimination, to always \"find a way or invent a way to make it work, even if we had to wait it out.\"\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, the Senate and the House of Representatives issued unprecedented apologies for slavery and Jim Crow laws but did not pass any joint bill for reparations.\n\n\"Whereas it is important for this country, which legally recognized slavery through its Constitution and its laws, to make a formal apology for slavery and for its successor, Jim Crow, so that it can move forward and seek reconciliation, justice, and harmony for all of its citizens,\" Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee wrote in the resolution.\n\nWhile there has been more vocal support for reparations in recent years, and individual states have instituted their own reparations committees , federal efforts have stalled.\n\nLast May, Democratic Rep. Cori Bush proposed Reparations Now , legislation that would push the federal government to provide reparations to the descendants of enslaved people.\n\n\"Black people in our country cannot wait any longer for our government to begin addressing each and every one of the extraordinary bits of harm it has caused since its founding, that it continues to perpetuate each and every day all across our communities all across this country,\" Bush said during a press conference.\n\nJump to"

Al Sharpton he would sign a bill to research reparations for descendants of slaves if elected president, somewhat reversing course on an issue that's emerged as one of the central topics of discussion along the 2020 campaign trail.\n\nSharpton asked the Vermont senator if he would sign Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee's bill that calls for setting up a commission to study the issue of reparations. Signing the bill into law would not automatically grant payments to descendants of slaves, which is something Sanders has expressed opposition to during interviews in recent weeks.\n\n\"If the House and Senate pass that bill of course I would sign it...There needs to be a study,\" Sanders told Sharpton at the National Action Network conference in midtown Manhattan on Friday.\n\nSanders added, \"But let me also say this, that I think what we need to do...is to pay real attention to the most distressed communities in America. We've got to use 10% of all federal funds to make sure that kids who need it get the education, get the jobs, get environmental protection, that they need.\"\n\nThe senator said this would be a \"major focus\" if he was elected.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, who are competing against Sanders for the 2020 Democratic nomination, also pledged to sign Lee's bill when asked by Sharpton on Friday.\n\nIn an appearance on \"The View\" last month, Sanders expressed skepticism over the discussions on reparations in the context of the 2020 race. He questioned what reparations for descendants of slaves would look like from a policy standpoint.\n\n\"I think that right now our job is to address the crises facing the American people in our communities,\" Sanders said at the time. \"And I think there are better ways to do that than just writing out a check.\"\n\nA recent INSIDER poll found a majority of voters who identify as liberal, 54%, support reparations for descendants of slaves.\n\nDuring his speech at the conference on Friday, Sanders focused heavily on criminal justice reform and once again referred to President Donald Trump as a \"racist.\"\n\n\"It gives me no pleasure to tell you that we have a president today who is a racist. Who is a sexist. Who is a homophobe. Who is a xenophobe. And who is a religious bigot.

Here's where the 2020 candidates stand.\n\nSeveral 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have came out in support of reparations for descendants of slavery, starting a conversation about what that would look like both financially and culturally.\n\nBut each candidate who has weighed in on the issue has attacked it from a different angle, while others have outright declined to support such a proposal.\n\nRead more : 2020 candidate Julian Castro blasts Bernie Sanders over slavery reparations\n\nThe idea of reparations for descendants of slavery is not a new one. Since the Civil War, the prospect of providing compensation for slaves and their descendants has existed in various iterations, such as confiscating land from the Confederacy to give to slaves or simply issuing money.\n\nWhat reparations boil down to is, how does the United States address the significant gaps between African-Americans and other demographics - which proponents say extend to the present day - from the brutal and inhumane slave trade in the US?\n\nHere are what some of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who support some form of reparations have said so far.\n\nOther candidates have declined to support such a policy but have instead backed other initatives they believe will address racial inequality gaps.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said during an appearance on ABC's \"The View\" that he wants to emboldened low-income communities but stopped short of endorsing reparations.\n\n\"What we have got to do is pay attention to distressed communities: black communities, Latino communities, and white communities, and as president I pledge to do that,\" he said. \"I think that right now, our job is to address the crises facing the American people and our communities, and I think there are better ways to do that than just writing out a check.\"\n\nSanders' comments also created a bit of a spat between him and Castro.\n\n\"There's a tremendous amount of disagreement on how we would do that, but let me say something about Senator Sanders's response there. He was also asked this question in 2016,\" Castro said. \"What he said on 'The View' the other day, I think, he didn't think the best way to address this was for the United States to write a check.\"\n\n\"To my mind that may or may not be the best way to address it. However, it's interesting to me that when it comes to 'Medicare for all,' health care, you know the response has we need to write a big check, that when it comes to tuition-free or debt-free college, the answer has been we need to write a big check,\" he added. \"So if the issue is compensation think the argue about writing a big check ought to be the argument you make if you're making the argument that a big check needs to be written for a whole bunch of other stuff.\"\n\nStaffers for Sanders' 2020 campaign responded by characterizing Castro's comments as \"playing politics,\" arguing that \"no one's got the magic vision.\"\n\nJump to"

Bernie Sanders on Friday said there are \"better ways\" to address the crises in American communities than \"writing out a check\" when he was asked if he supports reparations for the descendants of slaves.\n\nWhen Sanders was asked to expand on his views regarding this issue on ABC's \"The View,\" the senator said, \"The wealth gap ... between the white community and the black community is like 10 to one. Health disparities are terrible, environmental disparities are terrible - Flint, Michigan, comes to mind.\"\n\nSanders added, \"What we have got to do is pay attention to distressed communities - black communities, Latino communities, and white communities all over this country - and as president I pledge to do that.\"\n\nThe Vermont senator was then pressed by host Sunny Hostin to address reparations more specifically.\n\nHostin asked, \"Why not support reparations then?\"\n\nSanders asked Hostin to clarify exactly what she means by \"reparations,\" and she said \"money\" for the descendants of slaves.\n\n\"I think that right now our job is to address the crises facing the American people in our communities,\" Sanders replied. \"And I think there are better ways to do that than just writing out a check.\"\n\nA number of Democratic candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have been questioned on their positions on reparations and it appears to be emerging as a central issue in campaign discussions.\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro has explicitly endorsed reparations, but other candidates have offered more vague, convoluted stances.\n\nSen.

Years later, the money 'played a big role' in going to college.\n\nWhen Breeana Larkins was a teenager growing up in South Florida she learned a \"life-changing\" detail about her family tree. Her grandmother was a descendant of the 1923 Rosewood massacre.\n\nOn New Years Day 1923, just two years after the Tulsa Race Massacre , white vigilantes targeted and destroyed Rosewood, a tight-knit, majority Black community in Levy County, Florida. The terror attack - which lasted over a week - started after a 22-year-old white woman accused a Black man of physically assaulting her in Sumner, Florida, according to a 1993 report . The surviving Black residents fled to nearby areas and did not return home.\n\n\"It wasn't anything that was introduced to me through my education,\" Larkins told Insider about the massacre. \"It was taught from my family.\"\n\nBefore the massacre, Rosewood was a robust town with well-educated residents who lived in two-story homes and owned land and the residents were considered wealthy, Sherry Dupree a historian of the Rosewood Heritage Foundation told Insider.\n\n\"They were really another Black Wall Street that was taken out of existence because of their wealth,\" Dupree said, referring to Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma. \"That was why they were taken out because these other people could not stand to see Black folks living that way.\"\n\nAt the time of the massacre, the survivors were young and didn't speak about it for 20 to 30 years \"other than in family hush-hush situations because of the fear,\" Dupree said. But in the 1980s they gathered for a family reunion in Florida. Then in 1994, Florida legislators passed a bill granting the survivors reparations.\n\n\"The total amount of reparations was 2.1 million, and it was to be given to family members who left Rosewood during the time of the Rosewood Massacre,\" Dupree said. \"They had to have left during the time of the Rosewood Massacre.\"\n\nThe reparations package included an education fund for descendants.\n\n\"In order to receive it, I remember we had to submit my grandma's death certificate to (1) prove that, that's how we were related,\" Larkins said. \"It definitely played a big role financially in me continuing my education.\"\n\nLarkins used the money to cover part of her financial aid for college, she said.\n\nAccording to Dupree, the survivors who received reparations weren't able to go on lavish trips with their money but used it for \"survival,\" investing in healthcare, bills, their homes, and family members.\n\n\"They just didn't have a chance to enjoy it because most of them died the next few years,\" Dupree said.\n\nIn 1995 Willie Evans, one of the survivors compensated, told the Orlando Sentinel he used his money to renovate his home. Years later, his great-great-niece, Keri Miller, was able to receive the Rosewood scholarship when she was a student at Florida A&M University, a historically Black institution.\n\n\"Even though reparations will never give back what our family has experienced ... I feel like it's a step in the right direction,\" Miller said.\n\nFew groups in US history have received compensation. Among those who have are Japanese Americans who were put in internment camps during WWII, victims of the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment, and Rosewood survivors.\n\nA city in Illinois , Evanston, took a major step in reparations when it recently announced a plan to pay Black residents $10 million - $400,000 of which are earmarked for housing and mortgage assistance. In California, a task force was formed last year to study the impacts of slavery and \"recommend appropriate remedies.\" Last month the three living survivors of the Tulsa race massacre continued their call for reparations 100 years after the historic event.\n\nLarkins said that reparations are a \"necessity\" especially after what her grandmother's family went through.\n\n\"I think we all can look at history and see how Black people and other people of color and indigenous people included, how we have been basically put through hell,\" Larkins said.\n\n\"And I know some people say, well, that was the past, but the past really dictates the future,\" she continued.\" So I feel like it's a good thing for reparations to be given.\"\n\nJump to"

Most left Haiti years ago, after a 2010 earthquake ravaged what was already one of the most dismal economies in the world. They had originally settled in places like Chile , but the politics of the region have made them feel unwelcome, discriminated against, and fearful of the future.\n\nThe Haitian refugees hoped the United States, under President Biden, would offer them a lifeline. They were wrong. The Biden administration has been sending thousands back to Haiti, even though Haiti is a disaster zone, and many of the refugees fled it years ago. Some of those the U.S. government forcibly sent to Haiti are kids who have never lived there.\n\nAmbassador Daniel Foote, who was appointed by President Biden as the U.S. special envoy to Haiti in July, resigned in protest against his administration's policy. \"I will not be associated with the United States' inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees,\" Foote wrote in his resignation letter .\n\nTens of thousands of migrants, many of them Haitians previously living in South America, have arrived in recent weeks in Mexico hoping to enter the United States. ALFREDO ESTRELLA/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nTens of thousands of migrants, many of them Haitians previously living in South America, have arrived in recent weeks in Mexico hoping to enter the United States.\n\nThe Haiti that refugees are being sent back to is a nation in crisis. With its unlucky coordinates on the map and its poor infrastructure, Haiti has been devastated by multiple hurricanes and earthquakes in recent years, including a 7.2 magnitude earthquake in August . In July, Haiti's president, Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated by Colombian mercenaries, some of whom had received U.S. military training . A Florida-based security company reportedly connected whoever wanted Moïse killed with the mercenaries, but the details of why Moïse was killed and who directed the mercenaries are still murky .\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that Moïse's assassination continues Haiti's centuries-long political instability. In 2015, the World Bank concluded that Haiti's biggest political problem is that \"a social contract is missing between the state and its citizens.\" Ambassador Foote, in his resignation letter, blasted the United States and other nations for contributing to this problem for the umpteenth time by unabashedly backing Moïse's unelected replacement, Ariel Henry. Henry was appointed Prime Minister by Moïse in July, and took on the additional role of President after Moïse's assassination. Haiti's chief prosecutor said he found evidence linking Henry to the president's killing, and Henry promptly fired him . Some Haitian authorities have asked Henry to step down and pleaded with the international community to stop supporting him. \"This cycle of international political interventions in Haiti has consistently produced catastrophic results,\" Foote wrote.\n\nHaiti is one of the poorest nations in the world, and rich countries have their fingerprints all over the nation's stunted development. The United States worked to isolate a newly independent Haiti during the early 19th century and violently occupied the island nation for 19 years in the early 20th century. While the U.S. officially left Haiti in 1934, it continued to control Haiti's public finances until 1947 , siphoning away around 40% of Haiti's national income to service debt repayments to the U.S. and France.\n\nMuch of this debt to France was the legacy of what the University of Virginia scholar Marlene Daut calls \"the greatest heist in history\": surrounded by French gunboats, a newly independent Haiti was forced to pay its slaveholders reparations. You read that correctly. It was the former slaves of Haiti, not the French slaveholders , who were forced to pay reparations. Haitians compensated their oppressors and their oppressors' descendants for the privilege of being free. It took Haiti more than a century to pay the reparation debts off.\n\nHaiti won its independence from France in 1804, and it was almost immediately made a pariah state by world powers. It was an independent, black-led nation - created by slaves who had cast aside their chains and fought their oppressors for their freedom - during a time when white-led nations were enforcing brutal, racist systems of exploitation around the world.\n\nHaiti, then known as Saint-Domingue, had been the crown jewel of the French empire. It was the most lucrative colony in the whole world. French planters forced African slaves to produce sugar, coffee, and other cash crops for the global market. The system seemed to work well. That is, until the French and American revolutions helped to inspire, in 1791, what became the world's largest and most successful slave revolt. Against all odds, the slaves won. Former slaves sent slaveholders scurrying to France and America - and Haitians successfully fought back subsequent efforts to re-enslave them. Haiti was the first nation to permanently ban slavery.\n\nBut as a nation of freed black slaves, Haiti was a threat to the existing world order. President Thomas Jefferson worked to isolate Haiti diplomatically and strangle it economically, fearing that the success of Haiti would inspire slave revolts back home. With the invention and spread of the cotton gin, slavery was becoming much more lucrative at the very same time a free Haiti was coming into existence, and slaveholders in the United States and other countries clung to and expanded the inhumane means of production. Haitian success was perceived as a threat to this system for decades, and the United States didn't officially recognize Haiti until 1862, as slavery began being abolished.\n\n[Editor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money 's newsletter. You can sign up here .]\n\nDuring Haiti's critical period of development, France intervened even more directly than the U.S. to thwart its success. In July 1825, the French King, Charles X, sent an armed flotilla of warships to Haiti with the message that the young nation would have to pay France 150 million francs to secure its independence, or suffer the consequences. That sum was 10 times the amount the United States had paid France in the Louisiana Purchase, which had doubled the size of the U.S.\n\nAlmost literally at gunpoint, Haiti caved to France's demands in order to secure its independence. The amount was too much for the young nation to pay outright, and so it had to take out loans with hefty interest rates from a French bank. Over the next century, Haiti paid French slaveholders and their descendants the equivalent of between $20 and $30 billion in today's dollars. It took Haiti 122 years to pay it off. Professor Marlene Daut writes it \"severely damaged the newly independent country's ability to prosper.\"\n\nAfter the 2010 earthquake completely devastated Haiti, scholars and journalists wrote a letter to the French president demanding that France pay back Haiti. The French economist Thomas Piketty resurrected the idea in 2020, arguing that France owes Haiti at least $28 billion. The French government, under multiple presidents, has balked at the idea , and it is unlikely to pay Haiti back anytime soon.\n\nBut if the rich world wants to help right the wrongs done to Haiti in the past, perhaps the most effective policy right now would be to accept more Haitian refugees. This wouldn't only be a humane policy that would improve their and their future families' lives. It would also likely be a boost to the Haitian economy. According to the World Bank, Haitian expatriates sent $3 billion in remittances back home to Haiti in 2018, which was almost one-third of the island nation's entire GDP.\n\nDid you enjoy this newsletter segment?

The growing number of local actions has renewed hopes and questions about a national policy. Jeff Chiu/AP hide caption\n\nA reparations rally outside City Hall in San Francisco this month, as supervisors take up a draft reparations proposal. The growing number of local actions has renewed hopes and questions about a national policy.\n\nLocal reparations programs - in about a dozen cities and the state of California - have renewed hopes for an eventual national policy to compensate for slavery. But after decades of lobbying and three years of a national reckoning over race, Americans overall remain strongly opposed to the idea.\n\nWhen Tatishe Nteta began polling about it several years ago he expected money would be the biggest issue. Or perhaps the workability of such a complex undertaking. It turns out those are the smallest concerns among the two-thirds of Americans who say they're against cash payments to the descendants of slaves.\n\n\"A plurality of Americans,\" Nteta says, \"don't believe the descendants of slaves deserve reparations.\"\n\nThe political science professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, plans more research to get at exactly why people think that. The other most common reasons opponents cite is that it's \"impossible to place a monetary value on the impact of slavery\" and \"African Americans are treated equally in society today.\"\n\nNteta, and also the Pew Research Center , find about three-quarters or more of white adults oppose reparations, and so do a majority of Latinos and Asian Americans. A large majority of Black Americans support them. There's also more support among younger people and a sharp political divide, with overwhelming opposition from Republicans and conservatives.\n\nOn a recent sunny day on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., it was not hard to find reparations opponents willing to share their reasoning.\n\n\"You can't take what we know now and try to superimpose yourself onto 150 years ago,\" says Jeff Bernauer, visiting from Huntsville, Alabama. He calls racism a sin and says of course slavery was wrong. But to try and make amends at this point makes no sense.\n\n\"The generation that would be paying for it have nothing to do with what was done in the past,\" he says. \"And then you're paying people that have nothing to do with it in the past.\"\n\nTerry Keuhn of upstate New York agrees, and does not like the idea of a targeted program that would only help some people.\n\n\"We're all immigrants at some point, whether it was voluntary or forced,\" she says. \"And nobody needs a handout anymore. Everybody, you know, pulls themselves up by their own bootstraps and works for a living and makes their way in this world.\"\n\nThat conviction - that hard work pays off - is a core narrative of the U.S., says Yale social psychologist Michael Kraus, and the notion of a persistent racial wealth gap clashes with it. He's surveyed people about this and thinks his findings help explain the broad opposition to reparations.\n\n\"A majority of our sample tends to think that we've made steady progress towards greater equality in wealth between families, so between black and white families,\" he says. \"That is totally inconsistent with reality.\"\n\nMost of those he surveyed thought that today, for every $100 dollars white families have, Black families have about $90. In fact, the racial wealth gap is exponentially larger . Given its magnitude, and the recent intense focus on racial justice around the country, Kraus calls this disconnect a kind of \"collective willful ignorance.\"\n\nSure, he says, many people - especially white - may be isolated from those in different economic circumstances, and so find it difficult to fathom the enormous wealth gap. But he says it doesn't take much work to understand that Black people continue to be discriminated against in the job market, housing, banking, and other areas. He's come to believe that some - consciously or not - are avoiding information they may find uncomfortable.\n\nDorothy Brown is a convert on reparations. The Georgetown law professor dismissed the idea as impractical and unlikely, until she wrote a book about how even the U.S. tax system favors white families at the expense of Black ones. She decided the country's persistent wealth gap goes back to slavery , and so the only solution is reparations. Although she thinks they should be about systemic changes and not just cash.\n\n\"In 2 to 3 years that wealth would wind up in white hands, because our system for building wealth is not one designed for Black wealth,\" she says.\n\nBrown is not daunted by the lack of public support. Her forthcoming book will make the case for reparations and she thinks many Americans are persuadable.\n\n\"Part of it is an education, it's a walk through history,\" she says. \"It's a recognition that, okay, you may not have had anything to do with slavery, but ... your white grandfather got an FHA [Federal Housing Administration] insured loan. My grandfather couldn't because he was Black.\"\n\nBrown sees a model in U.S. reparations for Japanese Americans who'd been interned during World War II.\n\nBefore the activist push for them, \"fundamentally there was a lack of knowledge about what happened,\" says historian Alice Yang of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Then in 1980 and 1981, Congress held hearings in 20 cities around the country, and they included powerful testimony from people who'd been incarcerated with their families as children.\n\n\"Those hearings had a major impact on public perception of what happened during the war, how Japanese Americans were affected by it, and why redress might be appropriate,\" Yang says.\n\nIt helped convince some Japanese Americans who'd opposed the idea of reparations. But Yang says public opinion overall was not much of a factor. Japanese Americans at the time were only .5% of the population, mostly in California and Hawaii. The campaign for reparations was really about persuading members of Congress, and \"if there had been a lot of public opinion opposing it, I think it might have affected [them] differently,\" Yang says.\n\nSupporters of reparations for Black Americans consider a national program crucial. Explicitly racist federal policies were key in creating the wealth gap, and only the federal government could come anywhere close to compensating for harms that some have calculated at as much as $14 trillion . Brown sees local reparations as part of an education campaign for a national push, but others aren't sure whether they'll help or hurt.\n\nNteta, at U-Mass Amherst, believes some places are being mindful of the broad opposition to atoning for slavery. Evanston, Illinois, for example, is providing housing grants for residents who faced discrimination.\n\n\"It's not about slavery,\" Nteta says. \"It's about the ways in which individuals who still are alive today were treated during a period of Jim Crow and institutionalized racism. So those people still exist.\"\n\nIf that or another program is deemed successful, he says, perhaps a national roadmap will emerge. But Yale researcher Kraus says they could also prompt backlash and reinforce misperceptions about the wealth gap.\n\n\"People could even use local reparations events as evidence that things are moving too fast and unnaturally towards equality, and so we need to stop and take a measured approach,\" he says.\n\nNteta already sees a general backlash. He says the debate over critical race theory and how to teach race in schools is \"part and parcel of the debate about reparations,\" and yet another challenge to building support for them.\n\nHe says he wouldn't rule out an eventual policy, as young people more supportive of reparations replace older voters. But if it ever happens, \"it's going to be, I think, decades.\"\n\nIn the Pew survey, even most supporters of reparations considered them unlikely to happen in their lifetime.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Cori Bush introduces bill on reparations for Black Americans\n\nBy\n\nAlana Wise\n\nRepresentative Cori Bush speaks during a press conference held by Just Majority on May 8, 2023 in St Louis, Missouri. Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images for Just Majority hide caption\n\nRepresentative Cori Bush speaks during a press conference held by Just Majority on May 8, 2023 in St Louis, Missouri.\n\nMissouri Democratic Rep. Cori Bush has introduced new legislation calling for $14 trillion in reparations for Black Americans, in an effort to see the federal government atone for the practice of chattel slavery and hundreds of years of racist policies that followed.\n\n\"The United States has a moral and legal obligation to provide reparations for the enslavement of Africans and its lasting harm on the lives of millions of Black people,\" Bush said in a Wednesday news conference attended by Reps. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., and Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., as well as other stakeholders.\n\n\"America must provide reparations if we desire a prosperous future for all,\" Bush said.\n\nHer resolution is the latest in a long line of congressional efforts by Democrats to compensate Black Americans for centuries of racial inequity. Similar language about reparations has been introduced in every legislative session since 1989.\n\n\"We know that we continue to live under slavery's vestiges. We know how slavery has perpetuated Jim Crow. We know how slavery's impacts live on today,\" Bush said, citing the racial wealth gap, voter suppression, infant mortality rates and other negative health outcomes for Black people.\n\n\"It's unjust and it wouldn't happen in a just and fair and equitable society,\" she said. \"Those are not the natural consequences of human society.\"\n\n\"They are directly caused by our federal government's role in the enslavement and exploitation of Africans and Black people throughout our history.\"\n\nWhile the conversation around reparations has picked up traction in recent years, with about a dozen cities and the state of California considering reparation programs, the concept remains broadly unpopular with Americans.\n\nAbout three-quarters or more of white adults oppose reparations, and so do a majority of Latinos and Asian Americans.\n\nBlack Americans overwhelmingly support the proposal, and young people in general are more likely to support cash payments to the descendants of enslaved people than their older counterparts.\n\nBut more than 90 percent of Republicans say they oppose it, while Democrats are split nearly 50/50 on whether descendants should receive compensation.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Nearly 400 years later, the city of Boston is grappling with that legacy. In 2022, the city created a task force to consider reparations to the descendants of enslaved people. In \"What Is Owed?\" - a new podcast from GBH News - reporter Saraya Wintersmith explores what reparations could look like and how that debate is reflected across the nation and the globe. (SOUNDBITE OF CLOCK TOWER CHIMING) SARAYA WINTERSMITH: It's 3:00 on a weekday afternoon at the John Hancock Memorial in the Granary Burying Ground in Boston. (SOUNDBITE OF CLOCK TOWER CHIMING) WINTERSMITH: The site is kind of like a who's who of the American Revolution. There are graves for important figures like Thomas Paine and Samuel Adams. Every year, millions of tourists pass through here to visit the grave of John Hancock. You know John Hancock. Tour guides tout the man's great contributions to the country. But what you might not know, buried beside that much-celebrated Founding Father's grave is a man he enslaved. His name was Frank. Like many founding families, the Hancocks claimed several people as property, and they made their money in commerce based on products produced by the enslaved. That fortune bankrolled much of Boston's pre-Revolutionary activism. The tour guides here often referred to Frank as Hancock's servant. They say the two men must have been close because of how closely they were buried. Frank's contributions to the country have never been documented. Neither were the roles of countless other enslaved people - people who helped set Boston's trajectory to become a leader in health, education and technology. They were rarely recorded. Instead, U.S. history is full of portraits of heroic white people, mostly men. (SOUNDBITE OF SIREN) JULIA MEJIA: Boston has a deep racial history, and there's a lot of trauma that so many of us still carry. TANISHA SULLIVAN: We like to talk about Boston as a seat for the abolitionist movement. We don't like to talk so much about the role that Boston played in helping to finance this booming trade that was dehumanizing of Black folks in this country. WINTERSMITH: This duality has always existed throughout Boston's history. There's the facts and figures most Bostonians pride themselves on, like Boston being one of the first places in the U.S. to ban slavery. Then there's also the history Black Bostonians have been trying to hold the city accountable for, like being part of the first colony to legalize slavery and, much later, clinging to segregation around the end of the Civil Rights era. Now, Boston has taken it upon itself to bring both narratives together and address the harm. In 2022, the city of Boston made a commitment to address its legacy of oppression since the institution of slavery. And the tool, Mayor Michelle Wu proclaimed, is reparations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHELLE WU: Today, we're announcing a reparations task force to bring together experts and those with lived experience and deep community connections to help us begin the process. WINTERSMITH: The idea of a city giving reparations to its residents is a relatively new one. Most of the time when we talk about reparations, it's in a national context that harkens back to the post-Civil War promise of 40 acres and a mule for those recently freed. So as Boston finds itself yet again on a journey to be one of the first in the country, we are on a parallel journey to unpack what reparations could look like. When a city as old as the nation declares it's time to address its legacy of Black oppression, how might that work? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: To understand how Boston ended up at this moment to consider reparations for its Black residents, we have to go back to 2020. We were enduring the COVID-19 pandemic... (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) CHARLIE BAKER: Today, I'm declaring a state of emergency in Massachusetts. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We're asking people to stay home if possible. Practice social distancing. WINTERSMITH: ...Navigating a contentious presidential election... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Will you shut up, man? DONALD TRUMP: Who was on - listen, are you in favor of law and order? BIDEN: I'm in favor of law. You followed it. TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? WINTERSMITH: ...And watching it all isolated indefinitely in our homes. These realities dominated much of what we saw in the news, until... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car, man. GEORGE FLOYD: I will. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car. FLOYD: I can't move. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: I've been (inaudible). Let's get up and get in the car. FLOYD: Mama. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car right. FLOYD: I can't. I can't breathe. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: OK. FLOYD: I can't breathe. WINTERSMITH: ...Millions of people saw footage of George Perry Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FLOYD: Mama, mama. TOU THAO: (Inaudible) hobble? FLOYD: Mama, mama. WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

Nearly 400 years later, the city of Boston is grappling with that legacy. In 2022, the city created a task force to consider reparations to the descendants of enslaved people. In \"What Is Owed?\" - a new podcast from GBH News - reporter Saraya Wintersmith explores what reparations could look like and how that debate is reflected across the nation and the globe. (SOUNDBITE OF CLOCK TOWER CHIMING) SARAYA WINTERSMITH: It's 3:00 on a weekday afternoon at the John Hancock Memorial in the Granary Burying Ground in Boston. (SOUNDBITE OF CLOCK TOWER CHIMING) WINTERSMITH: The site is kind of like a who's who of the American Revolution. There are graves for important figures like Thomas Paine and Samuel Adams. Every year, millions of tourists pass through here to visit the grave of John Hancock. You know John Hancock. Tour guides tout the man's great contributions to the country. But what you might not know, buried beside that much-celebrated Founding Father's grave is a man he enslaved. His name was Frank. Like many founding families, the Hancocks claimed several people as property, and they made their money in commerce based on products produced by the enslaved. That fortune bankrolled much of Boston's pre-Revolutionary activism. The tour guides here often referred to Frank as Hancock's servant. They say the two men must have been close because of how closely they were buried. Frank's contributions to the country have never been documented. Neither were the roles of countless other enslaved people - people who helped set Boston's trajectory to become a leader in health, education and technology. They were rarely recorded. Instead, U.S. history is full of portraits of heroic white people, mostly men. (SOUNDBITE OF SIREN) JULIA MEJIA: Boston has a deep racial history, and there's a lot of trauma that so many of us still carry. TANISHA SULLIVAN: We like to talk about Boston as a seat for the abolitionist movement. We don't like to talk so much about the role that Boston played in helping to finance this booming trade that was dehumanizing of Black folks in this country. WINTERSMITH: This duality has always existed throughout Boston's history. There's the facts and figures most Bostonians pride themselves on, like Boston being one of the first places in the U.S. to ban slavery. Then there's also the history Black Bostonians have been trying to hold the city accountable for, like being part of the first colony to legalize slavery and, much later, clinging to segregation around the end of the Civil Rights era. Now, Boston has taken it upon itself to bring both narratives together and address the harm. In 2022, the city of Boston made a commitment to address its legacy of oppression since the institution of slavery. And the tool, Mayor Michelle Wu proclaimed, is reparations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHELLE WU: Today, we're announcing a reparations task force to bring together experts and those with lived experience and deep community connections to help us begin the process. WINTERSMITH: The idea of a city giving reparations to its residents is a relatively new one. Most of the time when we talk about reparations, it's in a national context that harkens back to the post-Civil War promise of 40 acres and a mule for those recently freed. So as Boston finds itself yet again on a journey to be one of the first in the country, we are on a parallel journey to unpack what reparations could look like. When a city as old as the nation declares it's time to address its legacy of Black oppression, how might that work? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: To understand how Boston ended up at this moment to consider reparations for its Black residents, we have to go back to 2020. We were enduring the COVID-19 pandemic... (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) CHARLIE BAKER: Today, I'm declaring a state of emergency in Massachusetts.

For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

(SOUNDBITE OF CLOCK TOWER CHIMING) WINTERSMITH: The site is kind of like a who's who of the American Revolution. There are graves for important figures like Thomas Paine and Samuel Adams. Every year, millions of tourists pass through here to visit the grave of John Hancock. You know John Hancock. Tour guides tout the man's great contributions to the country. But what you might not know, buried beside that much-celebrated Founding Father's grave is a man he enslaved. His name was Frank. Like many founding families, the Hancocks claimed several people as property, and they made their money in commerce based on products produced by the enslaved. That fortune bankrolled much of Boston's pre-Revolutionary activism. The tour guides here often referred to Frank as Hancock's servant. They say the two men must have been close because of how closely they were buried. Frank's contributions to the country have never been documented. Neither were the roles of countless other enslaved people - people who helped set Boston's trajectory to become a leader in health, education and technology. They were rarely recorded. Instead, U.S. history is full of portraits of heroic white people, mostly men. (SOUNDBITE OF SIREN) JULIA MEJIA: Boston has a deep racial history, and there's a lot of trauma that so many of us still carry. TANISHA SULLIVAN: We like to talk about Boston as a seat for the abolitionist movement. We don't like to talk so much about the role that Boston played in helping to finance this booming trade that was dehumanizing of Black folks in this country. WINTERSMITH: This duality has always existed throughout Boston's history. There's the facts and figures most Bostonians pride themselves on, like Boston being one of the first places in the U.S. to ban slavery. Then there's also the history Black Bostonians have been trying to hold the city accountable for, like being part of the first colony to legalize slavery and, much later, clinging to segregation around the end of the Civil Rights era. Now, Boston has taken it upon itself to bring both narratives together and address the harm. In 2022, the city of Boston made a commitment to address its legacy of oppression since the institution of slavery. And the tool, Mayor Michelle Wu proclaimed, is reparations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHELLE WU: Today, we're announcing a reparations task force to bring together experts and those with lived experience and deep community connections to help us begin the process. WINTERSMITH: The idea of a city giving reparations to its residents is a relatively new one. Most of the time when we talk about reparations, it's in a national context that harkens back to the post-Civil War promise of 40 acres and a mule for those recently freed. So as Boston finds itself yet again on a journey to be one of the first in the country, we are on a parallel journey to unpack what reparations could look like. When a city as old as the nation declares it's time to address its legacy of Black oppression, how might that work? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: To understand how Boston ended up at this moment to consider reparations for its Black residents, we have to go back to 2020. We were enduring the COVID-19 pandemic... (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) CHARLIE BAKER: Today, I'm declaring a state of emergency in Massachusetts. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We're asking people to stay home if possible. Practice social distancing. WINTERSMITH: ...Navigating a contentious presidential election... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Will you shut up, man? DONALD TRUMP: Who was on - listen, are you in favor of law and order? BIDEN: I'm in favor of law. You followed it. TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? WINTERSMITH: ...And watching it all isolated indefinitely in our homes. These realities dominated much of what we saw in the news, until... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car, man. GEORGE FLOYD: I will. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car. FLOYD: I can't move. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: I've been (inaudible). Let's get up and get in the car. FLOYD: Mama. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car right. FLOYD: I can't. I can't breathe. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: OK. FLOYD: I can't breathe. WINTERSMITH: ...Millions of people saw footage of George Perry Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FLOYD: Mama, mama. TOU THAO: (Inaudible) hobble? FLOYD: Mama, mama. WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: To understand how Boston ended up at this moment to consider reparations for its Black residents, we have to go back to 2020. We were enduring the COVID-19 pandemic... (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) CHARLIE BAKER: Today, I'm declaring a state of emergency in Massachusetts. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We're asking people to stay home if possible. Practice social distancing. WINTERSMITH: ...Navigating a contentious presidential election... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Will you shut up, man? DONALD TRUMP: Who was on - listen, are you in favor of law and order? BIDEN: I'm in favor of law. You followed it. TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? WINTERSMITH: ...And watching it all isolated indefinitely in our homes. These realities dominated much of what we saw in the news, until... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car, man. GEORGE FLOYD: I will. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car. FLOYD: I can't move. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: I've been (inaudible). Let's get up and get in the car. FLOYD: Mama. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car right. FLOYD: I can't. I can't breathe. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: OK. FLOYD: I can't breathe. WINTERSMITH: ...Millions of people saw footage of George Perry Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FLOYD: Mama, mama. TOU THAO: (Inaudible) hobble? FLOYD: Mama, mama. WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

There are graves for important figures like Thomas Paine and Samuel Adams. Every year, millions of tourists pass through here to visit the grave of John Hancock. You know John Hancock. Tour guides tout the man's great contributions to the country. But what you might not know, buried beside that much-celebrated Founding Father's grave is a man he enslaved. His name was Frank. Like many founding families, the Hancocks claimed several people as property, and they made their money in commerce based on products produced by the enslaved. That fortune bankrolled much of Boston's pre-Revolutionary activism. The tour guides here often referred to Frank as Hancock's servant. They say the two men must have been close because of how closely they were buried. Frank's contributions to the country have never been documented. Neither were the roles of countless other enslaved people - people who helped set Boston's trajectory to become a leader in health, education and technology. They were rarely recorded. Instead, U.S. history is full of portraits of heroic white people, mostly men. (SOUNDBITE OF SIREN) JULIA MEJIA: Boston has a deep racial history, and there's a lot of trauma that so many of us still carry. TANISHA SULLIVAN: We like to talk about Boston as a seat for the abolitionist movement. We don't like to talk so much about the role that Boston played in helping to finance this booming trade that was dehumanizing of Black folks in this country. WINTERSMITH: This duality has always existed throughout Boston's history. There's the facts and figures most Bostonians pride themselves on, like Boston being one of the first places in the U.S. to ban slavery. Then there's also the history Black Bostonians have been trying to hold the city accountable for, like being part of the first colony to legalize slavery and, much later, clinging to segregation around the end of the Civil Rights era. Now, Boston has taken it upon itself to bring both narratives together and address the harm. In 2022, the city of Boston made a commitment to address its legacy of oppression since the institution of slavery. And the tool, Mayor Michelle Wu proclaimed, is reparations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHELLE WU: Today, we're announcing a reparations task force to bring together experts and those with lived experience and deep community connections to help us begin the process. WINTERSMITH: The idea of a city giving reparations to its residents is a relatively new one. Most of the time when we talk about reparations, it's in a national context that harkens back to the post-Civil War promise of 40 acres and a mule for those recently freed. So as Boston finds itself yet again on a journey to be one of the first in the country, we are on a parallel journey to unpack what reparations could look like.

As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

That fortune bankrolled much of Boston's pre-Revolutionary activism. The tour guides here often referred to Frank as Hancock's servant. They say the two men must have been close because of how closely they were buried. Frank's contributions to the country have never been documented. Neither were the roles of countless other enslaved people - people who helped set Boston's trajectory to become a leader in health, education and technology. They were rarely recorded. Instead, U.S. history is full of portraits of heroic white people, mostly men. (SOUNDBITE OF SIREN) JULIA MEJIA: Boston has a deep racial history, and there's a lot of trauma that so many of us still carry. TANISHA SULLIVAN: We like to talk about Boston as a seat for the abolitionist movement. We don't like to talk so much about the role that Boston played in helping to finance this booming trade that was dehumanizing of Black folks in this country. WINTERSMITH: This duality has always existed throughout Boston's history. There's the facts and figures most Bostonians pride themselves on, like Boston being one of the first places in the U.S. to ban slavery. Then there's also the history Black Bostonians have been trying to hold the city accountable for, like being part of the first colony to legalize slavery and, much later, clinging to segregation around the end of the Civil Rights era. Now, Boston has taken it upon itself to bring both narratives together and address the harm. In 2022, the city of Boston made a commitment to address its legacy of oppression since the institution of slavery. And the tool, Mayor Michelle Wu proclaimed, is reparations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHELLE WU: Today, we're announcing a reparations task force to bring together experts and those with lived experience and deep community connections to help us begin the process. WINTERSMITH: The idea of a city giving reparations to its residents is a relatively new one. Most of the time when we talk about reparations, it's in a national context that harkens back to the post-Civil War promise of 40 acres and a mule for those recently freed. So as Boston finds itself yet again on a journey to be one of the first in the country, we are on a parallel journey to unpack what reparations could look like. When a city as old as the nation declares it's time to address its legacy of Black oppression, how might that work? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: To understand how Boston ended up at this moment to consider reparations for its Black residents, we have to go back to 2020. We were enduring the COVID-19 pandemic... (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) CHARLIE BAKER: Today, I'm declaring a state of emergency in Massachusetts. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We're asking people to stay home if possible. Practice social distancing. WINTERSMITH: ...Navigating a contentious presidential election... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Will you shut up, man? DONALD TRUMP: Who was on - listen, are you in favor of law and order? BIDEN: I'm in favor of law. You followed it. TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? WINTERSMITH: ...And watching it all isolated indefinitely in our homes. These realities dominated much of what we saw in the news, until... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car, man. GEORGE FLOYD: I will. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car. FLOYD: I can't move. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: I've been (inaudible). Let's get up and get in the car. FLOYD: Mama. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car right. FLOYD: I can't. I can't breathe. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: OK. FLOYD: I can't breathe. WINTERSMITH: ...Millions of people saw footage of George Perry Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FLOYD: Mama, mama. TOU THAO: (Inaudible) hobble? FLOYD: Mama, mama. WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people?

Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

TANISHA SULLIVAN: We like to talk about Boston as a seat for the abolitionist movement. We don't like to talk so much about the role that Boston played in helping to finance this booming trade that was dehumanizing of Black folks in this country. WINTERSMITH: This duality has always existed throughout Boston's history. There's the facts and figures most Bostonians pride themselves on, like Boston being one of the first places in the U.S. to ban slavery. Then there's also the history Black Bostonians have been trying to hold the city accountable for, like being part of the first colony to legalize slavery and, much later, clinging to segregation around the end of the Civil Rights era. Now, Boston has taken it upon itself to bring both narratives together and address the harm. In 2022, the city of Boston made a commitment to address its legacy of oppression since the institution of slavery. And the tool, Mayor Michelle Wu proclaimed, is reparations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHELLE WU: Today, we're announcing a reparations task force to bring together experts and those with lived experience and deep community connections to help us begin the process. WINTERSMITH: The idea of a city giving reparations to its residents is a relatively new one. Most of the time when we talk about reparations, it's in a national context that harkens back to the post-Civil War promise of 40 acres and a mule for those recently freed. So as Boston finds itself yet again on a journey to be one of the first in the country, we are on a parallel journey to unpack what reparations could look like. When a city as old as the nation declares it's time to address its legacy of Black oppression, how might that work? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: To understand how Boston ended up at this moment to consider reparations for its Black residents, we have to go back to 2020. We were enduring the COVID-19 pandemic... (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) CHARLIE BAKER: Today, I'm declaring a state of emergency in Massachusetts. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We're asking people to stay home if possible. Practice social distancing. WINTERSMITH: ...Navigating a contentious presidential election... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Will you shut up, man? DONALD TRUMP: Who was on - listen, are you in favor of law and order? BIDEN: I'm in favor of law. You followed it. TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? WINTERSMITH: ...And watching it all isolated indefinitely in our homes. These realities dominated much of what we saw in the news, until... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car, man. GEORGE FLOYD: I will. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car. FLOYD: I can't move. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: I've been (inaudible). Let's get up and get in the car. FLOYD: Mama. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car right. FLOYD: I can't. I can't breathe. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: OK. FLOYD: I can't breathe. WINTERSMITH: ...Millions of people saw footage of George Perry Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FLOYD: Mama, mama. TOU THAO: (Inaudible) hobble? FLOYD: Mama, mama. WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it.

(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

We don't like to talk so much about the role that Boston played in helping to finance this booming trade that was dehumanizing of Black folks in this country. WINTERSMITH: This duality has always existed throughout Boston's history. There's the facts and figures most Bostonians pride themselves on, like Boston being one of the first places in the U.S. to ban slavery. Then there's also the history Black Bostonians have been trying to hold the city accountable for, like being part of the first colony to legalize slavery and, much later, clinging to segregation around the end of the Civil Rights era. Now, Boston has taken it upon itself to bring both narratives together and address the harm. In 2022, the city of Boston made a commitment to address its legacy of oppression since the institution of slavery. And the tool, Mayor Michelle Wu proclaimed, is reparations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHELLE WU: Today, we're announcing a reparations task force to bring together experts and those with lived experience and deep community connections to help us begin the process. WINTERSMITH: The idea of a city giving reparations to its residents is a relatively new one. Most of the time when we talk about reparations, it's in a national context that harkens back to the post-Civil War promise of 40 acres and a mule for those recently freed. So as Boston finds itself yet again on a journey to be one of the first in the country, we are on a parallel journey to unpack what reparations could look like. When a city as old as the nation declares it's time to address its legacy of Black oppression, how might that work? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: To understand how Boston ended up at this moment to consider reparations for its Black residents, we have to go back to 2020. We were enduring the COVID-19 pandemic... (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) CHARLIE BAKER: Today, I'm declaring a state of emergency in Massachusetts. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We're asking people to stay home if possible. Practice social distancing. WINTERSMITH: ...Navigating a contentious presidential election... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Will you shut up, man? DONALD TRUMP: Who was on - listen, are you in favor of law and order? BIDEN: I'm in favor of law. You followed it. TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? WINTERSMITH: ...And watching it all isolated indefinitely in our homes. These realities dominated much of what we saw in the news, until... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car, man. GEORGE FLOYD: I will. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car. FLOYD: I can't move. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: I've been (inaudible). Let's get up and get in the car. FLOYD: Mama. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car right. FLOYD: I can't. I can't breathe. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: OK. FLOYD: I can't breathe. WINTERSMITH: ...Millions of people saw footage of George Perry Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FLOYD: Mama, mama. TOU THAO: (Inaudible) hobble? FLOYD: Mama, mama. WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs.

Most of the time when we talk about reparations, it's in a national context that harkens back to the post-Civil War promise of 40 acres and a mule for those recently freed. So as Boston finds itself yet again on a journey to be one of the first in the country, we are on a parallel journey to unpack what reparations could look like. When a city as old as the nation declares it's time to address its legacy of Black oppression, how might that work? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: To understand how Boston ended up at this moment to consider reparations for its Black residents, we have to go back to 2020. We were enduring the COVID-19 pandemic... (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) CHARLIE BAKER: Today, I'm declaring a state of emergency in Massachusetts. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We're asking people to stay home if possible. Practice social distancing. WINTERSMITH: ...Navigating a contentious presidential election... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Will you shut up, man? DONALD TRUMP: Who was on - listen, are you in favor of law and order? BIDEN: I'm in favor of law. You followed it. TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? WINTERSMITH: ...And watching it all isolated indefinitely in our homes. These realities dominated much of what we saw in the news, until... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car, man. GEORGE FLOYD: I will. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car. FLOYD: I can't move. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: I've been (inaudible). Let's get up and get in the car. FLOYD: Mama. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car right. FLOYD: I can't. I can't breathe. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: OK. FLOYD: I can't breathe. WINTERSMITH: ...Millions of people saw footage of George Perry Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FLOYD: Mama, mama. TOU THAO: (Inaudible) hobble? FLOYD: Mama, mama. WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

We were enduring the COVID-19 pandemic... (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) CHARLIE BAKER: Today, I'm declaring a state of emergency in Massachusetts. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We're asking people to stay home if possible. Practice social distancing. WINTERSMITH: ...Navigating a contentious presidential election... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Will you shut up, man? DONALD TRUMP: Who was on - listen, are you in favor of law and order? BIDEN: I'm in favor of law. You followed it. TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? WINTERSMITH: ...And watching it all isolated indefinitely in our homes. These realities dominated much of what we saw in the news, until...

UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239.

UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We're asking people to stay home if possible. Practice social distancing. WINTERSMITH: ...Navigating a contentious presidential election... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Will you shut up, man? DONALD TRUMP: Who was on - listen, are you in favor of law and order? BIDEN: I'm in favor of law. You followed it. TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? WINTERSMITH: ...And watching it all isolated indefinitely in our homes. These realities dominated much of what we saw in the news, until... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car, man. GEORGE FLOYD: I will. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car. FLOYD: I can't move. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: I've been (inaudible). Let's get up and get in the car. FLOYD: Mama. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car right. FLOYD: I can't. I can't breathe. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: OK. FLOYD: I can't breathe. WINTERSMITH: ...Millions of people saw footage of George Perry Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FLOYD: Mama, mama. TOU THAO: (Inaudible) hobble? FLOYD: Mama, mama. WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country.

TRUMP: Are you in favor of law and order? WINTERSMITH: ...And watching it all isolated indefinitely in our homes. These realities dominated much of what we saw in the news, until... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car, man. GEORGE FLOYD: I will. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car. FLOYD: I can't move. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: I've been (inaudible). Let's get up and get in the car. FLOYD: Mama. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car right. FLOYD: I can't. I can't breathe. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: OK. FLOYD: I can't breathe. WINTERSMITH: ...Millions of people saw footage of George Perry Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FLOYD: Mama, mama. TOU THAO: (Inaudible) hobble? FLOYD: Mama, mama. WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners.

TOU THAO: (Inaudible) hobble? FLOYD: Mama, mama. WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car. FLOYD: I can't move. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: I've been (inaudible). Let's get up and get in the car. FLOYD: Mama. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car right. FLOYD: I can't. I can't breathe. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: OK. FLOYD: I can't breathe. WINTERSMITH: ...Millions of people saw footage of George Perry Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FLOYD: Mama, mama. TOU THAO: (Inaudible) hobble? FLOYD: Mama, mama. WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: Get up and get in the car right. FLOYD: I can't. I can't breathe. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: OK. FLOYD: I can't breathe. WINTERSMITH: ...Millions of people saw footage of George Perry Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FLOYD: Mama, mama. TOU THAO: (Inaudible) hobble? FLOYD: Mama, mama. WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people?

UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: OK. FLOYD: I can't breathe. WINTERSMITH: ...Millions of people saw footage of George Perry Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FLOYD: Mama, mama. TOU THAO: (Inaudible) hobble? FLOYD: Mama, mama. WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done.

WINTERSMITH: It was the only other story dominating headlines. And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

And the restlessness of being at home, combined with heightened political energy, suddenly got people off their couches. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this mess? UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Revolution, nothing less. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #1: (Chanting) How do we get out of this... UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country.

As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER #2: (Chanting) No justice. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Chanting) No peace. WINTERSMITH: And from this moment, something started to give way. SULLIVAN: When it comes to policymaking, timing matters. WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities?

MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

WINTERSMITH: That's Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. She, like many people around the country, was looking for a way to capture the spark during the pandemic and move her community towards greater systematic change. Sullivan decided this was the moment to push the city of Boston to explore reparations. SULLIVAN: We might never get an opportunity like this again, where not only the minds but the hearts of people are open, and this seemed like the right time to get it done. WINTERSMITH: Sullivan recognized that any push for reparations was going to need a political champion. Enter Julia Mejia. MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239.

UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

MEJIA: Everyone thought I was crazy because I decided to file a hearing order around reparations. WINTERSMITH: The proposal called for Boston to fund a two-year, community-led commission to do two major things - examine Boston's culpability in the oppression of Black people since the time of slavery and recommend reparations proposals after careful study of the concept. But the proposal was controversial. Mejia says it was the most difficult piece of legislation she's ever carried. She got criticism from all corners. Beyond community criticism, there was an arguably bigger problem - Mejia's council colleagues were skeptical. So on December 14, 2022, Julia Mejia walked into the council chambers at Boston City Hall, not knowing whether she had enough votes to approve the proposal, now known as Docket #0239. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Mr. Clerk, can you do a roll call vote? WINTERSMITH: Somehow, all 13 councilors voted yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Docket #0239 has received a unanimous vote. MEJIA: I am happy with the outcome that Boston, one of the most racist cities in the country, is going to be able to have a mechanism to study the harm and hopefully repair it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WINTERSMITH: But Boston's new reparations task force stumbled out of the gate. After Mayor Wu announced her picks for the panel in February 2023, they didn't actually meet until May. The slow start, combined with some surprising headlines, raised doubts. Was the city of Boston actually going to take reparations seriously? It's a huge moment when any government body declares a time to acknowledge and remedy its past wrongs. For Black people, who have waited centuries, it's momentous. And this tension we're seeing in Boston is the same tension we're seeing all across the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #1: The town of Evanston made history in 2021, when it became the first municipality... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #2: California's first-of-its-kind task force on reparations for Black Americans has submitted... UNIDENTIFIED NEWSANCHOR #3: The city council of Asheville, N.C., unanimously voted to provide reparations to Black residents of the city. WINTERSMITH: In places like the state of New York and cities like San Francisco and Detroit, commissions are forming, researchers are studying, and people are asking, what is the debt to Black people in those communities? What historic points should we begin to examine, and how do we measure and assess harm to Black people? Are municipal and state governments truly prepared to acknowledge their culpability? And what about the federal government? Is there really a feasible way to repay Black people, all Black people? As Boston goes on a journey to answer questions like these for itself, we're exploring, too, looking locally and nationally at this moment in history when reparations finally seem possible, searching for an answer to the ultimate question - when it comes to America's so-called original sin and all it has entailed, what is owed?

      "text": "'From Here to Equality' Author Makes A Case, And A Plan, For Reparations\n\nBy\n\nNoel King\n\n,\n\nLisa Weiner\n\nBlack Lives Matter activists occupy the traffic circle underneath the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert Lee, last week, in Richmond, Va. Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty Images hide caption\n\nBlack Lives Matter activists occupy the traffic circle underneath the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert Lee, last week, in Richmond, Va.\n\nWhen slavery ended, the disenfranchisement of African Americans did not. Discrimination continued in jobs, housing, education - barriers that have contributed to the staggering economic inequality that persists in the country today.\n\nIn a new book, economist William Darity Jr. makes the case for reparations as an answer to closing the racial wealth gap.\n\nFrom Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the 21st Century , written by Darity and his wife, A. Kirsten Mullen, offers a roadmap on how to implement reparations for descendants of enslaved people.\n\nSpeaking with NPR, Darity said that while support for education and entrepreneurial activity should be part of any reparations plan, \"the preponderance\" of funds must go to individual recipients. \"And they must go in such a way that we in fact eliminate the racial wealth gap,\" he said.\n\nHere are excerpts from the conversation.\n\nA lot of us learn in school emancipation happened, enslaved people were freed and then they were able to go and make money just like everyone else in the United States of America, to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Your book does a fantastic job of detailing all of the ways in which that was untrue. The first being jobs. When enslaved people were emancipated, they couldn't just walk out into the world and demand payment for doing a job.\n\nNo, they couldn't. And one of the reasons they could not was because of the institution of a series of laws that we now refer to as the \" black codes .\" And the black codes created restrictions on the authority that individual black folks had over their family life. But it also created restrictions on their employment opportunities and their capacity to exercise agency over the types of jobs that they took.\n\nDid the North even win the Civil War? I mean, one of the things that is so clear in your telling of this history is that, yes, emancipation happened. But the Southern states, the Confederacy, made lots and lots of demands, particularly around what would happen to black people and what would happen to their labor, and the North gave in.\n\nI think that's correct. The North did give in and I think that the North gave in, in part, because the price for providing full citizenship to black Americans would have meant having a sustained and long-term division among white Americans, because the price for achieving full citizenship for black Americans would have meant deconfederatization in full. And in turn, the North would have had to commit to having the Union army play an extended role in the southern part of the United States. And ultimately, it was not done.\n\nWhen we look at these vast inequalities now between white wealth and black wealth - inequalities that extend to health outcomes, homeownership, education, the size of people's bank accounts, the neighborhoods that people live in - where do those gaps come from?\n\n... The starting point is the failure to provide the formerly enslaved with the 40-acre land grants that they were promised. At the same time, substantial allocations of land were being made to white Americans.\n\nAnd then subsequently, over the course of the next 80 years or so, there was a series of white massacres that took place across the United States, where black communities that had begun to develop some degree of prosperity and independence were literally destroyed.\n\nAnd then in the 20th century, there was a sustained pattern of discrimination in access to home ownership on the part of blacks, starting with the existence of restrictive covenants, following through with redlining and the accompanying predatory lending practices that were associated with obtaining home mortgages. So, we have a set of public policies that lie at the heart of the creation of this gaping wealth gap.\n\nNOEL KING, HOST: When slavery ended, the disenfranchisement of black Americans did not. Discrimination continued in jobs, housing, education. That's why we have staggering economic inequality in the U.S. So are the descendants of the enslaved owed reparations? Economist William Darity says yes. His new book is \"From Here To Equality: Reparations For Black Americans In The Twenty-First Century.\" The book reminds us that slavery and emancipation weren't that long ago. We talked first about a 90-year-old woman in North Carolina who was getting a Civil War pension from the government until she died just a few weeks ago. WILLIAM DARITY JR: The fact that somebody who was the child of a Civil War veteran was still receiving pension funds in 2020 is extremely striking. The individual that you're talking about is a woman who was white, whose father was white. And it's, again, suggestive of the ways in which there was a divergence in the rewards that the federal government gave by race to the folks who were descendants of the enslaved versus the folks who were the enslavers or folks who were complicit with the slavery process. KING: I think a lot of us learn in school that emancipation happened, enslaved people were freed, and then they were able to go and make money just like everyone else in the United States of America, to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Your book does a fantastic job of detailing all of the ways in which that was untrue, the first being jobs. When enslaved people were emancipated, they couldn't just walk out into the world and demand payment for doing a job. DARITY: No, they couldn't. And one of the reasons they could not was because of the institution of a series of laws that we now refer to as the Black Codes. And the Black Codes created restrictions on the authority that individual black folks had over their family life, but it also created restrictions on their employment opportunities and their capacity to exercise agency over the types of jobs that they took. KING: There was a moment reading your book where I wondered, in all honesty, as you lay out the Black Codes, as you lay out the ways in which they were institutionalized, it seemed worth asking, you know, did the North even win the Civil War? I mean, one of the things that is so clear in your telling of this history is that, yes, emancipation happened, but the Southern states, the Confederacy, made lots and lots of demands, particularly around what would happen to black people and what would happen to their labor. And the North gave in. DARITY: I think that's correct. The North did give in, and I think that the North gave in, in part, because the price for providing full citizenship to black Americans would have meant having a sustained and long-term division among white Americans because the price for achieving full citizenship for black Americans would have meant deconfederatization in full. And in turn, the North would've had to commit to having the Union Army play an extended role in the Southern part of the United States. And ultimately, it was not done. KING: When did the Black Codes end? DARITY: The practices associated with the Black Codes continue into the period of formal legal segregation. It's what we refer to as the Jim Crow period. And the laws that undergirded legal segregation in the United States, or American apartheid, really don't get overturned until the Civil Rights Act of 1964. KING: And so when we look at these vast inequalities now between white wealth and black wealth, inequalities that extend to health outcomes, homeownership, education, the size of people's bank accounts, the neighborhoods that people live in, where do those gaps come from? DARITY: I think it's a consequence of a host of social policies and practices that had been put in place in the aftermath of the Civil War. So the starting point is the failure to provide the formerly enslaved with the 40-acre land grants that they were promised. At the same time, substantial allocations of land were being made to white Americans. And then subsequently, over the course of the next 80 years or so, there was a series of white massacres that took place across the United States, where black communities that had begun to develop some degree of prosperity and independence were literally destroyed. And then in the 20th century, there was a sustained pattern of discrimination in access to homeownership on the part of blacks, starting with the existence of restrictive covenants, following through with redlining and the accompanying predatory lending practices that were associated with obtaining home mortgages. So we have a set of public policies that lie at the heart of the creation of this gaping wealth gap. And this means, in turn, that we need new public policy to reverse those conditions. KING: Part of the promise of this book is that you will offer a road map to reparations. Put simply, who do you think should get reparations? DARITY: We propose that there are two criteria for eligibility. The first is what we refer to as a lineage standard. An individual would have to demonstrate that they have at least one ancestor who was enslaved in the United States. And then the second is an identity standard. An individual would have to demonstrate that for at least 12 years before the enactment of a reparations program, the individual would've had to have self-identified as black, Negro or African American. KING: And then would you make the argument that checks should be cut to individuals, to families, or should there be a large pool of money that could go toward supporting education, supporting homeownership? DARITY: We feel strongly that direct payments must be a major component. We have talked about support for education, support for entrepreneurial activity, some resources that go to historically black colleges and universities. But the preponderance of the funds must go to individual recipients. And they must go in such a way that we, in fact, eliminate the racial wealth gap. That's the big objective of the reparations project. KING: William Darity Jr. is the co-author of \"From Here To Equality: Reparations For Black Americans In The Twenty-First Century.\" His co-author is A. Kirsten Mullen, also his wife. Thank you so much for being with us. DARITY: Thank you so much. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2020 NPR.  All rights reserved.

An individual would have to demonstrate that for at least 12 years before the enactment of a reparations program, the individual would've had to have self-identified as black, Negro or African American. KING: And then would you make the argument that checks should be cut to individuals, to families, or should there be a large pool of money that could go toward supporting education, supporting homeownership? DARITY: We feel strongly that direct payments must be a major component. We have talked about support for education, support for entrepreneurial activity, some resources that go to historically black colleges and universities. But the preponderance of the funds must go to individual recipients. And they must go in such a way that we, in fact, eliminate the racial wealth gap. That's the big objective of the reparations project.

That's why we have staggering economic inequality in the U.S. So are the descendants of the enslaved owed reparations? Economist William Darity says yes. His new book is \"From Here To Equality: Reparations For Black Americans In The Twenty-First Century.\" The book reminds us that slavery and emancipation weren't that long ago. We talked first about a 90-year-old woman in North Carolina who was getting a Civil War pension from the government until she died just a few weeks ago. WILLIAM DARITY JR: The fact that somebody who was the child of a Civil War veteran was still receiving pension funds in 2020 is extremely striking. The individual that you're talking about is a woman who was white, whose father was white. And it's, again, suggestive of the ways in which there was a divergence in the rewards that the federal government gave by race to the folks who were descendants of the enslaved versus the folks who were the enslavers or folks who were complicit with the slavery process. KING: I think a lot of us learn in school that emancipation happened, enslaved people were freed, and then they were able to go and make money just like everyone else in the United States of America, to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Your book does a fantastic job of detailing all of the ways in which that was untrue, the first being jobs. When enslaved people were emancipated, they couldn't just walk out into the world and demand payment for doing a job. DARITY: No, they couldn't. And one of the reasons they could not was because of the institution of a series of laws that we now refer to as the Black Codes. And the Black Codes created restrictions on the authority that individual black folks had over their family life, but it also created restrictions on their employment opportunities and their capacity to exercise agency over the types of jobs that they took. KING: There was a moment reading your book where I wondered, in all honesty, as you lay out the Black Codes, as you lay out the ways in which they were institutionalized, it seemed worth asking, you know, did the North even win the Civil War? I mean, one of the things that is so clear in your telling of this history is that, yes, emancipation happened, but the Southern states, the Confederacy, made lots and lots of demands, particularly around what would happen to black people and what would happen to their labor. And the North gave in. DARITY: I think that's correct. The North did give in, and I think that the North gave in, in part, because the price for providing full citizenship to black Americans would have meant having a sustained and long-term division among white Americans because the price for achieving full citizenship for black Americans would have meant deconfederatization in full. And in turn, the North would've had to commit to having the Union Army play an extended role in the Southern part of the United States. And ultimately, it was not done. KING: When did the Black Codes end? DARITY: The practices associated with the Black Codes continue into the period of formal legal segregation. It's what we refer to as the Jim Crow period. And the laws that undergirded legal segregation in the United States, or American apartheid, really don't get overturned until the Civil Rights Act of 1964. KING: And so when we look at these vast inequalities now between white wealth and black wealth, inequalities that extend to health outcomes, homeownership, education, the size of people's bank accounts, the neighborhoods that people live in, where do those gaps come from? DARITY: I think it's a consequence of a host of social policies and practices that had been put in place in the aftermath of the Civil War. So the starting point is the failure to provide the formerly enslaved with the 40-acre land grants that they were promised. At the same time, substantial allocations of land were being made to white Americans. And then subsequently, over the course of the next 80 years or so, there was a series of white massacres that took place across the United States, where black communities that had begun to develop some degree of prosperity and independence were literally destroyed. And then in the 20th century, there was a sustained pattern of discrimination in access to homeownership on the part of blacks, starting with the existence of restrictive covenants, following through with redlining and the accompanying predatory lending practices that were associated with obtaining home mortgages. So we have a set of public policies that lie at the heart of the creation of this gaping wealth gap. And this means, in turn, that we need new public policy to reverse those conditions. KING: Part of the promise of this book is that you will offer a road map to reparations. Put simply, who do you think should get reparations? DARITY: We propose that there are two criteria for eligibility. The first is what we refer to as a lineage standard. An individual would have to demonstrate that they have at least one ancestor who was enslaved in the United States. And then the second is an identity standard. An individual would have to demonstrate that for at least 12 years before the enactment of a reparations program, the individual would've had to have self-identified as black, Negro or African American.

KING: And then would you make the argument that checks should be cut to individuals, to families, or should there be a large pool of money that could go toward supporting education, supporting homeownership? DARITY: We feel strongly that direct payments must be a major component. We have talked about support for education, support for entrepreneurial activity, some resources that go to historically black colleges and universities. But the preponderance of the funds must go to individual recipients. And they must go in such a way that we, in fact, eliminate the racial wealth gap. That's the big objective of the reparations project. KING: William Darity Jr. is the co-author of \"From Here To Equality: Reparations For Black Americans In The Twenty-First Century.\" His co-author is A. Kirsten Mullen, also his wife.

And one of the reasons they could not was because of the institution of a series of laws that we now refer to as the Black Codes. And the Black Codes created restrictions on the authority that individual black folks had over their family life, but it also created restrictions on their employment opportunities and their capacity to exercise agency over the types of jobs that they took. KING: There was a moment reading your book where I wondered, in all honesty, as you lay out the Black Codes, as you lay out the ways in which they were institutionalized, it seemed worth asking, you know, did the North even win the Civil War? I mean, one of the things that is so clear in your telling of this history is that, yes, emancipation happened, but the Southern states, the Confederacy, made lots and lots of demands, particularly around what would happen to black people and what would happen to their labor. And the North gave in. DARITY: I think that's correct. The North did give in, and I think that the North gave in, in part, because the price for providing full citizenship to black Americans would have meant having a sustained and long-term division among white Americans because the price for achieving full citizenship for black Americans would have meant deconfederatization in full. And in turn, the North would've had to commit to having the Union Army play an extended role in the Southern part of the United States. And ultimately, it was not done. KING: When did the Black Codes end? DARITY: The practices associated with the Black Codes continue into the period of formal legal segregation. It's what we refer to as the Jim Crow period. And the laws that undergirded legal segregation in the United States, or American apartheid, really don't get overturned until the Civil Rights Act of 1964. KING: And so when we look at these vast inequalities now between white wealth and black wealth, inequalities that extend to health outcomes, homeownership, education, the size of people's bank accounts, the neighborhoods that people live in, where do those gaps come from? DARITY: I think it's a consequence of a host of social policies and practices that had been put in place in the aftermath of the Civil War. So the starting point is the failure to provide the formerly enslaved with the 40-acre land grants that they were promised. At the same time, substantial allocations of land were being made to white Americans. And then subsequently, over the course of the next 80 years or so, there was a series of white massacres that took place across the United States, where black communities that had begun to develop some degree of prosperity and independence were literally destroyed. And then in the 20th century, there was a sustained pattern of discrimination in access to homeownership on the part of blacks, starting with the existence of restrictive covenants, following through with redlining and the accompanying predatory lending practices that were associated with obtaining home mortgages. So we have a set of public policies that lie at the heart of the creation of this gaping wealth gap. And this means, in turn, that we need new public policy to reverse those conditions. KING: Part of the promise of this book is that you will offer a road map to reparations. Put simply, who do you think should get reparations? DARITY: We propose that there are two criteria for eligibility. The first is what we refer to as a lineage standard. An individual would have to demonstrate that they have at least one ancestor who was enslaved in the United States. And then the second is an identity standard. An individual would have to demonstrate that for at least 12 years before the enactment of a reparations program, the individual would've had to have self-identified as black, Negro or African American.

And the laws that undergirded legal segregation in the United States, or American apartheid, really don't get overturned until the Civil Rights Act of 1964. KING: And so when we look at these vast inequalities now between white wealth and black wealth, inequalities that extend to health outcomes, homeownership, education, the size of people's bank accounts, the neighborhoods that people live in, where do those gaps come from? DARITY: I think it's a consequence of a host of social policies and practices that had been put in place in the aftermath of the Civil War. So the starting point is the failure to provide the formerly enslaved with the 40-acre land grants that they were promised. At the same time, substantial allocations of land were being made to white Americans. And then subsequently, over the course of the next 80 years or so, there was a series of white massacres that took place across the United States, where black communities that had begun to develop some degree of prosperity and independence were literally destroyed. And then in the 20th century, there was a sustained pattern of discrimination in access to homeownership on the part of blacks, starting with the existence of restrictive covenants, following through with redlining and the accompanying predatory lending practices that were associated with obtaining home mortgages. So we have a set of public policies that lie at the heart of the creation of this gaping wealth gap. And this means, in turn, that we need new public policy to reverse those conditions. KING: Part of the promise of this book is that you will offer a road map to reparations. Put simply, who do you think should get reparations? DARITY: We propose that there are two criteria for eligibility. The first is what we refer to as a lineage standard. An individual would have to demonstrate that they have at least one ancestor who was enslaved in the United States. And then the second is an identity standard. An individual would have to demonstrate that for at least 12 years before the enactment of a reparations program, the individual would've had to have self-identified as black, Negro or African American. KING: And then would you make the argument that checks should be cut to individuals, to families, or should there be a large pool of money that could go toward supporting education, supporting homeownership? DARITY: We feel strongly that direct payments must be a major component. We have talked about support for education, support for entrepreneurial activity, some resources that go to historically black colleges and universities. But the preponderance of the funds must go to individual recipients. And they must go in such a way that we, in fact, eliminate the racial wealth gap. That's the big objective of the reparations project.

Martial Trezzini/AP hide caption\n\nMichelle Bachelet, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights shown here last year, is urging countries worldwide to do more to help end discrimination, violence and systemic racism against people of African descent.\n\nGENEVA - The U.N. human rights chief, in a landmark report launched after the killing of George Floyd in the United States, is urging countries worldwide to do more to help end discrimination, violence and systemic racism against people of African descent and \"make amends\" to them - including through reparations.\n\nThe report from Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, offers a sweeping look at the roots of centuries of mistreatment faced by Africans and people of African descent, notably from the transatlantic slave trade. It seeks a \"transformative\" approach to address its continued impact today.\n\nThe report, a year in the making, hopes to build on momentum around the recent, intensified scrutiny worldwide about the blight of racism and its impact on people of African descent as epitomized by the high-profile killings of unarmed Black people in the United States and elsewhere.\n\n\"There is today a momentous opportunity to achieve a turning point for racial equality and justice,\" the report said.\n\nThe report aims to speed up action by countries to end racial injustice; end impunity for rights violations by police; ensure that people of African descent and those who speak out against racism are heard; and face up to past wrongs through accountability and redress.\n\n\"I am calling on all states to stop denying - and start dismantling - racism; to end impunity and build trust; to listen to the voices of people of African descent; and to confront past legacies and deliver redress,\" Bachelet said in a video statement.\n\nWhile broaching the issue of reparation in her most explicit way yet, Bachelet suggested that monetary compensation alone is not enough and would be part of an array of measures to help rectify or make up for the injustices.\n\n\"Reparations should not only be equated with financial compensation,\" she wrote, adding that it should include restitution, rehabilitation, acknowledgement of injustices, apologies, memorialization, educational reforms and \"guarantees\" that such injustices won't happen again.\n\nThe U.N.-backed Human Rights Council commissioned the report during a special session last year following the murder of Floyd, a Black American who was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis in May 2020. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison last week.\n\nProtests erupted after excruciating bystander video showed how Floyd gasped repeatedly, \"I can't breathe!\" as onlookers yelled at Chauvin to stop pressing his knee on Floyd's neck.\n\nThe protests against Floyd's killing and the \"momentous\" verdict against Chauvin are a \"seminal point in the fight against racism,\" the report said.\n\nThe report was based on discussions with more than 340 people - mostly of African descent - and experts; more than 100 contributions in writing, including from governments; and review of public material, the rights office said.\n\nIt analyzed 190 deaths, mostly in the U.S., to show how law enforcement officers are rarely held accountable for rights violations and crimes against people of African descent, and it noted similar patterns of mistreatment by police across many countries.\n\nThe report ultimately aims to transform those opportunities into a more systemic response by governments to address racism, and not just in the United States - although the injustices and legacy of slavery, racism and violence faced by African Americans was clearly a major theme.\n\nThe report also laid out cases, concerns and the situation in roughly 60 countries including Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Canada, Colombia and France, among others.\n\n\"We could not find a single example of a state that has fully reckoned with the past or comprehensively accounted for the impacts of the lives of people of African descent today,\" Mona Rishmawi, who leads a unit on non-discrimination at the U.N. human rights office, told a news conference. \"Our message, therefore, is that this situation is untenable.\"\n\nCompensation should be considered at the \"collective and the individual level,\" she said, while adding that any such process \"starts with acknowledgment\" of past wrongs and \"it's not one-size-fits-all.\" She said countries must look at their own pasts and practices to assess how to proceed.\n\nThe U.N. report called on countries to make \" amends for centuries of violence and discrimination\" such as through \"formal acknowledgment and apologies, truth-telling processes and reparations in various forms.\"\n\nIt also decried the \"dehumanization of people of African descent\" that was \"rooted in false social constructions of race\" in the past to justify enslavement, racial stereotypes and harmful practices as well as tolerance for racial discrimination, inequality and violence.\n\nIt cited inequalities faced by people of African descent and the \"stark socioeconomic and political marginalization\" they face in many countries, including unfair access to education, health care, jobs, housing and clean water.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

California lawmakers have set aside $12 million, but cash payments aren't in the plan.\n\nADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST: In 2020, California's legislature did something no state has ever done. It created a task force to look at the legacy of slavery in the U.S. and at the history of racism in California and how those histories have harmed the state's Black residents and to suggest possible ways the state could atone for that harm. The California Reparations Task Force laid it all out in an 1,100-page final report. And it made a blockbuster recommendation that California should pay the descendants of enslaved people who today live in the state cash reparations. So a year later, where does this effort stand? Earlier this month, California lawmakers set aside $12 million in the state budget for reparations - not for cash payments, though, for other things. Although cash payments have been the reparations movement's central goal, both in California and nationally, politically, it's been tough. For more, we called on NPR race and identity correspondent Sandhya Dirks, and when we spoke, she began by explaining how California got to this point. SANDHYA DIRKS, BYLINE: So reparations for slavery is something Black people have been fighting for since even before slavery was abolished. But at the national level, there's really never been enough political support. Then, four years ago, after George Floyd's murder by police in Minneapolis, there was this moment, protests and conversations about racial justice. So lawmakers in California said, maybe we can do something. And they set up this reparations task force to study the state's history of racism and suggest concrete ways to atone for that history. FLORIDO: So tell us about what this task force did. DIRKS: Well, it spent two years collecting expert evidence and testimony, holding public hearings across the state. And then last summer, it issued this report recommending a long list of policies aimed at closing racial gaps in wealth, health, education and achievement - things like free college tuition, housing aid, tax breaks. But the biggest recommendation was for California to make cash payments to the descendants of enslaved people - in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. FLORIDO: So that was a year ago, and now this week, we learned that the new state budget will include $12 million for reparations. So is that for those cash payments? DIRKS: No. I mean, so far, there's been no movement on cash payments. The 12 million is money for, as of now, unspecified legislation. It could go to a slate of bills introduced by members of the Black Legislative Caucus to address some other parts of the task force's report. FLORIDO: Like what? DIRKS: One bill would end forced labor in state prisons. Another would provide grant money to combat violence in Black communities. And another would do something simple but deeply symbolic - accept responsibility for California's role in upholding slavery. It also recognizes the state's role in perpetuating systemic discrimination that exists to this day. Another bill would create a California Freedmen's Bureau, named for the agency set up after the Civil War to help formerly enslaved people. The idea is that bureau would help create the infrastructure for administering reparations. FLORIDO: So Sandhya, are there any bills that would actually, you know, compensate people? DIRKS: Well, there is one. State Senator Steven Bradford introduced what people are calling a land back bill. It would enable the state to compensate Black people whose land it took using policies like eminent domain. There's a long history of that tool being used for racist reasons. FLORIDO: California's budget is almost 300 billion - that's with a B - billion dollars, Sandhya. So 12 million set aside in this year's budget for reparations doesn't sound like very much. Can the state really do anything meaningful with that money? DIRKS: Well, I asked that question of state Senator Steven Bradford. He's also a member of the Reparations Task Force, and he admits the amount is basically budget dust. STEVEN BRADFORD: Does 12 million come close to healing or addressing all the massive wrongs and continued, you know, vestiges of slavery and - no, no - and discrimination? But it lets folks know that we're serious about it. It's a beginning. DIRKS: Other supporters of reparations say, while it's not a lot of money, it's a symbolic amount and that it's a bookmark or a promise. Kamilah Moore, who led the state's Reparations Task Force, also says it's a good start. KAMILAH MOORE: And I'm hoping to see more legislation that gets at direct benefits to descendants of slaves in this next legislative session, but I think it was a good idea for the California Legislative Black Caucus to start off with bills that relate to more structural policies. FLORIDO: So Sandhya, I mean, it sounds like lawmakers and even some advocates are sort of framing this money as an important first step. But what about the cash payments? Is there just no support for that? DIRKS: There just isn't enough. State Senator Bradford has said so himself. Governor Gavin Newsom has also publicly been very tepid on the idea of cash reparations. They say it's largely a budgetary issue. And these are all Democrats. Among Republicans, there's even more opposition. James Gallagher is the state assembly's Republican leader. And he doesn't think cash reparations are what's going to close racial gaps. JAMES GALLAGHER: Yes, I think in our current society, there are not impediments to, you know, Black Americans succeeding. But are there things in history that have certainly put Black Americans behind in terms of being able to build wealth? Yeah. I mean, I think we know that's true. DIRKS: And he also says it's just not fair for taxpayers today to have to pay for injustices of the past. But Adrian, to be clear, it's not Republicans holding up these more robust reparations. Democrats have a supermajority in the California legislature. If they wanted to make this happen, they could. Gallagher told me he feels like this is all a performance with very little substance to back it up. GALLAGHER: And to me, like, what Democrats continue to do in this situation is act like they're doing something in terms of reparations but not really doing it. DIRKS: What's so interesting is that grassroots reparations activists are saying something very similar. As we heard earlier, some are framing the 12 million and the bills as a solid start. But for Black people in the state who saw this as a chance for California to do something big and bold, there's a feeling of frustration, like things are already being watered down. FLORIDO: If reparations are proving so tough to pass in California, you know, one of the most progressive states in the country, what does that say about prospects for the broader reparations movement going forward, do you think? DIRKS: Well, it's always been really hard to get public support for reparations. Poll after poll has found that aside from African Americans, there's just not a lot of support for cash payments. Some polls have found that the general public don't believe Black Americans deserve reparations. The post-Floyd racial justice movement that led to this big momentum for reparations, it's dissipated. Democrats have kind of dropped it, and on the right, there's been an outright backlash, what some activists call whitelash. Many prominent conservatives have made an issue of denying systemic racism is real, and there's also a growing movement to challenge programs that address systemic racism in court. Now, all of that said, California reparations advocates are not giving up, and the state is still engaged in one of the largest-scale efforts to compensate people for historic racism in our country's history. FLORIDO: I've been speaking with NPR race and identity correspondent Sandhya Dirks. Thanks. DIRKS: Thanks, Adrian. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And he doesn't think cash reparations are what's going to close racial gaps. JAMES GALLAGHER: Yes, I think in our current society, there are not impediments to, you know, Black Americans succeeding. But are there things in history that have certainly put Black Americans behind in terms of being able to build wealth? Yeah. I mean, I think we know that's true. DIRKS: And he also says it's just not fair for taxpayers today to have to pay for injustices of the past. But Adrian, to be clear, it's not Republicans holding up these more robust reparations. Democrats have a supermajority in the California legislature. If they wanted to make this happen, they could. Gallagher told me he feels like this is all a performance with very little substance to back it up. GALLAGHER: And to me, like, what Democrats continue to do in this situation is act like they're doing something in terms of reparations but not really doing it. DIRKS: What's so interesting is that grassroots reparations activists are saying something very similar. As we heard earlier, some are framing the 12 million and the bills as a solid start. But for Black people in the state who saw this as a chance for California to do something big and bold, there's a feeling of frustration, like things are already being watered down. FLORIDO: If reparations are proving so tough to pass in California, you know, one of the most progressive states in the country, what does that say about prospects for the broader reparations movement going forward, do you think? DIRKS: Well, it's always been really hard to get public support for reparations. Poll after poll has found that aside from African Americans, there's just not a lot of support for cash payments. Some polls have found that the general public don't believe Black Americans deserve reparations. The post-Floyd racial justice movement that led to this big momentum for reparations, it's dissipated. Democrats have kind of dropped it, and on the right, there's been an outright backlash, what some activists call whitelash. Many prominent conservatives have made an issue of denying systemic racism is real, and there's also a growing movement to challenge programs that address systemic racism in court. Now, all of that said, California reparations advocates are not giving up, and the state is still engaged in one of the largest-scale efforts to compensate people for historic racism in our country's history. FLORIDO: I've been speaking with NPR race and identity correspondent Sandhya Dirks. Thanks. DIRKS: Thanks, Adrian. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Earlier this month, California lawmakers set aside $12 million in the state budget for reparations - not for cash payments, though, for other things. Although cash payments have been the reparations movement's central goal, both in California and nationally, politically, it's been tough. For more, we called on NPR race and identity correspondent Sandhya Dirks, and when we spoke, she began by explaining how California got to this point. SANDHYA DIRKS, BYLINE: So reparations for slavery is something Black people have been fighting for since even before slavery was abolished. But at the national level, there's really never been enough political support. Then, four years ago, after George Floyd's murder by police in Minneapolis, there was this moment, protests and conversations about racial justice. So lawmakers in California said, maybe we can do something. And they set up this reparations task force to study the state's history of racism and suggest concrete ways to atone for that history. FLORIDO: So tell us about what this task force did. DIRKS: Well, it spent two years collecting expert evidence and testimony, holding public hearings across the state. And then last summer, it issued this report recommending a long list of policies aimed at closing racial gaps in wealth, health, education and achievement - things like free college tuition, housing aid, tax breaks. But the biggest recommendation was for California to make cash payments to the descendants of enslaved people - in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. FLORIDO: So that was a year ago, and now this week, we learned that the new state budget will include $12 million for reparations. So is that for those cash payments? DIRKS: No. I mean, so far, there's been no movement on cash payments. The 12 million is money for, as of now, unspecified legislation. It could go to a slate of bills introduced by members of the Black Legislative Caucus to address some other parts of the task force's report. FLORIDO: Like what? DIRKS: One bill would end forced labor in state prisons. Another would provide grant money to combat violence in Black communities. And another would do something simple but deeply symbolic - accept responsibility for California's role in upholding slavery. It also recognizes the state's role in perpetuating systemic discrimination that exists to this day. Another bill would create a California Freedmen's Bureau, named for the agency set up after the Civil War to help formerly enslaved people. The idea is that bureau would help create the infrastructure for administering reparations. FLORIDO: So Sandhya, are there any bills that would actually, you know, compensate people? DIRKS: Well, there is one. State Senator Steven Bradford introduced what people are calling a land back bill. It would enable the state to compensate Black people whose land it took using policies like eminent domain. There's a long history of that tool being used for racist reasons. FLORIDO: California's budget is almost 300 billion - that's with a B - billion dollars, Sandhya. So 12 million set aside in this year's budget for reparations doesn't sound like very much. Can the state really do anything meaningful with that money? DIRKS: Well, I asked that question of state Senator Steven Bradford. He's also a member of the Reparations Task Force, and he admits the amount is basically budget dust. STEVEN BRADFORD: Does 12 million come close to healing or addressing all the massive wrongs and continued, you know, vestiges of slavery and - no, no - and discrimination? But it lets folks know that we're serious about it. It's a beginning. DIRKS: Other supporters of reparations say, while it's not a lot of money, it's a symbolic amount and that it's a bookmark or a promise. Kamilah Moore, who led the state's Reparations Task Force, also says it's a good start. KAMILAH MOORE: And I'm hoping to see more legislation that gets at direct benefits to descendants of slaves in this next legislative session, but I think it was a good idea for the California Legislative Black Caucus to start off with bills that relate to more structural policies. FLORIDO: So Sandhya, I mean, it sounds like lawmakers and even some advocates are sort of framing this money as an important first step. But what about the cash payments? Is there just no support for that? DIRKS: There just isn't enough. State Senator Bradford has said so himself. Governor Gavin Newsom has also publicly been very tepid on the idea of cash reparations.

FLORIDO: So Sandhya, I mean, it sounds like lawmakers and even some advocates are sort of framing this money as an important first step. But what about the cash payments? Is there just no support for that? DIRKS: There just isn't enough. State Senator Bradford has said so himself. Governor Gavin Newsom has also publicly been very tepid on the idea of cash reparations. They say it's largely a budgetary issue. And these are all Democrats. Among Republicans, there's even more opposition. James Gallagher is the state assembly's Republican leader. And he doesn't think cash reparations are what's going to close racial gaps. JAMES GALLAGHER: Yes, I think in our current society, there are not impediments to, you know, Black Americans succeeding. But are there things in history that have certainly put Black Americans behind in terms of being able to build wealth? Yeah. I mean, I think we know that's true. DIRKS: And he also says it's just not fair for taxpayers today to have to pay for injustices of the past. But Adrian, to be clear, it's not Republicans holding up these more robust reparations. Democrats have a supermajority in the California legislature. If they wanted to make this happen, they could. Gallagher told me he feels like this is all a performance with very little substance to back it up. GALLAGHER: And to me, like, what Democrats continue to do in this situation is act like they're doing something in terms of reparations but not really doing it. DIRKS: What's so interesting is that grassroots reparations activists are saying something very similar. As we heard earlier, some are framing the 12 million and the bills as a solid start. But for Black people in the state who saw this as a chance for California to do something big and bold, there's a feeling of frustration, like things are already being watered down. FLORIDO: If reparations are proving so tough to pass in California, you know, one of the most progressive states in the country, what does that say about prospects for the broader reparations movement going forward, do you think? DIRKS: Well, it's always been really hard to get public support for reparations. Poll after poll has found that aside from African Americans, there's just not a lot of support for cash payments. Some polls have found that the general public don't believe Black Americans deserve reparations. The post-Floyd racial justice movement that led to this big momentum for reparations, it's dissipated. Democrats have kind of dropped it, and on the right, there's been an outright backlash, what some activists call whitelash. Many prominent conservatives have made an issue of denying systemic racism is real, and there's also a growing movement to challenge programs that address systemic racism in court. Now, all of that said, California reparations advocates are not giving up, and the state is still engaged in one of the largest-scale efforts to compensate people for historic racism in our country's history. FLORIDO: I've been speaking with NPR race and identity correspondent Sandhya Dirks. Thanks. DIRKS: Thanks, Adrian. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nFLORIDO: So tell us about what this task force did. DIRKS: Well, it spent two years collecting expert evidence and testimony, holding public hearings across the state. And then last summer, it issued this report recommending a long list of policies aimed at closing racial gaps in wealth, health, education and achievement - things like free college tuition, housing aid, tax breaks. But the biggest recommendation was for California to make cash payments to the descendants of enslaved people - in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. FLORIDO: So that was a year ago, and now this week, we learned that the new state budget will include $12 million for reparations. So is that for those cash payments? DIRKS: No. I mean, so far, there's been no movement on cash payments. The 12 million is money for, as of now, unspecified legislation. It could go to a slate of bills introduced by members of the Black Legislative Caucus to address some other parts of the task force's report. FLORIDO: Like what? DIRKS: One bill would end forced labor in state prisons. Another would provide grant money to combat violence in Black communities. And another would do something simple but deeply symbolic - accept responsibility for California's role in upholding slavery. It also recognizes the state's role in perpetuating systemic discrimination that exists to this day. Another bill would create a California Freedmen's Bureau, named for the agency set up after the Civil War to help formerly enslaved people. The idea is that bureau would help create the infrastructure for administering reparations. FLORIDO: So Sandhya, are there any bills that would actually, you know, compensate people? DIRKS: Well, there is one. State Senator Steven Bradford introduced what people are calling a land back bill. It would enable the state to compensate Black people whose land it took using policies like eminent domain. There's a long history of that tool being used for racist reasons. FLORIDO: California's budget is almost 300 billion - that's with a B - billion dollars, Sandhya. So 12 million set aside in this year's budget for reparations doesn't sound like very much. Can the state really do anything meaningful with that money? DIRKS: Well, I asked that question of state Senator Steven Bradford. He's also a member of the Reparations Task Force, and he admits the amount is basically budget dust. STEVEN BRADFORD: Does 12 million come close to healing or addressing all the massive wrongs and continued, you know, vestiges of slavery and - no, no - and discrimination? But it lets folks know that we're serious about it. It's a beginning. DIRKS: Other supporters of reparations say, while it's not a lot of money, it's a symbolic amount and that it's a bookmark or a promise. Kamilah Moore, who led the state's Reparations Task Force, also says it's a good start. KAMILAH MOORE: And I'm hoping to see more legislation that gets at direct benefits to descendants of slaves in this next legislative session, but I think it was a good idea for the California Legislative Black Caucus to start off with bills that relate to more structural policies.

It could go to a slate of bills introduced by members of the Black Legislative Caucus to address some other parts of the task force's report. FLORIDO: Like what? DIRKS: One bill would end forced labor in state prisons. Another would provide grant money to combat violence in Black communities. And another would do something simple but deeply symbolic - accept responsibility for California's role in upholding slavery. It also recognizes the state's role in perpetuating systemic discrimination that exists to this day. Another bill would create a California Freedmen's Bureau, named for the agency set up after the Civil War to help formerly enslaved people. The idea is that bureau would help create the infrastructure for administering reparations. FLORIDO: So Sandhya, are there any bills that would actually, you know, compensate people? DIRKS: Well, there is one. State Senator Steven Bradford introduced what people are calling a land back bill. It would enable the state to compensate Black people whose land it took using policies like eminent domain. There's a long history of that tool being used for racist reasons. FLORIDO: California's budget is almost 300 billion - that's with a B - billion dollars, Sandhya. So 12 million set aside in this year's budget for reparations doesn't sound like very much. Can the state really do anything meaningful with that money? DIRKS: Well, I asked that question of state Senator Steven Bradford. He's also a member of the Reparations Task Force, and he admits the amount is basically budget dust. STEVEN BRADFORD: Does 12 million come close to healing or addressing all the massive wrongs and continued, you know, vestiges of slavery and - no, no - and discrimination? But it lets folks know that we're serious about it. It's a beginning. DIRKS: Other supporters of reparations say, while it's not a lot of money, it's a symbolic amount and that it's a bookmark or a promise. Kamilah Moore, who led the state's Reparations Task Force, also says it's a good start. KAMILAH MOORE: And I'm hoping to see more legislation that gets at direct benefits to descendants of slaves in this next legislative session, but I think it was a good idea for the California Legislative Black Caucus to start off with bills that relate to more structural policies. FLORIDO: So Sandhya, I mean, it sounds like lawmakers and even some advocates are sort of framing this money as an important first step. But what about the cash payments? Is there just no support for that? DIRKS: There just isn't enough. State Senator Bradford has said so himself. Governor Gavin Newsom has also publicly been very tepid on the idea of cash reparations. They say it's largely a budgetary issue. And these are all Democrats. Among Republicans, there's even more opposition. James Gallagher is the state assembly's Republican leader. And he doesn't think cash reparations are what's going to close racial gaps. JAMES GALLAGHER: Yes, I think in our current society, there are not impediments to, you know, Black Americans succeeding. But are there things in history that have certainly put Black Americans behind in terms of being able to build wealth? Yeah. I mean, I think we know that's true. DIRKS: And he also says it's just not fair for taxpayers today to have to pay for injustices of the past. But Adrian, to be clear, it's not Republicans holding up these more robust reparations. Democrats have a supermajority in the California legislature. If they wanted to make this happen, they could. Gallagher told me he feels like this is all a performance with very little substance to back it up. GALLAGHER: And to me, like, what Democrats continue to do in this situation is act like they're doing something in terms of reparations but not really doing it. DIRKS: What's so interesting is that grassroots reparations activists are saying something very similar. As we heard earlier, some are framing the 12 million and the bills as a solid start. But for Black people in the state who saw this as a chance for California to do something big and bold, there's a feeling of frustration, like things are already being watered down. FLORIDO: If reparations are proving so tough to pass in California, you know, one of the most progressive states in the country, what does that say about prospects for the broader reparations movement going forward, do you think? DIRKS: Well, it's always been really hard to get public support for reparations. Poll after poll has found that aside from African Americans, there's just not a lot of support for cash payments. Some polls have found that the general public don't believe Black Americans deserve reparations. The post-Floyd racial justice movement that led to this big momentum for reparations, it's dissipated. Democrats have kind of dropped it, and on the right, there's been an outright backlash, what some activists call whitelash. Many prominent conservatives have made an issue of denying systemic racism is real, and there's also a growing movement to challenge programs that address systemic racism in court. Now, all of that said, California reparations advocates are not giving up, and the state is still engaged in one of the largest-scale efforts to compensate people for historic racism in our country's history. FLORIDO: I've been speaking with NPR race and identity correspondent Sandhya Dirks. Thanks. DIRKS: Thanks, Adrian. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

KAMILAH MOORE: And I'm hoping to see more legislation that gets at direct benefits to descendants of slaves in this next legislative session, but I think it was a good idea for the California Legislative Black Caucus to start off with bills that relate to more structural policies. FLORIDO: So Sandhya, I mean, it sounds like lawmakers and even some advocates are sort of framing this money as an important first step. But what about the cash payments? Is there just no support for that? DIRKS: There just isn't enough. State Senator Bradford has said so himself. Governor Gavin Newsom has also publicly been very tepid on the idea of cash reparations. They say it's largely a budgetary issue. And these are all Democrats. Among Republicans, there's even more opposition. James Gallagher is the state assembly's Republican leader. And he doesn't think cash reparations are what's going to close racial gaps. JAMES GALLAGHER: Yes, I think in our current society, there are not impediments to, you know, Black Americans succeeding. But are there things in history that have certainly put Black Americans behind in terms of being able to build wealth? Yeah. I mean, I think we know that's true. DIRKS: And he also says it's just not fair for taxpayers today to have to pay for injustices of the past. But Adrian, to be clear, it's not Republicans holding up these more robust reparations. Democrats have a supermajority in the California legislature. If they wanted to make this happen, they could. Gallagher told me he feels like this is all a performance with very little substance to back it up. GALLAGHER: And to me, like, what Democrats continue to do in this situation is act like they're doing something in terms of reparations but not really doing it. DIRKS: What's so interesting is that grassroots reparations activists are saying something very similar. As we heard earlier, some are framing the 12 million and the bills as a solid start. But for Black people in the state who saw this as a chance for California to do something big and bold, there's a feeling of frustration, like things are already being watered down. FLORIDO: If reparations are proving so tough to pass in California, you know, one of the most progressive states in the country, what does that say about prospects for the broader reparations movement going forward, do you think? DIRKS: Well, it's always been really hard to get public support for reparations. Poll after poll has found that aside from African Americans, there's just not a lot of support for cash payments. Some polls have found that the general public don't believe Black Americans deserve reparations. The post-Floyd racial justice movement that led to this big momentum for reparations, it's dissipated. Democrats have kind of dropped it, and on the right, there's been an outright backlash, what some activists call whitelash. Many prominent conservatives have made an issue of denying systemic racism is real, and there's also a growing movement to challenge programs that address systemic racism in court. Now, all of that said, California reparations advocates are not giving up, and the state is still engaged in one of the largest-scale efforts to compensate people for historic racism in our country's history. FLORIDO: I've been speaking with NPR race and identity correspondent Sandhya Dirks. Thanks. DIRKS: Thanks, Adrian. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

State Senator Steven Bradford introduced what people are calling a land back bill. It would enable the state to compensate Black people whose land it took using policies like eminent domain. There's a long history of that tool being used for racist reasons. FLORIDO: California's budget is almost 300 billion - that's with a B - billion dollars, Sandhya. So 12 million set aside in this year's budget for reparations doesn't sound like very much. Can the state really do anything meaningful with that money? DIRKS: Well, I asked that question of state Senator Steven Bradford. He's also a member of the Reparations Task Force, and he admits the amount is basically budget dust. STEVEN BRADFORD: Does 12 million come close to healing or addressing all the massive wrongs and continued, you know, vestiges of slavery and - no, no - and discrimination? But it lets folks know that we're serious about it. It's a beginning.

DIRKS: Well, it's always been really hard to get public support for reparations. Poll after poll has found that aside from African Americans, there's just not a lot of support for cash payments. Some polls have found that the general public don't believe Black Americans deserve reparations. The post-Floyd racial justice movement that led to this big momentum for reparations, it's dissipated. Democrats have kind of dropped it, and on the right, there's been an outright backlash, what some activists call whitelash. Many prominent conservatives have made an issue of denying systemic racism is real, and there's also a growing movement to challenge programs that address systemic racism in court. Now, all of that said, California reparations advocates are not giving up, and the state is still engaged in one of the largest-scale efforts to compensate people for historic racism in our country's history. FLORIDO: I've been speaking with NPR race and identity correspondent Sandhya Dirks. Thanks. DIRKS: Thanks, Adrian. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But it lets folks know that we're serious about it. It's a beginning. DIRKS: Other supporters of reparations say, while it's not a lot of money, it's a symbolic amount and that it's a bookmark or a promise. Kamilah Moore, who led the state's Reparations Task Force, also says it's a good start. KAMILAH MOORE: And I'm hoping to see more legislation that gets at direct benefits to descendants of slaves in this next legislative session, but I think it was a good idea for the California Legislative Black Caucus to start off with bills that relate to more structural policies. FLORIDO: So Sandhya, I mean, it sounds like lawmakers and even some advocates are sort of framing this money as an important first step. But what about the cash payments? Is there just no support for that? DIRKS: There just isn't enough. State Senator Bradford has said so himself. Governor Gavin Newsom has also publicly been very tepid on the idea of cash reparations. They say it's largely a budgetary issue. And these are all Democrats. Among Republicans, there's even more opposition. James Gallagher is the state assembly's Republican leader. And he doesn't think cash reparations are what's going to close racial gaps. JAMES GALLAGHER: Yes, I think in our current society, there are not impediments to, you know, Black Americans succeeding. But are there things in history that have certainly put Black Americans behind in terms of being able to build wealth? Yeah. I mean, I think we know that's true. DIRKS: And he also says it's just not fair for taxpayers today to have to pay for injustices of the past. But Adrian, to be clear, it's not Republicans holding up these more robust reparations. Democrats have a supermajority in the California legislature. If they wanted to make this happen, they could. Gallagher told me he feels like this is all a performance with very little substance to back it up. GALLAGHER: And to me, like, what Democrats continue to do in this situation is act like they're doing something in terms of reparations but not really doing it. DIRKS: What's so interesting is that grassroots reparations activists are saying something very similar. As we heard earlier, some are framing the 12 million and the bills as a solid start. But for Black people in the state who saw this as a chance for California to do something big and bold, there's a feeling of frustration, like things are already being watered down.

Governor Gavin Newsom has also publicly been very tepid on the idea of cash reparations. They say it's largely a budgetary issue. And these are all Democrats. Among Republicans, there's even more opposition. James Gallagher is the state assembly's Republican leader. And he doesn't think cash reparations are what's going to close racial gaps. JAMES GALLAGHER: Yes, I think in our current society, there are not impediments to, you know, Black Americans succeeding. But are there things in history that have certainly put Black Americans behind in terms of being able to build wealth? Yeah. I mean, I think we know that's true. DIRKS: And he also says it's just not fair for taxpayers today to have to pay for injustices of the past. But Adrian, to be clear, it's not Republicans holding up these more robust reparations. Democrats have a supermajority in the California legislature. If they wanted to make this happen, they could. Gallagher told me he feels like this is all a performance with very little substance to back it up. GALLAGHER: And to me, like, what Democrats continue to do in this situation is act like they're doing something in terms of reparations but not really doing it. DIRKS: What's so interesting is that grassroots reparations activists are saying something very similar. As we heard earlier, some are framing the 12 million and the bills as a solid start. But for Black people in the state who saw this as a chance for California to do something big and bold, there's a feeling of frustration, like things are already being watered down. FLORIDO: If reparations are proving so tough to pass in California, you know, one of the most progressive states in the country, what does that say about prospects for the broader reparations movement going forward, do you think? DIRKS: Well, it's always been really hard to get public support for reparations. Poll after poll has found that aside from African Americans, there's just not a lot of support for cash payments. Some polls have found that the general public don't believe Black Americans deserve reparations. The post-Floyd racial justice movement that led to this big momentum for reparations, it's dissipated. Democrats have kind of dropped it, and on the right, there's been an outright backlash, what some activists call whitelash. Many prominent conservatives have made an issue of denying systemic racism is real, and there's also a growing movement to challenge programs that address systemic racism in court. Now, all of that said, California reparations advocates are not giving up, and the state is still engaged in one of the largest-scale efforts to compensate people for historic racism in our country's history. FLORIDO: I've been speaking with NPR race and identity correspondent Sandhya Dirks. Thanks. DIRKS: Thanks, Adrian. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

      "text": "A Call For Reparations: How America Might Narrow The Racial Wealth Gap\n\nTerry Gross\n\nA man kneels and raises his fist in the air during a march and protest to mark the Juneteenth holiday at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial June 19, 2020 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption\n\nA man kneels and raises his fist in the air during a march and protest to mark the Juneteenth holiday at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial June 19, 2020 in Washington, DC.\n\nThe killing of George Floyd has ignited protests and inspired conversations - and changes - across the globe. But New York Times Magazine writer Nikole Hannah-Jones says more needs to be done to address America's racial wealth gap.\n\n\"Very few Americans have created all of their wealth on their own; it's passed down through generations and then built upon,\" Hannah-Jones says. \"Black Americans never really had a chance to do that.\"\n\nHannah-Jones traces the wealth gap to slavery, and the fact that enslaved people were not allowed to own property. She notes that the legalized segregation and racial terrorism that followed slavery exacerbated the problem and \"prevented generation after generation of Black Americans from acquiring the type of wealth or foothold in the economy that allows you to live a life that is much more typical of white Americans.\"\n\nHannah-Jones won a Pulitzer Prize for creating the 1619 project at The New York Times, which tracks the legacy of slavery. Her latest article for the Times Magazine, What is Owed , makes the case for economic reparations for Black Americans.\n\n\"Reparations, to me, is about repair,\" she says. \"In the context specifically of Black Americans, reparations has to do with 250 years of chattel slavery, followed by another 100 years of legalized segregation or apartheid and racial terrorism, and how that impacted the economic well-being of Black Americans.\"\n\nOn the wealth gap between white Americans and Black Americans\n\nBlack Americans never really had a chance to [create wealth]. Of course, 250 years of slavery where they are unable to accumulate any capital and then coming out of slavery, Black Americans face the dragnet of discrimination and segregation that further prevented them from building any type of wealth. Black people were denied access to colleges, were denied access to high schools, were denied access to higher paying jobs. And when Black people were able to get some land or to build a business, oftentimes they face those businesses being stolen or burned down or destroyed.\n\nSo we saw really from 1619 until 1968, when the last of the civil rights legislation was passed saying you could no longer discriminate against Black Americans, Black people being denied access to the primary wealth-building tools, homeownership, federally financed loans, the G.I. Bill to be able to purchase housing that white Americans use to build their wealth. And so what we see today is the stark chasm that was built up over generations, and then only made worse by the fact that today Black Americans still face discrimination across the spectrum of American life.\n\nOn calling for a national conversation about reparations\n\nI think that reparations can't just be any one thing. I think that you have to have targeted investment in Black communities and Black schools that have been generationally under-resourced. You certainly need to have a commitment to strong enforcement of existing civil rights laws, because reparations don't do any good if you're still facing rampant employment and housing and educational discrimination. But the center of any reparations program has to be cash payments. The only thing that closes a wealth gap is money.\n\nYou cannot close a racial wealth gap without transferring wealth to the people who have the gap. So cash payments to me have to be central to any program.\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones\n\nI think a lot of the times when we have these discussions about, well, let's give scholarships and let's pay for Black people to go to college - one, the facts show that Black people with a college degree still earn less than white people, still have less wealth than white Americans who have a high school degree. So, again, that discomfort with a cash payment is something I think we need to understand is also racialized. And this belief that Black people are not deserving or won't spend their money the way that people think that they should. But you cannot close a racial wealth gap without transferring wealth to the people who have the gap. So cash payments to me have to be central to any program.\n\nOn the conversation about reparations at the time of emancipation\n\nWe are often taught in this country that Black people are emancipated and then everyone is on an even footing. We don't often question what does that mean to be emancipated after 250 years of bondage - to be emancipated with no job, no home, no money, no clothes, no bed, no pots, nothing. Enslaved people were unable to own anything or to accrue anything at all. And so what happens at emancipation is this expectation that the government should help formerly enslaved people to get a foothold. And what Black people wanted more than anything was land. ...\n\nThere are stories of mass starvation of Black people after they had been freed, having to leave the plantation and find shelter in burned out buildings, trying to forage for food in burned-out fields. It was a devastating period for Black people. This country decided that it was going to do nothing, that it owed these people nothing.\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones\n\nSo Gen. Sherman takes that to heart and he issues Field Order 15 and Field Order 15 declares that Black families will get 40 acres of former Confederate land, and that they will be able to work that land. ... But unfortunately, that period was very, very brief. President Lincoln was assassinated and he was replaced by his vice president, Andrew Johnson, who was a Southerner who was a white supremacist and who believed, like many white Americans at that time, that Black people were deserving of nothing after slavery, that they should be grateful for their freedom. And he confiscated the land and returned the land to the former confederates. And that ended the only real effort in the history of this country to provide reparations for those who have been enslaved. And that really left formerly enslaved people in absolute devastating poverty. There are stories of mass starvation of Black people after they had been freed, having to leave the plantation and find shelter in burned out buildings, trying to forage for food in burned-out fields. It was a devastating period for Black people. This country decided that it was going to do nothing, that it owed these people nothing.\n\nOn why she uses the term \"enslaved person\" and not \"slave\" in her writing\n\nIt was very important in the 1619 Project and whenever I write about this, to not use language that further dehumanizes people who every system and structure was designed to dehumanize. I think when we hear the word \"slave,\" we think of slavery as being the essence of that person. But if you call someone an enslaved person, then it speaks to a condition. These people were not slaves. Someone chose to force them into the condition of slavery, and that language to me is very important, as is using the word \"enslaver\" over slave owner because these people didn't have a moral right to own another human being, even though the society allowed it, and I think it needs to be active, that this was an active system of people choosing to treat other human beings as property.\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones has received the MacArthur \"Genius Award,\" as well as a Peabody Award and George Polk Award. She co-founded the Ida Be Well Society for Investigative Reporting, which is dedicated to increasing the ranks of investigative reporters of color. The New York Times hide caption\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones has received the MacArthur \"Genius Award,\" as well as a Peabody Award and George Polk Award. She co-founded the Ida Be Well Society for Investigative Reporting, which is dedicated to increasing the ranks of investigative reporters of color.\n\nOn where the concept of the 1619 Project came from\n\n[As a kid] I never knew that enslaved people, that African people, that my people, had been on this land that long, that we actually arrived here before the pilgrims. And I think I understood even at that moment that there was a reason we had all heard about the ship, the Mayflower, and there was a reason none of us had been taught about the ship, the White Lion, even though it arrived a year earlier and was just as significant. So that intentional erasure and the power of that erasure stuck with me. ...\n\nSo as the 400-year anniversary was approaching, [I] had this nagging feeling in my stomach, a very unsettling feeling that this tremendous anniversary ... that I thought was so foundational to the American story was going to pass, and it was likely going to have very little fanfare. Most Americans probably wouldn't ever even hear of the date. And like so much about the history of Black Americans and slavery, it was going to be buried and marginalized. And here I am at The New York Times and I have a huge megaphone and platform. I could do something about that. But I didn't want it to be a history. ... I wanted to use that anniversary as a time, not to just examine what happened in the past, but to really help us focus on how if you look across modern American life, so much of our institutions, our politics, our culture can be traced back to slavery and bring that story from the margins and make it a central.\n\nOn talking to her 10-year-old daughter about the death of George Floyd and the demonstrations against police brutality\n\nThe simple way that you talk about things with a younger child just doesn't work anymore. She wants to know why. And it is the hardest thing as a parent when your child asks you, \"Why would that police officer do that to him?\" And you don't have an answer because you don't know why. And how do you explain to your child the sweep of 400 years of history that leads this man to think that that would be OK and he wouldn't get in trouble and to feel so little humanity towards this man because he's a Black man?\n\nThose are really hard conversations. And I often wonder if I'm failing at them, if I'm either telling her too much or not explaining it well enough, because, of course, this is tough as a parent ... wanting to protect your child's innocence as long as possible. But being Black in this country and [I understand that] by protecting her too much, I'm actually harming her. I need to prepare her for the world. I need to give her the armor and the language and the understanding to know how the world is going to see her and treat her and people like her. And it's probably one of the things about parenting that I question myself the most [about].\n\nOn the challenge of having conversations about race with white people\n\nI personally don't have a problem talking with anybody about race ... but the challenge - particularly when you're talking to people who are not Black - is the bases of knowledge are just so different. It can be hard to have the same conversation. Black people have to study race. We cannot survive without understanding how race works in this country, without understanding white Americans. It is not a luxury for us not to know, and white Americans can largely exist in society without having to understand that history, without having to understand the social science, really not having to engage [with] it with any level of depth. And so when you're trying to have that conversation, there's so much groundwork that has to come first. And that can be really challenging, because it seems like you can't ever really get to the meat of it.\n\nThen the other thing is, it's very hard for white Americans not to take it personally and get defensive when you're talking about structures that exist and will exist whether an individual person is racist or not. And it speaks to the really superficial way we've dealt with racism in this country, it's either, \"Are you saying I'm a bad person?\" It's not about that. You don't have to be a bad person to buy a house in a neighborhood that was a creation of racist housing policies. But you are benefiting from those racist housing policies. So I think to me, that is the most challenging part. We don't have a common language and understanding of our history and ... why things are like they are. And a lot of Black folks just get frustrated and don't feel like we should constantly have to teach things that are easy to know.\n\nAmy Salit and Joel Wolfram produced and edited the audio of this interview.

Historically, the idea of reparations has been tied to the forsaken promise of 400,000 acres the U.S. government was going to give to formerly enslaved people due to the atrocities of slavery. However, the harms endured by Black people have not been confined to that period. We start the episode at Cape Coast Castle, a slave trading outpost on the coast of Ghana where enslaved people were first taken from the African continent and sold into the institution of slavery.

      "text": "What can reparations for slavery look like in the United States? One man has ideas\n\nBy\n\nSacha Pfeiffer\n\n,\n\nMichael Levitt\n\nProfessor Andrew Delbanco delivered the 50th annual Jefferson Lecture in Washington D.C. on Wednesday. Billy Delfs for the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) hide caption\n\nProfessor Andrew Delbanco delivered the 50th annual Jefferson Lecture in Washington D.C. on Wednesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Endowment for the Humanities held its 50th annual Jefferson Lecture.\n\nEach year, the lecturer is chosen based on distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities. Being selected to give the Jefferson Lecture is considered the highest honor given by the federal government in the field of the humanities.\n\nThis year's honoree was Andrew Delbanco, the Alexander Hamilton professor of American Studies at Columbia University and the president of the Teagle Foundation.\n\nDelbanco's lecture, titled \"The Question of Reparations: Our Past, Our Present, Our Future,\" addresses reparations for slavery in the United States from a variety of perspectives.\n\nHe joined All Things Considered to discuss what reparations in the U.S. have looked like in the past and what they could look like in the future.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nOn why the question of reparations feels more prominent lately\n\nI think it's fair to say that in the wake of the Second World War, when Germany made an effort to come to terms with its own recent history and agreed to pay some reparations to some Jewish families after the Holocaust, the idea sort of moved into the mainstream and became something that people were willing to take seriously and not to regard as an eccentric or crackpot notion.\n\nAnd it's been on again, off again since then. Many serious people have made the case for reparations, and many others have made arguments against them. We're at a particularly lively moment right now, thanks largely to a passionate essay by Ta-Nehisi Coates published almost a decade ago. So the reparations debate is heating up, and I think it's a very important one for us to have as a nation.\n\nOn why he believes everyone has a responsibility to help with reparations, even though they did not create the system\n\nIf we allow ourselves to be thoughtful, I think we all understand this instinctively. I mean, no one should be blamed for the sins of the fathers, as the scripture puts it. And yet we live in a world that has been damaged by history. And we have a responsibility, I think, to do what we can to repair the world.\n\nSo it's a paradoxical problem that on the one hand, the past is past and should have nothing to do with us in the present as individual moral actors. But on the other hand, we live in the world that we've inherited, and so do people who've been injured by history. So it's a difficult moral problem. It's a problem that writers and philosophers have wrestled with for centuries. And we're never going to arrive at a clean, clear answer to it. But the very fact that we're talking about it, I think, is a positive sign for where we could go as a society.\n\nOn the more modern facets of reparation that he believes should be addressed\n\nWell, we're inclined to go first to the things we can measure, and the fact that African Americans lived for 200 years with no property, including themselves.\n\nSlavery, meant by definition, that they could not even own themselves is the starting point for this whole discussion. But as you say, that was a long time ago. And one argument against the reparations impulse is to say, you know, that's ancient history. There's been plenty of time, water under the bridge, et cetera.\n\nThe fact is that the measurable deprivations continued long after slavery, well into the 20th century, when Black Americans were excluded, not necessarily with racist intent, but as a matter of practice. They were excluded from the Social Security Act, which left out domestic and agricultural workers who were overwhelmingly Black, especially in the South. And even from the G.I. Bill, which was theoretically open to everyone, including to women, but that very few Black people could take advantage of because most colleges wouldn't admit them.\n\nAnd when it came to the federally guaranteed mortgages, we all know that banks were drawing red lines around neighborhoods and saying, no Black people welcome. So that series of measurable larcenies, as I guess I call it, is pretty easy to wrap the mind around it. It's not easy to comprehend. But we can list them and we can understand them.\n\nOn the impacts that cannot be measured\n\nThe less measurable injuries, which we associate with the term Jim Crow, remain mind-boggling to me when we read about them in history books or in novels or in memoirs. I mean, Black people being pushed off the sidewalk, especially Black males being pushed off the sidewalk if a white woman walked by.\n\nChildren, as Dr. King wrote about so movingly, being told that they can't go to the local water park, or the swimming pool, or the beach, because the color of their skin was offensive to other people who were going to be on that beach. Not to mention the persistence of random beatings and lynchings that were an ever present danger for Black Americans through well into the 20th century.\n\nIt's impossible to measure the impact that that had.\n\nOn putting a monetary value on many of these intangible concepts\n\nI don't think we can. Some people have tried and we've seen numbers from the thousands to the millions to the billions and trillions proposed, and different programs for distributing financial benefits to all persons who are regarded as Black, according to some pundits.\n\nOthers say, \"No, it should be restricted to only those who can prove they had an enslaved ancestor.\"\n\nI don't think that's the right path to travel on, and I recognize that this is a point of view that will anger and upset many, and that should be part of the discussion. For me, the more sensible and the more plausible - in the sense that something might actually come of it - approach to this is to recognize that many Americans have been injured by history, notably Black Americans who have a good case to make that they're at the head of that line. But there are many others who can point to disadvantages that were visited on their families or on themselves for reasons of racial prejudice and for other reasons, as well.\n\nWhat we need to do, and I take my cue here from a great person, from the past, that is Dr. King, and from a young scholar, Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, who teaches at Georgetown University, who speaks of reparations not as a process of payback, or settling scores, or getting even, but as what Professor Táíwò calls, \"A construction project,\" a future-oriented reconstruction of our society to make it a fairer place. To ensure that the kinds of depredations that Black people and many others have had to deal with over the decades and centuries will be mitigated in the future.\n\nAnd you can imagine the sorts of policies that someone who takes this point of view would have in mind, providing wraparound services for schoolchildren of the sort that affluent families take for granted. Providing better access to quality health care to try to close those shocking gaps in infant mortality, maternal deaths and childhood, and many others in childbirth. And many other measures on which Black Americans still lag behind, providing better educational opportunities beyond those early years.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis story was co-published with the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network .\n\nTwenty-five years ago, the state of Hawaii and the U.S. government promised Native Hawaiians to correct a historic wrong.\n\nPublic agencies had occupied thousands of acres intended to return Native people to their ancestral lands, paying little or no compensation for decades as the sites were used for military bases, game preserves, schools and other purposes. In 1995, state and federal legislation pledged to provide reparations.\n\nThen-U.S. Rep. Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii, said it was \"a step toward righting a great wrong against the original people of this land.\" Then-Sen. Daniel Akaka, a Native Hawaiian who steered the bill through the Senate, called the legislation \"a vindication for Hawaiians who had lost hope that this long-standing issue would ever be resolved.\"\n\nBut as 2020 draws to a close, Native Hawaiians are still waiting for all of what was promised.\n\nWhile the state has added nearly 16,000 acres to the land trust, just a fraction were on Oahu, the island with the greatest housing demand. The state still owes another 1,300 acres to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands under the terms of its reparations bill, known as Act 14, an investigation by the Honolulu Star-Advertiser and ProPublica has found.\n\nOver the years, the U.S. government has provided about 900 acres as compensation for its unauthorized takings. But none of the land conveyed, almost all of it on Oahu, was suitable for residential use, according to DHHL. And the federal government still owes additional land under the Hawaiian Home Lands Recovery Act.\n\n\"Justice delayed is justice denied,\" said former Gov. John Waihee, the only Native Hawaiian to hold that office and whose administration was instrumental in negotiating the Act 14 bill. \"At some point, you can't keep putting things off.\"\n\nThe unmet obligations are among a number of key missteps by state and federal officials that have exacerbated the decadeslong failure of DHHL to fulfill its mission to Native Hawaiians.\n\nAs the Star-Advertiser and ProPublica reported in October , DHHL is failing to award homesteads in a timely fashion, as state law requires. The department has developed just 3,300 residential lots statewide since 1995, even as its residential waitlist has ballooned to 23,000. The strategy of building expensive single family subdivisions has left thousands of low-income and homeless Native Hawaiians behind in a state with one of the most acute affordable housing crises in the nation.\n\nDHHL is now running out of real estate on Oahu, the state's most populous - and popular - island. About half the residential applicants on the statewide waitlist want to live there, yet just 575 acres remain in the land trust that are suitable for housing. That's enough to supply less than a third of the so-called waitlisters with homesteads under the current single-family model, according to an analysis of department data by the Star-Advertiser and ProPublica.\n\nNearly all the 575 acres available for residential homesteads on Oahu are located on the island's west side. Green areas show the trust lands that the state has deemed suitable for residential development.\n\nDHHL says it is adjusting to the land shortage by planning hundreds of multifamily units on Oahu over the next five years. And to get the additional lands it is owed, the department is currently pursuing settlements with state and federal officials, who say they intend to fulfill their obligations. DHHL plans to hire a private law firm to represent the interests of the trust since it both reports to the state and is negotiating with the state. Gov. David Ige, who as a former state representative participated in negotiating the 1995 reparations bill, said completing the land transfers is a priority for his administration.\n\nSome members of Hawaii's congressional delegation are calling for federal action.\n\n\"It's long past time to settle old debts to the beneficiaries,\" U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said in a statement.\n\nDHHL faces a number of administrative and logistical hurdles in its efforts to win developable property and accommodate the crushing demand for housing. Some past efforts to make the trust whole have failed, in part because of the poor quality of the lands being offered as compensation.\n\nAdvocates, lawmakers and former government officials say DHHL needs to reckon with the realities of limited land in a chain of islands.\n\nEven if DHHL won all Oahu land in the settlements - an unlikely outcome - the trust would still be short of what it needs just to satisfy the current demand. The problem is compounded by a growing waitlist and the department's chronic money woes, shortfalls that prompt the agency to lease some of its Oahu lands to commercial interests.\n\nNowhere is the broken promise more apparent than on Oahu, where DHHL faces the greatest demand.\n\nOn paper, the department's 203,000-acre land trust contains 7,800 acres on the island, which is defined by two large mountain ranges that create towering ridges, steep slopes, forests, beaches and sea cliffs. But in reality, just a fifth of that land is considered suitable for residential development. A full third of DHHL's Oahu holdings are on terrain so rugged that it has been marked purely for conservation, including 1,400 acres of steep mountainside in the Hawaiian community of Waimanalo.\n\nThe state Legislature improved DHHL's prospects in 1995 by passing Act 14, providing money and land to settle the trust's claims against the state for past land abuses. For the next 20 years, DHHL received $30 million annually, helping underwrite the development of more homesteads. On the real estate side, however, the gains were less impressive, especially where the land was needed most.\n\nJust 440 of the 16,000 acres that the state added under the law were on Oahu. And even then, not all the lands were suitable for residential development.\n\nWaihee said the state had little land on the island at the time that was fit for homesteading. Under the program, beneficiaries - defined as those at least 50% Hawaiian - can apply for a 99-year land lease and then, upon award, either build or buy a home on the parcel. According to DHHL, the department developed about 660 lots on Oahu with the added property. The island's residential waitlist nearly doubled during that time, to 11,000 people.\n\nThe federal Hawaiian Home Lands Recovery Act has done even less. Under the law, the only lands eligible for transfer to the trust are those considered by the U.S. government to be surplus property, such as a closed military base or research lab.\n\n\"The implementation has ended up essentially being useless,\" said Abercrombie, who went on to serve as the state's governor, in a recent interview.\n\nA major land exchange that was announced to great fanfare in 1998 is instructive. Then-Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt traveled to Honolulu to join top Hawaii political leaders at Washington Place, the governor's residence, to tout more than 900 acres pegged for transfer to the trust. The vast majority of that land was on Oahu, and officials applauded the proposed deal as delivering prime land for, among other things, residential homesteads and transitional housing for homeless Hawaiians. But 22 years later, DHHL says the land is not suited for residential use, citing a host of complications.\n\nFor example, 586 acres, which were once part of a West Oahu naval air station, would have involved prohibitive development costs and the requirement to involve surrounding landowners on infrastructure issues, according to DHHL. Some of that land is instead being leased to companies for such purposes as solar farms, generating revenue for the trust.\n\nThe department has rejected other offers for lands elsewhere on Oahu over the years, citing contamination or other factors.\n\nSuch rejections are part of the reason that the federal government still has outstanding obligations to the state, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Department of the Interior. Moreover, few surplus federal lands have become available in Hawaii since 2000.\n\nDHHL, however, is currently evaluating an offer for an 80-acre lot in Ewa Beach on Oahu's west side. The site of a former tsunami warning center can be used for residential development, which would make the potential deal the first under the federal law to help alleviate the residential land shortage on Oahu.\n\nIf all parties reach agreement, the transfer could fulfill the U.S. government's commitment. In a nod to the limited utility of the lands obtained under prior settlement deals, the Interior spokesman said the Ewa Beach proposal could provide housing for hundreds of Hawaiian families and \"has the potential to be one of the most important acquisitions by the trust in the last 25 years.\"\n\nOther efforts to fix the problem have faltered.\n\nDHHL has looked to the private market to purchase additional property, but besides lacking land, the department has lacked money.\n\nIn 29 of the 61 years since statehood, the department received no operating funds from the state, according to DHHL data. In 2012, the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that the state is obligated to sufficiently fund the department, and it has fared much better since then. Still, it has received far less than what it deemed sufficient.\n\nOver the past five years, for instance, DHHL has requested about $50 million for land acquisitions, according to the department, an average of $10 million annually. It got just about $7 million in total.\n\nThe department is using the money to acquire a one-acre parcel in urban Honolulu, where it plans to restore two vacant apartment buildings as rentals for beneficiaries.\n\nCedric Duarte, a DHHL spokesman, said the department continues to look for possible land acquisitions but funding is a challenge.\n\nA 100-year-old program created to provide Native Hawaiians - especially poor ones - land to live on after the U.S. annexed the islands is failing. Thousands have died waiting in line and even more can't afford the mortgages they'd need.\n\nAs a result, the department leases some trust lands to generate revenue, a practice that DHHL considers essential for financial stability.\n\nOn Oahu, more than a quarter of the trust's 7,800 acres are in the hands of nonbeneficiaries, producing nearly $12 million in annual revenue - roughly 17% of the department's budget. The tenants pay to use the land for a wide range of purposes, from operating churches and other nonprofit organizations to running commercial enterprises.\n\nThe most lucrative lease, accounting for nearly $5 million annually, is for a West Oahu regional mall, Ka Makana Ali'i. Sitting on roughly 70 acres transferred to DHHL under Act 14, the property was developed by DeBartolo Development and opened several years ago. The company is led by former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.\n\nBeneficiaries have long criticized the practice.\n\nRobin Danner, chair of the Sovereign Council of Hawaiian Homestead Associations, the largest beneficiary group in the state, said Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalaniana'ole, considered the father of the homesteading program when it was created a century ago, envisioned having Hawaiians running successful businesses on their land. \"Did he intend for the 49ers to get my land to build a mall? No.\"\n\nKa Makana Ali'i said the 49ers have no ownership stake in the mall and noted the project - one of the region's largest employers - is supporting beneficiaries and the community, such as through a $500,000 donation to build a park in an adjacent homestead development. \"We are committed to uplifting the mission and vision\" of the Hawaiian prince, said Stephanie England, Ka Makana Ali'i general manager.\n\nStill, with 11,000 beneficiaries on Oahu's residential waitlist and 28,000 on statewide lists for residential, farming and ranching homesteads, advocates say DHHL should be using all lands to directly help Native Hawaiians. \"You need every inch of those lands for homesteading purposes,\" said Kekoa Enomoto, a Maui homesteader and chair of Pa'upena Community Development Corp., a nonprofit that assists beneficiaries to build homes and self-sufficient communities.\n\nThe department, however, says it needs the money, and this week announced plans to expand its commercial leasing program.\n\nOfficials said they intend to seek legislation that would authorize DHHL to lease trust lands for the development of a resort-casino. The proposal must first be approved by the Hawaiian Homes Commission, which oversees DHHL, before going to Ige, who would then consider whether to include it as part of his package of measures submitted to the Legislature for the upcoming session, which starts in January.\n\n\"Given the impact of COVID-19 on our state's economy, the department is proposing a bold measure that has proven successful for indigenous groups in generating critically needed revenue to improve the lives of their people,\" said Tyler Iokepa Gomes, a senior official at DHHL, in a statement. \"We are at a pivotal moment in the history of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act and resources to develop infrastructure and acquire lands will be needed to fulfill the vision of Prince Kuhio.\"\n\nState Rep. Sylvia Luke, who heads the House Finance Committee, raised concerns about placing a resort-casino on buildable trust land on Oahu, shrinking what is available for homesteads. \"The priority should be to use developable land to reduce the waitlist,\" she said in an interview.\n\nLuke previously told the Star-Advertiser and ProPublica that the Legislature has appropriated record amounts for DHHL in recent years, approving close to what the governor sought for the agency. For his part, Ige has substantially pared DHHL's annual requests, as he did with other departments, citing his duty to balance what the agencies sought with the state's available resources.\n\nGiven how the coronavirus pandemic has battered the state's tourist-driven economy and its tax revenues, additional funding for DHHL seems unlikely. Asked whether he intends to include money to purchase land in his coming budget requests to the Legislature, Ige said he would have to work with the department to identify priorities. But he said he would support acquisition money if it meant accelerating the slow pace of homestead awards.\n\nState policymakers are now scrambling for solutions.\n\nState Sen. Maile Shimabukuro, chair of the Senate committee on Hawaiian affairs, believes the pending settlement with the state represents the most practical way for Hawaii to help DHHL address the land shortage. \"If there's going to be any kind of solution, land is more likely than cash,\" she said, and \"if they can find some on Oahu, that's really the way to go.\"\n\nState House Speaker Scott Saiki agreed, saying \"the state should follow the law and prioritize the islands where the needs are greatest.\" He mentioned Oahu specifically and raised the possibility of lawmakers passing a bill that would give the Legislature the power to oversee negotiations.\n\nState Sen. Gilbert Keith-Agaran, vice chair of the Senate's Water and Land Committee, said lawmakers may need to pursue legislation outside of the settlement process to help alleviate the Oahu land shortage. One option could be to transfer or exchange lands held by other state entities to DHHL. \"I don't think we should foreclose any of these things,\" he said. \"The benefit to the entire state is that the more people we move off the waitlist and put into housing also helps alleviate our general shortage of housing.\"\n\nIge was open to the idea but said any potential sites would have to be evaluated in consultation with the state agency holding the land.\n\n\"If there are lands that are suitable, we certainly would be looking at it and seeing whether it makes sense that those should be included to finish our commitment.\"\n\nStill, even under the most optimistic settlement scenario, DHHL will be short of the lands it needs to accommodate the growing waitlist. That has prompted advocates, legislators and others to urge the department to make more efficient use of its limited holdings. One potential solution: develop high-rise condos. \"We have to go vertical,\" said Kama Hopkins, who served on the Hawaiian Homes Commission from 2011 to 2014. \"There's no choice.\"\n\nHistorically, the department has been reluctant to pursue the idea, in part because the beneficiary community is divided over the concept. Some question whether providing condos in a high-rise unit would fulfill the department's constitutional obligation to provide homesteading lots to beneficiaries. \"If you ask a Native Hawaiian on the waiting list what they want from DHHL, they will tell you they want their land,\" said Duarte, the department spokesman.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands continue to wait.\n\nWaikiki resident Darrell Maielua, a 58-year-old district manager for a Hawaii laundry company, applied for a homestead on Oahu in 2008. Today, he is more than 7,000 deep on the island's residential waitlist and has yet to get an offer.\n\nHe dreams of getting a house for his family of five and wants his granddaughter, who is not yet 2, to be able to run around outside in their yard. But he's growing impatient with the department and the long waits for a homestead. \"They're just coming up with excuses,\" he said of DHHL. \"They've been doing that for 50 years.\"\n\nHelp us investigate: ProPublica and the Honolulu Star-Advertiser are spending the year investigating the homesteading program for Native Hawaiians.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nSeries: Illinois Newsletter\n\nFive years ago, Chicago approved historic reparations for survivors of torture under former police Cmdr. Jon Burge. The city promised to create a memorial. It hasn't.\n\nby Logan Jaffe\n\nDive Deeper Into Our Reporting\n\nIt took some time for Vincent Wade-Robinson to come around to the idea of having his name inscribed on a memorial. His experience had been painful. He didn't want to dwell upon it.\n\n\"How can you describe torture?\" he asked me. \"Every day I look in the mirror I have that scar across my nose. That's my reminder of what happened to me.\"\n\nBut he eventually decided that a memorial would be an important public acknowledgment that he and others were wronged. Five years later, he's still waiting.\n\nThe memorial is part of the first municipal reparations package in the country to address police violence. This initiative, approved by the city of Chicago in May 2015, is designed to address the wrongs perpetrated in what is perhaps the nation's longest running police brutality scandal. For almost two decades, from the early 1970s to the early 1990s, former Chicago police Cmdr. Jon Burge led a crew of officers who tortured more than 125 individuals, most of them Black, into confessing to crimes that many, like Wade-Robinson, say they did not commit.\n\nBurge, who denied mistreating suspects, was convicted in federal court of perjury and obstruction of justice for lying under oath about the torture and was sentenced to 4 1⁄2 years in prison. He died in 2018.\n\nThe $5.5 million reparations package included a formal apology from former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, financial compensation to survivors and their families, waived tuition to City Colleges, a mandatory Chicago Public Schools curriculum to educate students about police torture under Burge, and the creation of a permanent, public memorial.\n\nAs monuments across the country are being toppled or removed because of their ties to the Confederacy or other racist legacies, the creation of this memorial is the sole requirement of the reparations package that remains unfulfilled.\n\n\"They admitted that they did wrong by us,\" said Wade-Robinson, who served 31 years in prison for convictions for murder, robbery and home invasion, crimes he said he falsely confessed to after detectives punched him and hit him in the face with a flashlight. \"But they're stumbling over their feet to do right by us.\"\n\nThere are a number of explanations for why the memorial remains unbuilt, and they differ depending on who you talk to. Joey Mogul, a lawyer at the People's Law Office and co-founder of Chicago Torture Justice Memorials, which advocated for the reparations, attributed some of the delay to the organization's commitment to involve a community of survivors, family members, artists, educators and activists in the memorial's design.\n\nBut money and politics, of course, have also played roles. Though the memorial was part of the reparations package, Emanuel did not commit funds to building it before he left office. A transition committee for Mayor Lori Lightfoot recommended that she fund the memorial within her first 100 days of office, but more than a year later, that hasn't happened.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the mayor said the city is committed to continuing to work \"on proposals for a memorial that honors the victims of injustice.\"\n\nBut it is unclear where the city stands on its commitment to creating a specific memorial to recognize Burge survivors and acknowledge the violence they suffered at the hands of police. A spokesperson did not respond to questions on whether the city favors creating a memorial that's more broadly themed around injustice or one specific to Burge survivors.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nAdvocates for the memorial say its specificity is important. Mogul said that the memorial would help establish the experiences of survivors and families, \"who repeatedly told [the] truth and were always told they were lying\" about the torture, as the dominant narrative of how the city remembers a shameful part of its past.\n\n\"We need the public memorial to ensure their truth is sealed,\" Mogul said.\n\nAnthony Holmes, 74, who served 30 years in prison for a murder he said he did not commit and later testified against Burge at the former police commander's trial in federal court, said the city's delay in creating the memorial hurts.\n\n\"They've got other histories up,\" Holmes said, referring to other memorials and monuments around Chicago, some of which have been debated for decades . Among them: an 1895 monument to Confederate prisoners of war in Oak Woods Cemetery on the South Side and a 1934 monument to Italian fascist Italo Balbo along the lakeshore (Two Chicago aldermen proposed an ordinance to rename Balbo Drive in honor of Black journalist and anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells in 2018. The city instead renamed a portion of Congress Parkway after Wells).\n\nMore recently, there's been a push to add one more S to Douglas Park, effectively renaming it in honor of Frederick Douglass, the Black abolitionist and scholar, rather than Stephen A. Douglas .\n\nThe Logan Square neighborhood, too, is named after Union Army Gen. John A. Logan, who helped pass a measure in 1853 that for a time criminalized the settlement of Black people in Illinois . A large monument to Logan stands in Grant Park downtown.\n\n\"These things took place and we honored them,\" Holmes said. \"They won't honor us and I don't understand this because we're the ones that suffered.\"\n\nIf and when the city decides to move forward with the memorial, there is a design for the structure. After years of gathering more community input, exhibits, research and the solicitation of Chicago artists, a panel of jurors - which included Wade-Robinson and Holmes - approved in April 2019 a design by Chicago artist Patricia Nguyen and architectural designer John Lee.\n\nNguyen said the proposed memorial , titled \"Breath, Form & Freedom,\" is particularly relevant to current movements across the country to remove monuments and memorials with harmful, racist legacies.\n\n\"We don't want a memorial that says the city has dealt with it and the city moved on,\" Nguyen said. \"We want to show a continued fight for justice.\"\n\n\"Breath, Form & Freedom,\" a 16,000-square-foot spiraled hallway that features the names of the Burge survivors, leaves space to add the names of future victims of police violence, Nguyen said. The memorial is estimated to cost about $750,000, according to Chicago Torture Justice Memorials.\n\nNguyen said she and Lee designed the structure to be used as a timeless gathering space for reflection and imagination, much as, she said, people have recently taken over some sites of Confederate monuments, including a street in Richmond, Virginia, that has become a popular spot for high school graduation photos, community barbecues and even basketball games among statues now covered in graffiti and impromptu public art. Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney said Wednesday that his administration plans to remove the city-owned statues.\n\nLee, the architectural designer, said he hopes the exposed structure of the memorial invites people to question the structural roots of racism and police violence. The circular gathering space in the memorial's center is also roofless. Nguyen said that by leaving a view of the sky, she hopes it gives people space to feel like they can breathe, a reminder of the words of Eric Garner, and most recently George Floyd, and the long history of those who have been suffocated by police.\n\nImmigrant teenagers who work overnight shifts in suburban factories dream of a better life for children they don't yet have. So did the author's father.\n\nThe location of the memorial remains undecided. But Wade-Robinson has an idea. Rather than putting it in a neighborhood on the South Side where he says \"nobody will see it,\" he'd like to see the memorial in a high-traffic area downtown or \"right in front of the police headquarters.\"\n\nBut he's skeptical.\n\n\"You think they want to see something symbolizing a disgrace to their Chicago Police Department?\" Wade-Robinson said. \"Let's be for real.\"\n\nCorrection, July 6, 2020: This story originally misidentified the Chicago roadway renamed for Black journalist and anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells. It was a portion of Congress Parkway, not Balbo Drive.\n\nFiled under:\n\nLogan Jaffe\n\nLogan Jaffe is a reporter for newsletters at ProPublica.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "Virginia Lawmaker Calls for Commission to Study State Universities' History of Uprooting Black Communities\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with the Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism at WHRO . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nA Virginia state representative has called for creating a legislative commission to examine public universities' uprooting of Black neighborhoods following reports of the racial impacts of one local college's expansion.\n\nDelegate Delores McQuinn said in an interview that a commission is needed to research Black communities that were displaced by Virginia universities and to examine cases of families who say they were forced to sell their homes. Separate legislation sponsored by McQuinn in 2020 established a commission studying the impact of slavery and racial discrimination in Virginia , which is expected to issue a preliminary report in January.\n\nMcQuinn also urged colleges to explore potential redress for displaced families, such as free tuition. \"Universities should take it upon themselves to revisit and address these inequities and injustice that occurred at monumental levels,\" said McQuinn, a Democrat who represents part of the city of Richmond and adjoining counties. \"Many universities have profited for years based on the injustice that prevented Black families from progressing financially.\"\n\nAlong with McQuinn, other state legislators, a U.S. representative, and municipal and academic leaders said they were troubled by a recent series of articles by ProPublica and the Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism. The series detailed how Virginia universities have dislodged Black families , sometimes through the use of eminent domain, to make room for dormitories, parking lots, laboratories and other facilities, thereby exacerbating the racial gap in home ownership and the loss of Black-owned land.\n\nFor example, the city of Newport News seized the core of a middle-class Black community in the early 1960s for the site of what is now Christopher Newport University. Although less expensive locations were available, the Shoe Lane neighborhood was close to an all-white country club and residents were planning to develop more housing for Black families. Newport News leaders decided to erase what they called the \"Black spot,\" according to former CNU President Anthony Santoro. The city paid homeowners 20% less than the property value set by an independent appraiser. After Black families began to resettle around the university, Christopher Newport expanded its boundaries and bought most of the remaining homes. The university used eminent domain as leverage to force at least one homeowner to sell in 2005. That year, the school's governing board approved the tactic's use for three other properties that Christopher Newport said it ultimately acquired without resorting to eminent domain.\n\nIn a September message to faculty and staff, Christopher Newport President Bill Kelly acknowledged that the university's progress \"has come at a human cost, and we must continue to learn about and understand our complicated history.\" This \"important chapter ... is appropriately receiving renewed attention,\" he added in an apparent reference to our Sept. 5 article .\n\nThe school has erected a plaque and an exhibit chronicling the 1960s seizure of the community. In response to ProPublica and VCIJ's reporting, Kelly, a retired rear admiral who became CNU's president this year, will lead a neighborhood walk next week with CNU faculty and students as well as state and city leaders and law enforcement officials, according to university spokesperson Jim Hanchett. Although one purpose of the walk is to explore the university's history, the tour will bypass two of the streets most affected by CNU's expansion into the former Black neighborhood. \"The route was chosen because it was the safest option\" in terms of traffic and sidewalk width, Hanchett said. \"We are listening and learning ... so that actions pursued by the university are thoughtful and effective.\"\n\nAs part of its \"listening and learning\" campaign, the university hosted a panel discussion Wednesday at its fine arts center, where faculty members, local historians and clergy spoke to an overflow crowd about the significance of the campus's location and the effects of expansion on the surrounding community. While acknowledging the event as a first step, associate professor Johnny Finn, chair of the sociology department, said that the university should go beyond symbolic actions and consider \"very real and very material things that we can do,\" such as paying reparations or offering scholarships to descendants of families who were pushed out of their homes.\n\n\"I hope that this is indeed a starting point and not an ending point,\" Finn said.\n\nSeveral other universities in Virginia and elsewhere have sought to make amends for shattering minority communities. Part of the Lamberts Point neighborhood in Norfolk, Virginia, was leveled in the 1960s and 1970s, when it was a predominantly Black neighborhood, to make room for what is now Old Dominion University's main campus.\n\nODU officials said they have long recognized the need to improve relationships with their neighbors in Lamberts Point. In the past three decades, through community outreach and changes to admissions policies, students of color have increased from 21% to 54% of ODU's enrollment. ODU has awarded $310,000 in scholarships to 137 students from Lamberts Point and nearby neighborhoods since 1999, according to university records. The school also has run free summer camps for Lamberts Point children since 1992 and offers seasonal jobs to high school students.\n\nThe University of Virginia also has acknowledged its role in displacing Black residents, appointing two executive commissions within the last decade to study its historical support for racist policies. The school's president, Jim Ryan, set a goal of building up to 1,500 affordable homes and apartments by 2030 for Charlottesville residents on property owned by the university or its affiliates.\n\nSome public and private universities outside Virginia are directing scholarships to residents of communities that were diminished by campus expansions. The bustling, largely Hispanic neighborhood of Auraria in Denver was chosen in the early 1970s as the site for a satellite campus of the University of Colorado. An urban renewal project razed all but 13 cottages and a grocery store, scattering 343 families. In the 1980s, the University of Colorado at Denver set up a Displaced Aurarian Scholarship program to eliminate fees and tuition for students from families who lived there between 1955 and 1973. Last year, the university expanded the program to include all future direct descendants of the displaced families. Overall, the school has handed out more than 600 Aurarian scholarships worth $3.4 million.\n\nNolbert Chavez, an administrator at the University of Colorado at Denver and former Colorado state lawmaker, said community lobbying helped secure an additional $2 million in scholarship funds from the state legislature in 2022. The Aurarian community's struggle for recognition is similar to that of other Black and Hispanic neighborhoods displaced by universities across the country, he said.\n\n\"The thread is all the same - the communities were all traumatized,\" Chavez said. \"Until that is dealt with, these communities can't move on.\"\n\nOne such community is seeking financial reparations. About 50 families in Linnentown, a small Black neighborhood in Athens, Georgia, were displaced when their homes were acquired, mainly through eminent domain, and razed between 1962 and 1966 to clear space for University of Georgia dormitories. The financial losses caused by the seizures cost Black families $5 million in current dollars, including $4 million in underpayments and $1 million in foregone increases in property values, according to a study by University of Georgia researchers.\n\nIn 2021, commissioners in Athens-Clarke County, where the school is located, passed a resolution supporting redress for Linnentown families through economic development projects in underserved communities. Commissioners also earmarked $2.5 million to build affordable housing and a community center.\n\nLinnentown families who say they were paid less than fair value for their properties have sought compensation from the university. But a university spokesperson said the Georgia Constitution prohibits the school from using state funds for voluntary payments to third parties.\n\n\"However, the university leads a wide range of successful initiatives and partnerships that contribute to UGA's nearly $500 million economic impact on the Athens-Clarke County community,\" spokesperson Greg Trevor said. The school dedicates 10 need-based scholarships to residents of the county, he said.\n\nIn an interview with VCIJ, Newport News Councilperson Tina Vick raised the possibility of reparations for families uprooted by the establishment and expansion of Christopher Newport University. Scholarships for their descendants aren't adequate compensation, she said. \"If somebody disrupted my whole family, business and wealth, free tuition would not be enough for me.\" She said the council has informally discussed the ProPublica/VCIJ articles but hasn't decided what, if anything, to do.\n\nState Delegate Jeion Ward, a Christopher Newport graduate whose General Assembly district includes part of Newport News, said Virginia universities need to enhance their investments in Black communities through scholarships, affordable housing initiatives and development programs. The treatment of Black property owners by universities highlights \"how the loss of generational wealth has been systemically sustained in our society,\" she said.\n\n\"It's crucial for both our community and the universities involved to acknowledge and respect the sacrifices of the Black property owners who were unjustly evicted from their homes and businesses,\" said Ward, a Democrat.\n\nRep. Bobby Scott, who has represented Newport News in the U.S. House of Representatives for 30 years, said that the seizure of Shoe Lane was typical of \"some of the practices and policies intended to make life more difficult for Black Americans\" during the Jim Crow era. \"It is neither shocking nor surprising that one of the only thriving middle class Black neighborhoods in Newport News was selected for this treatment,\" he said.\n\nRead More\n\nScott added that he supported the Biden administration's infrastructure bill, which passed in 2021 and included a $1 billion pool to be used for reconnecting predominantly minority communities that have been intentionally divided by major highway construction. Public and private universities are eligible for the grants, which require local matching funds.\n\n\"We cannot undo all the harm that has been done, but we can do more to ensure current policies are implemented with equity,\" said Scott.\n\nMcQuinn, the state delegate who called for a commission to explore the racial impact of university expansions, was reelected this week. She said she hopes that \"these efforts will result in solution oriented steps towards addressing past inequities.\"\n\nReach Brandi Kellam at [email protected] or [email protected] and Louis Hansen at l [email protected] .\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Virginia Lawmakers Approve Commission to Examine Universities' Displacement of Black Communities\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with the Virginia Center for Investigative Reporting at WHRO . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nThe Virginia legislature has approved creating a statewide commission to investigate the role of public colleges and universities in displacing Black communities.\n\nThe legislature's action represents a milestone for the budding national movement to seek compensation for families dispossessed by university expansion. It follows a 2023 series by ProPublica and the Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism at WHRO, which showed that universities nationwide have uprooted tens of thousands of families of color , contributing to Black land loss and lagging rates of Black home ownership. The series, which detailed how the creation and expansion of Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, swallowed up a Black neighborhood, spurred city and university leaders there to create a similar task force in January.\n\nThe state budget passed by the legislature Saturday would establish a commission to determine whether any public institution of higher education in Virginia \"has purchased, expropriated, or otherwise taken possession\" of properties in Black neighborhoods to establish or expand a campus, and whether compensation would be \"appropriate\" for the property owners or their descendants, according to the bill. The commission will also research similar acquisitions in other states to provide context. The panel would report its findings annually to the legislature and submit final recommendations by July 2027. National higher education groups said they are unaware of any other statewide commissions studying the issue.\n\nThe Virginia commission would include 10 legislators, the state's two top education officials and seven members of the public. Gov. Glenn Youngkin has until April 17 to sign the budget; he could also veto specific line items such as the commission's funding, which consists of $28,760 per year for members' expenses. Commission staff will be paid separately by the state Division of Legislative Services.\n\n\"My country has gone from uprooting Black communities violently to legally doing it,\" the Rev. Robin D. Mines, a Richmond minister, testified at a legislative hearing last month in support of the provision. \"It is far past due time to do something about this and bringing hope to our communities.\"\n\nBy documenting the confiscation and destruction of Black neighborhoods for higher-education facilities, the ProPublica-VCIJ series added to the debate over how universities address the legacy of racial injustice - both on their campuses and in the country as a whole. Numerous universities are grappling with their racial histories, even as red states are restricting classroom discussion of critical race theory, which holds that racism is ingrained in America's laws and power structures.\n\nDel. Delores McQuinn, a Richmond Democrat, introduced legislation in January to create the commission . McQuinn originally proposed allocating $150,000 a year, which was reduced in the conference committee process after her bill was inserted into the budget. She said she would request more funding if needed.\n\nMcQuinn, who will be a member of the commission, said she will seek input from other legislators, historians and families affected by university expansion. She said the commission would address \"how we repair some of the damage that has been done, whether it is through actual dollars, or scholarships or other kinds of ways.\"\n\nShe declined to speculate on whether the governor would veto the commission. Youngkin, a Republican, issued an executive order in 2022 to end the use in K-12 schools of what he called \"inherently divisive concepts,\" including critical race theory, which is more commonly taught in colleges and graduate schools. In a statement Saturday after the legislative session ended, Youngkin said that the legislature \"sent me more than a thousand bills plus backward budgets that need a lot of work,\" and that he would review and decide on them in the next 30 days.\n\nIn the past two decades, prominent universities including Harvard , Yale , Brown and the University of Virginia have issued extensive mea culpas describing their historical involvement with the slave trade and slave owners. In Virginia, a 2021 law required UVA and four other universities that were established before the Civil War and used enslaved laborers to search for descendants and make reparations through scholarships or community-based economic development and memorial programs.\n\nThe 2020 protests over the murder of George Floyd prompted more institutions to reexamine their history of racial injustice. Still, only a few universities have reckoned with the impact of their growth on communities of color. In 2022, Colorado lawmakers allocated $2 million in scholarships for families and descendants of the Auraria community in Denver. The establishment of the University of Colorado at Denver campus in the early 1970s and its subsequent growth displaced 350 families and reduced the predominantly Hispanic neighborhood to just 13 cottages and a grocery store. The scholarship program eliminates fees and tuition for students and families who lived in the community between 1955 and 1973.\n\nIn Athens, Georgia, former residents of the Linnentown neighborhood have sought redress for the taking of their community by eminent domain to develop dormitories for the University of Georgia in the early 1960s. Researchers estimated the property seizures cost Black families $5 million in current dollars, mostly due to underpayment for the land.\n\nCommissioners in Athens-Clarke County, where that university is located, passed a resolution in 2021 urging the state to compensate the roughly 50 displaced families and their descendants. They set aside $2.5 million to build affordable housing and a community center. The University of Georgia, citing a state constitutional ban on voluntary public funding for third parties, has rejected the concept of reparations.\n\nVirginia legislators began discussing redress for uprooted families in response to the ProPublica-VCIJ series and an accompanying documentary film , which both explored how Newport News' all-white city council seized the core of a thriving Black community in and around Shoe Lane by eminent domain in the early 1960s to build Christopher Newport's campus. City leaders wanted to \" erase the Black spot \" near a segregated country club. In the ensuing decades, the school acquired almost all of the remaining homes.\n\nFollowing the first article in the series, Christopher Newport University President William Kelly acknowledged in a message to faculty and staff that the university's progress \"has come at a human cost, and we must continue to learn about and understand our complicated history.\" Kelly, who became president last year, has also said that incoming freshmen will be taught at orientation about the college's origins and evolution. In January, the city of Newport News and CNU announced a task force to review decades of property acquisitions and consider possible redress for displaced families.\n\nChristopher Newport University has declined to comment to ProPublica or VCIJ on the joint local task force or the possible state commission.\n\nOther Virginia state universities that absorbed Black communities have tried to make amends for their history. Old Dominion University's expansion since the early 1960s diminished a once-thriving Black community in Norfolk called Lamberts Point. In the 1990s, the university established scholarships and a jobs program for current neighborhood residents.\n\nA memorial on UVA's campus acknowledges its centuries of mistreatment of Black people both during and after slavery, including employees and local residents. In 2020, UVA President Jim Ryan announced a goal to build as many as 1,500 affordable homes and apartments on property owned by the school and its affiliates. The housing would be open to residents outside the university community.\n\nRead More\n\nWhile the Virginia measure focuses on public universities because they were established by the state, private institutions have their own fraught history. The University of Richmond, for example, acknowledged in 2019 that part of the campus was built on top of a cemetery for enslaved persons. The university is planning a memorial to honor the people buried there.\n\nMcQuinn, the legislation's sponsor, said that she has long been aware of the displacement of Black neighborhoods by universities, but that the ProPublica-VCIJ series spurred her to act. Several supporters of the proposal, including the heads of the statewide and Richmond chapters of the NAACP, attended the Feb. 9 subcommittee hearing in person or online.\n\nOthers submitted comments via the General Assembly's portal. \"I see an opportunity to right the wrongs of the past,\" wrote a Richmond resident identifying himself only as Antoine. He added that the \"pushback\" against studying the history of racial injustice, like the university expansions themselves, is \"reminiscent once again of the erasure of a culture.\"\n\nLouis Hansen contributed reporting.\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Task Force to Consider \"Restorative Justice\" for Black Families Uprooted by Virginia University's Expansion\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with the Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism at WHRO . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nThe city of Newport News, Virginia, and Christopher Newport University are creating a joint task force to reexamine the destruction of a Black neighborhood to make way for the school's campus starting in the 1960s, and recommend possible redress for uprooted families.\n\nThe new commission, announced Monday, will scrutinize four decades of the school's property acquisitions, probing the decisions that led to locating and expanding its campus in the midst of a once-thriving Black community. It will also contact families displaced by Christopher Newport's steady growth to ask what \"restorative justice\" would mean for them, and seek state assistance with potential relief for victims, according to a draft action plan.\n\nThe formation of the task force follows publication of a series by the Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism at WHRO and ProPublica , which revealed that Christopher Newport and other Virginia state universities grew by decimating thriving Black communities. It also documented race-based decision-making by the City Council by locating the school in a Black neighborhood despite having cheaper options and by seizing properties by eminent domain. CNU's expansion has whittled down the Shoe Lane neighborhood in Newport News to just five houses.\n\nIn their announcement, Newport News Mayor Phillip Jones and Christopher Newport University President Bill Kelly said that the task force's goals are to develop a \"comprehensive understanding\" of historical events and to ensure that residents are treated better in the future. \"Understanding and acknowledging our past is important to moving forward in a transparent and thoughtful way. Christopher Newport is committed to this work,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"I was deeply disturbed to know that this happened in our community,\" Jones said. \"I feel a personal obligation to ensure the city speaks to its role in displacing families and disrupting the sense of community in this historic area.\"\n\nThe city will align itself with CNU's plan to boost Black enrollment, according to the draft action plan obtained by VCIJ and ProPublica. Black people make up 44% of Newport News residents but only 8% of Christopher Newport students, down from 17% in 1996, VCIJ and ProPublica reported.\n\nThe announcement marks the latest and one of the broadest efforts in the country by a university and its host city to revisit their role in urban renewal and the disruption of once-stable Black communities. City and school reexamination of the historic displacement of marginalized communities has led to greater recognition of the plight of former residents near the University of Colorado Denver and the University of Georgia in Athens. The Denver university has also established a scholarship fund for descendants of families in the displaced Aurorian community.\n\nBesides municipal and university action, the VCIJ-ProPublica series has also stirred a state legislative response. Delegate Delores McQuinn introduced legislation this month to create a commission to study how Virginia public colleges have uprooted Black communities and to explore routes of redress.\n\nThe first phase of the Newport News and CNU review will examine property records and assessments from 1958 to 1997 to determine whether property owners were properly paid for their land. The task force will also review city and university records, family archives and church documents to identify displaced families and calculate potential compensation, according to the draft action plan.\n\nAdditionally, the working group will survey affected families and consult with historians, lawyers and restorative justice experts. The task force will also suggest changes to the city's policy for using eminent domain to seize properties.\n\nThe city has not released details about how many members would be appointed to the task force, when it would be expected to conclude its work or when findings would be released.\n\nNewport News Vice Mayor Curtis Bethany and CNU Provost Quentin Kidd will co-chair the task force, which is expected to include representatives of the city, the university administration, alumni, students and the community, according to the action plan.\n\nThe ProPublica series detailed how universities have taken advantage of federal funding and court rulings to displace tens of thousands of families of color. A 1959 amendment to the Federal Housing Act gave colleges generous subsidies to join with cities to expand into stable neighborhoods, often by using eminent domain. While these efforts were promoted as ways to revitalize deteriorating neighborhoods, they frequently resulted in the destruction of Black middle-class communities. Christopher Newport and other Virginia state universities grew at the expense of Black neighborhoods.\n\nFollowing the first story in the series , Kelly acknowledged in a message to faculty and staff that the university's progress \"has come at a human cost, and we must continue to learn about and understand our complicated history.\"\n\nKelly also shared the series and a related documentary film with students, faculty and staff, and CNU hosted a panel discussion in November on its history. There, before an overflow crowd, panelists and audience members lashed out at the university. \"A school that's built on land that was taken from Black Americans should be more diverse,\" said panelist Audrey Perry Williams, president of the Hampton Roads Association for the Study of African American Life and History.\n\nAnother panelist, professor Johnny Finn, chair of the Christopher Newport sociology department, floated the idea of reparations for affected families. \"I think we need to think about materially, in addition to the symbolic and the representational, how we deal with this,\" Finn said.\n\nIn 2019, Christopher Newport implemented the Community Captains program, designed to prepare students from Newport News high schools to enter the university and increase enrollment of Black students. Other Virginia universities have taken steps to rectify the historical displacement of marginalized communities caused by their campus expansions. Beginning in the 1960s, Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, took over part of the predominantly Black Lambert's Point neighborhood. ODU has since worked to improve relations with remaining residents by increasing enrollment of students of color and awarding scholarships to residents of Lambert's Point and nearby areas. The University of Virginia, which also dislodged Black residents, appointed two executive commissions to study its historical support for racist policies and has set a goal to create affordable housing for Charlottesville residents on university-owned properties.\n\nAround 1960, the area bounded by Shoe Lane and three other streets was a growing Black middle-class neighborhood. Residents included teachers, dentists, a high school principal and a NASA engineer, and there were plans to develop farmland for additional housing. But an all-white Newport News City Council blocked those plans by seizing the core of the community in 1961 to establish a college. A former Christopher Newport University president said he was told that the goal was to \"erase the Black spot,\" in part because the area was near an all-white country club where city and business leaders gathered. The city paid the homeowners 20% less for the properties than the value set by an independent appraiser, council records show.\n\nEven after the 1960s seizure, Black families continued to live around the perimeter of the college. However, Christopher Newport kept expanding. Between 1987 and 2019, it acquired at least 70 properties in the Shoe Lane area, according to an analysis of real estate records. Contending that the university's expansion hurt their property values, because no one else would want to buy the property, homeowners unsuccessfully sued the university in federal court in 1989.\n\nRead More\n\nPaul Trible, CNU's president from 1996 to 2022, said publicly he wouldn't need to invoke eminent domain. But his administration used it as leverage to force at least one homeowner to sell in 2005, records show. That same year, the school's governing board approved its use for three other properties that Christopher Newport said it ultimately acquired without resorting to eminent domain.\n\nDwayne Johnson, who grew up on Shoe Lane, urged the task force not only to compensate families for underpayments and loss of property value but also to pay them punitive damages. Johnson's great-grandfather purchased 30 acres of land on Shoe Lane in the early 1900s.\n\n\"Do we want reparations? That would be nice,\" Johnson said. \"But do we think it will be meaningful in that it actually is reflective of our losses? I don't know.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Barbados Resists Climate Colonialism in an Effort to Survive the Costs of Global Warming\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis article is a partnership between ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine.\n\nLate on May 31, 2018, five days after she was sworn in as prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley and her top advisers gathered in the windowless anteroom of her administrative office in Bridgetown, the capital, for a call that could determine the fate of her island nation. The group settled into uncomfortable straight-backed chairs around a small mahogany table, staring at framed posters of Barbados' windmills and sugar cane fields. Mottley, who was then 52, can appear mischievous in the moments before her bluntest declarations, but on this evening her steely side showed. She placed her personal cellphone on speaker and dialed a number in Washington for the International Monetary Fund. As arranged, Christine Lagarde, the managing director, answered.\n\nMottley got to the point: Barbados was out of money. It was so broke that it was taking out new loans just to pay the interest on the old ones, even as its infrastructure was coming undone. Soon the nation would have no choice but to declare itself insolvent, instigating a battle with the dozens of banks and creditors that held its $8 billion in debt and triggering austerity measures that would spiral the island into further poverty. There was another way, Mottley said, but she needed Lagarde's help.\n\nMottley, the first woman to lead Barbados, had been working toward this conversation for nearly two years, consulting expert financial and legal advisers to develop a plan that would restructure the country's soaring debts in a way that would free up money to invest in Barbados' economy. Then, nine months before voting day, that plan took on new urgency as two powerful hurricanes ripped through the Caribbean 12 days apart; they missed Barbados, but one of them obliterated nearby Dominica.\n\nIn Mottley's view, that obliteration was \"like a nuclear event.\" It was increasingly clear that climate change would make all the projects that Barbados already could not afford more necessary - and more expensive. The storms revealed that even the most heroic economic planning could be laid to waste in a moment. It was already obvious that every climate crisis was an economic crisis; but going forward, she realized, every economic crisis would effectively be a climate crisis. For Mottley, this meant the money she needed the IMF to help her recoup wasn't just for her people's prosperity but for their survival.\n\nMottley's insistence on speaking directly with Lagarde - she had been pushing for the meeting for nearly a week while Lagarde's office demurred - was an unorthodox way to approach the leader of one of the world's dominant economic institutions. Having descended from two generations of elite politicians, Mottley had learned, though, that important decisions at large organizations are made at the top. Her grandfather was the mayor of Bridgetown; her father served as the country's consul general to the United States. She was groomed at the island's elite girls' academy, Queen's College, and at the private United Nations International School in New York. Beside her in the anteroom was her adviser Avinash Persaud, a close friend since the days when they each studied at the London School of Economics, where she received her law degree in 1986. Persaud, who went on to lead research departments at J.P. Morgan and State Street Bank, was deeply knowledgeable about development finance. The two friends were joined by the principals of a little-known but influential London financial firm called White Oak Advisory - Sebastian Espinosa and David Nagoski - debt experts who had developed a novel contractual clause to protect countries from at least some of the economic consequences of climate-driven catastrophes.\n\nWith Lagarde on the phone, Mottley made her pitch. Barbados, she said, was going to default on the debt it owed to private banks and investors. She wanted Lagarde's support in persuading them to renegotiate its terms. The IMF is both the assessor and the enforcer of global economic policy, the de facto gatekeeper to the world's capital markets. Mottley knew that banks and investors would work with her only if Barbados were participating in a formal IMF program for economic reform - and it had to start immediately.\n\nMottley told Lagarde that Barbados was prepared to do voluntarily what most countries have to be coerced to do: cut its budget and raise taxes. But she needed something in return. With the effects of climate change bearing down on the region, the kind of austerity the IMF demanded from developing nations - slashing the size of government agencies and firing thousands of public employees while auctioning off real estate and other national assets - would no longer work. Mottley wanted Lagarde to endorse an economic program that would still allow her to raise salaries of civil servants, build schools and improve piping and wiring for water and power. \"Before you carry people on a long journey,\" she told Lagarde, \"you have to give them a little breakfast.\"\n\nBarbados, while considered relatively wealthy by World Bank standards, hadn't been able to borrow on the international market since 2013, and it had no capacity to pay for essential programs and projects. The concern was immediate, Mottley explained: Hurricane season was about to begin. The room fell quiet. No one was sure how Lagarde would respond. Would she trust Mottley to spend on Barbados first? Or demand - as the IMF usually did - deference to debtors? Then, as Mottley's advisers recall, came the director's surprising reply: She was extremely supportive of what Mottley was proposing.\n\nThe next day, Mottley declared that Barbados would stop making its payments on the nation's debts. \"Today, my friends, we pry off the hands that have been strangling us,\" she said. Some of the business leaders she had gathered to stand behind her at the lectern winced. The value of Barbados' bonds on the global markets crashed. S&P Global downgraded the island's credit. The country teetered on the edge of financial chaos. With that, Mottley's adventure onto the global stage of financial and climate activism began.\n\nWhat Mottley sought would not be easy. She would have to untangle the relationships connecting the IMF with the financial institutions that invest in countries like Barbados - a global financial system that simultaneously helps and preys upon countries at their moments of greatest need. She would have to challenge the rules of that system and its powerful figures, who often struggle to recognize how climate change is altering the traditional dynamics of debt and development. Mottley would come to see the traps of that system as fundamentally unjust, born from generations of colonial rule. Just as outsiders once pillaged the Caribbean for wealth created by the hands of slaves, investors in those former imperial powers now squeezed former territories for their assets, for access to markets, for interest on loans. And she would have to contend with all of that waiting for the next storm, knowing she governed a dot of land isolated in one of the most vulnerable places on Earth.\n\nFew parts of the planet are as imperiled by the changing climate as the Caribbean's crescent-shaped string of islands. Every summer, the warm waters off the northwest coast of Africa spin off cyclonic systems that hurtle across the Atlantic, reaching the easternmost stretch of these islands - where Barbados stands sentinel. Quick successions like that of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria , the two storms that narrowly missed the island, were supposed to be rare. Now, though, experts believe that global warming could drive a fivefold increase in strong hurricanes, suggesting that hits from Category 4 and 5 storms will become an annual near-certainty.\n\nDroughts , meanwhile, are growing longer and drier, threatening drinking-water supplies and making it difficult to grow food. Barbados, a teardrop-shaped island of 290,000 people, is among the half of Caribbean islands the United Nations already describes as water-scarce , with seawater seeping into its aquifers and rainfall that might drop by as much as 40% by the end of the century. The droughts will lead to wildfires, killing more vegetation and crops. When it does rain, it is projected to rain heavily and all at once, causing precipitous landslides, which will wipe out roads, rip up electrical grids and cut off energy supplies. At the same time, rising and warming seas are eroding shorelines and killing off reefs and fisheries. According to the IMF, roughly two-thirds of the 511 disasters to hit small countries since 1950 have occurred in the Caribbean, taking more than 250,000 lives.\n\nThese islands have another dubious distinction: They carry more debt, relative to the size of their economies, than almost anywhere else on the planet, a fiscal burden that makes it virtually impossible for them to pay for the infrastructure necessary to protect them from the climate disruptions to come. Barbados, which in 2017 had the third-highest debt per capita of any country in the world, was spending 55% of its gross domestic product each year just to pay back debts, much of it to foreign banks and investors, while spending less than 5% on environmental programs and health care.\n\nThis is true beyond the Caribbean too. In poor nations around the world - from the deserts of North Africa to the low-lying islands of the Pacific and the Caribbean - rising sovereign debt is becoming a hidden but decisive aspect of the climate crisis. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, external debt for what are called Small Island Developing States, or SIDS, more than doubled between 2008 and 2021. The IMF projected that three-quarters of emerging-market economies would pay a third or more of their tax revenue just on debt service in 2021. In the zero-sum game of budgets, that means less money for shoring up infrastructure that is already in shambles. A recent analysis by Eurodad, the European debt-and-finance advocacy organization, found that over the last six years, Latin American and Caribbean countries have slashed what they pay on anything non-debt-related by 22%. As Mottley explained to me, \"We always have to put aside debt money first.\"\n\nThe warming planet has turned this into a self-perpetuating cycle: Were it not for the disasters worsened by climate change, much of the region's debt might not exist in the first place. Jamaica's debt, for example, can be tied to the response to Hurricane Gilbert more than three decades ago. Grenada's is in part because of Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Dominica's 2017 loss , relative to its GDP, was the equivalent of a $44 trillion hit to the U.S. economy.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, these climate-driven damages have made it difficult for the Caribbean economies to achieve anything resembling healthy growth. Since 1980, the cumulative cost of disasters has amounted to more than half of a year's worth of total economic product for 14 Caribbean nations. The costs have eclipsed average annual GDP growth in five of them. There are poor countries with more debt, and there are island countries in the Pacific facing more imminent climate threats, but nowhere in the world do the debt and climate vulnerabilities overlap to the extent they do in the Caribbean. Fixing the debt crisis, as Persaud told me, \"isn't about countries mopping up their fiscal discipline. It is that countries on the front line face a different kind of risk. They face wipeout risk.\"\n\nThe IMF could buffer this crisis. Indeed, doing so is arguably its mission. The IMF was formed in 1944 when the soon-to-be victors of World War II met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to build a new economic system for a world devastated by years of war and depression. Its mandate: to stabilize global markets and keep currencies - and debts - predictable. Today 190 member countries pay dues into a pool from which they can borrow in a crisis.\n\nOn balance, the IMF and the World Bank have served their primary function well, steadying economies and offering the reassurance of economic leadership to global markets over many decades. But the fund also became a conduit by which global capital, and the mixed blessings that come with it, flow to the world's poorer nations. Its advisers are the people who dictate the often-painful recalibrations a troubled country must take to crawl back toward economic recovery and regain market trust. It has become one of the most influential, if underappreciated, determiners of climate policy in the world.\n\nThe IMF doesn't lend much money directly - that's the job of the World Bank and other development banks - and it doesn't negotiate between a country and its creditors. But it does draw the boundaries of possibility and policy, and its stamp of approval is an essential prerequisite for other investors, banks and ratings agencies to encourage new projects or lend more money. Should those private contracts fail, the bankers and other buyers know that to some degree, the great international finance institutions stand by ready to help make them whole. An indebted developing country is paralyzed and ostracized without the IMF's stamp of approval, which gains it access to the world's capital markets. And that approval is conditioned on fiscal changes that can carve deeply into the bone of civil society.\n\nFor her entire life, Mottley had watched Barbados painstakingly build itself up as a postcolonial democracy. Now climate change was prying away the nation's - and the whole region's - grip on its destiny. The big institutions capable of aiding Caribbean countries, Mottley could see, leaned too heavily on outdated assumptions and equations. The IMF requires countries to perform within its framework but has been slow to allow that global warming might require the framework to change, only recently beginning to fold some nominal climate risk into its calculations. It continues to hold countries to metrics for success - primarily the ability to keep the ratio of total debt to annual GDP quite low - that many economists say are unrealistic and arbitrary. The IMF has held steadfastly to its doctrine for years, based on its studies of how larger economies, not small ones, function. But a doctrine that demands austerity often only increases a country's vulnerability to climate threats. \"There's an orthodoxy as to what is acceptable, and what can be sustained,\" Mottley said.\n\nBy declaring nations like Barbados too rich to qualify for development aid, the World Bank - which effectively puts IMF policy into practice - has relegated them to economic purgatory. The bank has folded climate risk into a range of climate-related aid and disaster-finance programs, but it still does not formally consider a country's specific climate risk when it evaluates eligibility for its discounted development loans.\n\nThen, by failing to fully account for how the exceptional costs of climate change affect national wealth, the IMF and the World Bank have wound up driving countries in need toward profit-reaping hedge funds and banks, to borrow billions of dollars, often at credit-card-like interest rates.\n\nThroughout, the debts have been collected. They were collected as the shadow of the 2008 financial crisis lingered and as a pandemic decimated tenuous health care systems and tourist-reliant economies. They continue to be collected despite a climate crisis that is caused almost entirely by the copious fossil fuels that those same powerful creditor nations burned to industrialize and achieve their own wealth, the very wealth that undergirds the IMF. Caribbean nations are being asked, in a sense, to pay not only their own debts but the rest of the world's debts, too, for all the progress it made while leaving the Caribbean behind.\n\nMottley's ascent seemed inevitable to some Barbadians - one childhood friend said that at 12, she promised she would be prime minister - but not to all. Even after she earned her law degree at 21, her father urged her toward private practice. Why would Mia, the oldest of four siblings, a girl who loved music and for a while even managed a reggae band, want to wade into the island's internecine politics? \"Horses for courses,\" Mottley told me recently, using the British phrase suggesting that everyone has a purpose in life. Her mother was the real politician. \"Mommy would tell us all along that you all and your father are lawyers, but I am the law,\" she said. It was her mother who \"sees people, she hears people, she feels people.\" That became Mottley's creed. As prime minister, she is often seen at food trucks and is known as Mia to cabdrivers and reporters.\n\nMottley was first elected to Barbados' Parliament in 1994. She was the youngest Barbadian ever appointed to a ministerial position and has served as both the country's attorney general and its minister of economic affairs. Since 2008, she has twice headed the Barbados Labour Party. Her 2018 election was a landslide, with the party taking all 30 seats in the country's lower Parliament.\n\nShe told me once that one of her great regrets was not being around to fight for Barbados' independence in 1966. The country's first prime minister, Errol Barrow, was a family friend, and Mottley grew up steeped in his belief that it was the responsibility of the island's government to use its resources to lift up, educate and house its citizens. She also shared Barrow's indignation about Barbados' past. The island, first claimed by King James I of England, was importing slaves from Africa as early as 1625, receiving thousands of people from Guyana and the Gold Coast and using them up - their life expectancy once on Barbados was less than 10 years - to produce sugar. When the British Parliament passed the act that abolished slavery in its territories in 1833, it paid white slave owners 20 million pounds to compensate them for the loss of their property, even as it required the kidnapped Africans to provide four additional years of free labor as \"apprentices.\"\n\n\"It goes further,\" Mottley told me. The British rulers then told its freed slaves that if they didn't continue to work, they couldn't live on the plantations that made up most of the 166-square-mile island, \"the master and servant land.\" That arrangement continued for many decades, extending the system of sugar and exploitation that powered the modernization of Britain and its boom in banking, shipping and insurance. Along the way some 250,000 Black Barbadians died.\n\nAs it turns out, Mottley says, she didn't miss the rebellion after all. \"My belly full but me hungry,\" she intoned one afternoon, recalling Bob Marley. \"A hungry mob is an angry mob.\" Her point was that the stakes for Barbados and the Caribbean are still high and the dynamics the same: The region's 45 million people still have little voice and are easy to forget, and as the Caribbean becomes increasingly unlivable, it could become a source of potential destabilization - and mass migration - right at America's door.\n\nFor at least a decade before Mottley was elected, a mixture of poor management and corruption had eroded the country's economy. As Barbados' former central bank governor DeLisle Worrell described it to me, the country had developed a \"dysfunctional\" fiscal culture in which government agencies and departments took loans and negotiated deals without consulting the central bank, accumulating sprawling debt and a backlog of need. On the touristed southern end of the island, sewage erupted from neglected pipes as funding to fix them lagged. The country's response was to print more money and borrow more from abroad, to stanch the economic bleeding. In 2013, during Worrell's term, Barbados took one of the largest commercial loans in its history - $150 million - from Credit Suisse at 7% interest; within a year, it had grown to $225 million, and by 2018, the interest on the balance was 12%. The money didn't last, and the sewer lines weren't fixed. It would be the last commercial loan Barbados could get. Running a consistent deficit, the country began drawing down its foreign reserves to service the loans. By the time of the 2018 election, the government was nearly broke, its reserves having dwindled to enough for just 28 days.\n\nThe people of Barbados did not choose Mottley - or her Barbados Labour Party - over its rival by a margin of 3-to-1 because their political philosophies were substantively different. They were not; both are center left. Nor was the vote driven by people thinking Mottley would challenge the global finance system or solve climate change. The vote was for fiscal competence.\n\nClimate change was only a small part of the fiscal morass, but it was a big part of what could keep Barbados from ever clawing out. As Mottley plotted how to escape the fiscal spiral, she met repeatedly with European climate scientists who helped bring into focus how everything from the island's housing stock to its coral reefs would determine how habitable Barbados would be in the future. Along with restructuring the country's debt, Mottley laid out a plan, called Roofs to Reefs, to restore the island's physical and ecological infrastructure. But it was going to take money - a lot of it. Mottley thought she could work her way to the heights of global finance to gather that money. She wasn't the first to try it, and she didn't know how hard a climb that would soon prove to be.\n\nThe IMF's education in the economic threat of climate change began with Hurricane Ivan in 2004. It was heading straight for Barbados but veered south and instead hit Grenada, another former British colony, as a Category 3 storm; it damaged most of the structures on the island, including 73 of the country's 75 schools. Four-fifths of Grenada's power grid was knocked out, along with most of its nutmeg trees, virtually eliminating a key export for years. The total damages topped $800 million. Aid did come; the World Bank disbursed $20 million almost immediately. Grenada, already heavily indebted before the storm, still plunged into a deep recession. In December 2004, it missed its first payment, entering what Standard & Poor's termed \"selective default.\" Then, seven months later, another hurricane struck.\n\nIn the IMF's view, Grenada could not sustain its debts , and that judgment gave cover for the country to renegotiate with the banks and foreign governments that it owed. The IMF's assessment came at the usual price, though. Grenada agreed to slash its federal payroll - the government was the largest employer on the island - as well as sell off assets and privatize agencies, all toward the goal of reducing its debt.\n\nAs the IMF sees it, reducing debt is the recipe for financial stability. But in the climate era, stability also requires enormous spending. Grenada needed sea walls to protect its towns against ocean surges and retaining walls to keep its mountainous roads from collapsing. It needed to harden the country for worse storms and droughts to come. And immediately after Ivan, it needed a place to send its children and its sick. So the government spent a part of its budget on new schools and hospitals and roads. But when Grenada missed its fiscal targets, the IMF instead blamed the country's \"capital expenditure overruns\" for its \"fiscal slippages.\" From then on, according to a 2007 staff report, the IMF wanted Grenada to pay off its debts to outside investors first.\n\n\"The IMF always blames the countries,\" says Timothy Antoine, director of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank and Grenada's permanent secretary in the Ministry of Finance during the hurricanes. Focusing on debt alone was \"absolutely ludicrous,\" a sign that the fund was still unprepared to acknowledge the extreme effect that a catastrophic event had on a country's finances. Grenada had cut its budget and increased its revenues but watched its economy crumble and its poverty explode anyway. Lack of fiscal discipline alone could not account for the country's troubles, and it wanted the support of the most powerful global institutions in finding a solution.\n\nOver time, the IMF did begin to recognize the importance of preparing for the economic shock that climatic changes could bring - by 2014, several of its Grenada reports mentioned it. Still, connecting the risk to the consequence of default appears to have been too great a leap. Climate change was not even identified as a cause or risk factor when the IMF released its post-mortem on Grenada's restructuring in 2017, suggesting that it had few methods for quantifying how environmental pressures might affect debt or the pace of its repayment. What was discussed was political instability and rising interest rates, not faltering agricultural exports or rising heat. \"They only have a hammer,\" says Daniel Munevar, a former senior analyst for Eurodad now with the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development.\n\nIn June 2014, as Grenada again approached insolvency, Antoine gathered civic and religious leaders in the second-story meeting room of a Catholic church overlooking Grand Anse Beach to plot a different approach. Grenada's leaders wanted a mechanism that could protect them against repeating the same fate when another climate catastrophe hit. But the IMF staff weren't sure how to put a value on the chance of a catastrophe and how to measure something that hadn't even happened yet. A breakthrough came from White Oak Advisory - the consultants Grenada had hired.\n\nEspinosa, the firm's co-founder, had long seen how wealthy countries pushed exotic insurance products as the fix to protect against high risk. But it occurred to him that insurance, which is designed to protect against unlikely calamities, was a poor match for the grim certainties of the climate crisis. He thought instead about how debt and equity contracts often have triggers that change the terms when parties aren't confident about their risk. What if debt relief were to be triggered by a storm? It could guarantee that Grenada would be protected when the next climate catastrophe arrived.\n\nWhite Oak constructed a contract clause that would automatically grant Grenada a reprieve from payments on much of its commercial debt if another hurricane hit the island, introducing a new tool for managing sovereign debt crises in a climate-plagued region.\n\nAs Mottley began to shepherd Barbados through its own insolvency, Grenada's experience taught her that success would depend on her ability to use the IMF to her advantage. If she failed, Barbados risked being recolonized, this time financially. Moreover, when it came to facing off against the country's creditors, Mottley didn't just want a discount on her debts. She wanted the one thing she'd learned would begin to make her public debt resilient to the shocks of climate change - Barbados' own hurricane clause.\n\nAfter Mottley announced that Barbados would default on its debts, the IMF wasn't the main obstacle to restructuring them; instead, it was the financial institutions that held the debts. It might stand as a mystery how anyone thinks he or she can make money off the tribulations of a group of tiny countries. But impoverished Caribbean islands have delivered wealth to larger powers for centuries, and today is no exception. Before, it was risky commodity ventures that made great fortunes. Now it is increasingly the risk itself. Traffickers in debt offer money that is desperately needed. By taking on the risk that these tiny nations will default, they profit handsomely - and if the risk gets to be too high, they can pass the debt on at a discount to more adventurous investors. That's the nature of finance. But the climate crisis is raising the risks considerably, and in so doing, it is once again binding the destiny of these fragile nations to the speculative will of faraway powers. Postcolonialism barely had a chance to take hold before it gave way to climate colonialism.\n\nWhen in 2018 Mottley told Barbados' creditors that she did not intend to pay them, she and her team had a plan. The country owed approximately $8 billion, much of it to Barbadian banks owned by Canadian institutions like Scotiabank and CIBC, but nearly $1 billion of the total was owed to global financial firms, including Credit Suisse, the investment-management firm Pimco and a Morgan Stanley subsidiary called Eaton Vance. Her goal - drawn up in collaboration with the IMF - was to reduce Barbados' total debt load by a third within 15 years. She needed to persuade her creditors to take what's known as \"a haircut,\" reducing what they were owed, in this case by roughly a third. The old bonds would be exchanged for new ones at a lower interest rate. It was essential that a hurricane clause be included, too.\n\nOn the other side of the negotiations was a young, ambitious investment manager out of Boston named Federico Sequeda. A portfolio manager in emerging markets for Eaton Vance, Sequeda was accustomed to buying sovereign-debt stakes in places like Vietnam and Brazil. The mutual funds he oversaw held large positions in Barbados' bonds. Sequeda, for one, would take umbrage at the suggestion that emerging-markets investors are predatory. Clearly, these developing countries need capital to function, he points out. Nobody is willing to donate that capital, and so accessing it - just like every other service purchased in the world - comes at a price. Ideally, there is sufficient transparency of motive and transaction so that the exchange can be a win for both sides.\n\nIn the run-up to Mottley's election, Sequeda had flown down to the island to meet with Worrell, the former central bank chief, to get a pulse on the changes foreign investors could expect should she be elected. Still, he was caught off guard by both the sweep of Mottley's plan and her determination to execute it. The creditors thought that Barbados could pay more and that the country was using the IMF's cooperation to leverage lower payments. They were neither versed in nor particularly concerned with climate change as a unique risk to their investments. The notion that a hurricane clause might be imposed on funds that firms sold to their clients as less volatile than other investments was untenable. Sequeda didn't think climate change - or the invention of a debt instrument to address it - was his business or responsibility. \"We're not really set up to analyze the probability of a climate-type risk taking place, and we don't really think we're actually the investors who want to be taking on that risk,\" he told me.\n\nThe problem was that Sequeda and others already had huge exposure to climate risk. Commercial banks and private investors now hold approximately $54 trillion, or more than half, of the total global sovereign debt in emerging markets, linking themselves to the fate of the world's poorest countries in what the Institute of International Finance warns is \"a vicious circle of interdependency.\"\n\nComplicating matters is that only part of that total debt is publicly known. Bloomberg records, for example, show that before Mottley's default, Barbados had at least 30 outstanding bonds and loans worth more than $1 billion, at interest rates as high as 12%. Eurodad examined another financial trading database for The New York Times, looking at bonds in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Belize and Suriname - four countries with bonds issued in U.S. or European currencies - and found foreign commercial debt worth nearly $10 billion. The records show that almost every major bank and investment house has a stake in these countries. BlackRock, for example, held $840 million in Dominican bonds as of January 2021. Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup have all held bonds in the countries, some at exorbitant interest rates. Jamaica, for one, recently owed some $208 million to J.P. Morgan Chase at 11.6%.\n\nAlmost certainly this is only a glimpse of a bigger and murkier picture. Eurodad researchers estimate that a vast majority of holdings - about 75% - is private debt that cannot be identified. It is obscured by the contracts that funds and equity groups make with governments, which are not required to be disclosed. Sometimes, Persaud said, even governments aren't sure to whom they are beholden. Or, as one sovereign-debt lawyer once joked, the only reliable way for a country to identify the holders of its bonds is to stop paying.\n\nThe lack of transparency raises fundamental questions about the fairness of default negotiations and the inability of the people most endangered by the debt-climate collision to hold their governments - and their creditors - accountable. In many cases, creditors can sue countries, but countries have difficulty suing back, leaving citizens even more exposed. Over the past two decades, according to Eurodad , half of sovereign debt restructurings have led to litigation, often forcing higher payments than a country can afford.\n\nThe most aggressive litigators are found within an ecosystem of hedge-fund investors, sometimes called vulture funds, that wait for the most vulnerable moment to buy distressed debt cheaply and then flip it for a profit, often by resisting any sort of restructuring or renegotiation. In 2008, NML Capital, a subsidiary of Elliott Management, a hedge fund, bought a discounted stake in Argentina's pre-default debt and then pursued a relentless legal strategy for repayment - at one point having an Argentine Navy ship seized off the coast of Ghana. It earned its money back and then some when Argentina issued a new bond deal. A fund called Aurelius Capital Management similarly bought up Puerto Rico's debt, then argued in court that the island had to repay the fund before it could finance other projects, including hurricane preparedness. That case was dismissed.\n\nIn late 2018, Persaud received an email stating that a Connecticut hedge fund called Greylock Capital had bought an undisclosed portion of Barbados' debt, and with it, a seat at the table among its creditors. The email, as Persaud recalled, warned that \"they could take us to court.\" But Greylock's interest offered an opportunity. A distressed-debt fund also doesn't need to recoup the same value that Sequeda did to make its profit, because it bought the bonds for a lower cost. Greylock might be able to drive down Sequeda's price, helping Mottley get the terms she wanted.\n\nFrom almost the start, the disaster clause Mottley sought was a sticking point. Her team would write up a lengthy proposal, always with a natural-disaster clause among Barbados' demands. The creditors' committee routinely would remove it. Mottley, patient, held out.\n\nThe clause White Oak designed wouldn't reduce Barbados' debt directly. But by suspending payments, it provided immediate access to funds in the aftermath of a calamity and shifted payment to the back end of the term. It would avoid disorderly default and keep Barbados, in the event of a catastrophe, at the table. The investors, though, didn't buy it. Some of them, Persaud says, sharpened their tactics, telling reporters that Barbados was slow-walking its economic repair. The Financial Times reported that some creditors found White Oak's $27 million fee to be \"absurd.\" Then, Sequeda and the creditors' committee went to Washington and lobbied the IMF, demanding that it require Barbados to set aside a larger annual surplus - in essence, to free more cash to repay its debt faster.\n\nThe IMF maintains it kept the creditors at arm's length. But sometime soon after, according to Persaud, its mission chief on the Barbados deal, Bert van Selm, grew impatient for the government to settle - even if it meant the hurricane clause would be lost. \"I said, 'Bert, are you trying to pressure us into a debt restructuring?'\" Persaud told me. He says van Selm replied that the IMF needed the restructuring to be finished. Alejandro Werner, though, the IMF's former director for the Western Hemisphere, is more direct about what occurred. For months, he says, he struggled to keep the IMF's internal departments aligned so that Barbados' program could succeed. But the more Mottley delayed, the more the pieces threatened to come apart. Some of the IMF staff thought Barbados was \"being very obnoxious in asking for the natural-disaster clause,\" he told me. \"Everybody was kind of like: 'OK, we're so close. Let's just close.'\"\n\nOne day in early 2019, with the negotiations at an impasse, Persaud flew to New York for a private meeting with Sequeda. For nearly a year, the two sides had been in a stalemate. In person it was different. They sat for coffee at the luxurious Mandarin Oriental hotel, with views over Central Park and Midtown Manhattan. Sequeda, who was unyielding in previous meetings, softened. His father-in-law and Persaud's father were both from Guyana. Persaud, once a Wall Street executive himself, could talk Sequeda's talk. Sequeda wanted to make sure the new bonds would be large enough for him to easily sell his stake later on - something made more likely if the bond met the $500 million threshold to be listed on the J.P. Morgan emerging-market index. Persaud, of course, wanted the disaster clause. \"He kept saying liquidity,\" Persaud said. \"I kept saying disaster clause.\"\n\nA few months later, the agreement was signed. There would be a fund of roughly $530 million. Barbados received a 26% reduction in its debt, enough to - at least temporarily - drop its interest payments from 7% of its economy to 3% and free up more than $500 million a year. And it received its disaster protection, making Barbados the largest issuer of bonds with hurricane clauses in the world.\n\nIt was a tremendous victory for Mottley and Persaud, but soon afterward, two things happened to remind them just how precarious life on an island can be: The COVID-19 pandemic struck, and a relatively modest storm rolled over the country.\n\nThe July 2, 2021, forecast was for blustery rains, but not extreme by Caribbean standards. As the winds picked up in Bridgetown around 7:15 a.m., Sandra Clarke made up some peanut butter on biscuits for breakfast. Clarke had worked as a stenographer for the Health Ministry. She liked Mottley - \"She's down to earth.\" When the IMF terms spurred the Barbados government to cut roughly 1,000 jobs, Clarke was among those let go. It hurt her finances, but she still felt that Mottley was acting in Barbadians' best interests. That morning, the howling grew louder, and the rain came harder. A tearing sound made Clarke look up - there was a gap where a wall and the ceiling met. \"Run!\" her son shouted. \"I can see the sky.\"\n\nMonths later, I met Clarke where she was staying, a government-run emergency shelter in an 18th-century stone seminary overlooking the eastern shore of the island. The good news, she told me, was that the government planned to rebuild her home. The bad news was that progress had been slow, and the house remained a series of dilapidated courtyards, with a yellow dumpster in the front yard filled with soggy mattresses and splintered wood.\n\nThree years after Mottley identified climate change as Barbados' preeminent threat, and three years into her effort to restructure its economy to better prepare for that threat, the country still hadn't been able to address one of its highest priorities: shoring up vulnerable, poorly built housing. The storm, called Elsa, which barely ranked as a Category 1 hurricane, happened to fall just short of the catastrophe level that would trigger the country's hurricane debt relief. It was, however, the kind of routine challenge the government should be able to withstand. Indeed, Clarke had gone to the government a year earlier to apply for a program that would have fixed up her house, but the waiting list was long and the funding short.\n\nThe dollars that might have saved Clarke's home were instead used to amass a surplus that the government had promised the IMF. Mottley had reduced the public work force and raised all sorts of taxes to ballast the government's balance sheet. All of this was done for the sake of two metrics by which the IMF still judged a country's success: How much savings could the government set aside, and how quickly could it reduce the ratio of its debt to its GDP? To critics like Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, these metrics weren't fit to the task, and meeting them was proving to be more than Barbados could bear.\n\nAs a key condition of its IMF program , Barbados agreed to produce a surplus of 6% of its GDP each year. Because government revenues - from taxes and fees - were dependent on how well the nation's economy performed, this assumed that it would grow at a rate it had not in years, if ever, an expectation that several economists described as unrealistic, even cruel. Van Selm, the IMF's mission chief for Barbados at the time, defends the number. \"It can be done,\" he told me. The IMF, meanwhile, held Barbados to its second critical measure: It would have to use much of that surplus to slash its debt levels until the debt made up just 60% of the nation's GDP.\n\nThese are metrics that looked great in the textbooks of global economics schools in the 1960s, but they are not the measure by which the ruling economies of the world are judged today. Japan's economy is doing fine with a debt ratio of 258%, and the United States has a ratio of 150% - both countries, Mottley said, that \"did everything that they tell us traditionally not to do.\" The 60% ratio, in particular, requires extreme austerity. \"It's a little bit of a matter of theology rather than economics,\" Persaud told me. He and many others believe that it's not the total amount of debt that matters, but to whom it is owed and how much it costs to carry. Development aid, for example, is often delivered as extremely low-interest loans. Should that count the same as high-interest debts to hedge funds? \"It's become a fetish,\" Persaud said.\n\nAs small nations accumulate substantial debt because of climate change, which they neither caused nor benefited from causing, it raises even larger questions. Should those countries be penalized again for carrying that debt on their balance sheets, even as investors - in the purest distillation of climate colonialism - profit from that debt? Should there not at least be an allowance in IMF policy that distinguishes between climate-caused expenses and other, normal governing expenses?\n\nWhen she was elected, Mottley thought she could work within the IMF's system - that it could be flexible enough to let her whittle away at the drastic needs her country faced. A year after the negotiations were complete, though, she was beginning to see this was an illusion. That was when the COVID pandemic kneecapped Barbados' tourism industry. Government revenues plummeted, the country's surplus flipped into a 2% deficit and its debt started to rise again. The IMF cut Barbados a break when the pandemic hit, lowering its surplus target, but only temporarily. As the free-fall continued into 2021, the IMF announced that it would soon push Barbados toward its 6% target surplus once again, with van Selm saying that he was \"pretty sure that tourism in Barbados will bounce back.\" If the IMF's goal was to support Mottley in building resilience to shock - climate as well as economic - its policies seemed to be having the opposite effect. The fund's insistence on building a surplus was instead putting Barbados in a holding pattern, effectively sidetracking climate priorities.\n\nWhy? One reason, according to current and former staff members I spoke to, was that some groups within the IMF still didn't think that accounting for climate change was essential to their work. Lagarde, who declined to be interviewed for this article, was sympathetic to Mottley's climate fears, says Mark Plant, a 24-year veteran of policymaking at the IMF who now runs a finance division at the Center for Global Development, but during her tenure the fund made few strides on the issue. Then, in 2019, Kristalina Georgieva, a Bulgarian environmental economist, came from the World Bank to direct the IMF. Climate issues were trending politically, \"and so she has pushed it quite hard,\" Plant said. The same year, Alejandro Werner and Krishna Srinivasan, then the IMF's deputy director for the Western Hemisphere, wrote a policy paper that for the first time laid out a broad philosophy for incorporating climate risk into the fund's analytical framework. It suggested that in the future the IMF should lead countries into considering climate costs and make its support conditioned on it. Implementing those intentions has proved complicated, though. \"The fund,\" Plant says, is still \"struggling to fund the right levers.\"\n\nOne problem, according to Aldo Caliari, who heads policy and strategy at Jubilee USA , an interfaith group active in development finance, is that the organization is still trying to build the staff and expertise it needs to grasp the fiscal impact of the climate threat. Sometimes, its efforts have appeared borderline disingenuous. A few years back, for example, the IMF began advising countries to build a climate reserve fund made up of roughly 1% of their GDP to help pay for disaster recovery. But that, say analysts of IMF policy like the U.N.'s Munevar, basically is asking struggling countries to not use money that they could spend to prevent a disaster - so that they can use it to mop up afterward instead.\n\nThe IMF, through the official statements it offered for this article, says that climate change is \"now in the DNA\" of the institution and that it is acting aggressively on the issue. \"The IMF is a learning institution,\" a fund spokesman said. \"We recognized the need for change in recent years and are moving fast on that journey.\"\n\nThe fund points to the paper Srinivasan and Werner wrote in 2019, which called for new mechanisms, like the hurricane clauses Grenada and Barbados enacted, to create fiscal breathing room for countries to pay for climate impacts. It presented a vision for the future in which climate issues rise to such prominence within the organization that climate planning becomes a central criterion for IMF approval.\n\nBy 2022, the fund had made some headway. Among other efforts, it and the World Bank have both begun to help countries either self-insure against disaster or secure discounted institutional financing before a catastrophe happens. The two organizations are running a pilot program in six vulnerable countries to assess their climate-change policies. For low-income countries, the IMF now requires the economic shock of a disaster - though not the gradual and corrosive trends of climate change - to be considered in its analysis of debt. Most recently, in April, the IMF announced the creation of a new, $45 billion resilience trust, some of which is likely to head to Barbados. Mottley, for her part, says she has found the IMF increasingly attuned to her country's needs.\n\nStill, when in late 2020 Eurodad looked for evidence that the climate-change policies were rising to prominence within the IMF, it found little. Researchers examined 80 IMF programs around the world and found that climate was central to the fund's assessment in only one country - Samoa. Critics and insiders both observe that a sense of urgency is still missing. \"Eventually\" the IMF will have to figure out how to better incorporate climate vulnerability, Werner told me. \"I mean, we're still advancing on that.\"\n\nOne evening in January, I visited Persaud at his home atop a neighborhood called Beacon Hill. Winding up his short, steep drive, I parked in front of a set of broad concrete steps with views over Bridgetown. Persaud came to the porch dressed casually, in a light blue button-down and slacks. We headed toward his backyard, where two friends, Barbadians visiting from the United States, sat among trees on a short-cropped lawn.\n\nMuch had happened in the previous few months. In November, Mottley announced that Barbados would cast off Queen Elizabeth as the country's titular head of state and declare itself the world's newest republic, then called for a snap election, which she won handily. The mood was light; the next day, a new government would swear allegiance to its own country for the first time. Persaud poured a glass of California cabernet while his guests told stories about Mottley from high school.\n\nThen Persaud got serious, returning to Barbados' precarious future. \"We cannot do this just through debt, even if there were no limits,\" he said. Nor could any country in the Caribbean - or, for that matter, any vulnerable country in the world - survive the climate crisis by borrowing more money. No amount of economic growth would ever be enough, either. The deeper he and Mottley got into their economic reeducation, he said, the clearer it became that a just future for people in small, front-line countries would require a radical shift in how the IMF and the World Bank applied their resources.\n\nFor years, Persaud has been at Mottley's side, answering midnight text messages, tuning her fiscal options, looking five chess moves ahead, innovating ways to fix the region's fiscal crisis even as her star rose through international speeches and she worked to raise the issue of sovereign debt from an obscure cause to a global climate concern. When Mottley talks about economics, it's partly her thinking - she is indisputably the boss and has a striking fluency in policy minutiae - but almost always partly his, too. He writes many of those speeches. If Mottley is the decisive leader, Persaud is the fount of possible solutions, churning out or delving into economic innovations he thinks might save the world.\n\nThere are the hurricane clauses, catastrophe bonds, \"blue bonds\" - which designate money just for ocean conservation - and a trendy new category called debt-for-climate swaps. The list goes on, Persaud said. The problem isn't lack of ideas. It's how to scale them so they can have measurable effects.\n\nLately, he had been focused on a new plan that would draw on two pools of money. The IMF directly controls nearly $1 trillion worth of member reserves, which it can distribute to members using what it calls \"special drawing rights\" and mostly holds for some larger emergency. Surely the climate crisis counted as an emergency. The IMF could use its internal drawing rights and expand the availability of 0% loans to help fund the kinds of adaptation efforts that the United Nations estimates will soon cost as much as $500 billion annually. Doing so would require changing a lot of rules, particularly about who qualifies for that funding and how it is earmarked. The IMF's new Resiliency and Sustainability Trust - a catchall for everything from climate mitigation to pandemic costs - is a start, but only just that. \"It's about 10 times too small,\" Persaud said.\n\nPersaud's plan has an even more costly and ambitious element: addressing mitigation, which Morgan Stanley estimates will cost $50 trillion globally over the next 27 years. IMF members hold $13 trillion in national reserves. Persaud proposes using 1% of that larger pool to seed an enormous new climate trust that would attract outside investment for emissions-slashing projects. The trust could make seed loans at a nominal interest rate and target those loans to specific development projects, keeping the debt off governments' balance sheets - and excluded from debt-ratio calculations. Persaud thinks that funding could attract perhaps another $2.5 trillion in annual investments from banks and equity funds. That, finally, would be big money.\n\nAs expensive as these plans may sound, they are likely to save money and ultimately pay for themselves. According to Colin Young, executive director of the regional Caribbean Community Climate Change Center, for every dollar spent on climate resilience, six dollars are saved in recovery efforts. Not doing anything, researchers at Tufts University found, will allow costs to mount so much that they will subsume today's Caribbean economies even without the shock of devastating storms. By 2050, the researchers wrote, the costs of inaction will amount to 10% of the region's total economic activity - a fiscal death sentence.\n\nIt is possible that none of the approaches that Persaud argues for will ever be enough. But the IMF is increasingly aware that the scale of the problem requires solutions that are antithetical to the old way of thinking. One person close to the IMF's highest levels of policymaking told me that some of the countries facing the most intense climate peril will never be able to pay back what they owe. \"They're going to require complete debt forgiveness, and some bit of austerity around the edges is not going to change that,\" he said. \"The order of magnitude of the problem is just too big.\"\n\nPersaud, like virtually everyone I spoke to, is hesitant to talk about erasing sovereign debt. After all that Barbados has been through, he would still prefer to work within the global finance system. \"I know we don't want to create the moral hazard of giving away money for free,\" he says. Besides, global institutions can forgive only their own loans. Because most of the debt is now held by commercial investors, it stands to reason that to receive relief from them, the development banks or other large economies would have to be willing to pay those investors back.\n\nThere is an argument to be made, though, that the loss of the money owed is a minimal price in the context of the profit that has been made, and that there is justice to this form of mercy. BlackRock, for example, is now among the largest holders of Barbados' publicly traded debt, having purchased large blocks of it once Sequeda and the creditors settled. Consider what BlackRock, which is also the largest global financier of the oil-and-gas industry, has earned directly from the processes that have caused climate warming.\n\nIn a capitalist society, it is fair to ask why anyone should get anything free. But Barbados and the countries of the Caribbean are paying a tangible price now in lives and in dollars because of the emissions of wealthier nations. Perhaps the suggestion that lenders forgive debt isn't about kindness but about obligation - about seeing it as a kind of back tax that they owe to society and to front-line societies, in particular.\n\nThroughout the winter, the pressure mounted on Mottley. The IMF's three-year program was drawing to a close, and the fund was still insisting that Barbados would have to swing back toward 6% budget surpluses by 2024 - or else it would lose access to promised funding, as well as the credibility that would allow it to borrow from markets in the future. The IMF announced this while Barbados' economy continued to struggle and while COVID still raged, and so Mottley, perhaps approaching the end of her patience, raged too.\n\nI reached Mottley one afternoon at her house on the beach, a home where she had spent time since she was a little girl. She arrived for our video call late, delayed by a stop she made across the island at a water-pumping station, where she had gone to assure locals that the government would fix its 70-year-old cast-iron foundation. It was the sort of thing, the most basic thing, that her government was managing to address in these difficult budgetary times - but only barely.\n\nShe sat on an outdoor sofa, her laptop on her knees, the camera close to her face in the way we have all grown accustomed to in the era of Zoom. It was the second of our three interviews over the course of the past year, and she began by telling me about the beach in front of her house. It used to teem with spiny sea urchins. \"As a child, I stepped on more cobblers than I would like to recall,\" she said. \"Now you can walk, you don't see anything.\" The beach itself was eroding, her house edging into the rising sea.\n\nIn four years, Mottley had become a leader not just for Barbados but effectively for dozens of Caribbean countries, many with populations smaller than a midsize American city, all of which had to face these global institutional juggernauts by themselves. In 2018, she excoriated the United Nations General Assembly - \"For us, it is about saving lives. For others, it is about saving profits\" - in a speech about the forgotten countries on the climate front lines. She spoke, in 2021, at the opening of the 26th annual U.N. Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, in which she pointedly accused the developed world of hypocrisy, asking, \" When will our leaders lead? \" Since 2008, she pointed out, the G20 nations had spent $25 trillion printing new money to juice their own stalling economies, money they could have used to prevent the worst of the climate crisis instead. That failure \"will allow the path of greed and selfishness to sow the seeds of our common destruction,\" she said. She left the conference holding hands with President Joe Biden.\n\nAll that access to leaders like Lagarde, Georgieva and Biden gave Barbados an advantage over other Caribbean countries - an advantage Mottley was happy to leverage but which meant that even Barbados' modest successes might be unrealistic for its regional peers. \"We are unequally yoked,\" she said. If there was any consolation, it was that the IMF itself finally appeared to be attaching action on climate to its reputation. Thanks to Mottley's efforts, Barbados had become a showcase for the IMF, a way to prove it could be agile on climate issues, too.\n\nBarbados, though, was still being measured against the antiquated convention of its ratio of debt to GDP, which happened to be growing as the pandemic and war unsettled markets. How could the IMF still want the budget to swing back into surplus? Mottley found it infuriating. \"I can't do these things if I have to spend money on augmenting water supply because of the climate crisis,\" she said.\n\nSuddenly it seemed as if all of it had become a treadmill exercise. The efforts to win a disaster clause - a clause that the Inter-American Development Bank has now made standard for its loans in the Caribbean. The deep thinking and brainstorming of bigger solutions. The climate swaps to exchange debt-service fees for ecological upgrades. And so on. Maybe her goal hadn't been big enough. Maybe it wasn't about finding more money in the current system but about changing the system altogether. \"I'm saying the same things over and over, over and over,\" Mottley told me. \"You begin to feel as though you're going crazy.\"\n\nIn March, Mottley was scheduled to give a speech at the World Trade Organization. She has two rules for capitalizing on her high-profile public appearances: Always make a big ask, and never leave the podium without offering a solution. Persaud set to writing the speech, but this time felt different. Neither he nor Mottley was confident that trade helped solve the big problems of the world. It seemed to make them worse.\n\nFor Mottley, the fact that Britain was swimming in vaccine doses for months while Barbados had to beg China for a few thousand vials was a prime example. The politics of the pandemic had erased Mottley's inhibitions about dealing more straightforwardly with the climate crisis, too. The World Trade Organization couldn't protect against pandemics. It couldn't preserve peace in Europe. It couldn't fix climate change. Mottley would now disavow the current global financial system in its entirety, because it was still, at its heart, a colonial system, a system of oppression.\n\nLately, she told me, she had been thinking a lot about the idea of reparations, and about how Barbadians have struggled, and how far they had come. The horrific paradox, of course, was that after the British banned slavery, they did pay reparations - just not to the victims of the crime. At every step, Mottley reflected, freedom had come incrementally for Barbadians. Or rather, the oppression had found new, seemingly more benign forms. First, it was the decadeslong work-for-land scheme. Later, it was their beaches and banks - almost all of which are foreign-owned. And after that, it was their cash, in the form of interest. What more was there to give?\n\nElsewhere, the world has confronted its past abuses. Mottley recalled a trip to Europe 20 years ago, during which she observed a ceremony for Germany's reparations paid to survivors of the Holocaust. While she was there, South Asians were rioting in Britain over their former colonial oppression. She was struck that no such thought was given to the Caribbean. The Caribbean was unseen then, and it remains unseen now. To fight the climate crisis, to fight the pandemic or meet development goals, Mottley said, countries are still fighting for a platform. \"You will realize that in almost every instance, we're fighting our old struggles on the same basis,\" she said. \"What is its underlying cause? The inequity in the world in which we live, and the inequity is preserved fundamentally because we've not changed the power structure.\"\n\nThere were no misgivings or hesitations about what she was preparing to deliver to the WTO. She and Persaud had decided to be blunt. The rest was a delicate balance. \"She does not want to be put into a box,\" Persaud said. \"She does not want to be put in a female box, I don't want her in a SIDS box, and we don't want to be anti-West, because that's not who we are.\" Mottley read the speech the day before and read it again, absorbing it.\n\n\" My friends,\" she began , with a nod across the floor to Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, \"the global order is not working.\" It does not deliver on peace or on prosperity or on stability, she said. The words of global partnerships were hollow, the partnerships themselves glib, corrupted by greed and selfishness - and they remained fundamentally imbalanced. Debt is written off in Ukraine, as it was for Germany after World War II. Other countries, though, the ones subjugated throughout history, have seen their humanitarian crises ignored. The world, she said, \"is segregated regrettably between those who came first and in whose image the global order is now set\" and a global order that is itself \"simply the embalming of the old colonial order that existed at the time of the establishment of these institutions.\"\n\nGone was the patient case-building, the appeals to logic and empathy, that characterized so many of her recent speeches. Her hair, always in a neat Afro, was grayer and frazzled; her fatigue seeped through her expression. \"We have therefore to ask ourselves whether we can live in this global order.\"\n\nRead More\n\nIt was time to reset. The war in Ukraine was forcing that reset anyway. She could work with the global economic system to raise capital. She could probably find a strategy to bolster her island's standing in the face of cataclysmic climate change, at least for a while. But combining both? It had proved impossible. It was time to use the IMF's drawing rights, the hurricane clauses, all of it. And then Mottley laid out Persaud's plan to establish a new climate trust based on the IMF's reserves, her big ask.\n\nBut to make these changes, she warned, the world had to get to a new place in spirit. It had to fill some gaping moral cavity. \"That we are more concerned with generating profits than saving people,\" she said, \"is perhaps the greatest condemnation that can be made of our generation.\"\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?
