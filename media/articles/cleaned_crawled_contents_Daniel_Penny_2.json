But personally, I don't believe being mentally unwell and being homeless is a crime worthy of death,\" said one of the organizers, Sean Blackmon.\n\nAn anonymous Manhattan jury cleared Penny of a criminally negligent homicide charge in the death of Neely , 30. The jury had deadlocked last week on a more serious manslaughter charge, which was dismissed .\n\nPenny, who served four years in the Marines, put Neely in a chokehold for about six minutes after Neely had an outburst that frightened riders on a subway car on May 1, 2023. Penny is white. Neely was Black.\n\nAccording to passengers, Neely hadn't touched anyone but had expressed willingness to die, go to jail - even to kill, some said. The former street performer was homeless, had schizophrenia, had synthetic marijuana in his system and had been convicted of assaulting people at subway stations.\n\nIn his first extensive comments since the trial began, Penny told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro that he's \"not a confrontational person.\" But he said he wouldn't have been able to live with \"the guilt I would have felt if someone did get hurt, if he did do what he was threatening to do.\"\n\nPenny's arm remained around Neely's neck after another rider intervened to hold down the man's arms, and onlookers worried aloud that Neely might be dying, and he went still for nearly a minute, bystanders' video showed.\n\nPenny told Pirro that he was in a \"very vulnerable position\" as he restrained Neely on the subway floor.\n\n\"If I just let him go, I'm on my back now, he could just turn around and start doing what he said to me ... killing, hurting,\" Penny said in the clips, aired ahead of the planned release of the full interview Wednesday on the Fox Nation streaming service.\n\nPenny, 26, also criticized city officials as \"self-serving,\" suggesting that they were refusing to scrutinize their own roles in the conditions that led to his encounter with Neely.\n\n\"These are their policies that clearly have not worked,\" Penny said.

A more serious manslaughter charge was dismissed last week because the jury deadlocked on that count.\n\nPenny, who had shown little expression during the trial, briefly smiled as the verdict was read. While celebrating later with his attorneys, he said he felt \"great.\"\n\nBoth applause and anger erupted in the courtroom, and Neely's father and two supporters were ushered out after audibly reacting. Another person also left, wailing with tears.\n\n\"It really, really hurts,\" Neely's father, Andre Zachery, said outside the courthouse. \"I had enough of this. The system is rigged.\"\n\nThe case amplified many American fault lines, among them race, politics, crime, urban life, mental illness and homelessness. Neely was Black. Penny is white.\n\nThere were sometimes dueling demonstrations outside the courthouse, including on Monday. High-profile Republican politicians portrayed Penny as a hero while prominent Democrats attended Neely's funeral .\n\nPenny's attorneys argued he was protecting himself and other subway passengers from a volatile, mentally ill man who was making alarming remarks and gestures.\n\nPenny \"finally got the justice he deserved,\" one of his lawyers, Thomas Kenniff, said while celebrating the outcome with him at a downtown Manhattan pub.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat whose office brought the case, said prosecutors \"followed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end\" and respect the verdict.\n\nThe anonymous jury, which had started deliberating Tuesday , was escorted out of court to a van.\n\nPenny, 26, served four years in the Marines and went on to study architecture.\n\nNeely, 30, was a sometime subway performer with a tragic life story: His mother was killed and stuffed in a suitcase when he was a teenager.\n\nAs a younger man, Neely did Michael Jackson tributes - complete with moonwalks - on the city's streets and subways. But Neely also struggled with mental illness after losing his mother, whose boyfriend was convicted of murdering her.\n\nHe subsequently was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia, was repeatedly hospitalized, and used the synthetic cannabinoid K2 and realized it negatively affected his thinking and behavior, according to medical records seen at the trial. The drug was in his system when he died.\n\nNeely told a doctor in 2017 that being homeless, living in poverty and having to \"dig through the garbage\" for food made him feel so hopeless that he sometimes thought of killing himself, hospital records show.\n\nAbout six years later, he boarded a subway under Manhattan on May 1, 2023, hurled his jacket onto the floor, and declared that he was hungry and thirsty and didn't care if he died or went to jail, witnesses said. Some told 911 operators that he tried to attack people or indicated he'd harm riders, and several testified that they were afraid.\n\nNeely was unarmed, with nothing but a muffin in his pocket, and didn't touch any passengers. One said he made lunging movements that alarmed her enough that she shielded her 5-year-old from him.\n\nPenny came up behind Neely, grabbed his neck, took him to the floor and \"put him out,\" as the veteran told police at the scene.\n\nPassengers' video showed that at one point during the roughly six-minute hold, Neely tapped an onlooker's leg and gestured to him. Later, he briefly got an arm free. But he went still nearly a minute before Penny released him.\n\n\"He's dying,\" an unseen bystander said in one video. \"Let him go!\"\n\nA witness who stepped in to hold down Neely's arms testified that he told Penny to free the man, though Penny's lawyers noted the witness' story changed significantly over time.\n\nPenny told detectives shortly after the encounter that Neely threatened to kill people and the chokehold was an attempt to \"de-escalate\" the situation until police could arrive. The veteran said he held on so long because Neely periodically tried to break loose.\n\n\"I wasn't trying to injure him. I'm just trying to keep him from hurting anyone else. He's threatening people. That's what we learn in the Marine Corps,\" Penny told the detectives.\n\nHowever, one of Penny's Marine Corps instructors testified that the veteran misused a chokehold technique he'd been taught.\n\nProsecutors said Penny reacted far too forcefully to someone he perceived as a peril, not a person. Prosecutors also argued that any need to protect passengers quickly ebbed when the train doors opened at the next station, seconds after Penny took action.\n\nAlthough Penny told police he'd used \"a choke\" or \"a chokehold,\" one of his lawyers, Steven Raiser, cast it as a Marine-taught chokehold \"modified as a simple civilian restraint.\" The defense lawyers contended Penny didn't consistently apply enough pressure to kill Neely.\n\nContradicting a city medical examiner's finding , a pathologist hired by the defense said Neely died not from the chokehold but from the combined effects of K2, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint, and a blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during exertion.\n\nPenny did not testify , but relatives, friends and fellow Marines did - describing him as an upstanding, patriotic and empathetic man.\n\nThe manslaughter charge would have required proving that Penny recklessly caused Neely's death. Criminally negligent homicide involves engaging in serious \"blameworthy conduct\" while not perceiving such a risk. Both charges were felonies punishable by prison time.\n\nDuring the criminal trial, Neely's father filed a wrongful death suit against Penny.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Joseph B.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - The older sister of Daniel Penny, the former U.S. Marine charged with fatally choking a homeless man aboard a Manhattan subway, told jurors Monday that her brother was a \"calm, soft-spirited person\" with a reputation for honesty and integrity.\n\nJacqueline Penny, a 27-year-old accountant, was called to the witness stand by Daniel Penny's attorneys after prosecutors rested their case Monday afternoon, kicking off a defense presentation that immediately sought to burnish the defendant's character and emphasize his military service.\n\nPenny faces manslaughter charges in the death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man and occasional subway performer known for his Michael Jackson impression.\n\nProsecutors say Neely was acting erratically but non-violently on the train when Penny threw him to the ground and placed him in a chokehold for six minutes, showing an \"indifference\" to the life of a man in the throes of a mental health crisis.\n\nLawyers for Penny counter that their client showed courage by putting his own safety above others as he worked to neutralize a \"seething, psychotic\" man whose behavior had frightened other riders.\n\nIn her testimony Monday, Jacqueline Penny said her brother was a soft-spoken but \"always patriotic\" striver who followed the other men in the family into the military.\n\nWhile she painted a picture of a close-knit town and a childhood punctuated with fishing, sports and enduring friendships, she also said their grandparents had been a key source of support to the four Penny siblings when their parents went through a \"very difficult\" separation during the defendant's high school years.\n\nShe was followed on the witness stand by Alexandra Fay, a childhood neighbor of the family, who spoke of their \"typical upbringing\" in a Long Island suburb. \"He has the same exact friends that he's had since fifth grade,\" she said of Penny.\n\nThe defense presentation followed three days of testimony from Dr. Cynthia Harris, the city medical examiner who performed an autopsy on Neely and concluded he'd died of the chokehold. In hours of cross-examination Monday, Penny's attorney, Steven Raiser, sought to cast doubt on that finding, questioning the woman's credentials and suggesting she had offered \"no evidence that pressure was maintained in a sufficient way\" to kill Neely.\n\nRather, Raiser said Neely, who had sickle cell condition, may have died after ingesting enough synthetic cannabinoid - or K2 - to trigger a fatal \"sickling crisis.\" While K2 was found in Neely's system, Harris said it was \"profoundly improbable\" that those factors killed Neely.\n\nShe then brushed off the defense attorney's insistence that Penny had not applied enough pressure on Neely's neck to block the flow of blood to his brain. \"I believe there is sufficiently consistent pressure to the vital structure of the neck, which led to him losing consciousness and sustaining brain injury,\" Harris said.\n\nManhattan jurors also heard testimony last week from another rider, who said he urged Penny to loosen his grip on Neely's neck during the fatal encounter, as well as a former martial arts trainer in the U.S. Marines. The trainer said Penny had appeared to misuse a \"blood choke\" technique that was taught to U.S. Marines as a method to knock a person unconscious.\n\nJurors were also shown video of Penny's interview with detectives inside the precinct, where he repeatedly referred to Neely as a \"crackhead,\" then demonstrated the chokehold he'd used to subdue him.\n\n\"He had his back turned to me and I got him in a hold, got him to the ground, and he's still squirming around and going crazy,\" Penny said. \"He gets a burst of energy at one point and I did have to hold him a little more steady.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Jurors began deliberating and soon revisited some of their legal instructions Tuesday in the trial of a military veteran charged with using a fatal chokehold to subdue a New York subway rider whose behavior was alarming other passengers.\n\nThe anonymous jury is weighing manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges in the death of Jordan Neely , a troubled street performer who was homeless. The veteran, Daniel Penny , has pleaded not guilty and maintains that his actions were justified.\n\nIn a reflection of the complexities of the closely watched case , the jury asked within the first 75 minutes of deliberations to rehear Judge Maxwell Wiley's instructions on justification defenses and on the definitions of the crimes charged. After the re-reading and 90 more minutes of deliberations, jurors headed home for the day without reaching a verdict.\n\nPenny, 26, has said he was protecting fellow subway riders and intended only to restrain Neely and hold him for police, not to hurt him. Prosecutors say the Marine veteran used far too much force for too long when he gripped Neely by the neck for about six minutes.\n\nThe case has animated debate about public safety, societal responses to mental illness and homelessness, the line between self-defense and aggression, and the role of race in all of it.\n\nForming a tableau of the divisions surrounding the case, a small number of protesters outraged by the death of Neely, who was Black, routinely wait for Penny, who is white, to arrive at court, as does a Penny supporter. Some well-known Democratic politicians paid respects at Neely's funeral, while Penny has gotten support from prominent Republicans.\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, cast the case this weekend as an illustration of mental health system failures that ultimately had Neely making threats in a subway car.\n\n\"We have to recognize we have a mental health crisis and we're not doing enough to solve it,\" the mayor said in a WOR-AM radio interview . He added that he didn't want to prejudge the jury's decision.\n\nThe 30-year-old Neely sometimes entertained passersby with Michael Jackson impersonations but also struggled with depression, schizophrenia and drug use after his mother was strangled during his teen years. Penny was a college architecture student who served four years in the Marines.\n\nWitnesses said Neely boarded a train under Manhattan on May 1, 2023, started moving erratically, yelling about his hunger and thirst and proclaiming that he was ready to die, to go to jail or - as Penny and some other passengers recalled - to kill.\n\nPenny came up behind Neely, grabbed his neck and head and took him to the floor. The veteran later told police he'd held Neely in \"a choke\" and \"put him out\" to ensure he wouldn't hurt anyone.\n\nCity medical examiners ruled that Neely was killed by having his neck compressed in a chokehold. A pathologist hired by Penny's defense contradicted that finding , attributing the death to a variety of other factors.\n\nPenny's lawyers argued that he used what they term a \"civilian restraint,\" departing from the chokehold technique he'd been taught in the military, in order to control Neely without rendering him unconscious. Prosecutors say Neely had the training to know that what he was doing could kill.\n\nWiley told jurors Tuesday that if they convict Penny of manslaughter, they won't be asked for a verdict on the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. If they decide he's not guilty of manslaughter, they'll consider the second charge.\n\nManslaughter requires proving that a defendant recklessly caused another person's death. The standard entails, among other things, consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk that an action will be deadly.\n\nCriminally negligent homicide, on the other hand, involves engaging in serious \"blameworthy conduct\" while not perceiving such a risk.\n\nBoth charges are felonies. Neither carries mandatory prison time, but both carry the possibility of it - up to 15 years for manslaughter, or four for criminally negligent homicide.\n\nDeliberations will resume Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP) - Daniel Penny , a military veteran who choked an agitated New York subway rider and was acquitted of homicide this week, has been invited by Vice President-elect JD Vance to join Donald Trump's suite at the Army-Navy football game on Saturday.\n\nThe Marine veteran was cleared of criminally negligent homicide in Jordan Neely 's 2023 death. A more serious manslaughter charge was dismissed last week.\n\nVance said Penny, 26, accepted his invitation to join the president-elect and him at the game.\n\n\"Daniel's a good guy, and New York's mob district attorney tried to ruin his life for having a backbone,\" Vance said in a post on X. \"I'm grateful he accepted my invitation and hope he's able to have fun and appreciate how much his fellow citizens admire his courage.\"\n\nThe case sparked national debate, with some hailing Penny as a hero for attempting to subdue a man he considered a menace to public safety and others seeing him as a white vigilante who choked a Black man to death.\n\nPolitical figures on the right have defended Penny since he was charged for the death in May 2023. Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy , who ran for the GOP presidential nomination and was tapped by Trump last month to lead an effort along with billionaire Elon Musk to cut government spending, donated money to his legal defense fund.\n\nAfter the acquittal, Penny gave an extensive interview to Fox News and declared he's \"not a confrontational person.\" He told the network that he wouldn't have been able to live with \"the guilt I would have felt if someone did get hurt, if he did do what he was threatening to do.\"\n\n\"I'll take a million court appearances and people calling me names and people hating me, just to keep one of those people from getting hurt or killed,\" Penny said.\n\nTrump has not referred to the case publicly recently, but last year he told The Messenger that he thought Penny and other people on the subway were \"in great danger.\"\n\nSome New Yorkers protested the trial outcome this week, holding signs and chanting Jordan Neely's name in a Manhattan square.\n\nVance, who served in the Marine Corps, including in Iraq, said this week that \"justice was done in this case\" and Penny never should have been prosecuted.\n\nPenny has been hailed a hero by many, but Neely's death also divided the city as residents grapple with how to respond to mental health crises threatening public safety.\n\nPassengers said Neely hadn't touched anyone but had expressed willingness to die, go to jail or even to kill. The former street performer was homeless, had schizophrenia and had synthetic marijuana in his system. He had been convicted of assaulting people at subway stations.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Daniel Penny chose not to testify and defense lawyers rested their case Friday at his trial in the death of an agitated man he choked on a subway train.\n\nClosing arguments are expected after Thanksgiving in the closely watched manslaughter case about the death of Jordan Neely , 30.\n\nThe encounter between Penny, a white Marine veteran, and Neely, a homeless Black man with mental health and drug problems, has been drawn into U.S. political divides over race, public safety and cities' ability to handle mental illness and social ills.\n\nPenny, 26, has pleaded not guilty. Many criminal defendants don't take the stand, and juries are routinely instructed that they cannot hold defendants' silence - a constitutional right - against them.\n\nOne of Penny's lawyers, Thomas Kenniff, noted after court that jurors did hear from Penny, in the form of his recorded statements to police minutes and hours after he put Neely in a chokehold.\n\n\"Virtually everything he said then is consistent with credible testimony of his fellow passengers,\" Kenniff said.\n\nPenny told police that he wrapped his arm around Neely's neck, took him to the floor and \"put him out\" because he was angrily throwing things and making threatening comments. Penny said on police video that he hadn't wanted to injure Neely but rather to keep him from hurting anyone else.\n\nA number of other passengers testified that they were scared of Neely and relieved that Penny grabbed hold of him.\n\nA man who later stepped in and held down Neely's arms, however, told jurors that he urged Penny to let go but that the veteran kept choking Neely for a time.\n\nProsecutors say Penny meant to protect people but recklessly used too much force, overlooking Neely's humanity and making no effort to spare his life.\n\nCity medical examiners ruled that the chokehold killed Neely.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nDaniel Penny leaves the courtroom for a lunch break in New York, Monday, Nov. 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - For roughly six minutes, Jordan Neely was pinned to a subway floor in a chokehold that ended with him lying still. But that's not what killed him, a forensic pathologist testified Thursday in defense of the military-trained commuter charged with killing Neely .\n\nDr. Satish Chundru disputed a New York City medical examiner's determination that Daniel Penny's chokehold killed Neely, who was behaving erratically on a subway the two men were riding. Penny's defense says that he acted to protect frightened passengers and was trying only to restrain Neely, not to kill him.\n\nThe white Marine veteran's reaction to Neely, who was Black, homeless and mentally ill, has become a flashpoint in national divides over race, urban life and the boundary between self-defense and vigilantism.\n\nPenny's lawyers have argued throughout the trial that his pressure on Neely's neck wasn't sufficient and consistent enough to be lethal. The attorneys brought Chundru to the witness stand to shed light on their argument.\n\nHe told jurors that Neely's medical records and bystander video don't show telltale signs of known types of fatal chokeholds.\n\nAmong the discrepancies, he said: the location and extent of bruising on Neely's neck, and the small amount of petechiae - small red spots caused by subsurface bleeding - on his eyelids.\n\n\"In your opinion, did Mr. Penny choke Mr. Neely to death?\" defense lawyer Steven Raiser asked.\n\n\"No,\" replied Chundru, who has worked as a medical examiner for county governments in Florida and Texas.\n\nHe said Neely died from \"the combined effects\" of synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint, and a blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during exertion.\n\n\"The chokehold did not cause death,\" the pathologist said.\n\nProsecutor Dafna Yoran later sought to show that some aspects of Chundru's testimony, including about petechiae, departed from some medical literature and even his own opinion in other cases. He responded that the comparisons weren't comparable.\n\nHis testimony starkly contrasted with the findings of Dr. Cynthia Harris, the city medical examiner who performed Neely's autopsy.\n\nShe told jurors earlier in the trial that Neely suffered \"an asphyxial death\" as a result of the chokehold. She called it \"profoundly improbable\" that Neely's death was due to synthetic marijuana use and sickle cell condition, which is related but not equivalent to sickle cell disease.\n\nWithin the medical examiner's office, \"the consensus was unanimous\" that Neely had died from the chokehold, Harris said, adding: \"There are no alternative reasonable explanations.\"\n\nA Marine Corps combat instructor who trained Penny testified earlier that the veteran didn't use the chokehold properly when he restrained Neely.\n\nPenny, 26, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. His defense says the Marine veteran and architecture student was defending himself and a car full of subway riders.\n\nNeely, 30, sometimes entertained subway riders as a Michael Jackson impersonator. But he also had a history of psychiatric and drug problems and a criminal record that included assaulting a woman at a subway station.\n\nWhen they crossed paths in a subway car on May 1, 2023, Neely was begging for money, shouting about being willing to die or go to jail, and making sudden movements, according to witnesses. Penny's lawyers have said Neely lurched toward a woman with a small child and said, \"I will kill.\"\n\nPenny put his arm around Neely's neck, took him to the floor and held Neely there, with Penny's legs around him, for close to six minutes, bystander videos show. Neely had stopped moving during roughly the last minute.\n\nPenny's attorneys have said he continued to hold on, while urging onlookers to call police, because Neely had tried at points to break free.\n\nProsecutors maintain he applied too much force for too long.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jake Offenhartz contributed.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The judge in the case, Maxwell Wiley, allowed prosecutors to have the charge dropped, while Penny's attorneys had wanted Wiley to declare a mistrial. Penny still faces a charge of criminally negligent homicide for putting Neely in a six-minute chokehold on the New York City subway in May 2023, in an incident largely caught on cameras. Penny's attorneys argued their client was justified in using the chokehold because witnesses had claimed Neely's behavior was threatening, and that he had told passengers, \"Somebody's going to die today.\" Prosecutors, meanwhile, noted that no witnesses had testified that Neely brandished a weapon or touched anybody, and that Penny kept Neely in the chokehold long after other passengers left the train. The manslaughter charge had carried a 15-year maximum prison sentence; for the lesser charge, Penny could face up to four years if convicted.

The jury acquitted Penny of criminally negligent homicide, after throwing out the manslaughter charge on Friday when the jury twice couldn't come to a unanimous verdict. The charge of criminally negligent homicide would've put Penny behind bars for four years; the manslaughter charge had a maximum of 15 years. Penny, a former Marine, put Neely, who was homeless at the time, in a chokehold for six minutes after Neely said, \"someone is going to die today,\" in May 2023. No witness testified that Neely touched or made any move towards another passenger, though many testified that they were afraid of Neely during his rant. He did not have a weapon on him. Prosecutors noted that Penny kept Neely in the chokehold even after the passengers had left the train. But jurors sided with Penny's defense-that he was justified in protecting his fellow passengers in the face of an erratic homeless man, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and previously had over two dozen encounters with the police. The defense also questioned if it was the chokehold that killed Neely.\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\ngrace.harrington@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Viewers Baffled By Contrasting Cable News Takes to Penny Acquittal and UnitedHealth Suspect's Arrest\n\nOn Monday night's broadcast of The Ingraham Angle , Fox News host Laura Ingraham took less than 30 seconds to condemn support for one alleged vigilante killer and offer up that another is being called a \"hero.\"\n\n\"The Instagram posts from nutbag people, which I was sent in the commercial break earlier: crazy,\" she said, of online support for Luigi Mangione, who was charged with murder in connection with the killing of UnitedHealth Care CEO Brian Thompson on Monday. \"Like he's cute and this and people celebrating this, this is a sickness. Honestly it's so disappointing, but I guess we shouldn't be surprised.\"\n\nThe host then immediately teed up the next segment to follow a commercial break: \"Up next, the other big news out of New York, Daniel Penny. A lot of people think he's a hero and tonight he's not guilty.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIngraham: The instagram posts from nut bag people ..people celebrating.

The good guys: Daniel Penny. The bad guys: Luigi Mangione pic.twitter.com/mHF9IWmzqJ\n\n\"Two killers. Both bad guys,\" tweeted journalist Victoria Brownworth in reply.\n\nJennings went on to state he thinks New York City should build a statue of Penny in his honor.\n\nWhile conservative commentators valorized Penny and celebrated his acquittal, Neely's family and members of the Black community were in mourning.\n\nThe NAACP slammed the acquittal for setting \"a dangerous precedent by embracing vigilantism and disregarding the sanctity of human life.\"\n\n\"The acquittal of Daniel Penny in the murder of Jordan Neely is a painful reminder of a long-standing reality: vigilante violence against Black people often goes unchecked,\" said Rep. Summer Lee (D-PA), in a tweet. \"Jordan deserved compassion, not violence. We stand with his loved ones in demanding accountability.\"\n\nNeely's father, Andre Zachery, said he had no confidence in the justice system.\n\n\"I just want to say I miss my son,\" he told reporters, standing outside a Manhattan courthouse Monday. \"My son didn't have to go through this. I didn't have to go through this either. It hurts. It really, really hurts. I had enough of this, the system is rigged.\"\n\nWhile celebrating Penny for restraining Neely, Ingraham and Jennings ignored that the preponderance of commentary about Thompson's murder has focused on the practices of private American health insurance firms like the one he led.\n\nOutrage has come from Americans who have experienced friends or loved ones being denied coverage, something that can be bankrupting or even fatal.\n\nIn the past week, some right-wing political commentators, like Ben Shapiro, have even been mocked by their own conservative viewers, who also have concerns about the state of American health care.\n\nMe reading the comments and watching Ben Shapiro's audience turning on him... 🤌 pic.twitter.com/NHpUx2Vomr\n\n\"Thank goodness the killer of a poor schizophrenic black man is free and the killer of a wealthy white death merchant is in custody,\" David Klion, a contributing editor to Jewish Currents , morbidly joked about the celebration of Penny's acquittal.\n\nThank goodness the killer of a poor schizophrenic black man is free and the killer of a wealthy white death merchant is in custody\n\nKlion added : \"I'm taking a shot at the many, many conservatives who do in fact think Penny is a hero and also think it's disgusting that anyone would celebrate a CEO's death.

Jurors were not able to consider the criminally negligent homicide count until reaching a verdict on second-degree manslaughter.\n\nBy agreeing to dismiss this top charge, jurors will be able to continue deliberating the case. Wiley has instructed them to return to court on Monday, according to CNN.\n\n\"Judge Wiley is letting the DA withdraw the manslaughter charge. He'll let the jury consider just criminally negligent homicide now. That's big for precedent. That also means Penny is now off the hook for manslaughter, though,\" Courthouse News reporter Erik Uebelacker said on X .\n\nPenny had been tried on second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely , whom Penny held in a chokehold for about six minutes on a New York City subway car in 2023.\n\nThe panelists sent Wiley a note on Friday morning stating they were unable to agree on a verdict on the manslaughter charge. Wiley then read them what is known as an Allen charge - an instruction urging them to make every possible effort to reach a verdict. As he pressed the jurors to continue, Wiley commended them for being \"very conscientious in your deliberations\", noting that it was not uncommon to have difficulties in reaching a verdict. But he warned that if they cannot, a new trial will have to be scheduled with a different jury and there was no reason to think any other jury would be more fair or hard-working than them. He said two and a half days of deliberations may seem like a long time, but \"given the factual complexity of the case, I don't think it's too long\".\n\nThey reportedly sent another note to Wiley on Friday afternoon saying once again that they could not reach a unanimous verdict on the manslaughter count. Manhattan prosecutors then successfully requested a dismissal of that count in particular.\n\nCriminally negligent homicide involves engaging in serious \"blameworthy conduct\" while not perceiving such a risk. Manslaughter, meanwhile, requires proving that a defendant recklessly caused another person's death.\n\nPenny's lawyers say he was protecting himself and other subway riders from a volatile, mentally ill man who was making alarming remarks and gestures. Prosecutors say Penny reacted far too forcefully to someone he perceived as a peril, not a person.\n\nNeely, a 30-year-old street artist and Michael Jackson impersonator, entered a New York City subway car in May 2023. Witnesses say he began yelling at passengers that he was hungry and thirsty and that he did not care whether he died.\n\nPenny then grabbed Neely from behind and restrained him on the train floor in a chokehold that reportedly lasted for several minutes . Neely lost consciousness during the struggle and later died in the hospital. The incident was captured on video by other subway riders.\n\nPenny later told police that he \"just wanted to keep him from getting to people\", and described Neely as \"a crackhead\" who was \"acting like a lunatic\".\n\nProsecutors argued in court that Penny's actions were reckless and that he consciously disregarded the substantial risk of putting Neely in the chokehold for such a long period of time. They argued that Penny's use of lethal force should be considered unjustifiable.\n\nDefense attorneys countered by telling the jury that Penny's actions were only motivated by a desire to protect the subway passengers. They added that Penny never intended to kill Neely, while prosecutors said that an intention to kill was not necessary for a conviction in this case.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting"

      "text": "Daniel Penny's acquittal reveals 'double standard' about white vigilante crime\n\nIn longstanding pattern in the US, white killers are celebrated and Black victims denigrated, experts say\n\nOn Monday, Daniel Penny, a 26-year-old white man, was acquitted of all charges related to the 1 May 2023 killing of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old unhoused Black man with severe mental illness , on a New York City subway train. Penny was charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide after he choked Neely for nearly six minutes , causing his death. The Marine veteran claimed self-defense after an unarmed Neely made threats to passengers and complained of being hungry and thirsty, according to witness testimony.\n\nIn a police interview following Neely's death, Penny referred to Neely as \"just a crackhead\" who was \"acting like a lunatic\". Experts say Penny's acquittal fits into a longstanding pattern of how white vigilante crime is treated in the US, with white killers celebrated and Black victims denigrated.\n\n\"In situations where people of color have tried to defend themselves, it's a whole different result,\" said Mark Brodin, a professor of law at Boston College Law School. \"It's as transparent a double standard as you can ever imagine. And race is the only explanation. Class enters into it with Mr Neely, his mental problems entered into it. But race is at the top of the pyramid.\"\n\nDespite widespread outrage about Neely's killing in New York City, Penny received an onslaught of support from those on the far right after his arrest. A crowdfunding campaign for Penny's legal fund amassed more than $2.9m in the months after the incident. (Neely's burial funds, on the other hand, raised just $150,094.) The Fox News host Greg Gutfeld called Neely a \"violent mess\" who was \"better at impersonating Michael Meyers than Michael Jackson\", referring to Neely's previous impersonations of the pop star. And another Fox News pundit, Kayleigh McEnany, laughed alongside her colleagues at protesters who gathered to condemn Neely's killing.\n\nFollowing his acquittal, Penny has been praised by conservatives, including the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis ; Ben Shapiro and Meghan McCain, who called those critical of Penny \"lunatics\".\n\nSuch commentary is part of an \"unfortunate spiral\" in which news outlets, platforms and people \"demonize individuals for existing\", said the NAACP president, Derrick Johnson. \"The fact that [Penny] called this individual [a] crackhead shows his state of mind. He didn't see this person as someone who was human [or who] more or less had the right to live.\"\n\nBrodin said that Penny's acquittal was virtually certain, given the \"history of the legal system sending these people out the back door at the courthouse. You can set your watch to it,\" he said of cases in which white vigilantes claimed self-defense. \"There's just no accountability with these people.\"\n\nFor example, George Zimmerman , who shot and killed Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in Florida in 2012, Kyle Rittenhouse , who killed two men and injured a third during a Black Lives Matters protest in Wisconsin in 2020, and Bernhard Goetz , who shot four Black teenagers on the New York City subway in 1984, were all acquitted. Vigilantes like Penny are also generally portrayed and celebrated as \"heroes\", Brodin added. Goetz was hailed as the \"subway savior\" by New York tabloids. And Rittenhouse received messages of support and fundraisers following his arrest for first degree intentional homicide. (Rittenhouse's victims were all white, but the protest he traveled to was against the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man. Rittenhouse's defense team said that he traveled across state lines to the demonstration to \" help people \".)\n\nAcquittal of white vigilantes takes place for several reasons, said Brodin. For one, standards of self-defense are based on a perpetrator's testimony that they believed they were in danger, with the burden of proof in a criminal case high and jurors being \"vulnerable to fear mongering by the defense lawyers\".\n\n\"It's supposed to be a 'reasonable fear', but jurors don't hear the 'reasonable' part of it,\" said Brodin. \"They think, 'That could've been me on that subway. I'm glad he choked that man to death after six minutes of strangling him.'\"\n\nDefense lawyers representing vigilantes often \"play on the fears of jurors\", Brodin added. In the case of Zimmerman, his defense team included the testimony of Olivia Bertalan, a young white mother who said she lived in the same gated community as Zimmerman and had been the victim of a robbery.\n\n\"It had nothing to do with [Martin], but she was portrayed by defense counsel as cowering in her bedroom closet when she heard the burglars go next door,\" Brodin said. \"It was [an] all-female jury [who] were obviously putting themselves in the situation of cowering in their own bedrooms.\"\n\nWhat's more, Penny's acquittal could have far-reaching consequences for unhoused people, a demographic that already faces increased risks of violence, said Dave Giffen, the executive director at the New York-based Coalition for the Homeless. \"The fear is that we're sending a message that citizens should be taking these situations into their own hands, that it's okay to attack and even kill somebody that you're afraid of.\"\n\nA potential increase in violence against the unhoused could also take place given that homeless people are unfairly blamed for perceived increases in crime, Giffen said, noting that incidents of violence perpetrated by unhoused individuals tend to dominate news headlines. City and state officials then respond with law enforcement, further \"stoking fears\" around public safety instead of providing resources to those in need, he continued.\n\nPenny's framing as a hero and Neely's as a villain only works to move focus away from how to help vulnerable populations dealing with homelessness, Giffen said. \"If what we're saying is that it's okay to attack somebody who's acting in a way that makes you feel nervous, then the city is descending into chaos.\""

Penny held Neely in a lethal chokehold.\n\nPenny was charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide following Neely's killing, which received widespread attention . Both charges carried the potential for prison time.\n\nOn Friday, the jury in the case said it had been unable to reach a verdict on a charge of manslaughter after more than two days of deliberations. Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed the charge and directed the panel to consider the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide.\n\nPenny was acquitted of the lesser charge after two hours of deliberations on Monday. In the courtroom, there was a burst of applause from Penny's legal team, and the defendant was hustled out of the courtroom through a side door.\n\nBut Neely's supporters audibly lamented the outcome, including some who were reported as visibly crying.\n\nEarlier Monday, Penny's defense team said they were concerned about protests outside the lower Manhattan criminal court, claiming that jurors were able to hear chants of \"subway strangler\" and \"murderer\" as they deliberated. Wiley said there were protesters from both sides outside.\n\nPenny's acquittal is a significant blow to the reputation of Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought charges against him as protests over Neely's killing mounted.\n\nPenny, 26, was accused of placing Neely, 30, in a chokehold as Neely acted erratically on an F train in SoHo on 1 May 2023.\n\nNeely, a 30-year-old street artist and Michael Jackson impersonator, entered a New York City subway car in May 2023. Witnesses said he began yelling at passengers that he was hungry and thirsty and that he didn't care whether he died.\n\nPenny then caught Neely from behind and restrained him on the train floor in a chokehold that reportedly lasted for several minutes . Neely lost consciousness during the struggle and later died in the hospital. The incident was captured on video by other subway riders.\n\nHe later told police that he \"just wanted to keep him from getting to people\", and described Neely as \"a crackhead\" who was \"acting like a lunatic\".\n\nThe jury, composed of seven women and five men, entered deliberations on Tuesday.\n\nProsecutors argued in court that Penny's actions were reckless and that he consciously disregarded the substantial risk of putting Neely in the chokehold for such a long period of time.\n\nThey argued that Penny's use of lethal force should be considered unjustifiable.\n\nDefense attorneys countered by telling the jury that Penny's actions were only motivated by a desire to protect the subway passengers. They added that Penny never intended to kill Neely, while prosecutors said that an intention to kill is not necessary for a conviction in this case.\n\nDuring the trial, jurors heard from more than 40 witnesses, including passengers who recounted that Neely had shouted he was \"willing to die and go to jail\" and \"someone is going to die today\" before Penny restrained him.\n\nAnother woman on the subway train said she feared for her life after hearing Neely's \"satanic\" rant. But no witness claimed that Neely physically touched or lunged at a specific person.\n\nThe outcome of the trial is unlikely to resolve a debate in the city over safety in the subway and the fate of a troubled man who had clearly been let down by New York's healthcare services.\n\nThe New York mayor, Eric Adams , recently criticized the \"failure\" of the city's mental health system for not doing more to help Neely.\n\n\"The young man, in this case, was going within our system, throughout the revolving door of our system,\" Adams told the Rob Astorino radio show. \"Now, we're on the subway where we're hearing someone talking about hurting people, killing people.\n\n\"You have someone on that subway who was responding, doing what we should have done as a city and the state.\""

He was released on bond after surrendering his passport.\n\nCharges in the grand jury indictment were unsealed on Wednesday.\n\nIn the minutes before he was killed, Neely, a 30-year-old former Michael Jackson impersonator who struggled with mental illness, had been shouting about how hungry he was and that he was willing to return to jail or die, according to passengers on the subway car.\n\nPenny has said he acted to defend himself and other passengers, and did not intend to kill Neely, and he has been hailed as a hero by prominent Republican politicians and supporters, who have raised millions for his defense. Protesters have decried Penny as a vigilante and described Neely's death as a lynching.\n\nPenny, a military veteran, was questioned by police that day but was not arrested or brought to court until 11 days after the killing.\n\nWitnesses have said Neely did not physically threaten or attack anyone before Penny grabbed him. His killing renewed debate about gaps in the city's systems for homeless and mentally ill New Yorkers.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the courthouse after the hearing, one of Penny's defense attorneys, Thomas Kenniff, said he believed New York jurors would be sympathetic to his client.\n\n\"There is not a living, breathing soul in Manhattan that has not experienced a variation of what not only Mr Penny but other individuals experienced on that subway car,\" Kenniff said.\n\nDonte Mills, a lawyer representing Neely's family, addressed those supporters in his remarks outside the courthouse.\n\n\"For everyone who thought donating $3m would somehow make this go away or buy his pass: it's not going to happen,\" Mills told reporters. \"You can ask for a refund.\"\n\nReuters contributed reporting"

The Christian fundraising website has also hosted drives for rightwing vigilante Kyle Rittenhouse and far-right groups , including January 6 insurrectionists.\n\n\"Funds are being raised to pay Mr Penny's legal fees incurred from any criminal charges filed and any future civil lawsuits that may arise, as well as expenses related to his defense. All contributions are greatly appreciated,\" the fundraising page said.\n\nThe campaign, which is listed as being created by Penny's attorneys, Raiser & Kenniff, PC, claims that any proceeds exceeding the costs of his legal expenses will be donated to a \"mental health advocacy program in New York City\". The firm's co-founder, Steven M Raiser, confirmed that his company started the campaign.\n\nNeely's killing nearly two weeks ago spurred extensive anger across New York City and the US, with his death underscoring ongoing racial and economic inequality, and the country's lagging mental healthcare and social services. Moreover, Neely's death has renewed attention on crime - despite low crime rates in New York City - and vigilantism.\n\nPenny has attracted the support of a broad swathe of the US right, including senior Republicans like rightwing Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who called Penny a \"good Samaritan\" for his actions.\n\nThe fatal encounter unfolded when Neely - who had struggled with homelessness and mental illness - walked onto a Manhattan subway train car shouting that he was tired, hungry and ready to die. A video recorded by a freelance journalist captured riders holding Neely against the floor.\n\nPenny kept Neely in a chokehold long after Neely stopped moving and at least one rider implored him to release the man. Police officials found Neely unconscious, and he was pronounced dead at hospital. The city's medical examiner deemed Neely's death a homicide.\n\nWhile police officers detained Penny and questioned him following the incident, they quickly released him, spurring public outcry and intense scrutiny over that decision.

The sum now exceeds $2.5m.\n\nShowing how his support largely comes from the US right, the financial drive is posted on GiveSendGo, a Christian fundraising website which has also hosted efforts for rightwing vigilante Kyle Rittenhouse and far-right groups and individuals, among them January 6 insurrectionists.\n\nNumerous senior Republican politicians have joined the chorus of Penny's defenders. Among them is Florida's rightwing governor, Ron DeSantis, who touted Penny as a \"Good Samaritan\" who merited support in a Twitter post that also managed to invoke George Soros - a Holocaust survivor and funder of liberal causes whose name has become an antisemitic dog whistle.\n\n\"We must defeat the Soros-Funded DAs, stop the Left's pro-criminal agenda, and take back the streets for law abiding citizens,\" DeSantis, a likely Republican primary contender, ranted in his tweet . \"We stand with Good Samaritans like Daniel Penny. Let's show this Marine ... America's got his back.\" DeSantis's tweet also included a link to Penny's fundraiser.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy , a businessman seeking the Republican presidential nomination, donated $10,000 to the Penny fundraiser. He retweeted his likely primary rival DeSantis, saying: \"I agree with this. Just donated. More of us should. We must restore the rule of law in America.\"\n\nRamaswamy, listing some of Neely's past criminal offenses, said that he \"never faced real justice for terrorizing New Yorkers\" and blamed Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nThe fatal encounter unfolded when Neely - who had struggled with homelessness and mental illness - walked on to a Manhattan subway train car shouting that he was tired, hungry and ready to die. A video recorded by a freelance journalist captured riders holding Neely against the floor.\n\nPenny kept Neely in a chokehold long after Neely stopped moving and at least one rider implored him to release the man.

The city's medical examiner deemed Neely's death a homicide.\n\nWhile police officers detained Penny and questioned him after the incident, they quickly released him, spurring public outcry and intense scrutiny over that decision.\n\nBragg later announced that Penny would be arraigned on a second-degree manslaughter charge and he surrendered to police on Friday. He appeared in court shortly thereafter and was released on $100,000 bail.\n\nThe Florida Republican congressman Matt Gaetz echoed similar pro-Penny sentiments. \"'Subway Superman' Daniel Penny is a HERO,\" Gaetz tweeted . \"Today, I will personally be donating to his legal defense fund on GiveSendGo.\"\n\nKid Rock, an American rap-rock musician who has become an adamant Donald Trump booster, was among Penny's top supporters, donating $5,000. \"Mr Penny is a hero. [Manhattan district attorney] Alvin Bragg is a POS. Kid Rock,\" the singer, who rose to fame in the late 1990s with Bawitdaba, said in a message.\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nCharlie Kirk, who founded the powerful conservative student organization Turning Point USA, similarly issued a call to action. \"Please consider supporting Daniel Penny's legal fund against NYC's unjust prosecution. Even if he's acquitted of criminal charges, he'll likely face a civil trial, so give what you can,\" Kirk tweeted .\n\nJenna Ellis, an attorney who served as a senior adviser to Trump, said: \"Support Daniel Penny!!\" Her tweet included three American flag emojis.\n\nTrump, the Republican presidential frontrunner who last week was found liable of sexual abuse, surprisingly did not offer concrete commentary on Penny. He did, however, demonize Neely while admitting he had seen no recording of the incident.\n\n\"Well, I think he was in great danger and the other people in the car were in great danger. I haven't seen the tape,\" Trump said in an interview with the Messenger that was published on Monday. \"But I think he was in danger. And it sounded like the other people in the car were in danger. And it also looks like [Neely] was arrested over 40 times and had lots of problems.\"\n\n\"So I haven't seen the tapes. I won't make a definitive [statement] but it looks to me like the people in that car were in great danger.\"\n\nAttorney Ron Kuby - who represented one of the Black teens whom white subway gunman Bernhard Goetz shot nearly four decades ago in an incident that also became a flashpoint in culture war discourse on crime and vigilantism, said the tenor of conversation around Neely wasn't unique.\n\n\"When Bernard Goetz opened fire on four teenagers riding on a train he too became the celebrated everyman - every white man - who's had enough by the right wing,\" Kuby said. \"It's not new, and it's not hard to explain. Your Penny is a white Marine, and his victim was a mentally ill, homeless ... queer Black man. So that's the agenda of white supremacy playing out right there.\""

      "text": "Trial in subway killing of Jordan Neely to begin in New York\n\nDaniel Penny, 24, a former US Marine, had held the Michael Jackson impersonator in a chokehold over perceived threat\n\nNew York City central criminal courthouse braced this week for the start of a trial that will shed light on and perhaps assign accountability for the death of a 30-year-old unhoused Black man.\n\nWas Daniel Penny, the 24-year-old former US Marine accused of causing the death of Jordan Neely, an unhoused former Michael Jackson impersonator, acting recklessly when he placed Neely in a chokehold allegedly for more than six minutes on the subway last May?\n\nAlong the way, the case will also be a referendum on the safety of the city's transit system, the effectiveness of its mental health services, and where limits on citizen interventions in situations where they may perceive themselves or others to be under physical threat may lie.\n\nLast week, as more than 100 potential jurors were being screened ahead of opening arguments, Judge Maxwell Wiley granted a request by prosecutors to conceal the identity of the jury, acknowledging that \"threats\" had been made to all parties in the case.\n\n\"I believe that's wise,\" Wiley said. \"There's not just opinions, but very, very strong opinions. There's been people who have not been afraid to make threats.\"\n\nWiley asked potential jurors if they had heard of the case. Nearly everyone raised their hand.\n\n\"Not a surprise,\" the judge remarked.\n\nPenny, who has pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter and negligent homicide, told investigators that Neely, who suffered from schizophrenia, threatened to kill other passengers and was merely was trying to hold Neely down until help arrived. The chokehold lasted at least 5 minutes.\n\nNeely's death sparked immediate protests. On the subway platform at Broadway-Lafayette, where EMTs had attempted to revive Neely, a support column had been daubed with \"Who killed Jordan Neely ?\"\n\nTensions soon turned into hostility toward New York's policy for the unhoused and transit authority police.\n\n\"This was a horrible lynching - the murder of someone needing help,\" student Shifa Rahman told the Guardian last year. \"He was at a point of desperation and a citizen, acting in racial bias, acted to suppress that.\"\n\nPenny told police that Neely was ranting in an \"insanely threatening\" way, shouting \"I'm gonna' kill you\" and saying he was \"ready to die\" or go to jail for life before he placed him in the chokehold.\n\nWitnesses on the subway car have offered differing accounts of what took place. One said Neely had been acting aggressively and frightening people but hadn't attacked anyone. Other witnesses claim Neely was not threatening.\n\n\"Jordan Neely did not attempt to physically injure anybody on that train so the question is whether a majority of white people on a jury are going to let another white guy kill a Black man in the middle of Manhattan because the man is scary,\" says veteran New York criminal defense attorney Ron Kuby.\n\n\"Historically, the answer to that has been, sure,\" he adds. \"So we'll see whether things have changed ... \"\n\nPenny was not charged for nearly two weeks, sparking further protests across the city. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the manslaughter charge.\n\n\"I'm not trying to kill the guy,\" Penny told investigators, according to court papers, and said he was \"not a confrontational guy\".\n\nOutside Manhattan criminal court, Penny was greeted with shouts of \"murderer!\" by social justice protestors, some held signs that read \"Justice for Jordan Neely: End Racist Vigilantism Now!\"\n\nNeely's family and supporters have said he was simply crying out for help. They say his mental health had deteriorated after his mother's body was found stuffed in a suitcase in the Bronx.\n\nNeely's aunt, Carolyn Neely, later said her nephew became a \" complete mess \", noting he was schizophrenic and suffered from both PTSD and depression.\n\n\"The whole system just failed him. He fell through the cracks of the system,\" she told the New York Post.\n\nCity authorities had placed Neely, who was on the psychosis-inducing synthetic marijuana K2, according to an autopsy report, was on a list informally known as \"the Top 50\" of people known for the severity of their mental health troubles and resistance to accepting help.\n\n\"Jordan Neely's life mattered,\" New York mayor Eric Adams said before Penny was charged. \"He was suffering from severe mental illness. That was not the cause of his death. His death is a tragedy that never should have happened.\"\n\nOther New York political figures, among them progressive council member Chi Osse, have pointed to a failure of mental health services and disparities in the way that Penny was arrested and released, and the way a Black man might have been treated if the situation was reversed.\n\nPenny's defense fund has raised more than $3m via a pledge drive that describes the criminal charges as \"stemming from him protecting individuals on a NYC subway train\".\n\nTensions around the case seep deep into issues confronting New Yorkers that have played into difficulties even selecting a jury to hear the case and what may be admitted into evidence. Last week, prosecutors reportedly asked the judge in the case to bar witnesses from calling Penny a \"hero\" or \"good Samaritan\".\n\nAccording to an email exchange between lawyers obtained by Gothamist , assistant district attorney Dafna Yoran said the use of those terms was subjective and \"the equivalent of a determination that the [defendant] was justified\".\n\nBut defense lawyer Thomas Kenniff countered that witnesses used those words soon after the incident. \"It describes what they perceived, Neely acting as the aggressor, and Mr Penny acting to defend and protect,\" he wrote.\n\nThe trial is expected to last six weeks."

      "text": "Daniel Penny's lawyers used a racist defense strategy and it worked\n\nTo argue that it was sickle cell trait - a condition that disproportionately affects Black people - killed Jordan Neely is dangerous and wrong\n\nM ake no mistake, Daniel Penny was acquitted this week of choking Jordan Neely to death on the New York City subway after his lawyers invoked some of the most institutionally insidious appeals to anti-Black racism around.\n\nPenny's defense lawyers and his legions of fans will say otherwise, of course. They'll point out that Penny, a 26-year-old former marine, was merely protecting himself and his fellow passengers from Neely, a 30-year-old unhoused Black man suffering from schizophrenia. And they'll argue that if race did matter in this trial, it was only Penny's race that mattered. Penny's attorneys (and the New York Post ) vehemently objected when the prosecution described Penny, who is white, as \"the white man\", as if pointing out the obvious was some underhanded masterpiece of racial guilt-tripping.\n\nBut don't believe what the lawyers said, no matter how loud they said it. Believe what they did.\n\nPenny's defense team paid an expert witness, Dr Satish Chundru, nearly $100,000 to testify at the trial, which had a mostly white jury composed of seven women and five men . By the time Chundru took the stand, the facts of Neely's death were clear. Neely entered an uptown F train on 1 May 2023 and, clearly in distress, began yelling that he was hungry, thirsty and ready to go to jail. Less than 30 seconds later , Penny had Neely in a chokehold called \"the blood choke\" that Penny's own marine trainer testified was used improperly by the ex-marine. That specific chokehold will render a person unconscious after only 13 seconds, the Marine Corps martial arts instructor testified , at which point one should stop. Penny held Neely in the chokehold for about six minutes, including a full 50 seconds after Neely had gone limp.\n\nBoth common sense and medical science would dictate precisely what the medical examiner found. Neely's cause of death was asphyxiation due to Penny's chokehold. But that's not what Dr Chundru determined. According to Chundru, Neely died of a mix of factors : his schizophrenia, drugs in his system, and the fact that he was a carrier of a genetic trait called sickle cell. \"This is not a chokehold death,\" Chundru testified .\n\nAnd here's the problem. Sickle cell trait is an inherited and normally asymptomatic blood condition that mostly means the person with the trait is simply a carrier of a specific gene. I'm personally a carrier of a related condition called thalassemia. (Full-blown sickle cell disease requires two sickle cell genes, not just the one carried by those who have sickle cell trait.) There is simply no good scientific evidence that the sickle cell trait plays any role in choking deaths. The American Society of Hematology even warns that deaths attributed to sickle cell crisis \"must be viewed with profound skepticism\".\n\nNow take a guess which population in the United States most often carries the sickle cell trait? Upwards of 10% of African Americans are carriers of the gene, far and away more than any other population in this country (and more than 90% of those with full-blown sickle cell disease in the United States are Black people). In 2021, the New York Times investigated the dubious practice of blaming the deaths of Black men at the hands of law enforcement on the sickle cell trait, finding at least 46 instances in what \"was almost certainly an undercount\".\n\nThis racially marked determination is very similar to the finding of \"excited delirium\", another racially coded finding used by authorities around the country. \"Excited delirium\" is a diagnosis not found in the DSM, the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the United States, but that hasn't stopped the authorities from invoking it. As Columbia University's Dr Paul Applebaum explains , excited delirium \"has been used to explain fatalities of people in police custody, especially deaths of young Black men, and to exculpate police officers from responsibility\".\n\nWhat findings of \"excited delirium\" and \"sickle cell trait\" both do is pathologize Black people, especially Black men, by turning their own bodies against them in a court of law. The news site Gothamist understood this in a report filed from Penny's trial. Penny's lawyers, Gothamist reported , \"argued that [Neely's] own cells starved him of oxygen - not their client's arm wrapped around his neck\".\n\nI don't know if the jury was swayed by Dr Chundru's testimony. We'll have to wait to hear directly from the jurors to know what transpired during their deliberations. But what I do know is that, in 2021, lawyers representing Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, sought the same sickle cell trait defense in a motion to dismiss the case against their client. It didn't work.\n\nWhat I do know is that, unlike the Derek Chauvin trial, this time around the use of the sickle cell defense has left the realm of law enforcement and migrated to the case of a citizen vigilante executing his own justice, which worries me owing to the expansion of its use.\n\nWhat I do know is that, again unlike Derek Chauvin, Daniel Penny is a free man today, indicating a serious rightwing turn in how our juries and the public are assessing high-profile cases about the deaths of Black men like George Floyd and Jordan Neely.\n\nWhat I do know is that Vice President-elect JD Vance posted on X.com \"thank God justice was done in this case. It was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place.\" And Rudy Giuliani posted : \"A great act of justice by 12 fair New Yorkers rejecting the racist, unjust charges of Bragg, the Soros imposed DA. Daniel Penny is a hero and deserves a medal from NYC and [Donald Trump].\" And Kyle Rittenhouse, acquitted in 2021 of shooting three people at an anti-racist protest in Wisconsin (killing two), posted \"Congratulations on your NOT GUILTY Daniel Penny!!!!\" and \"Self-defense is still alive in this country.\"\n\nWhat I do know is that an online Daniel Penny legal defense fund raised over $3m, including a $10,000 contribution from Vivek Ramaswamy and $5,000 from the musician Kid Rock.\n\nWhat I do know is that Jordan Neely never physically touched anyone in that subway car, and that there's a long history of white people killing Black people without due process in this country.\n\nWhat I do know is that Jordan Neely was hurting and hungry and now he's dead. And our criminal legal system has determined that this outcome is just fine.\n\nWhat I do know is that, while this verdict is seen as a vindication for the principle of self-defense, Jordan Neely was armed with nothing more than a muffin in his pocket. And the idea that all the Daniel Pennys in this city can exercise their vigilante violence on others in this city out of some undefined notion of \"safety\" and later rely on explicitly racist defense strategies like sickle cell trait, makes me feel like I and a lot of the rest of New York City are now living in a lot more danger.\n\nMoustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnist"

      "text": "Tragedy in Texas as Pandemic Border Policy Ends - and a Rush to Judgment\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe hate-crime narrative that emerged after migrants were killed in Brownsville ignored details about history and life in the border town.\n\nA man lights a candle at a memorial for eight migrants who were struck by a car and killed waiting at a bus stop on May 7, 2023, in Brownsville, Texas.\n\nThe man who crashed into a group of mostly Venezuelan migrants in Brownsville, Texas, on Sunday - killing eight of them - sounds in the media like a cipher, if not a monster. A video of the collision shows his vehicle knocking people down like matchsticks. A reporter I know told me that human gore and bone lay in the grass for hours afterward, putrefying in the heat and reeking. On Democracy Now! , a human rights activist called the killings a hate crime.\n\nThe driver was identified as George Alvarez. The police charged him with manslaughter, and they are investigating whether he committed hate crimes or acted intentionally. During a press conference, Brownsville Police Chief Felix Sauceda pointed to a list of Alvarez's numerous criminal priors. One was \"assaulting a public servant.\"\n\nSauceda failed to clarify that it was Brownsville police who assaulted Alvarez years ago, not the other way around. For contesting that false claim in court, Alvarez was once considered a civil rights hero. (More about this later.) Meanwhile, the narrative around the killings has ignored details about history and current conditions in Brownsville - about animus against people like Alvarez that spans generations. That hostility may bode badly in the coming weeks and months, in Texas and throughout the country as we reach the end of Title 42.\n\nTitle 42 is an obscure regulation that allows the U.S. to turn back people at borders during public health emergencies. Former President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant Rasputin, Stephen Miller, revived it in 2020 during the Covid crisis, to keep people from applying for asylum. President Joe Biden has since used it to excuse his administration's fear of aggressively crafting policy to help millions of asylum-seekers from South and Central America to move north to safety. On Thursday night, the rule expired. With its end and without robust federal assistance to help settle an anticipated wave of refugees, local communities are susceptible at worst to murderous hostility fueled by the right, and at best to pathological indifference.\n\nThe canary in the coal mine for these risks might be the chokehold. We've heard much about it lately in New York City, following the fatal strangulation of Black subway entertainer Jordan Neely , who had a history of mental illness, by white former Marine Daniel Penny, assisted by other riders. We've heard less about the chokehold's use against people like Alvarez, in Texas.\n\nBrownsville is an antique city. Downtown, it looks Caribbean the way New Orleans does, with French Quarter-style architecture dating from the 19th century. True to its appearance, the city's history is Southern. It served as a cotton-smuggling port for the Confederacy during the Civil War, and a monument to Jefferson Davis stood in a park until 2020 .\n\nThe city is 94 percent Latino, mostly Mexican American. Its poverty rate is over twice the national average. It is filled with Border Patrol and ICE agents, who take these jobs because they pay well over twice the local per capita income. In Brownsville, almost every Mexican American has a relative who is an immigration agent.\n\nI lived there during the Trump administration. I reported on endemic dehumanization of poor people by law enforcement, and not just against immigrants. In the whirlpool of my nice gym in a nice part of town, I used to hear muscled men and well-coiffed women joke about this injustice, particularly when it came to migrants. A small crew of local rights activists resisted this generalized nastiness, but they barely made a dent.\n\nI knew about the Ozanam Center , a nonprofit shelter for unhoused people and the site of Sunday's tragedy. The eight migrants were staying there before they were killed. It's been operating for decades. When I first moved to Brownsville to do reporting on immigration, an activist suggested that I go to Ozanam and offer some Hondurans $20 an hour plus lunch to help unload the moving van. I did so. After that, I heard nothing about the place. It was low key and out of the way.\n\nOzanam lies on the corner of Houston Road, which, along with nearby Travis and Crockett roads, are named after leaders of the 1835 Texas independence war with Mexico. Historians now concur that the rebellion was started by U.S. Southerners eager to import their Black chattel into Texas - where importation was illegal because Mexico owned Texas, and Mexico outlawed slavery.\n\nCrossing Houston Road is Minnesota Avenue, not far from Iowa, Indiana, and North Dakota avenues. Midwestern whites migrated to Brownsville in the early 20th century and leveled the Latino ranching economy, replacing it with agribusiness fruit and vegetable farms. Along with their crops, they institutionalized the segregation of Mexican Americans, whom they derided as mixed-race \" mongrels .\"\n\nToday, Alvarez lives in this neighborhood, where the houses near Ozanam are cramped and run-down. A friend who knows the area calls it \"a very sad place.\"\n\nAs a ninth-grade special-education student in 2005, Alvarez was arrested on suspicion of burglarizing a vehicle. He'd just turned 17 and, according to a later court filing, already was having problems with substance abuse. In his cell, he became frustrated about a broken phone and banged it. An officer who weighed 200 pounds threw 135-pound Alvarez to the ground and put him in a chokehold, with other officers assisting, the filing states. Alvarez was then charged with assaulting a public official, a major felony.\n\nThe incident had been captured on video, but the recording was never given to internal investigators. In a legal complaint he filed years later, Alvarez said he had feared that if he went to trial he would be convicted on the officer's word and given a long sentence. Still a minor, he pleaded guilty and agreed to eight years of probation. Within months, he'd lapsed into drug addiction and violated probation. He was sent to state prison for eight years.\n\nA few years later, according to court documents, another man, accused of the same crime by the same officer, found the recording of his own stay in detention, which proved the officer had lied and perpetrated the assault himself. Alerted that recordings existed, Alvarez demanded and received his and discovered the same lie. A judge ordered him freed after four years of hard time. He sued the city of Brownsville in federal court, a jury awarded him $2.3 million, and his case was listed in the University of Michigan's National Registry of Exonerations .\n\nBut Brownsville appealed the decision, and the case went to the notoriously conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans. Judges there overturned the jury's verdict, reasoning that prosecutors do not have to reveal exculpatory evidence if a defendant pleads guilty. Alvarez's lawyer went to the Supreme Court, which in 2019 declined to consider the case. Alvarez was denied a financial win that might have changed his life.\n\nAccording to his lawyer , he now works at an industrial sandblasting company and has six children. But he is covered with tattoos that mark a brown man on the border as a lumpen, a pariah. He's had additional arrests for driving while intoxicated and for assaulting other people, though most charges have been misdemeanors and most have been dismissed. He seems angry if not broken.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nOn Tuesday the Brownsville police said that toxicology tests were still being done on Alvarez, but early findings documented cocaine and marijuana in his system, as well as benzodiazepines - the ingredient in Valium, Xanax, Ativan, and Klonopin. These are highly addictive sedatives used to treat conditions including anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, and bipolar disorder. They alter reflexes and can make driving dangerous. High doses of cocaine can cause agitation, paranoia, aggression, and dizziness.\n\nAt about 8:29 on Sunday morning, Alvarez was driving a mile from his home. He ran a red light and barreled into the migrants. He himself was injured, and witnesses said he seemed disoriented. Some survivors kicked and beat him as he yelled anti-immigrant epithets. In subsequent interviews, some migrants cited these slurs as evidence that Alvarez committed a hate crime, and the press has pushed that narrative. Yet police have presented no evidence that Alvarez was motivated by hate, and none of his insults surpass the border shit talking I used to hear from the good citizens of Brownsville in the whirlpool.\n\nAlvarez's carnage may well turn out to have been an accident, and its location by a migrant shelter simply a horrible coincidence. Even so, publicity surrounding the crimes has suddenly turned Ozanam into a hate magnet. According to management, some people have blamed the organization's sheltering of migrants for the killings.

The mayor has lately scared straphangers about subway passengers with mental illness and argued that increased policing is necessary to control them. A civilian fatally choked Neely. But despite strong evidence that the killer acted as a vigilante, the district attorney's office did not announce until 10 days later that he would be criminally charged - and only for manslaughter.\n\nAcross the country, anti-immigrant rhetoric is hardening into policy.

      "text": "Daniel Penny Was Just Acquitted in Subway Choking Trial\n\nDaniel Penny awaits the jury's verdict in a New York criminal court in lower Manhattan. Andrea Renault/Zuma\n\nDaniel Penny, a former Marine who fatally choked a man on a New York City subway in May 2023, has been found not guilty of criminally negligent homicide. The trial, which began in late October, lasted seven weeks and featured more than 40 witnesses.\n\nThe death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old Black man who had a history of serious mental illness, immediately became a political flashpoint. It happened amid growing fears about public safety in the subways-which New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams pledged to address with increased police presence. To some, Penny's actions were an admirable intervention in an all-too-common public mental health episode that threatened to endanger bystanders. Republican Arizona Rep. Eli Crane recently said that he plans to nominate Penny for the Congressional Gold Medal, telling Fox News , \"Mr. Penny bravely stood in the gap to defy this corrupt system and protect his fellow Americans.\"\n\nBut for many advocates, Neely's death exemplified the city's inability to protect its most vulnerable citizens. Neely, who was homeless, had spent years cycling through the mental health and criminal justice systems. Jawanza Williams, director of organizing at the social justice organization VOCAL-NY, said that Neely had not just been failed by the city's social services, but also by the recent political rhetoric around homelessness.\n\n\"What happened to Jordan Neely was an indirect consequence of the way that people-in particular, Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul-were talking about people experiencing homelessness,\" Williams said while the trial was still ongoing. \"Creating this atmosphere of fear around people on the subway, especially those with mental health conditions, dehumanized them, and it made it more likely for people to engage in violence against them.\"\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Neely entered a crowded uptown F train in Lower Manhattan, declaring that he was hungry, thirsty, and ready to go to jail or die. Penny, an architecture student who served four years in the Marine Corps, was already on the train, heading to the gym. His defense lawyers would later argue that when Penny approached Neely from behind and put him into a chokehold, it was to protect others.\n\nA freelance journalist captured a video of the several-minute-long encounter, which eventually went viral. In it, Penny can be seen lying on the train floor with his arm around Neely's neck. Penny continued his hold until well after the subway arrived at the next station and another man grabbed Neely's arms. A bystander can be heard urging Penny to let go, saying, \"You're gonna kill him now.\" Neely became unconscious during the encounter and was later pronounced dead.\n\nThe incident sparked subway protests calling for Penny's arrest, with some describing it as a racist act of vigilante justice. Yusef Salaam, a New York City Council member who was wrongly convicted as a teenager of the 1989 rape of a woman in Central Park, called it a \"lynching in the public square.\"\n\nPenny was eventually charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. It led some prominent Republicans to rally around Penny,  with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis calling him a \"Good Samaritan.\" His legal defense fund raised millions.\n\nNeely was once a Michael Jackson impersonator, dancing in costume on the subways. His early life was marked by tragedy-his mother was murdered when he was 14-and he was eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia. Reporting from New York magazine tracked Neely's descent into drug use and homelessness. Outreach workers became familiar with Neely, who was at one point on the city's list of homeless people in the most dire need of services. Along with a series of minor charges, Neely had also been accused of assault-including an instance when he punched a woman on the subway.\n\nAt the trial, prosecutors laid out a narrow path toward conviction. Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran said in her closing statement that it was \"laudable\" for Penny to intervene initially, describing Neely as behaving in an \"extremely threatening manner.\" But, prosecutors argued, Penny's actions became unlawful when he continued the chokehold after Neely was subdued and passengers had exited the train.\n\nDefense attorneys have emphasized Penny's character-his platoon sergeant agreed during testimony that he was \"calm and peaceful\"-and argued that he did not mean to kill Neely. Penny's lawyer Steven Raiser said that Penny had applied the chokehold in a \"less aggressive\" way because he did not intend for Neely to lose consciousness. They have also tried to cast doubt on findings from the city's medical examiner, who determined that Penny's hold had killed Neely. The defense's forensic pathologist testified that a genetic condition and the use of synthetic marijuana contributed to Neely's death.\n\n\"The government is scapegoating the one man who was willing to stand up at the moment he was needed,\" Raiser said during his closing statement.\n\nAfter nearly three days of deliberation, the jury was unable to come to a consensus on the most serious charge of manslaughter. On Friday, the judge dismissed the manslaughter charge to allow them to move to deliberate the charge of criminally negligent homicide. The acquittal came just hours after the jury reconvened on Monday.\n\nLast week, while the criminal trial was ongoing, Neely's father, Andre Zachary, filed a wrongful death suit against Penny. \"It really, really hurts,\" Zachary told reporters outside of the courthouse after the verdict was announced, according to the Associated Press . \"I had enough of this. The system is rigged.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Daniel Penny Charged With Second-Degree Manslaughter\n\nAP/Jeenah Moon\n\nAmid intense anger and calls for justice, the man who put 30-year-old Jordan Neely in a deadly chokehold surrendered to police Friday morning to face a second-degree manslaughter charge.\n\nDaniel Penny, the 24-year-old ex-marine who choked and killed Neely in a subway car last week, turned himself into the New York Police Department's 5th Precinct. In a video recording from the deadly May 1 encounter, Penny was seen placing Neely, an unhoused street performer, in a chokehold for several minutes as another person restrained Neely's arms. A bystander is heard warning Penny, \"If you suffocate him, that's it. You don't want to catch a murder charge.\" Penny has alleged that Neely had been \"aggressively threatening\" toward Penny and other passengers. A witness contradicted that characterization , claiming instead that Neely had been asking for food and hadn't physically harmed anyone in the lead-up to Penny's attack.\n\nNeely's shocking death has divided New Yorkers. Mental health advocates and city leaders have called for Penny's arrest, in addition to increased protections for the unhoused and mentally ill, while others have pointed to the incident as evidence of mounting concerns over public safety. New York Mayor Eric Adams, who was criticized for his initial milquetoast response to Neely's death, said Thursday that Neely's \"life mattered.\"\n\n\"One thing we can control is how our city responds to this tragedy,\" he said in a speech, adding, \"One thing we can say for sure: Jordan Neely did not deserve to die.\"\n\nThe city's response to Neely's death, and what it might mean for future policies regarding the serious lack of mental health resources, is sure to be closely watched. At the close of last year, Adams announced a plan to task police officers to remove people who appeared mentally ill off the streets. But the policy has proved divisive.\n\nIn his announcement last month, Adams appeared to be under the impression that the state's commitment of 50 new beds for city hospitals would be enough to provide one for \"everyone\" who needed it. That, of course, is nothing short of a delusion; at least 60,000 people are homeless in New York, with thousands living unsheltered. A large majority of the unhoused suffer from mental illness.

      "text": "Donald Trump Hasn't Said Much About Daniel Penny. He Doesn't Need To.\n\nPhelan M. Ebenhack via AP\n\nIn the weeks since a 24-year-old Long Island man named Daniel Penny killed Jordan Neely in a New York City subway car, the response from the Republican Party's right wing has been as consistent as it is chilling. These politicians and commentators seem to believe that Neely-a homeless former Michael Jackson impersonator who was reportedly berating passengers-deserved to die. Or put another way: Penny's fear of his fellow passenger simply mattered more than Neely's own right to live.\n\nAs my colleague Noah Lanard wrote last week, Republican presidential candidates have not just praised Penny, but raised money to help the former Marine fight his charge of manslaughter. Penny was a \"Good Samaritan,\" said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. \"Let's show this Marine...America's got his back.\"\n\nAnother GOP candidate, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, donated $10,000 to Penny's defense fund. It was time, he said, to \"restore the rule of law in America.\"\n\nThere is one notable exception in all of this, though: Donald Trump. The former president has, by his standards, been conspicuously quiet on the subway homicide. This is a man who once took out a full-page newspaper ad demanding New York state bring back the death penalty so it could kill the teenagers accused of raping a white woman in Central Park. (They turned out to have been wrongfully accused.) As president, and ever since, he demonized the homeless in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York, and talked about using the federal government to clear those residents off the streets. Trump was, and still is, at the vanguard of a broader conservative war on cities, and he has allied himself with people-such as Kyle Rittenhouse and the McCloskeys of St. Louis -who embody the right-wing yearning for vigilantes to use violence, or the threat of violence, against liberal lawlessness. Or simply against liberals exercising constitutional rights in settings that conservatives don't like.\n\nIf Trump has been conspicuously quiet on all of this, it's not because he's lost a step, and it's definitely not because of his compassion for Jordan Neely-it's more that he doesn't need to say anything. A campaign like this is how he wins. Every expression of extrajudicial bloodlust from a party that quite recently nominated Willard \"Mitt\" Romney, every Bane-like pronouncement from a tennis-playing shitposter , is an affirmation of who the party belongs to. Right now, all of his rivals are tripping over themselves to reinforce the supremacy of Trump's politics, and to tear down the very prosecutor, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, who just indicted Trump-the man they have to defeat. If there's one thing America's most notorious grifter understands, it's the value of a free ride.

You can tell by my past and all my travels and adventures around the world,\" said Penny. \"I was actually planning a road trip through Africa before this happened.\"\n\nNeely's family said the interview amounted to nothing more than a pro-Penny press release .\n\n\"We don't care how many vacations he's been on,\" said Donte Mills, an attorney representing the Neely family, to NBC News. \"We want to know why he didn't let go of that chokehold until Jordan was dead.\"\n\nOn May 1, Penny, who is white, put Neely-a Black unhoused man who was allegedly ranting at passengers on the F-train-in a deadly chokehold. Neely reportedly had a long history of mental health struggles that were exacerbated after his mother's murder in 2007. On May 12, Penny was formally charged with second-degree manslaughter.\n\nWhile Penny might claim not to be a white supremacist or a \"vigilante,\" the far right is enamored with him. Since the reveal of his identity, many right-wing trolls alongside your more run-of-the-mill conservatives, have propped up Penny as a \" hero. \" In the political sphere, high-profile Republicans, like Gov. Ron DeSantis and Rep. Matt Gaetz, have openly supported Penny, both vocally and financially. As my colleague Noah Lanard previously reported Penny's supporters have raised over $2 million dollars in donations via the Christian crowdfunding website, GiveSendGo.\n\nArguing that you're not racist because you were planning a road trip to Africa is silly. Anyone who's ever cracked open a history book would know that racists have long journeyed to the continent-just look at any of the countless British colonies in African nations or the bloody legacy of the transatlantic slave trade .\n\nIf Penny was looking for sympathy, that explanation is not helping.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump's Republican Rivals Are Funneling Money to Daniel Penny\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy speaks at an event in Iowa last month. Charlie Neibergall/AP\n\nAfter Daniel Penny was charged on Friday with manslaughter for choking Jordan Neely to death on the F train, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) tweeted a link to donate to Penny's legal defense fund. \"We stand with Good Samaritans like Daniel Penny,\" DeSantis wrote. \"Let's show this Marine...America's got his back.\"\n\nOther Republicans followed suit. \"I agree with this. Just donated,\" Vivek Ramaswamy, the self-funding presidential candidate, responded on Sunday. \"More of us should. We must restore the rule of law in America.\" Ramaswamy gave $10,000, so far the second largest of the more than 46,000 donations totaling over two million dollars sent via the Christian crowdfunding site GiveSendGo.\n\nEarlier this month, Neely, a thirty-year-old unhoused man in the midst of a mental health crisis, made some of his fellow passengers feel uncomfortable and potentially unsafe. A 24-year-old former Marine came from behind and put him in a fatal chokehold for about 15 minutes, even though a bystander said 98 out of 100 people would have waited to see \"one more sign that indicates aggression.\" DeSantis and others on the right responded by comparing Penny to the Samaritan who provided aid to a man robbers beat and left to die.\n\nAs his rivals defended Penny, Donald Trump remained silent on his highly active social media feed-avoiding a chance to attack Alvin Bragg, the New York District Attorney who charged both him and Penny. When asked about Neely's death in an interview published Monday, Trump was unusually reserved in his support of Penny. \"So, I haven't seen the tapes,\" Trump said. \"I won't make a definitive [statement] but it looks to me like the people in that car were in great danger.\"\n\nThis isn't totally unprecedented. Force was often justified for Trump-a man who'd once taken out a full-page ad in the New York Times that implied that five Black and Latino teenagers, who were later exonerated, should be executed-but it wasn't always. In May 2020, four days after Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd, Trump did not defend what was captured on video and said the Justice Department should investigate as quickly as possible. \"It's a terrible thing. We all saw what we saw,\" Trump said . \"Should never be allowed to happen a thing like that. But we're determined that justice be served.\" That summer, he wondered why a Wisconsin police officer had shot Jacob Blake in the back multiple times. \"Couldn't you have wrestled him?\" Trump asked . \"But they choke. Just like in a golf tournament, they miss a three-foot putt.\"\n\nTrump's stance caused some backlash. An editor at Chronicles , a far-right magazine dedicated to defending \"the traditions of America and the West,\" quickly called Trump's comments on the death of Neely \"pathetic.\"\n\nDiverging from Trump, some on the right have attempted to elevate Penny to ever higher levels of valor.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) called him a \"subway Superman.\" A New York Post editor wrote that the \"only difference between Daniel Penny and the heroic passengers aboard United 93 is he's been charged with manslaughter by a usually soft-on-crime Manhattan DA.\"\n\nOn Twitter, Gavin Wax, the head of the New York Young Republican Club captioned a tweet of Penny in handcuffs: \"This man is a hero.\" Wax then shared a reply from an anonymous user that claimed Penny \"is no different than the frontiersmen that settled America - brave and fearless against foes.\"\n\nHe is no different than the frontiersmen  that settled America - brave and fearless against foes #DanielPennyIsAHERO 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/cKojFKrUfg\n\n- DesertWind (@brenner_colleen) May 12, 2023\n\nThe post effectively adopted a darker narrative, that Penny, who has said he did not intend to harm anyone, was a vigilante eager to kill. The only difference was that this was now presented as something to be celebrated.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Activate your online access\n\nWhen social structures corrode, as they are doing now, they trigger desperate deeds like Mangione's, and rightist vigilantes like Penny.\n\nBrandishing a juvenile, chicken-scratch graph, right-wing pundit and neoconservative toady Scott Jennings offered a simple analysis during a recent CNN roundtable. \"Here's my chart: The good guys today, Daniel Penny. The bad guys, Luigi Mangione,\" he proclaimed . \"People on the left can't seem to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys.\"\n\nYes, Jennings's crass and essentialist framing is baby-brained. But in linking Penny, who was acquitted this week in the killing of unhoused man Jordan Neely on a New York City subway in 2023, and Mangione, who has been charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, he was making a connection that's worth examining.\n\nAfter all, though they come from seemingly different philosophical places-and though the societal reaction to their actions has differed dramatically-there are similarities between Penny and Mangione.\n\nBoth are 26-year-old vigilantes who engaged in shocking public acts of violence. Their actions are very much open to partisan interpretation. The view of their conduct seems dependent on where you fall within the socioeconomic map. And though Mangione's violence may feel more sympathetic than Penny's, both are deeply entwined within the long history of American vigilantism-a history that has been detrimental to building relevant working-class politics. When social structures transition or corrode, as they are doing in the 21st century, they trigger deeds like Mangione's or Penny's-neither of which will satisfy the multitude of unresolved catastrophes that are unfolding.\n\nFor those on the hard right, Penny has become a kind of reactionary Batman, especially following his acquittal on Monday. ( He will be a guest of Vice President-elect JD Vance's at a football game this weekend.) In this deranged narrative, Penny should be hailed for his bravery because the government has ceded control of public spaces to a roaming horde of violent vagrants.\n\n\"Given the...thousands of untreated mentally ill drug addicts who are roaming the streets, it is a virtual certainty that every couple of days, every couple of weeks, one of them will assault an innocent pedestrian, possibly lethally,\" Heather Mac Donald, a fellow at the right-wing think tank the Manhattan Institute and author of several pro-cop polemics, said in a Tuesday discussion with Megyn Kelly concerning Penny. \"It's not a chance, it is a certainty. And the city and state do nothing. They spend all their money on vanity left-wing projects.\" Put more plainly, Mac Donald and her contemporaries believe that since the feckless administrative state has become ideologically corrupt, it's up to the Daniel Pennys of the world to restore order.\n\nBy contrast, Mangione has become a Travis Bickle-esque hero for the millions of Americans enraged at the country's healthcare system. But it's not just the anti-capitalist left praising Mangione. More apolitical bystanders seem to view the assassination of a multimillionaire healthcare CEO as a performance of righteous justice. (This ideological muddle chimes with Mangione's seemingly inchoate politics.)\n\nComment sections on right-wing content chastised any criticism of Mangione because, for many across the political spectrum, the tragedy of the hundreds of thousands of citizens who have and will die because of healthcare deficiencies is too blatant. And the fact that such deficiencies have been artificially inflated for profit by those like Brian Thompson makes Mangione's vigilantism even more appealing to people.\n\nDespite maintaining a social media profile rife with manosphere influencers like wellness crank Andrew Huberman and \"heterodox\" right-wing sycophant podcaster Lex Friedman, Mangione's alleged homicide ironically falls into the anarchist tradition known as \"propaganda of the deed.\" In this theory of political change, violence is carried out against the ruling class in the hope of provoking a wider social insurrection.\n\nAdditionally, as articulated by anarchist theorists, this violence is morally virtuous and includes the added bonus of petrifying the elite. Famous examples that come to mind are the multitude of failed assassination attempts against oil baron John D. Rockefeller in 1914, the 1920 demolition of Wall Street by Italian anarchists, and the 1972 bombing of the Pentagon by the Weather Underground. Most notably, all were conducted during moments when left-wing political organizing was besieged by federal law enforcement.\n\nWhile Mangione's manifesto does not contain the radical fervor of his predecessors, the document echoes many of the same sentiments. \"Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming,\" Mangione writes. \"The reality is, these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allowed them to get away with it.... it is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play. Evidently, I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty.\"\n\nAccording to Mangione, because the healthcare industry engages in widespread pilfering and social murder with impunity, he was left with no other choice but to even the score. On a superficial level, Mangione seems to have succeeded: Healthcare firms have ramped up security and have begun removing photos of their C-suite vanguard from websites. And on Wednesday, New York City police warned healthcare executives that they had discovered an \"online 'hit list.'\"\n\nPenny's behavior, meanwhile, echoes the more explicitly right-wing ethics of a long-held tradition of vigilantism-one that is often invoked in moments of political turmoil and change. During increased radical agitation in the late 19th century, everyday citizens were encouraged to violently resist left-wing mayhem believed to have been sparked by immigrant revolutionaries.\n\n\"If the communists in this country are counting on the looseness of our police system and the tendency to proceed against criminals by due process of law, and hope on that account to receive more leniency than in Europe, they have ignored some of the most significant episodes in American history,\" an 1875 issue of the Chicago Daily Tribune trumpeted . \"There are no people so prone as the American to take the law into their own hands when the sanctity of human life is threatened and the rights of property invaded in a manner that cannot be adequately reached and punished by the tortuous course of the law.\"\n\nThis energy would be mobilized countless times in the 20th century. At the height of working-class crusades waged against capital in the late 1910s and early 1920s, wealthy business magnates would organize a litany of vigilante, reactionary paramilitary groups like the American Defense Society, the American Vigilant Intelligence Federation, the Black Legion, and the Knights of Liberty. These organizations were founded on the principle of \"law and order\" and \"100 percent Americanism,\" as the Constitution of one such group, the American Legion, expressed . The mission was \"to combat the autocracy of both the classes and the masses.\" In other words, the insatiable mob needed to be put down.\n\nA more palpable, modern example of Penny's lineage lies in the chaos that ensued during the Rodney King riots in 1992. Like Kyle Rittenhouse during the George Floyd protests, local Korean American business owners became right-wing icons when images emerged of them standing atop their property fending off looters and protesters with shotguns. In the dim caverns of the conservative mind palace, complex political emergencies like state-sanctioned brutality, unfettered financial corruption, and rampant social austerity melt away when viewed through the lens of \"Good Guy vs. Bad Guy.\"\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nIt's best to understand the Penny and Mangione phenomena as being symptomatic of broader structural rot. Those at the highest echelons of power have allowed the intersecting crises of economic inequality, housing shortages, and lack of medical care to fester. That's the kind of societal breakdown that other moments of vigilantism have often reflected. On the left, they've grown out of everything from the putrid working conditions of the early 20th century to the industrialized carnage of Vietnam. On the right, they're rooted in backlashes whipped up during times of intense social upheaval.\n\nWe should be worried, however, that Penny's murder may prove more influential politically than Mangione's. Vigilante attacks against the unhoused are becoming more prominent as the politics of resentment continue to simmer. The same can be said for the likes of ad hoc border patrols who have recruited heavily to combat the manufactured threat of asylum seekers. With a second Trump term-and a likely exacerbation of the aforementioned crises-it wouldn't be surprising if loyal right-wing forces were deputized against dissenters.\n\nMeanwhile, Mangione may prove to be more of a generator of memes than of movements. The antidote that he may have sought if the left were stronger would have been labor-centered politics that prioritize mass organizing over individual acts of rage. It is at that site of collective action where we will ultimately topple the bloodsucking ghouls who operate our healthcare system-not through the undertakings of any one disaffected gunman.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

The right-wing celebrations of Penny echo a violent, racist past.\n\nThe guests in Donald Trump's luxury box at Saturday's Army-Navy game in Landover, Maryland, were right-wing A-listers. They included Elon Musk, JD Vance, Ron DeSantis, and the GOP's man of the moment : Daniel Penny. (If Derek Chauvin hadn't been convicted of killing George Floyd, he probably would've been there too.)\n\nIn February, Penny, an ex-Marine, killed an unhoused Black man on the New York City subway. He choked to death a slender 30-year-old street performer with preexisting mental health concerns having a breakdown on the F train. His name was Jordan Neely. Penny said that he saw Neely as someone potentially violent and was therefore compelled to hold him in what's known as a \"coward's choke\" (from behind, without warning). He held that Marine-trained choke hold for six full minutes, even after Neely slumped down and lost consciousness, even after other subway riders begged him to loosen his grip.\n\nBefore Neely's body was cold, Penny became a right-wing, white-power folk hero. He was the Marine \"standing up\" to the crazies on the big, bad urban subway; his New York City \"persecution\"-like Trump's-was a sign of a liberal legal system off the rails. But unlike Trump, Penny was acquitted by a New York City jury. It was a case where the facts were never in doubt: The only question was whether the jury-in a long, ignominious, American tradition-would give its approval to what should be called a lynching.\n\nThe word \"lynching\" is used intentionally here, with all the implied historical weight.\n\nIt is an accurate descriptor for a killing that was public (filmed and widely shared on social media) and that many cheered as an act of necessary social and racial discipline. The online revelry accompanying this verdict is a digital equivalent of the old black-and-white Jim Crow lynching postcards, where a sea of white faces and white smiles surround a Black man's body-neck twisted obscenely-hanging from a tree. Lynchings are not just executions; they're celebrations of terror.\n\nVance, with Trump's approval, apparently decided that Penny hadn't been feted enough and that there was no better time or place to further honor a killer than at this particular football game. The Army-Navy game is-per tradition-the sole focus of the college football world. Trump's presence only added to the coverage. (Biden did not attend.) With a combined record of 19-4, both teams took the field in exceptional form. But the mythos of the 125th Army-Navy game transcends records. It is one of the oldest rivalries in all of football, a contest that dates back to when people arrived at rickety stadiums by horse and carriage. There are films, documentaries, and best-selling books that have waxed rhapsodic about the patriotic purity of a spectacle that has involved future NFL Hall of Famers, future four-star generals, and, most wrenchingly, future casualties of war, disproportionately Black and Latino since World War II, killed thousands of miles from home not long after they took the field. The idea that glory and defeat on a football field mirrors the glory and death on the battlefield has been media catnip for more than a century. (Penny never fought on a battlefield nor killed anyone overseas; he only fulfilled his military training on the New York City subway.)\n\nIt is impossible to comprehend Trump's invitation to Penny without considering the incoming president's refrain that the \"true enemy\" of the United States is within our borders. How will Republicans defeat this \" enemy within ?\" They are telling us. We know they are building prison camps for immigrants. We know Trump wants to activate the armed forces in our cities. We know his administration will be revoking education visas and deporting student agitators for a free Palestine. And now we know that its \"law and order\" agenda will not be confined to providing immunity to the next-generation Derek Chauvins on the police force but will extend to celebrating the right of people they like to kill the people they don't. We saw it with George Zimmerman. We saw it with Kyle Rittenhouse. We see it with Daniel Penny. They are three men whose capacity to kill made them right-wing cause célèbres.\n\nAs for the game, Navy won in a romp, 31-13. After their victory, the players for the Midshipmen cheered, hugged, and cried. They are true and worthy victors. Many of them looked like someone that Penny-or someone inspired by his fame-might decide to kill one day on the subway. After all, the Super Bowl is in February, tickets are going fast, and now we know the key to getting a killer seat next to Trump.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nDaniel Penny, the man who choked another man to death on the F train on May 1, was finally arrested and charged with a crime late last week. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged Penny with manslaughter in the second degree for killing Jordan Neely. In New York , second-degree manslaughter occurs when a person \"recklessly causes the death of another person.\" Different states use different words and phrases to describe the various levels of criminal homicide. In New York State, the criminal code is fairly straightforward. The charge of \"murder,\" be it in the first or second degree, requires the killer to have engaged in a degree of premeditation: The criminal intended to kill the victim. The charge of first-degree manslaughter also requires a degree of intentionality, but to harm, not necessarily to kill; that is, the criminal intended to hurt the victim, badly, but did not necessarily mean to cause their death. Second-degree manslaughter only requires the intent to do an inherently dangerous or reckless thing. To explain the difference, I like to think of various ways I could be killed by my version of a stereotypical, gun-toting Texan. If the Texan says, \"Yee-haw, I shot that loud man in the face,\" and I die, that's murder. If the Texan says, \"I shot that loud man's tires out when he tried to drive away, git 'er done,\" and I die from the car crash, that's first-degree manslaughter. If the Texan says, \"I fired two warning shots into the sky to shut that man up, 'cause I don't know nothing about civilized debate, or gravity,\" and the bullets land on me and I die, that's second-degree manslaughter. There has been a lot of debate about the DA's charge, because we live in a world where some people see a video of a white man choking a Black man to death and argue that no crime has been committed. Others, including Neely's own family, believe the charge is too lenient. That's not surprising: If you saw your family member get murdered (in the colloquial sense) on the subway, you'd also want the word \"murder\" to be included in the legal charges against the killer. Attorneys for Neely's family say they asked the DA to consider a charge of murder in the second degree. The problem is that, based on what we know publicly, there's just not enough evidence to support a murder charge. It's very difficult to prove premeditation in this case: It doesn't appear that Penny was \"lying in wait\" for Neely or some other unfortunate homeless person to come along. Some might infer an \"intent to kill\" from Penny's use of a deadly choke hold, or the length of time he used it, but proving this intent is difficult, especially when Penny, a trained Marine, will argue that he did not mean to kill Neely. Other passengers on the train will also likely testify that they didn't think Penny was killing Neely.

I know that a choke hold is an inherently dangerous maneuver intended to cause grievous harm to its victims, but do I trust a jury of 12 random New Yorkers to see it that way? We live in a culture suffused with Wrestlemania -style popular media that shows people who are \"choked to sleep\" getting back up after the commercial break, as if nothing has happened. Choking is what you do when you don't want to kill somebody, according to action movies. I have to assume that a jury of my peers is as ignorant about the frailty of the human windpipe as Rambo. Comparatively speaking, second-degree manslaughter should be easy to prove. Was Jordan Neely killed? Yes. Was his death caused by Daniel Penny? Yes. Were Penny's actions reckless? Yes, it is inherently, obviously reckless to choke someone. This is pretty much what second-degree manslaughter is designed for: Maybe you didn't mean to kill that person, but you did something that could have killed him, and he died, so now you go to jail. That's how things should work in a civil society. Current Issue View our current issue Unfortunately, it will not be as easy as all that, because we do not live in a civil society. Instead, we live in a society with people like David French, who frames uncivilized vigilante killings as some kind of expected social reaction to subway crime. I wish I were making this up. But in a convoluted opinion piece in The New York Times , French managed to cast some form of blame for Neely's killing on everybody-including Neely himself, New York City social services, the criminal justice system that didn't punish Neely enough, and the breakdown of social order-except perhaps Penny, whose actions French suggests may be justified as a defense of others. French's closing flourish is pure incoherent nonsense: \"The best way to resolve these problems isn't through jury trials of those, like Penny, who take it upon themselves to intervene (as necessary as those trials may be) but rather through the preservation of public order by the just application of the law and the generous provision of public support.\" Excuse me? The \"best\" way to solve social problems is not through jury trials of people who take it upon themselves to kill people on the subway, but rather through applications of laws? I have an idea, how about we start with the just application of laws that prohibit killing people on the subway? It seems to me that, if we want to preserve public order, a key feature of that order would be prosecuting people who kill other people on mass transit. The astute reader will note that French begrudgingly agrees that a trial of Penny is probably necessary, but consider the likely reason he says this: because French knows that the alternative to a jury trial is somebody visiting the kind of vigilante justice on Penny that Penny forced on Neely. Funny how that works. French does what so many of Penny's defenders have been doing for the past two weeks. He brings up Neely's criminal past (a past none of the other riders, including Penny, knew about before he was killed). He mentions other anecdotes of people who have been assaulted on the subway in the past, as if homicide can be justified because of things that happened to other people. He even includes himself as a victim-not of an actual crime but of a violation nearly as severe to bourgeois elites: He's been made to feel uncomfortable on the subway, you see. He writes: \"I'm a former resident of New York City and a frequent visitor. I can easily think of tense moments when I had to ask myself whether it would be more or less dangerous for me and others if I stayed in my seat.\" I guess I can also call myself a frequent tension observer on the New York City subway, but I do not recall ever asking myself, \"I wonder if I should kill this homeless man making me super uncomfortable right now? He hasn't done anything yet, but he's poor, and you know how they get when they're all hungry and stuff.\" All of these retributive ideations are done for the sake of painting Penny as a man who was simply trying to protect other passengers from a potentially violent individual. Not an actually violent individual-Neely wasn't violent when he was killed; only the people in French's anecdotes and imaginations were actually violent. But here's the thing: Penny is not a Precog . He is not allowed to violently act on his supposed clairvoyance. We know that Penny committed a crime because we know that there were nonviolent ways to handle the situation that Penny, and others on the subway, didn't appear to even try. The easiest way to diffuse the situation on the train that day would likely have been to offer Neely a sandwich. Or a bottle of water. Or five bucks. That's still the most shocking thing about this whole situation. The \"hostile\" and \"aggressive\" things that Neely said on the train were, \"I don't have food. I don't have drink. I'm fed up.\" And in response, nobody thought to give him food or water or money. None of Penny's defenders can explain why choking a man to death is defending other passengers on the subway, but giving a desperate man some indication of compassion and charity is not. What's lost on French and others defending Penny is that Neely was a passenger on that subway too. He was the passenger who was violently assaulted. But no one helped him. No vigilante Batman appeared to say \"In addition to being a secret ninja, I'm also rich. Here's 10 bucks...\" Nobody parted with a bag of cashews in their purse or a bottle of Poland Spring they hadn't finished from lunch. French thinks that the way to save Neely from Penny would have been to keep Neely in jail. I think anybody carrying small bills could have saved Neely that day. More from Mystal One Man Killed Jordan Neely-but We All Failed Him Elie Mystal Tennessee Republicans Are Showing Exactly How Deep American Racism Goes Elie Mystal The world in which Penny keeps his ass on his wallet but wraps his arms around Neely's neck, and gets away with it, is simply untenable. Nobody wants to live in a world where people can be killed based on what they might do, or based on their perceived threat to others. Should people be allowed to kill a barbecue-splattered white man in camouflage gear and a MAGA hat based on what they know the Proud Boys are capable of? Do their actions become \"justified\" if the MAGA man says, \"Trump won the election and I'm prepared to go to jail to see him reinstated\"? Or maybe someone sees a white boy on the subway playing Call of Duty , and after he loses his game, he starts angrily shouting: \"This is why I don't have a girlfriend!\" Can they kill him then, based on his likelihood to commit domestic terrorism? Nobody wants that. The pro-Penny types want that only if poor people or people of color are the ones who can be killed because of their perceived threat. Justifying Daniel Penny's behavior doesn't lead to more safety but to lawless chaos. Penny has to be prosecuted for this crime, and should be convicted. Penny behaved recklessly, and his recklessness killed somebody else. Treating the situation as anything else is madness.\n\nDifferent states use different words and phrases to describe the various levels of criminal homicide. In New York State, the criminal code is fairly straightforward. The charge of \"murder,\" be it in the first or second degree, requires the killer to have engaged in a degree of premeditation: The criminal intended to kill the victim. The charge of first-degree manslaughter also requires a degree of intentionality, but to harm, not necessarily to kill; that is, the criminal intended to hurt the victim, badly, but did not necessarily mean to cause their death. Second-degree manslaughter only requires the intent to do an inherently dangerous or reckless thing. To explain the difference, I like to think of various ways I could be killed by my version of a stereotypical, gun-toting Texan. If the Texan says, \"Yee-haw, I shot that loud man in the face,\" and I die, that's murder. If the Texan says, \"I shot that loud man's tires out when he tried to drive away, git 'er done,\" and I die from the car crash, that's first-degree manslaughter.

But in a convoluted opinion piece in The New York Times , French managed to cast some form of blame for Neely's killing on everybody-including Neely himself, New York City social services, the criminal justice system that didn't punish Neely enough, and the breakdown of social order-except perhaps Penny, whose actions French suggests may be justified as a defense of others. French's closing flourish is pure incoherent nonsense: \"The best way to resolve these problems isn't through jury trials of those, like Penny, who take it upon themselves to intervene (as necessary as those trials may be) but rather through the preservation of public order by the just application of the law and the generous provision of public support.\" Excuse me? The \"best\" way to solve social problems is not through jury trials of people who take it upon themselves to kill people on the subway, but rather through applications of laws? I have an idea, how about we start with the just application of laws that prohibit killing people on the subway? It seems to me that, if we want to preserve public order, a key feature of that order would be prosecuting people who kill other people on mass transit. The astute reader will note that French begrudgingly agrees that a trial of Penny is probably necessary, but consider the likely reason he says this: because French knows that the alternative to a jury trial is somebody visiting the kind of vigilante justice on Penny that Penny forced on Neely. Funny how that works. French does what so many of Penny's defenders have been doing for the past two weeks. He brings up Neely's criminal past (a past none of the other riders, including Penny, knew about before he was killed). He mentions other anecdotes of people who have been assaulted on the subway in the past, as if homicide can be justified because of things that happened to other people. He even includes himself as a victim-not of an actual crime but of a violation nearly as severe to bourgeois elites: He's been made to feel uncomfortable on the subway, you see. He writes: \"I'm a former resident of New York City and a frequent visitor. I can easily think of tense moments when I had to ask myself whether it would be more or less dangerous for me and others if I stayed in my seat.\" I guess I can also call myself a frequent tension observer on the New York City subway, but I do not recall ever asking myself, \"I wonder if I should kill this homeless man making me super uncomfortable right now? He hasn't done anything yet, but he's poor, and you know how they get when they're all hungry and stuff.\" All of these retributive ideations are done for the sake of painting Penny as a man who was simply trying to protect other passengers from a potentially violent individual. Not an actually violent individual-Neely wasn't violent when he was killed; only the people in French's anecdotes and imaginations were actually violent. But here's the thing: Penny is not a Precog . He is not allowed to violently act on his supposed clairvoyance. We know that Penny committed a crime because we know that there were nonviolent ways to handle the situation that Penny, and others on the subway, didn't appear to even try. The easiest way to diffuse the situation on the train that day would likely have been to offer Neely a sandwich. Or a bottle of water. Or five bucks. That's still the most shocking thing about this whole situation. The \"hostile\" and \"aggressive\" things that Neely said on the train were, \"I don't have food. I don't have drink. I'm fed up.\" And in response, nobody thought to give him food or water or money. None of Penny's defenders can explain why choking a man to death is defending other passengers on the subway, but giving a desperate man some indication of compassion and charity is not. What's lost on French and others defending Penny is that Neely was a passenger on that subway too. He was the passenger who was violently assaulted. But no one helped him. No vigilante Batman appeared to say \"In addition to being a secret ninja, I'm also rich. Here's 10 bucks...\" Nobody parted with a bag of cashews in their purse or a bottle of Poland Spring they hadn't finished from lunch. French thinks that the way to save Neely from Penny would have been to keep Neely in jail. I think anybody carrying small bills could have saved Neely that day. More from Mystal One Man Killed Jordan Neely-but We All Failed Him Elie Mystal Tennessee Republicans Are Showing Exactly How Deep American Racism Goes Elie Mystal The world in which Penny keeps his ass on his wallet but wraps his arms around Neely's neck, and gets away with it, is simply untenable. Nobody wants to live in a world where people can be killed based on what they might do, or based on their perceived threat to others. Should people be allowed to kill a barbecue-splattered white man in camouflage gear and a MAGA hat based on what they know the Proud Boys are capable of? Do their actions become \"justified\" if the MAGA man says, \"Trump won the election and I'm prepared to go to jail to see him reinstated\"? Or maybe someone sees a white boy on the subway playing Call of Duty , and after he loses his game, he starts angrily shouting: \"This is why I don't have a girlfriend!\" Can they kill him then, based on his likelihood to commit domestic terrorism? Nobody wants that. The pro-Penny types want that only if poor people or people of color are the ones who can be killed because of their perceived threat. Justifying Daniel Penny's behavior doesn't lead to more safety but to lawless chaos. Penny has to be prosecuted for this crime, and should be convicted. Penny behaved recklessly, and his recklessness killed somebody else. Treating the situation as anything else is madness.\n\nThe problem is that, based on what we know publicly, there's just not enough evidence to support a murder charge. It's very difficult to prove premeditation in this case: It doesn't appear that Penny was \"lying in wait\" for Neely or some other unfortunate homeless person to come along. Some might infer an \"intent to kill\" from Penny's use of a deadly choke hold, or the length of time he used it, but proving this intent is difficult, especially when Penny, a trained Marine, will argue that he did not mean to kill Neely. Other passengers on the train will also likely testify that they didn't think Penny was killing Neely.

Man-1 has the same problem as a murder charge: Prosecutors would have to prove intent. I know that a choke hold is an inherently dangerous maneuver intended to cause grievous harm to its victims, but do I trust a jury of 12 random New Yorkers to see it that way? We live in a culture suffused with Wrestlemania -style popular media that shows people who are \"choked to sleep\" getting back up after the commercial break, as if nothing has happened. Choking is what you do when you don't want to kill somebody, according to action movies. I have to assume that a jury of my peers is as ignorant about the frailty of the human windpipe as Rambo. Comparatively speaking, second-degree manslaughter should be easy to prove. Was Jordan Neely killed? Yes. Was his death caused by Daniel Penny? Yes. Were Penny's actions reckless? Yes, it is inherently, obviously reckless to choke someone. This is pretty much what second-degree manslaughter is designed for: Maybe you didn't mean to kill that person, but you did something that could have killed him, and he died, so now you go to jail.

The astute reader will note that French begrudgingly agrees that a trial of Penny is probably necessary, but consider the likely reason he says this: because French knows that the alternative to a jury trial is somebody visiting the kind of vigilante justice on Penny that Penny forced on Neely. Funny how that works. French does what so many of Penny's defenders have been doing for the past two weeks. He brings up Neely's criminal past (a past none of the other riders, including Penny, knew about before he was killed). He mentions other anecdotes of people who have been assaulted on the subway in the past, as if homicide can be justified because of things that happened to other people. He even includes himself as a victim-not of an actual crime but of a violation nearly as severe to bourgeois elites: He's been made to feel uncomfortable on the subway, you see. He writes: \"I'm a former resident of New York City and a frequent visitor. I can easily think of tense moments when I had to ask myself whether it would be more or less dangerous for me and others if I stayed in my seat.\" I guess I can also call myself a frequent tension observer on the New York City subway, but I do not recall ever asking myself, \"I wonder if I should kill this homeless man making me super uncomfortable right now? He hasn't done anything yet, but he's poor, and you know how they get when they're all hungry and stuff.\" All of these retributive ideations are done for the sake of painting Penny as a man who was simply trying to protect other passengers from a potentially violent individual. Not an actually violent individual-Neely wasn't violent when he was killed; only the people in French's anecdotes and imaginations were actually violent. But here's the thing: Penny is not a Precog . He is not allowed to violently act on his supposed clairvoyance. We know that Penny committed a crime because we know that there were nonviolent ways to handle the situation that Penny, and others on the subway, didn't appear to even try. The easiest way to diffuse the situation on the train that day would likely have been to offer Neely a sandwich. Or a bottle of water. Or five bucks. That's still the most shocking thing about this whole situation. The \"hostile\" and \"aggressive\" things that Neely said on the train were, \"I don't have food. I don't have drink. I'm fed up.\" And in response, nobody thought to give him food or water or money. None of Penny's defenders can explain why choking a man to death is defending other passengers on the subway, but giving a desperate man some indication of compassion and charity is not. What's lost on French and others defending Penny is that Neely was a passenger on that subway too. He was the passenger who was violently assaulted. But no one helped him. No vigilante Batman appeared to say \"In addition to being a secret ninja, I'm also rich. Here's 10 bucks...\" Nobody parted with a bag of cashews in their purse or a bottle of Poland Spring they hadn't finished from lunch. French thinks that the way to save Neely from Penny would have been to keep Neely in jail. I think anybody carrying small bills could have saved Neely that day. More from Mystal One Man Killed Jordan Neely-but We All Failed Him Elie Mystal Tennessee Republicans Are Showing Exactly How Deep American Racism Goes Elie Mystal The world in which Penny keeps his ass on his wallet but wraps his arms around Neely's neck, and gets away with it, is simply untenable. Nobody wants to live in a world where people can be killed based on what they might do, or based on their perceived threat to others. Should people be allowed to kill a barbecue-splattered white man in camouflage gear and a MAGA hat based on what they know the Proud Boys are capable of? Do their actions become \"justified\" if the MAGA man says, \"Trump won the election and I'm prepared to go to jail to see him reinstated\"? Or maybe someone sees a white boy on the subway playing Call of Duty , and after he loses his game, he starts angrily shouting: \"This is why I don't have a girlfriend!\" Can they kill him then, based on his likelihood to commit domestic terrorism? Nobody wants that. The pro-Penny types want that only if poor people or people of color are the ones who can be killed because of their perceived threat. Justifying Daniel Penny's behavior doesn't lead to more safety but to lawless chaos. Penny has to be prosecuted for this crime, and should be convicted.

In America heroic compassion won't get you anything like the devotion for killing someone who is a member of an \"out group\". Jordan Neely's group: untreated mental patients, is a ubiquitous group in NY. They are our biggest product. They are a loud, flailing, urinating indictment of the rest of us, who often turn away in fear and indifference. We just want to get through the day, free of exposure to their tortured humanity. We prefer to devote our money to things other than emergency health care. New York is essentially an enterprise of finance, real estate, and related services supporting those projects. Most of us are in this service. And we hardly think about the poor. Or the untreated mentally ill ground up in a broken medical system. Jordan Neely didn't exist to make subway riders feel threatened. He just existed. He was a neglected man who somehow adapted to the neglect ... and became a glaring billboard for our negligence. And as a society we find it a relief to be rid of that reminder of ourselves and the culture we tolerate or even choose. And so celebrate Daniel Penny.\n\nHis co-celebrant, Mangione, also gets some ticker tape for killing a man. It is not hard for us to understand Mangione's suffering. Our identification with him, another privileged young white man, now identified on social media as \"hot\", is unrestrained. Although, he is really the Neely of his story, a person also tortured by a crushing system of profit over people. But in his case, opposed to that of Neely, his situation and looks make him worthy of our compassion. The celebrity media system now crashes into the criminal justice system, taking the truth about this poor wretch, and all the others, even further away from our consideration than before.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

(Michael Nagle / Xinhua via Getty Images\n\n\" T he war comes home\" is a misleading phrase that we should probably abandon. America's endless foreign wars usually reflect violent economic, social, and political currents already within our borders and that stretch as far back as settler colonialism, chattel slavery, and the birth of racial capitalism. But foreign wars and domestic social ungluing certainly interact with each other, as when Chicago police commander Jon Burge tortured Black Chicagoans with electric shocks familiar from Vietnam. And you could see this dynamic this spring, when right-wing politicians and journalists embraced vigilantes, especially those with military backgrounds. For several days after he fatally strangled a homeless Black man, Jordan Neely, for threateningly vocalizing his crisis on an F train on May 1, New Yorkers didn't know Daniel Penny's name. The press, following the lead of the police, referred to him only as the Marine . The effect, particularly amid a generation-long War on Terror, was to portray Penny as an anonymous hero, someone willing and able to confront the scourge of homelessness with the due force usually applied against America's foreign enemies. In this framing, Penny wasn't the modern Bernie Goetz . He was Cincinnatus reborn as the Punisher . More From Spencer Ackerman These Corporations Are the  True \"Winners\" of the War on Gaza July 9, 2024 Negotiate With Iran or the Whole of the Middle East Could Burn March 20, 2024 Requiem for the Biden of the Afghanistan Withdrawal March 13, 2024 Key figures within the city's Democratic power structure hesitated to treat Penny the way they would have treated Neely had Neely been the one to initiate violence. Mayor Eric Adams, whose demonization of the homeless recalls Rudy Giuliani's war on the \"squeegee men\" of the 1990s, empathized with Penny. \"We cannot just blanketly say what a passenger should or should not do in a situation like that,\" Adams said on May 3 , taking to task progressives like Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who emphasized Neely's humanity. District Attorney Alvin Bragg waited until May 12 to charge Penny, who had been free after initial questioning by the police, and the charge wasn't murder, but second-degree manslaughter .

All this underscored a yearning on the right for violence to reassert its social dominance at home, as it does American dominance abroad. In April, a Texas jury convicted Daniel Perry, an Army sergeant, of murdering a Black Lives Matter protester during a 2020 demonstration in Austin. Perry claimed that his victim, Garrett Foster, leveled the AK-47 he was legally carrying , but witnesses contradicted that at trial. On the eve of Perry's conviction, Tucker Carlson, predictably, painted the murderer as the victim . The next day, Governor Greg Abbott, a man not known for his clemency, tweeted that he was \"working as swiftly as Texas law allows regarding the pardon of Sgt. Perry.\" Left unsaid was that Foster was an Air Force veteran. The public deference the right typically demands for veterans stops when a veteran's politics are inconvenient. Perry was sentenced to 25 years earlier this month. At his sentencing hearing, it emerged that at the dawn of the 2020 BLM protests, he posted on Facebook , \"It is official I am a racist because I do not agree with people acting like animals at the zoo\"; lamented that he couldn't \"get paid for hunting Muslims in Europe\"; and texted a friend , \"I wonder if they will let my [sic] cut the ears off of people who's decided to commit suicide by me.\" His defense team attempted to argue that Perry had PTSD from his Afghanistan deployment, which is an insult to the vast majority of Afghanistan veterans who don't murder people. Carlson claimed Perry's conviction showed that \"in the state of Texas, if you have the wrong politics, you're not allowed to defend yourself.\" That is exactly what Abbott's impending pardon will prove to anyone who might avail themselves of Texas's open-carry laws for a left-wing reason.

A senior Pentagon official groused to me last year that the policy was \" milquetoast .\" The military's long-standing reluctance to address its white supremacist problem is America in microcosm. A recent measure of that reluctance came last month, when a former intelligence analyst assigned to the 1st Special Forces Command at Fort Bragg pleaded guilty to possessing a serial-number-free \"ghost gun.\" Federal prosecutors said that the 23-year old Noah Edwin Anthony, whom the military discharged last year after military police found his ghost pistol, possessed in his barracks \"an American flag with a Swastika, instead of blue field and stars, and other Nazi type patches,\" as well as other unregistered guns . On Anthony's devices were what prosecutors said was evidence of his ambitions to \" physically remove as many of [Black and brown people] from Hoke, Cumberland, Robeson and Scotland Counties by whatever means need be.\" In a different chain of command, the Massachusetts Air National Guardsman charged with posting classified documents to Discord servers filmed himself at a firing range saying, \"Jews scam, n****** rape, and I mag-dump.\" Yet at least one Republican senator thinks that the Pentagon's \"extremism\" rules are too restrictive. \"The Democrats are attacking our military, saying we need to get out the white extremists, the white nationalists, people that don't believe in our agenda,\" Alabama's Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn football coach who now sits on the Armed Services Committee, told a radio interviewer. When the interviewer pressed Tuberville on the acceptability of white nationalists in the military, he replied, \"I call them Americans.\" The extreme right is often misconstrued as anti-war. In reality, it wants to wage its war on American soil, against people whose Americanness it won't recognize, like Jordan Neely or Garrett Foster. The Democratic response is often evasive, leaving in jeopardy vulnerable people it claims to champion. Penny's intentions are not to be presumed until his trial. But more broadly, unless the Pentagon purges its white nationalists-and the country more broadly confronts the militarism so deeply rooted in both its history and its economic system-it will continue to produce and train many of the right's cherished domestic combatants.\n\nBut foreign wars and domestic social ungluing certainly interact with each other, as when Chicago police commander Jon Burge tortured Black Chicagoans with electric shocks familiar from Vietnam.

      "text": "How Daniel Penny Was Found Not Guilty in a Subway Killing That Divided New York\n\nThe men's bathroom on the thirteenth floor of the state courthouse at 100 Centre Street, in Manhattan, has doorknobs that are engraved \" CITY OF NEW YORK ,\" and pink soap in dispensers that are manufactured upstate, by incarcerated men, many of whom have been found guilty in the courtroom down the hall. There are no mirrors in the men's bathroom, but there are windows, one of which is usually open, and so, for the past several weeks, as an ex-marine named Daniel Penny, who is white, stood trial for the death of a Black man named Jordan Neely , the chants of the dozen or so Black Lives Matter demonstrators who had assembled on the sidewalk, behind police barricades, could be heard clearly near the sink. One protester would shout, \"Hey, hey, what do we say?,\" to which a chorus would reply, \"Daniel Penny has got to pay!\"\n\nThe case, in which Penny put Neely into a choke hold on the subway, had become a local and national fixation, pitting progressives against right-wing supporters, who portrayed Penny as a maligned crime-fighting hero. The sound of the protesters on the street often carried into Judge Maxwell T. Wiley's courtroom. On November 1st, two weeks into the proceedings on the day of the Manhattan Assistant District Attorney's opening statement, the chants were particularly loud. Judge Wiley swivelled in his leather chair toward the sixteen jurors seated in his jury box. \"If you hear people expressing ideas outside\"-he paused a moment, listening to the protesters-\"ignore it. Anything outside this courtroom, as far as you're concerned, is noise.\" He paused again, leaned back in his chair, then leaned forward and said, \"What matters to you, and to us, is what happens in this courtroom.\"\n\nThe Lede Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nJudge Wiley's courtroom has high ceilings, fluorescent lights, peeling white paint, and seven rows of dark wooden benches, some filled with reporters, others with spectators (college students, Black Lives Matter activists, a man wearing a \"Trump\" kippah), and members of the defendant's private security detail. That morning, Penny sat near the front of the courtroom, listening as Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran said, \"Jordan Neely took his last breaths on the dirty floor of an uptown F train.\" On May 1, 2023, Neely, a Michael Jackson impersonator who often busked in Times Square, and who had a history of homelessness, substance abuse, and schizophrenia, boarded a moderately crowded train and, as Yoran explained, began shouting:\n\nHis voice was loud and his words were threatening. And in immediate\nresponse to these menacing words, the defendant, Daniel Penny, this\nman, took it upon himself to take down Jordan Neely, to neutralize\nhim. Without hesitation, he grabbed Mr. Neely from behind in a choke\nhold and brought him down to the ground.\n\nPenny, an architecture student from West Islip, on Long Island, did not look at Yoran as she said, \"His initial intent was even laudable, to protect fellow subway riders from a man he perceived to be a threat.\" But the law does not permit \"laudable behavior\" when it is also \"unnecessarily reckless,\" Yoran went on. Her opening statement-in which she described how Penny held Neely in a choke hold for almost six minutes, even after the train doors had opened and the other straphangers had fled to safety-concluded, \"The defendant was not justified in these deadly actions. He used far too much force for far too long. He went way too far.\" Later, the jury-twelve jurors and four alternates, all hailing from Manhattan-would need to decide for themselves whether the Assistant District Attorney was correct. Did Daniel Penny, who had a green belt in Marine Corps martial arts, go too far? Or did he do what the jurors would have wanted him to do if they had been on that uptown F train? Shortly before lunchtime, the judge looked toward them and said, \"Stretch your legs. Think about something else. And don't talk about the case yet, with each other or anyone else.\"\n\nAlong with the sound of the protesters outside, the courtroom was often filled with the sound of sneezing and coughing (a case of bronchitis was going around), and with the sound of death. Eight JBL speakers and six large television screens broadcast the moments on the train before Neely's death, and during it, and afterward. There were videos captured by eyewitnesses-Darrick Clay, Moriyela Sanchez, Ivette Rosario-and body-cam footage from police officers: Tejada, Ceesay, Kang, Ortiz, Joefield, and Johnson. There were also videos from detectives at the Fifth Precinct. (\"I wasn't trying to injure him,\" Penny said, during his interrogation. \"I'm just trying to keep him from hurting anybody else. He's threatening people!\") The most important video, four minutes and fifty-seven seconds long, was shot by a passenger named Juan Alberto Vasquez. It clearly shows Penny's left arm wrapped around Neely's neck.\n\nInside Judge Maxwell T. Wiley's courtroom.\n\nIt is a strange thing to sit in a courtroom and watch a man die over and over and over again. At first, the people assembled reacted to the videos with great emotion. Spectators in the gallery cried and gasped, as Neely's legs flailed about and then slowed down and stopped moving altogether before Penny released his hold on Neely's neck and got up, fifty-one seconds later. The jurors fidgeted in their seats. The judge stood up. Two court officers, both of whom carried guns and handcuffs and wore black bulletproof vests and otherwise stoic expressions, wiped tears from their eyes. Jordan Neely's father, Andre Zachery, wept quietly, then loudly, then walked out of the courtroom; later, he returned to his seat and hung his head. The second time the Vasquez video played, there were more grimaces in the jury box, but in the course of the following five weeks the jurors adopted passive, detached expressions.\n\nBy the time the prosecution presented another version of the Vasquez video, broken into fourteen hundred and sixty-five frames, on PowerPoint slides, which show Penny and Neely's struggle even more clearly, the jurors had begun to resemble listless schoolchildren. Still, to sit in the courtroom that day was to watch death in slow motion. As prosecutors clicked through the images, Juror No. 11-a young corporate lawyer from Michigan whose grandmother struggles with mental illness-calmed his nerves with chewing gum. Juror No. 9-a white woman who has lived on the Upper West Side for forty-five years-bit her fingernails. At one o'clock, during the lunch recess, just as he did every afternoon, Juror No. 5-an Upper East Side retiree who enjoys reading and video games-smoked cigarettes behind the courthouse, in Columbus Park.\n\nAround the courthouse, especially among the court security officers, the Daniel Penny case, in Room 1313, was known as a \"media trial.\" Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan District Attorney, had brought a manslaughter charge against Penny on May 12, 2023, following intense criticism by protesters and left-leaning politicians; that evening, the former Republican congressman Matt Gaetz called Penny a \"Subway Superman.\"  (Six weeks later, Bragg also charged Penny with criminally negligent homicide, a lesser offense.) Throughout the trial, everyone in town, it seemed, had an opinion about the case: \"Daniel Penny is a hero\"; \"this was a lynching\"; \"the whole system just failed him\"; \"what a horrible thing, my God. I don't know really what I would've done.\" Each morning, two or three dozen reporters lined up behind a police barricade in the hallway, jockeying for a spot. Each evening, the journalists filed dispatches, or appeared on television. After testimony by a man named Eric Gonzalez, on November 12th, the following headlines appeared in the press:\n\nThe Times : \"Rider Who Helped Restrain Homeless Man Testifies About Fatal Chokehold\"\n\nFox News : \"Key Witness in Marine Vet Chokehold Case Admits He Lied\"\n\nThe Associated Press : \"Subway Rider Who Helped Restrain Man in NYC Chokehold Says He Wanted Ex-Marine to 'Let Go' \"\n\nIn the Vasquez video, Gonzalez can be seen in a baseball cap, holding down Penny's arms during the final seconds of Neely's life. When he was first interviewed by the police, Gonzalez told detectives that he was aboard the train when Neely entered it, at the Second Avenue station, and that Neely had struck him. But that wasn't true; Gonzalez had wandered on after the doors opened, at the Broadway-Lafayette station, as he was answering e-mails on his phone. He'd helped Penny, then went to work, read in the news that Neely had died, hid in his house for several days, then lied to the police about the sequence of events, because, as he later told detectives, he was afraid he might be charged with murder. \"I fabricated a story,\" he said, from the witness stand. Gonzalez also said that he attempted to persuade Penny to loosen the choke hold around Neely's neck. \"I said, 'I'm going to grab his hands so you can let go,' \" Gonzalez recalled. \" 'Let him go! Get your arm away from his neck.' \" A column in the Post about Gonzalez's testimony read:\n\nBoth he and Penny activated their instincts to protect New Yorkers from the Gotham City-like chaos and violence that plagued the underground at the time. Now, one is facing almost two decades behind bars. And the other, it seems, did everything he could to avoid being a helper again. The perverse and dangerous lesson: Next time, don't get involved.\n\nJudge Wiley regularly instructed the jurors to ignore these and other news reports, but his courtroom is only one room in a city full of them; during the trial, the jurors frequently found themselves, in the course of their \"real lives,\" as the judge put it, surrounded by opinions and the news. The other morning, before the defense called another witness, a Fox News daytime host, said, \"While Daniel Penny returns to court, career criminals continue to cause chaos across city streets.\" A few days earlier, a man who had recently been released from Rikers Island had stabbed three people across Manhattan. Afterward, Mayor Eric Adams stood behind a lectern at City Hall and said, \"This is the result of not taking actions and ignoring people who need help.\" He went on, \"The street corner is not a psychiatric ward.\" On Friday, November 22nd, in Judge Wiley's courtroom, as an expert witness spoke to jurors about a photograph of Neely's spleen, the suspect in the stabbing spree was indicted in another courtroom on the second floor.\n\nAmong the prosecution's many witnesses-patrol cops, detectives, a train conductor, a 911 record keeper-Yoran brought forward passengers who were aboard the train on the afternoon that Neely staggered through the doors and began shouting. Ivette Rosario said, \"I was worried.\" Larry Goodson said, \"He wasn't threatening me, nor did I notice him threaten anyone else.\" Lori Sitro said, \"I actually took the stroller that I had and put it in front of my son to create a barrier of sorts because I didn't know what was going to happen.\" Alethea Gittings said, \"I was scared shitless.\" The defense called witnesses who spoke to Penny's character. (Penny's lawyers-and the Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro, who sat in the courtroom scribbling on a yellow legal pad most days-referred to the defendant as \"Danny\" throughout the trial.) Jacqueline Penny, the defendant's older sister, said, \"He was always very sweet to my friends.\" Gina Maria Flaim-Penny, his mother, said, \"He was always an A-plus student.\" Gunnery Sergeant Nathaniel Dunchie said, of Penny's time in the Marine Corps, \"Working with him was a breath of fresh air.\" The defense also hired a forensic psychiatrist, a former director of mental health on Rikers Island, who reviewed five thousand pages of Jordan Neely's medical records:\n\nQ: Would you agree that he was perhaps one of the most severely psychotic individuals that you ever evaluated?\n\nA: I have not evaluated him.\n\nQ: Based on his history?\n\nA: Based on his history, yes.\n\nEach lawyer, then, in his or her own way, played a part in creating a caricature: Danny, the kid in a tough situation trying his best to do the right thing; Mr. Neely, that malodorous man with schizophrenia stoking passengers' fears on the subway. As the jurors scribbled notes on their court-issued legal pads, their difficult task was to look past these caricatures. That Daniel Penny acted to defend others from a frightening figure on the train was of no legal relevance, from the prosecution's point of view, given that Neely did not have a weapon or threaten a specific passenger directly. Yoran's argument was, in part, that Penny acted with \"reckless\" disregard for Neely's life, that the deadly choke hold continued long after Penny had rendered Neely unconscious. That Penny-\"Danny\"-was an upstanding young man trying to protect a woman and child was, on the other hand, of the utmost importance to the defense. Their argument relied primarily on the jury's fear and sympathy: the police were too slow to arrive-it took them seven minutes and thirty-five seconds after the first 911 call-and Penny was thus legally justified to hold Neely in the choke hold to protect other riders. The defense asked many witnesses from the train whether they ever heard Neely gasping or gagging, or if he said, \"I can't breathe.\" (If he couldn't breathe, then why didn't he say so?)\n\nThe defense also did its best to discredit the determination, made by Cynthia Harris, one of the city's medical examiners, of the cause of Neely's death: \"Compression of Neck (Chokehold).\" If Neely hadn't died from Penny's choke hold but from another cause, any other cause, then a reasonable jury would have no choice but to acquit the defendant. Steven Raiser, one of the defense lawyers, who later referred to Penny's choke hold as \"a civilian restraint,\" pointed out that Harris made her opinion on the cause of death before the toxicology report, the molecular genetic report, the anthropology report, and the neuropathology report had been reviewed. His insinuation was that she-and her colleagues, including many of the city's top medical examiners, who also reviewed the case-had rushed to judgment. Raiser asked, \"How could you determine whether the results of those tests were unimportant before knowing what the results of those tests were?\" Harris said, \"No toxicological result would have changed my opinion.\" She went on, \"He could have come back with, you know, enough fentanyl to put down an elephant, and I would have just thought that he walked onto the subway with a huge amount of fentanyl in his system, and then put in a choke hold, in which he died.\" A juror laughed. Jordan Neely's father lifted his head and sat upright in his seat; an almost-smile crept across his face.\n\nThe defense attorneys, for their part, brought forward Dr. Satish Chundru, of theforensicdoc.com, who argued that the cause of Neely's death was the \"combined effects\" of the street drug K2, acute schizophrenic psychosis, and physical exertion, which all contributed to a death by sickle-cell crisis, in which one's red blood cells clump together and stop moving, leading, in this instance, to asphyxiation. (In a pretrial motion in the case of Derek Chauvin , the former Minneapolis police officer who murdered George Floyd, defense attorneys also argued that Floyd died from a combination of drug use and complications from sickle-cell trait, rather than neck compression.) Asked about the purple discoloration in Neely's face, which Harris had explained as a sign of \"congested veins\" resulting from \"a sufficient amount of pressure\" on Neely's neck, Chundru replied that perhaps Neely had a sun tan. In the men's bathroom, a white-haired man in a black sweater attending the trial said, of Chundru, \"He's coming off like a gun for hire.\"\n\nSeveral days later, after Thanksgiving, on the first morning of the lawyers' closing arguments, the chants of protesters could again be heard through an open window. Raiser asked the jurors to picture the jury box as the uptown F: \"Imagine for the moment, that you are on that train, too-strangers brought together by faith, much like you are here.\" Several jurors fidgeted in their seats as Raiser again described Neely boarding the train-\"screaming threats that he will hurt you and even kill you\"-and frightening the passengers. He went on, \"The subway car falls silent. Where do you go? You go nowhere, because you can't.\" Juror No. 11 scratched his nose.\n\n\"You are not here to decide whether you want to ride alone on the train with Jordan Neely,\" Yoran said, during her own closing argument. \"That's not what this case is about.\" The actual task at hand was to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, whether Penny's actions were \"reckless\" and \"not justified,\" and Yoran acknowledged that it was a difficult one. \"As I've said to you all along, this is a hard case,\" she said. \"It's hard to find someone guilty of a killing they did not intend.\"\n\nAs the jurors deliberated, Jordan Neely's father filed a civil suit against Penny, and Judge Wiley's regular court docket proceeded: motions were agreed upon, hearings were scheduled, a young Rastafarian man was sentenced to five years in state prison for a firearm charge. \"Good luck,\" the judge told him. In the jury room, the jurors again watched the Vasquez video, the police body-cam footage, and the detective's interview of Penny on a court-issued laptop.\n\nOn Friday, December 6th, the jurors sent Judge Wiley a note. Despite their best attempts, the twelve Manhattanites-the retired public librarian, the young corporate lawyer, the gray-haired Ukrainian woman who often wore an elaborate hat-could not set aside their differences of opinion to reach a unanimous verdict on the first charge, manslaughter in the second degree. Judge Wiley instructed them to try again-\"jury deliberations aren't intended to be easy,\" he said-but, around three o'clock that afternoon, the jurors again announced that they were deadlocked. The defense moved for a mistrial; Yoran responded with a motion to dismiss the manslaughter charge, and, over the defense's strong objection-in a move criticized by some legal scholars, several right-wing commentators, and even Elon Musk-the judge instructed the jury to consider the lesser charge, criminally negligent homicide. The following Monday, the jurors returned to the courthouse to deliberate.\n\nAt around 11:30 A.M. , they filed into the courtroom, and the jury foreperson announced that Penny had been acquitted. Several people in the gallery broke into applause, and Judge Wiley shouted, \"Quiet!\" Neely's father stared ahead blankly, then looked around the courtroom, in disbelief. Penny grinned. Still, the case that had divided New York City for more than a year and a half would continue to divide it. To some, Penny was a triumphant hero; others saw a villain let go.

      "text": "An Eyewitness to Jordan Neely's Death\n\nLast year, after Mayor Eric Adams stepped up sweeps of homeless encampments in New York, Johnny Grima became one of the most visible homeless activists in the city. Grima was a resident of Anarchy Row , a holdout encampment on Ninth Street, off Tompkins Square Park, and he was a voluble and eloquent presence at many of the street demonstrations and protests that broke out in response to the sweeps. Grima, who is in his late thirties, describes himself as \"second-generation\" homeless. He spent much of the pandemic on the streets of New York. \"I want apartments for all my homeless people!\" he chanted over and over again during a sweep of Anarchy Row last April. He refused to leave his tent even as police officers collapsed it on top of him. A few months later, Grima succeeded in navigating the city's notoriously labyrinthine and dysfunctional shelter system, and secured an apartment in a supportive-housing facility, where he has lived since.\n\nOn Monday, Grima and a friend, James Kings, happened to be riding on the same subway train in which Jordan Neely , a homeless man and street performer, was killed by an ex-marine named Daniel Penny. (Penny has not been charged with any crime and could not be reached for comment. His lawyers released a statement saying that Penny acted in self-defense and \"never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death.\") In a partial video of the incident that has been posted online, Grima can be heard and seen moments after Neely, pinned down by Penny and two other men, stopped moving. \"Don't put him on his back though, man. He might choke on his own spit,\" Grima said. \"Put him on his side.\" Grima, who has described his own life at times as a \"nightmare,\" is distraught by what he witnessed on Monday. On Wednesday, he helped organize a vigil for Neely in the same subway station where he died. When I called Grima on Friday, he was getting in and out of subways, travelling around the city. His voice broke several times as he recounted what he'd seen. His account has been condensed and edited.\n\n\"Me and my friend James were on our way home-my home, a supportive-living apartment. We got on an uptown F at Second Avenue. We needed to change to the D at, preferably, Broadway-Lafayette. That's the next station.\n\n\"At first, we didn't notice that the train stopped, because we were deep in conversation. We were talking about something, not paying attention to where we were at. Then we heard an announcement-the conductor saying for N.Y.P.D. to come to one of the cars. I looked up at that point and noticed that we were at Broadway-Lafayette. I said, 'Oh, we got to transfer anyway. Let's get off and go check out what's going on over there.'\n\n\"We were maybe four or five cars down. We went up to where it's happening. There was a whole bunch of people crowding around the train car, some people filming. I had to squeeze through to take a look-a pretty intimidating scene. I looked. I didn't know anybody at the time. I didn't know anything about any of these people. I didn't know that Jordan Neely was homeless. I didn't know that Daniel Penny was an ex-marine.\n\n\"I saw Penny holding Neely by the neck, and another guy holding on to Neely, as if he was still resisting. Neely was staring off. But, honestly, at the moment, I didn't know how long they had had him. The way they were holding him, it was as if they had just had the craziest fight or something. They're holding on to him for dear life. Somebody was filming it, and this person finally said, 'You gotta let him go.' They finally let him go, and he just fell limp.\n\n\"There were maybe twenty-some people outside the train car. I was looking in the window, and I was, like, 'Something is fucking wrong.' Because I was looking at him, and he was staring off into space. His eyes were dead. He wasn't not moving. But the thing is, these guys that choked him the fuck out were saying that he was still breathing, that he still had a pulse. They were acting in such a way that no one else could come next to him. I told them to put him on his side. I didn't believe that he was dead. I'd never seen a dead body before. I didn't want him choking on his own spit or vomit. I had my water bottle in my hand. I wanted to try to check him out. But I was intimidated by these people. I didn't know anybody. I wasn't not trying to get stabbed. I tried to move in. I poured a little water on his forehead. And Daniel Penny came over and told me to stop. He shuffled me off.\n\n\"Just as my train was arriving, the police showed up. I told them to do CPR on him. Then I left. But, like I said, I didn't think he was dead, because they were saying he was breathing. It's upsetting as fuck. It's ruining my life right now. We got to bang out right now, bang out the truth. It's shameful. There's no getting around it. I won't feel better until they fucking arrest this guy for murdering him. And I'm not about all that police shit and people going to prison. The only reason they're letting him off is the race of the people involved. If that was a white woman he choked to death, he'd be in a cell right now. So what does that mean? That a Black man's life is worth less than a white woman's life. That's what that means. That's why I went to the police over this fucking shit. And I would never do that.\n\n\"This is a racist, disgusting attack on a beloved Black homeless street performer. And, even if he wasn't a beloved street performer, we'd love him anyway. He didn't deserve that. No one deserves that. They're treating him like he's less than everybody else-because he's Black, and he's homeless, and he had mental-health issues. I feel so fucking bad about what happened. Just this morning, I'd seen a homeless guy with mental-health issues in a corner of a train. I offered him a couple cigarettes. I told him, 'Look, man, you got to be careful. A homeless guy just got murdered on the train.' He said, 'Yeah, I know.' I told him, 'People love you, man. Stay safe.' I feel scared for homeless people who are out there right now. Because people are murdering them.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The System That Failed Jordan Neely\n\nNot long ago, on Sixth Avenue in Chelsea, I walked past a man in a black coat, who was hunched over, licking the sidewalk. He murmured to himself and passersby. For a moment, it occurred to me that he might be having a psychotic episode. Then I ducked into a deli, bought lunch, and headed to the office. Should I have called 911? Maybe. The thought didn't linger long.\n\nThis kind of thing happens all the time. Recently, aboard an F train, en route to Brooklyn, I saw a young man reach both hands into his pants and start masturbating. He wore a dirty sweater that was pulled over his head, and his socks were halfway off his feet. There was a cup of coffee and a chicken bone under his seat. An older man with two FreshDirect bags loaded with clothes and takeout containers was stretched out nearby. The young man was crying, and the older man slept. Several straphangers were watching, but it was late at night, and no one seemed particularly interested or concerned. Later, I asked an inpatient psychiatrist at a local hospital about the incident. There was little I could've done, he said, adding that the young man likely would have wound up at a hospital sooner or later. Perhaps he had recently been discharged from one. More often than not, people experiencing acute mental distress in public places get picked up by the police or an ambulance and are taken to the emergency room. Sometimes they find their way to a hospital on their own. Other times, something awful happens first.\n\nOn Monday, May 1st, aboard an F train in Manhattan, a Black man named Jordan Neely started yelling. He shouted, \"I want food!\" He shouted, \"I'm not taking no for an answer!\" He shouted, \"I'm ready to die!\" And then Daniel Penny, a twenty-four-year-old Marine veteran, who is white, pinned Neely down and started to strangle him. A second man held Neely's wrists. Another passenger filmed the incident on a cell phone. Others were calling 911. Penny had Neely in a choke hold-and Neely's body went limp. Someone said, \"He'll be all right.\" Three minutes, five minutes, ten minutes, fifteen minutes. The train had pulled into the Broadway-Lafayette subway station. The doors had opened, and a few passengers drifted onto the platform, upstairs, into the spring afternoon. Belowground, a police officer wearing blue gloves began chest compressions. Neely was pronounced dead. The city's medical examiner ruled the death a homicide.\n\nThe N.Y.P.D. questioned Penny, then released him. (His lawyers say that he was acting in self-defense.) \"We don't know exactly what happened here,\" Mayor Eric Adams said, afterward. \"We cannot just blanketly say what a passenger should or should not do in a situation like that.\" Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, said, \"There's consequences for behavior.\" Was she talking about Neely, or the man who killed him?\n\nMany locals knew Jordan Neely. He liked to hang out in Times Square, where he would perform, dressed up like Michael Jackson-the side slide, the crotch grab, and the moonwalk were his signature moves. Law-enforcement and public-health officials also knew him. He had been arrested more than forty times, mostly for petty offenses, such as loitering and trespassing. He had a history of mental illness, and that Monday afternoon he had reportedly been throwing garbage at other passengers. Reflecting on the incident, the inpatient psychiatrist, who has worked in hospitals in New York for more than fifteen years, told me, \"A couple months ago, a mentally ill man threw a juice box at my kid in the subway at Union Square, where there was a police presence, and no one intervened. The man walked out of the station.\" Neely was killed. \"It's just very strange, the arbitrariness of it,\" he said.\n\nThe psychiatrist went on to tell me that Neely had been involuntarily hospitalized, at Bellevue, in 2021. Neely was admitted to the hospital's forensic-psychiatry unit, on the nineteenth floor, where doctors and nurses treat patients who have been recently arrested, or incarcerated on Rikers Island. Then, like so many other patients, Neely walked out of the hospital and onto the street. For a while, he lived at a homeless shelter. Sometimes he stayed with his aunt Carolyn and her wife, Whitney, at their apartment in Washington Heights, near where he grew up. In January, the two moved upstate, and Neely decided not to go-he said that he didn't want to burden them. In early April, outreach workers spotted him on the subway. He urinated in front of them and they called the police. Carolyn told the Post that she had tried for years to get judges and doctors to help. \"The whole system just failed him,\" she said. \"He fell through the cracks.\"\n\nThere are more than two hundred thousand residents of New York City living with severe mental illness; roughly five per cent of them are homeless. That's thirteen thousand people with schizophrenia, major depressive and bipolar disorders, or other significant mental- or behavioral-health diagnoses, all of whom regularly spend the night at a shelter, in the subway, on the street. They're the ones you recognize-the people whom, for the past fifty years, every mayor has either tried to help, harass, or hide from view. Rudy Giuliani's cops were known to chase people out of midtown, forcing them into the Bronx and Queens. Michael Bloomberg largely avoided public initiatives that addressed mental illness. Bill de Blasio allocated almost a billion dollars for a mental-health plan, but it was criticized for failing to track outcomes or prioritize treatment for those who needed help the most.\n\nLast November, Adams, citing a \"crisis we see all around us,\" announced at a press conference that homeless people with mental illness would be removed from the streets and the subways, against their will if necessary, by the police and other city employees. Advocates were outraged. Norman Siegel , the former head of the New York Civil Liberties Union and a longtime friend of the Mayor, said, \"Just because someone smells, because they haven't had a shower for weeks, because they're mumbling, because their clothes are disheveled, that doesn't mean they're a danger to themselves or others.\" Rumors spread quickly. Were the police about to start rounding up people who simply appeared to be mentally ill? How many were going to be detained? Two weeks later, lawyers sought to halt the initiative. In a courtroom downtown, an attorney for the city, who was defending the Mayor's plan, said, \"As far as anyone in this room knows, the initiative hasn't changed anything.\" The judge asked, \"So the purpose of the press conference was to do what?\"\n\n\"To announce the fact that the Mayor is taking the initiative of providing further guidance to the agencies about what is permitted under current law so that they can take action to protect New Yorkers under circumstances that the law permits.\"\n\nAdams's policy, in other words, was more of the same.\n\nIn 1987, Mayor Ed Koch announced a broad interpretation of New York state law that permitted him to hospitalize the \"loonies\" and \"crazies\" around town. In the decades since, police and E.M.S. workers have regularly transported homeless people with apparent mental illness to hospitals against their will. That's just part of the job: violent crime, parking tickets, heart attacks, the unsheltered woman in a wheelchair at Penn Station who is taken to Bellevue every few months after creating a public disturbance. The man with four large black suitcases who is picked up for zigzagging through traffic in Brooklyn and sent to the psychiatric emergency room at Kings County Hospital. The woman with schizophrenia who believes that the French government bought a church on Fifth Avenue and granted her the legal right to live there. One E.M.T., who has worked on ambulance crews across the city for the past twenty years, told me, \"If the person is out of their mind, if you can see the person is not all there, the police will call for us, and we'll come and take them.\" (In the course of reporting this article, I interviewed dozens of E.M.T.s, paramedics, police officers, nurses, social workers, emergency-room doctors, and inpatient psychiatrists, most of whom requested anonymity in order to speak openly about the people in their care.)\n\nHere's how it happens. An E.M.T. and her partner park the ambulance-cops call it \"the bus\"-and evaluate the scene for safety. Does the individual have a weapon ? Where's the nearest egress ? Then she'll put on a pair of purple nitrile gloves and make a cautious approach. She'll say, \"What's going on today, sir?,\" or \"Ma'am, how are you feeling tonight?\" The person might respond with a mumble, a shout, or the formality you'd expect in a job interview. Often, the person will say, \"I don't want to tell you my name,\" so the E.M.T. will smile and offer her own. She'll say, \"You're not in trouble. I just want to know why you're standing in the middle of the road. Can you come with me to the sidewalk, please? I'm here to listen.\" Or maybe the person is already ripping the hair from his head and trying to escape the encounter by tossing the E.M.T.'s stretcher into the street. In that case, a paramedic can use a cotton sling to tie the patient's wrists to his ankles and inject a drug, such as the sedative midazolam or the anesthetic ketamine. But not every ambulance crew has a paramedic. One might be ten or twenty minutes out, so, in the meantime, the E.M.T., who isn't allowed to inject those drugs, will have to get creative. \"You want cake? You want cookies? You want a cigarette?\" Lies and threats, carrots and sticks; anything to get them on their way to the nearest hospital. The E.M.T. told me, \"I don't want to use the word 'manipulative,' but you have to figure out a way to just fucking get them in the ambulance.\"\n\nAt the hospital, the patient is evaluated by a team of nurses and doctors in the emergency department. In New York City, this happens seventy thousand times a year. A little more than half of these patients-the ones in the worst shape-are then taken to the psychiatric unit. The hospital's job is to evaluate, stabilize, treat, discharge. Just as you don't depart the I.C.U. while you're having a stroke or bleeding out, you don't leave the psychiatric unit while you're in the throes of psychosis. Some people stay for months before being transferred to a state-run psychiatric hospital; others are discharged after only a few days, or are never admitted at all. Every day at Bellevue, the largest city-run hospital, there are usually about five or six patients downstairs, in the psychiatric emergency department, waiting for a bed. The average stay in the psychiatric unit is thirteen days. (One reason hospitals discharge people so quickly is that there are not enough inpatient psychiatric beds; high-quality psychiatric care is not as profitable as specialized spinal surgeries and hernia repairs.)\n\nAlmost every patient who comes in this way has a serious underlying condition-bipolar disorder, major depression, schizophrenia-that even a couple of weeks surrounded by nurses, doctors, and social workers cannot fix. In the late eighties, following a legal challenge to Koch's involuntary-hospitalization initiative, one judge described the city's approach as \"revolving door mental health-that is, forcibly institutionalize, forcibly medicate, stabilize, discharge back into the same environment, and then repeat the cycle.\" Thirty-five years later, the vocabulary that's used to describe the city's mental-health-care system hasn't changed. \"It's a revolving door,\" a cop who was working an overtime shift on a subway platform in Clinton Hill told me. \"We bring them in, and the hospital just discharges them!\" She and her partner both had a few streaks of gray in their tidy black hair, and wore matching N.Y.P.D. beanies. The second cop sighed. \"In and out,\" she said. \"I'm not sure anything we do is going to help if the hospitals keep letting them go.\"\n\nThe hospitals keep letting them go because they often have to. Patients can always refuse treatment or ask to be released; compelling someone to stay requires a court order from a judge, and the legal standard is high. The hospital must prove that the patient poses an immediate threat to himself or to others, and that his judgment is so impaired by his illness that he doesn't even understand that he needs help. A psychiatrist at a city-run hospital sketched out a hypothetical scenario: Two men with paranoid schizophrenia arrive in the back of an ambulance, escorted by police. Both are living at homeless shelters, and neither has eaten in about five days. A doctor asks each man, \"Why are you starving yourself to death?\" The first says, \"The voice of God is commanding me to go on a hunger strike!\" The second replies, \"The food at the shelter is disgusting. I'll eat when I have money to buy something good.\" Both men have a serious mental illness, but only the first will be made to stay at the hospital against his will. The second can walk out the door.\n\nOn a recent Tuesday morning, I visited the second floor of a shabby building on Rockaway Avenue, in Brownsville. Social workers were sitting in blue office chairs, surrounded by large Rubbermaid containers filled with granola bars, body lotion, sweatpants, toilet paper, detergent, and chocolate-chip cookies. The group is one of thirty-one Intensive Mobile Treatment teams, which care for the city's \"frequent fliers\" and \"heavy hitters\"-the four hundred or so men and women who are regularly and repeatedly admitted and discharged from city and state psychiatric units, or released from Rikers, where a fifth of incarcerated people have been diagnosed as having a severe mental illness. I.M.T. teams help people who have a history of chronic street homelessness and violent behavior; a psychiatric diagnosis is not on the list of admission criteria, but almost all I.M.T. clients have one.\n\nLink copied\n\nJust after ten o'clock, someone turned down the volume on a TV in the office, and the team's leader, Lauren Schultz-Kappes, who wore bluejeans, yellow Nikes, and a silver heart necklace, began the day by giving an update on their twenty-seven clients. Tony was living in a shelter and recently went to a dentist appointment. J. B. Fresh had been staying at a nursing home and didn't like the food. Batsheva was transferred to a state-run hospital on Staten Island. Alex requested a Russian Orthodox Bible with large type and has become obsessed with juice. Markease was scheduled to receive his psychotropic medicine via intramuscular injection at a veterans' hospital. Merisa had court that afternoon. \"She didn't seem to understand why it was wrong for her to pepper-spray the emergency room,\" Schultz-Kappes explained. \"And she said, 'Why's it such a big deal?' So, we'll see how court goes today.\" The list went on: Fantasia was a little internally preoccupied again. Casper was still street homeless. Raymond was still missing. Rene was doing all right. Marwan was back at Bellevue. \"He's a weird mix of really lucid at times and then really not understandable,\" one of the social workers said.\n\nSchultz-Kappes added, \"And he's really loud.\"\n\nNew York has funded an alphabet soup of outreach groups and teams-M.C.T., B.R.C., S.O.S., ACT , B-HEARD , C.U.C.S., A.O.T., FACT , I.M.T.-each of which is different in origin, scale, and scope. A person with a mental illness is more likely to be the victim of a crime than to commit one, but every so often the script gets flipped. It's in those moments that local and state politicians feel compelled to talk about change. Assisted Outpatient Treatment was announced, in 1999, after a schizophrenic man, who had been in and out of psychiatric care and had stopped taking his medication, pushed a thirty-two-year-old woman named Kendra Webdale in front of an N train. Webdale died, and that year the state passed Kendra's Law, which allowed a court to mandate outpatient treatment, including psychotropic medication. (Around three thousand patients are currently under such orders.) City Hall launched I.M.T. teams in 2016, after a person with a mental illness killed a thirty-six-year-old woman named Ana Charle, who ran a homeless shelter in the Bronx.\n\nIn 2022, there was another horrific crime, another person failed by the system. Martial Simon, whose medical records included dozens of psychiatric hospitalizations, indicating that he was a serious threat to himself and to others, walked up to a forty-year-old woman named Michelle Go one morning and pushed her onto the subway tracks, where she was run over and killed by a train. Before the incident, Simon had been in the emergency room at Queens Hospital Center. A psychiatrist who treated him at another hospital told me, \"If someone had just read his chart, it would have flagged for them 'Hey, this guy is the real deal.' \" Instead, clinical staff decided that he was malingering, or faking his symptoms, and told him to leave.\n\nThe goal of most outreach teams is to get a patient from one point of care to the next-a complicated and difficult process. (A hundred thousand city residents with severe mental illness are not receiving any mental-health treatment.) Sometimes, when a person gets discharged from a hospital or released from Rikers, he'll leave with a pill bottle filled with thirty days' worth of Abilify, Ativan, or Haldol. Often, though, a person leaves with only a prescription, and it is not uncommon for it to be sent to a pharmacy that's far away from where he wants to end up-to a Walgreens in the Bronx, for instance, even though he is staying in a homeless shelter downtown. Several people who have stayed in shelters told me that, if they don't show up for a night to claim their bed, staffers throw away their medicine-along with everything else they own. (The city's Department of Homeless Services told me that, when someone does not return, shelters store their belongings for at least seven days.)\n\nThe waiting list to be treated by an I.M.T. team can be at least six months-and sometimes much longer-but once someone has been assigned they are in really good hands. A social worker named Bridgette Callaghan, who oversees six I.M.T. teams, said, \"For the people that are, like, 'Go fuck yourself,' I'm, like, 'No problem, I will absolutely go do that. Can I grab you a cup of coffee first?' And they're, like, 'Yes, you can. But then leave!' That can be the first thing. And then, the next week, I'll show up with the coffee that I know they'll drink, and I'm, like, 'Hey, it's nice to see you again. Are you going to tell me to go fuck off again? Yes? All right, I'll see you next week.' \" It takes months to build trust.\n\n\"I get it, social workers have not been great,\" Callaghan said. \"And we're just another one-until we're not.\" I.M.T. teams take their clients to Yankee Stadium for baseball games and buy them Chinese food for lunch. (Each client costs taxpayers around eight hundred and forty dollars a week; admission to a city-run psychiatric unit, or incarceration on Rikers, is at least ten times that.) Clinicians administer medicine via intramuscular injection anywhere and everywhere-a Burger King bathroom, a Penn Station turnstile, an abandoned building where a client is hiding out. One nurse taught clients self-defense in Prospect Park. Another offers cooking classes.\n\nLater on the afternoon that I visited the Brownsville team, clients began to show up. Cindy, who wore maroon leggings, violet nail polish, pink lipstick, and an oversized ruby-red ring, told me that she lives in a homeless shelter and attends group-therapy sessions. She preferred to talk about her outfit, though. \"I love the color red,\" she said. A social worker handed her a cup of hot chocolate. Nearby, a man named Brandon spun around in Schultz-Kappes's office chair. He was supposed to get an injection that morning, but the team's nurse had COVID , so he was shouting instead. A man named Joseph said, \"Can I get a laptop?\" Joseph had arrived in a dirty gray Marmot puffer carrying a wad of crumpled documents, including his birth certificate. He told me that he had been sleeping in the stairwell of his cousin's building. \"I just stay outside and play on my phone. That's how I get my Netflix,\" he said. Joseph added that the city had recently transferred him to a new homeless shelter in Far Rockaway-\"Far Rock? I'm not going! It says take three trains!\"-and that the last shelter had thrown away all his personal effects. \"I'm used to starting from scratch. I like it. Or-I don't like it,\" he said, pausing. \"It's only material stuff. Expensive stuff, but- Can I get detergent? Laundry detergent?\"\n\nA social worker handed Joseph a jug of Tide. He was headed to Coney Island for a thirty-day temporary-housing program, arranged by the team. The residence offered toiletry kits, pajamas, beach towels, and a space for yoga. There was a bowl of fruit on the kitchen table, and a grill in the back yard. Joseph was a bit reluctant to go. \"Do I gotta check in at ten o'clock?\" he asked. Callaghan explained, \"It's not a hospital. You can come and go as you please. But there's probably a curfew, and I know when you're first moving in they'll want to wash all your clothes, and you'll probably have to take a shower.\" Joseph gave a small nod. \"I'll give you a call when I get there,\" he said.\n\nIn 1954, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new medication called Thorazine, which could be used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. For the first time, it was possible to provide meaningful care for the mentally ill on an outpatient basis. In the fifties, sixties, and seventies, hundreds of thousands of patients across the country were released from derelict state-run asylums. (A key provision of the Medicare and Medicaid Act, passed in 1965, was that the federal government would no longer pay for care in that type of dedicated facility.) By one count, more than forty-seven thousand previously institutionalized patients moved to New York City. Some lived with families; others lived in single-room-occupancy hotels. When those closed down, in the late seventies and early eighties, people with mental illness started appearing in greater numbers on the city's streets and subways. Most of the funding that had been promised by lawmakers for community-based outpatient care never arrived. The dream of deinstitutionalization collapsed. In 1985, the president of the American Psychiatric Association summed up the situation in an interview with a newspaper: \"The chronic mentally ill patient has had his locus of living and care transferred from a single lousy institution to multiple wretched ones.\"\n\nMeanwhile, police and corrections officers became de-facto mental-health-care providers, one 911 call at a time. In 1999, the police responded to some sixty-four thousand calls about Emotionally Disturbed Persons, the official designation for people presenting symptoms of severe mental illness. (Mental-health advocates consider the label demeaning.) By 2022, the number of such calls had almost tripled; the city's cops responded to nearly five hundred mental-health crises every day. The N.Y.P.D. is, in effect, the largest psychiatric-outreach team in America.\n\nAbout a decade ago, under pressure from advocates, the Police Department began offering a four-day course, called Crisis Intervention Training, which taught officers to use \"active listening\" and \"de-escalation strategies\" when approaching people with mental illness. (An early version of C.I.T. was developed by an instructor who also taught the department's hostage-negotiation course; he changed the background color of the slide deck.) Today, roughly forty per cent of N.Y.P.D. officers have received the training, during which improv actors pretend to have psychotic episodes in the department's \"scenario villages,\" which include a bank vestibule, several apartments, and part of a subway car. But the city's 911 system can't specifically dispatch cops with that training to situations that would benefit from their expertise. (N.Y.P.D. officials recently told internal investigators that they are developing a \"Next Generation 911\" system, which may fix the problem; the last overhaul to the system, which was completed in 2004, cost more than two billion dollars.) Following Mayor Adams's November press conference, the N.Y.P.D. started to require additional training on how to identify someone who is experiencing a mental-health crisis. Nine of ten patrol cops have completed it. The training, which happens during roll call, and includes an at-home video component, lasts for twenty-five minutes.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post database, since 2015 about a fifth of people killed by police nationwide have been in the midst of a mental-health crisis. An investigation by The City, a nonprofit news outlet in New York, found that, during a recent three-year stretch, fourteen people in such a crisis were killed by the N.Y.P.D. In those cases, most of the officers on the scene had not received C.I.T.; in one instance, the cop who killed a mentally ill person was the only responding officer who had not received it. But even a well-trained police officer is not the best person to defuse a mental-health emergency. Six weeks ago, two officers shot a forty-two-year-old homeless man in the midst of a schizophrenic episode. One had received C.I.T.; both had completed the Mayor's mandated mental-health training. The victim, Raul de la Cruz, was visiting his father's apartment to take a shower. He and his father got into an argument. His father called 311 for help, and de la Cruz picked up a knife. The call lasted twenty-three minutes; the cops shot Raul twenty-eight seconds after arriving on the scene.\n\nOne night in late November, two police officers working a shift in the subway came across a sixty-four-year-old homeless woman in need of assistance. She had a history of hospitalization and a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. They did not reach for handcuffs or call an ambulance. Instead, the cops escorted her to a nondescript office building in East Harlem. Around eleven o'clock, a receptionist buzzed them up to the second floor. A security guard searched the woman for weapons and needles, an intake nurse took her vitals, and a peer counsellor led her upstairs to a dormitory with three-inch mattresses, clean sheets, and a small dresser. The next morning, the woman met with a psychiatrist named Rob. \"The cops were really nice,\" she explained. \"They said that I should be in a new place.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nThe woman had landed at one of the city's two Support and Connection Centers, formerly known as Diversion Centers, where people with mental illness and substance-use problems can stay for five or ten days-a sort of way station where they can avoid the hospital or the criminal-justice system, at least for a little while. (Drug use and mental illness often go hand in hand; Bridgette Callaghan, the I.M.T. social worker, told me, \"Drugs are an unhealthy coping skill. But they are a coping skill. Everyone deserves some relief.\") The Support and Connection Center program, modelled on similar ones in San Antonio, Kansas City, and Los Angeles, is good but not especially large. Since it opened, three years ago, the facility has served eight hundred and fifty people-a fraction of a per cent of the city's mental-health 911 calls during that period. \"In five days, it can feel like we're not able to do a lot for people,\" Carli Wargo, who runs the center, told me. \"What we can do is remind people that they're deserving of compassion and dignity and safety. That's something that the big system often forgets.\" She added, \"We're not going to fix the system. It's just not possible. But when I hear, 'I felt safe there,' and 'I felt heard,' those are the biggest compliments.\" Guests can spend their time watching television or checking Facebook; they can also meet with clinicians and substance-use counsellors, apply for supportive housing, and attend various therapy sessions. Above some computers, someone had stuck a note, written in red marker:\n\nFor whom it may concern! Take advantage of this 5-day rest period. Get your groove on the move. Pull your pants up & get to doing the dang thing.\n\nDownstairs, the woman told the psychiatrist, Rob, that she became homeless two years ago after the friend she had been staying with died. She added that she experienced frequent panic attacks, difficulty sleeping, and schizophrenic delusions, and that she had been admitted to several inpatient psychiatric units. Her current psychotropic medicine, Risperdal, wasn't working. She didn't want anyone to take her vitals again. She wouldn't eat any solid food. \"I have trouble trusting people,\" she said. A nurse brought her a nutritional shake, and the woman drank it. Then she said that she didn't want to go back to a hospital or to a homeless shelter, and that she didn't want to live in the subway anymore. \"I need to go somewhere where people can help me out,\" she said. One day in early December, she was admitted to an assisted-living facility; that night, she disappeared.\n\nIn February, a man who police say was experiencing a mental-health crisis, and who had stopped taking his medication, rammed a U-Haul truck into several pedestrians and a police officer in South Brooklyn. Eight people were injured, and one died. Two weeks later, Mayor Adams gave another speech about his plan for people living with severe mental illness. \"This is the next phase,\" he said, pledging that the city would expand a pilot program that dispatched medical professionals instead of police officers to respond to most mental-health 911 calls. (The program had been widely criticized; last year, the average response time was more than fifteen minutes, and medical personnel weren't sent out during late-night hours.) The Mayor also announced seven million dollars in funding for mental-health clubhouses, where people with severe mental illness can meet with social workers and psychiatrists, and, what is perhaps more important, connect with one another-over a game of chess, an art project, a meal.\n\nThis winter, I visited some of the city's mental-health clubhouses. One afternoon, at Fountain House, in Hell's Kitchen, a man told me about the collapse of his business, in New Jersey, in 2014. \"I had lost all my income, so I knew I was going to be homeless,\" he said. He was dressed in Gore-Tex boots, a red scarf, and a tight-fitting leather jacket. \"My first option, at that time, was to commit suicide.\" We sat in a small room, and light streamed through a large window. Upstairs, social workers and counsellors discussed supportive-housing and Medicaid applications. Downstairs, a woman with three large tote bags handed out peppermint candies and pastel-colored lapel pins. \"You can take up to twenty,\" she said. \"Praise God!\" On the second floor, the man with Gore-Tex boots spoke slowly and plainly. \"I wanted to jump under a train,\" he said. \"I didn't have the courage.\"\n\nHe went on, \"Why would you want to expose yourself to the things that could happen through homelessness? Homelessness isn't just the condition of being without a home. It's the ultimate brutality. The fact that I'm here now, and all that's behind me, it wasn't given.\" He had spent three weeks in a homeless shelter, and a few years in rehab programs meant for alcoholics, and a few more at some halfway houses in Far Rockaway. \"If the guy who owned the place didn't like the look of you, he'd come and give you a black garbage bag and say, 'Get the fuck out.' In that setting, there isn't any of this 'tenants' law,' or any of that crap. When I was first there, the road was unpaved. Just gravel. And every time it rained the water would build up about this high\"-he used his hands to show me what a lot of water looked like-\"and you were forced to walk through the water, and then you'd have to go through the whole day with wet feet.\"\n\nIn 2017, he arrived at Fountain House, which helped get him a part-time job and connected him with supportive housing-his first apartment in four years. \"For about six months, I didn't trust it,\" he said. \"I bought a blow-up mattress and just slept on that and waited for them to come and kick me out. Slowly, it dawned on me that they weren't going to. And a certain amount of growth happened from there. The growth comes from security.\" It was quiet for a moment. \"I've had just over five years of good stability,\" he said. \"I haven't had any major incidents or anything for five years. The only thing is that about a week ago at my job I did have an incident with someone.\"\n\nHe wouldn't elaborate. Recently, when I tried to get back in touch with him, Nancy Young, who is a program director at Fountain House, told me that he didn't want to speak with me again. \"He's had other incidents in the past,\" she said. \"Sometimes he reaches out to me and sometimes he doesn't. Sometimes he self-corrects. Every single person here has a story like that. This is a place that helps people pick themselves up.\" Our conversation turned to Jordan Neely's death. \"It's an us-and-them mentality,\" she said. \"We don't feel connected to people with mental illness at all. We feel scared of them. It's easy for people to fall from a healthy place, and yet we blame them for not knowing how to make it in this world. It's scary when we see someone who reminds us that it could happen to any of us.\" She paused. \"I wish we had found Jordan Neely. I wish we knew him. It could have been very different.\"\n\nIn and out. Around and around. One institution to the next: 7-Eleven, Kirby Forensic, Atlantic Armory, Manhattan Psychiatric, Maimonides, Lincoln, Kings County, Bellevue. Tonight, there are more than seventy thousand people without beds of their own sleeping in homeless shelters and temporary-housing programs and other places, too. Some shelters have kitchens that serve freshly stewed chicken thighs and homemade strawberry pie; others serve chicken that is undercooked and mealy apples for dessert. Many shelter beds are seven inches off the ground and bolted to the floor. For the mentally ill, there are forty-nine hundred beds in mental-health shelters, but more than forty-nine hundred people want to sleep in them. And so tonight mentally ill men and women are sleeping in large intake shelters, on the street, in the trains. Tomorrow, they will wake up and go about their day.\n\nPatrol cops will help them, and harass them, and call ambulances, which will pick them up and take them to the hospital, often but not always against their will. Some will stay there for a long time. Others will leave after lunch. The most fortunate among them will meet with their I.M.T. or ACT or A.O.T. teams-nurses, behavioral specialists, social workers turned friends. They will also go to the deli for breakfast, to the train station, to their jobs, to the grocery store. They'll sit down and rest for a while, in a plastic chair at the library, or on a park bench, under a favorite sycamore tree.\n\nRecently, at the Hoyt-Schermerhorn subway station, in Brooklyn, I watched as a woman walked slowly toward the painted yellow line at the edge of the platform. It was a Saturday afternoon, and the woman was dressed in a long gray parka with the hood pulled up. She was wearing reflective bicycling gloves and dirty suède boots; her hands were moving in wobbly circles above her head, almost as if she were dancing. She looked and looked into the tunnel; usually, people don't stand so close to the tracks for so long. As the train screeched into the station, the woman sprinted toward the yellow line. The train thundered past; she stopped. Then the doors opened, and strangers poured onto the platform. The woman boarded the crowded train. Inside, several people made idle chitchat. A few others looked down at their phones. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The systemic issues revealed by Jordan Neely's killing, explained\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nDaniel Penny has now been indicted in connection with the tragic killing, which came in a climate of fearmongering and New York City's long failure to support people experiencing homelessness.\n\nby Nicole Narea and Li Zhou\n\nIn early May, Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old Black, unhoused man experiencing mental health issues, died after fellow New York City subway passenger Daniel Penny put him in a chokehold for 15 minutes.\n\nA Manhattan grand jury has now indicted Penny, a 24-year-old former Marine, in connection with the killing. It's not clear what the exact charges are given that the indictment has yet to be unsealed, and he has yet to enter a plea.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office pursued second-degree manslaughter charges , which carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, after interviewing eyewitnesses, 911 callers, and officers at the scene. Penny turned himself over to law enforcement and was released on $100,000 bail following his initial court appearance in May, sparking widespread outcry.\n\nThe case has brought to the forefront several of the systemic issues New York and the country are confronting: crime rates, fears about crime, and how politicians are exploiting those fears seem likely to have played a role. For those gathered in the subway to protest Neely's killing, he's become a symbol of New York City's failure to provide an adequate safety net to vulnerable individuals and protect them from danger and criminalization. Racial justice advocates have also called out the initial delays in the city's decision to pursue charges against Penny as the latest example of violence toward Black Americans seemingly being condoned by the criminal justice system.\n\n\"This is about much more than just this one specific case,\" said Bill Neidhardt, a Democratic strategist based in New York. \"There's a clear throughline between the endless demonization of unhoused people and mentally ill people and also the relentless campaign to fan the flames of fear about crime in the city.\"\n\nSome city officials have declined to condemn Penny throughout the law enforcement investigation and court proceedings. Immediately after the killing, New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams refused to discourage other subway passengers from similarly taking matters into their own hands: \"Each situation is different. ... We cannot just blanketly say what a passenger should or should not do in a situation like that,\" he told CNN.\n\nOn Wednesday, he again withheld judgment, issuing a statement saying that he has \"the utmost faith in the judicial process, and now that the grand jury has indicted Daniel Penny, a trial and justice can move forward.\"\n\nBut whatever the result, rendering justice in this one case won't solve the broader systemic issues that led to Neely's killing and the initially one-sided public response defending Penny.\n\n\"I think [what happened to Jordan Neely] is yet another example of a whole host of responses we have to people who are experiencing homelessness, people with serious psychiatric impairments, race, fear, the jump to 'my safety, you're a threat,'\" says Kendall Atterbury, a social work expert affiliated with Yale School of Medicine's Program for Recovery and Community Health. \"It's unconscionable that we keep allowing this to happen.\"\n\nSome have come to Penny's defense, saying his actions were justified, and some media coverage has painted Neely as the aggressor. Headlines from local news outlets initially described Neely as the \"Man Who Threatened NYC Subway Riders\" and \"Man Harassing NoHo Subway Riders\" and declared that the rider had tried to \"Subdue Him.\"\n\nAccording to one eyewitness who posted a video of the altercation on his Facebook page, Neely yelled that he did not have food or anything to drink, that he was ready to die, and that he didn't care about facing life in prison. But that eyewitness also told the New York Post that Neely did not attack anyone in the car.\n\nLaw enforcement also found no evidence that Neely had become violent or threatened anyone specifically, including Penny, in their investigation. But initial headlines assumed Neely would have become violent if his fellow subway rider had not intervened - assumptions that are, experts say, rooted in years of political fearmongering over a pandemic spike in violent crime in New York City. That wave of violent crime has subsided, but nonviolent crimes were up in 2022 and at the forefront of New York state voters' minds in the midterms.\n\n\"When politicians constantly use New York City as the emblem of danger and violence and they exploit that to motivate their voters, why would we be shocked that people in New York are walking around on pins and needles and afraid all the time?\" said Jeffrey Butts, a professor and director of the Research and Evaluation Center at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\nAs was the case across much of the US in 2020, the murder rate jumped significantly - by about 47 percent - in New York City. Though murders were still about 80 percent below their peak in 1990, New Yorkers had well-founded concerns that their city was less safe than it had been just a few years ago. Adams, a Democrat and former NYPD cop, rode a \"tough on crime\" message to win the city's mayoral race in 2021.\n\nBy the end of 2022, city homicides had fallen to their lowest levels since the onset of the pandemic, though a surge in robberies and burglaries contributed to a 22 percent rise in overall crime since the previous year. That wasn't enough to assuage voters' concerns, which had been fed by New York City tabloid coverage, turning them into a full-blown \"crime panic,\" said Gabe Tobias, a Democratic strategist based in New York.\n\nWith headlines likening the city to Blade Runner and asking, \"Will No One Help Us?\" amid concerns about public safety, publications like the New York Post were amplifying the spike in crimes and individual crimes, including other violent attacks on the subway system in Manhattan.\n\nCrime in New York City became the subject of almost 800 stories in digital and print outlets each month after Adams's inauguration, compared to an average of 132 stories monthly under his predecessor Bill de Blasio.\n\nWhat many of those stories failed to get across was the critical context that New York was still a lot safer than many other parts of America and that the city's violent crime levels were not nearly as high as they have been historically and had abated substantially in the years since 2020.\n\n\"It was certainly a big increase, and it was almost an overnight increase. But historically, it was nowhere near where it was when New York was having 2,000-plus murders in a year,\" said Jeff Asher, co-founder of the criminal justice data firm AH Datalytics.\n\nFor more than two decades, New York City's murder rate has been consistently at or below the national average, which is extraordinary for a city of its size, Asher said. Shootings were down 23 percent this year as of March. The per capita violent crime rate in New York City is also lower than in many small towns in the South, Butts said. (New York City remains safer than other big cities and safer than small-town America , Bloomberg's Justin Fox noted last year.)\n\n\"People are bad at perceiving crime trends. And they're especially bad at perceiving crime trends while they're in the middle of them,\" Asher said. \"And so when you have highly public incidents, it can give people a false impression of what the overall big-picture trends look like.\"\n\nExperts worry that Neely's killing is, in part, a result of relentless political rhetoric that has contributed to the public's incomplete understanding of actual crime levels, and that by refusing to outright condemn the killer, Adams is perpetuating that rhetoric. \"Someone committed murder on the subway in broad daylight,\" Neidhardt said. \"You should be able to acknowledge what happened here.\"\n\nNeely's killing has also raised new attention on the way that people experiencing homelessness have been treated both by the city and its residents. Advocates have been working for years to close gaps in mental health support and end punitive treatment of unhoused people. And the initial release of the man who conducted the fatal chokehold prompted outcry given the message it sent about his actions.\n\n\"The fact that someone who took the life of a distressed, mentally ill human being on a subway could be set free without facing any consequences is shocking and evidences the city's callous indifference to the lives of those who are homeless and psychiatrically unwell,\" Dave Giffen, the executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, said in a statement in the wake of Neely's killing.\n\nA 2016 United Nations report highlighted how people experiencing homelessness are subject to \" inhumane and degrading treatment \" both by the government and by private citizens. And according to a 2020 study published in The Lancet , unhoused people are at much higher risk of being the victims of crime and violence than people who are housed. Narratives about unhoused people being \"dangerous\" also spur a \"climate of fear ,\" advocates say.\n\nIn recent years , there's been a growing focus on such stories amid high-profile instances of unhoused people being involved in violence in cities including New York City. The increased homelessness in the city, where it's at the highest levels since the Great Depression, has also drawn attention to these concerns. Advocates note that it's important not to make sweeping statements, however, and stress that unhoused people are more likely to be the target than the perpetrators of fatal violence .\n\nExperts have also criticized New York City's implementation last year of an involuntary hospitalization policy for people navigating serious mental illness. It has enabled law enforcement and other government employees to hospitalize unhoused people who appear to be undergoing a mental health crisis, and a federal court declined to block the policy . After Neely's killing, Adams sought to codify the policy as part of a legislative proposal that he called the \" Supportive Interventions Act \" - but it never got traction in the state legislature before the session ended in early June. Those who've studied the issue say that it doesn't provide a durable solution to challenges people may be having with mental illness and lack of housing.\n\n\"It's a short-term solution, but it's one that's been shown not to work,\" says Deborah Padgett, an NYU social work professor who has studied homelessness. \"In a matter of days, these people are going to be back on the street and no better.\" Mayor Adams touted the city's commitment to mental health resources in a statement following Neely's killing in May, noting that it was making \"record investments in providing care to those who need it.\"\n\nBroadly, experts note that the reaction lawmakers across the country have had to homelessness has been focused on penalizing those who are unhoused and on reducing their visibility, when the focus should be on providing stable housing outside of shelters.\n\n\"Punitive police responses focusing on behaviors associated with homelessness - including everything from encampment visibility, to sleeping in public, to public displays of mental illness - is one of, if not the most common, response to homelessness across the country,\" Charley Willison, a Cornell public health professor who studies the issue, told Vox. \"Extensive previous research has shown that punitive responses do not end homelessness, and actually facilitate cycles of homelessness.\"\n\nInstead, Willison and Padgett note, increasing units of affordable housing and providing support services for people in these places has been proven to work.\n\nAccording to the Coalition for the Homeless , nearly 69,000 unhoused people spent each night in one of the city's shelters in December 2022. \"The bottom line is the lack of affordable housing, and so little has been done in that area for the last 30 to 40 years,\" says Padgett.\n\nThe fatal violence toward Neely, and the initial release of the white Marine who perpetrated it, also pointed to how such attacks on Black people have been treated differently by the criminal justice system. As the New York Times reported, under New York law , \"a person can only use deadly physical force if they have reason to believe that an attacker is doing or about to do the same.\"\n\n\"Racism that continues to permeate throughout our society allows for a level of dehumanization that denies Black people from being recognized as victims when subjected to acts of violence,\" New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said in a statement shortly after Neely was killed.\n\nIn multiple cases, including the shooting of teenager Ralph Yarl and the killing of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery , law enforcement has moved slowly to formally charge white perpetrators involved in these acts of violence. \"[Homicide] cases with a white perpetrator and a Black victim are 281 percent more likely to be ruled justified than cases with a white perpetrator and white victim,\" according to an Urban Institute study .\n\n\"The perceptions of Black people have long been interpreted through a distorted, racialized lens that aims to justify violence against us,\" Adams, the New York City Council speaker, noted.\n\nIn a 2017 study , researchers found that people perceived Black men who were the same size as white men to be larger and more threatening. Such perceptions likely contribute to the willingness by police and other residents to use more force against Black Americans in settings where they otherwise would not.\n\nUpdate, June 15, 1:50 pm ET: This story was originally published on May 5 and has been updated to reflect the grand jury indictment of Penny.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Why conservatives condemn Luigi Mangione and celebrate Daniel Penny\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA tale of two killings.\n\nby Zack Beauchamp\n\nThe American right has spent the past week performing an interesting tap dance: condemning the left for cheering on one alleged killer while turning another into a right-wing celebrity.\n\nIn the first case, health care CEO shooting suspect Luigi Mangione , the right is appalled by (the admittedly appalling) celebrations in a certain corner of the left. \"It's really terrible that some people seem to admire him,\" President-elect Donald Trump said in a Monday press conference.\n\nThe second killer - Daniel Penny , who choked homeless man Jordan Neely on the New York subway - has become the subject of much right-wing admiration . After his acquittal on manslaughter charges last week , Vice President-elect JD Vance invited him to attend the Army-Navy football game with Trump .\n\nThis contrast was everywhere, among both Republican electeds and right-leaning pundits (much as a mirror image discourse played out among the left's Mangione supporters).\n\nThe ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.\n\nIncoming House GOP member Brandon Gill, who had broadcast criticisms of liberals on Twitter for lionizing Mangione, said in a Sunday speech that \"we need a lot more Daniel Pennys in this country because we have far too many Jordan Neelys.\" Bari Weiss, whose Free Press publication had published an editorial calling the very idea of prosecuting Penny unjust , went on Fox News to declare that \"you cannot have a functioning liberal democracy like the one we have and accept that certain people are allowed to be murdered in the streets of Manhattan.\"\n\nNothing captures the divergence in reactions to the two killings than a viral clip of Fox News host Laura Ingraham , in which she says:\n\nPeople celebrating [Mangione]? This is a sickness - honestly, so disappointing, but I guess we shouldn't be surprised. Gentlemen, thank you so much.\n\nUp next, the other big news out of New York: Daniel Penny. A lot of people think he's a hero.\n\nTo many on the left, this might seem like pure hypocrisy. But I think that's too simple. Not only does it skate over some obvious differences between the two situations, it also fails to grapple with the deeper ideological differences between right- and left-wing approaches to these issues.\n\nThe notion of \"order\" plays a central role in conservative thought, in a way that liberals and leftists often have trouble reckoning with. Once you understand the nature of the right's philosophical commitment to order, it's easier to see why they find no hypocrisy in their treatment of Mangione and Penny - even if one can fairly question if the right is letting itself off too easily.\n\nWhile reporting this piece, I watched the available footage of the two incidents in question. And it's clear that they are very, very different situations.\n\nThe killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson was a cold-blooded killing; multiple shots to the back with no prior altercation and no hint that Thompson posed an immediate physical threat to anyone. This was a straightforward, intentional, and premeditated killing.\n\nNeely's situation is different: Some passengers on the train said he was threatening to hurt someone, though he hadn't actually done so. Penny claims that he restrained Neely to protect the other passengers.\n\nIn reality, it's highly questionable whether putting Neely into a chokehold for six straight minutes is a justifiable response to mere verbal aggression. Even Penny's defense team implicitly conceded death was not an appropriate punishment, with his attorneys arguing both that Penny didn't intend to kill Neely and technically may not have .\n\nBut conservatives aren't just arguing that Penny should be found not guilty. They're celebrating him as a hero. In this, they are mirroring those on the left who see the extinction of a human life on the streets of New York as a political victory.\n\nSo why? How can they condemn the left's choice to lionize an (alleged) killer on the one hand while doing the same with one that they like?\n\nIn National Review, cultural critic Christian Schneider took this challenge head-on . His argument proceeds by comic book analogy, comparing Mangione to the Joker and Penny to Batman.\n\nMangione \"likely killed a man in cold blood as an act of showmanship, of toying with law enforcement. It's straight out of the Joker's antihero playbook, in which he earns the respect of like-minded citizens as he unleashes chaos,\" Schneider writes.\n\nPenny, by \"committing a random act of public safety\" and being condemned for it, has in contrast begun \"the most basic superhero origin narrative: An individual looks around, sees the justice system can't handle the criminality infesting the streets, and takes action on his own.\"\n\nSchneider's language may be simplistic, but he is putting his finger on the pulse of the conservative approach to these issues. Conservatism is, above all else, a philosophy of order. In fact, the insistence on order's value is one of the things that binds together the entire conservative coalition - from Trump to the GOP's centrist squishes.\n\nWhen Russell Kirk, a defining voice in 20th-century conservatism, made a list of 10 conservative principles , he made this the very first: \"The conservative believes that there exists an enduring moral order. That order is made for man, and man is made for it: human nature is a constant, and moral truths are permanent.\" Much of his list consists of an elaboration on this principle: an accounting of what \"the enduring moral order\" is, how it shapes the health of a political community, and how it may be prudently adjusted over time.\n\nThe moral order, for Kirk, is a social code developed collectively by a society over centuries - more akin to common sense than abstractly reasoned-out principles. It is enforced both by law and custom; without it, we risk wholesale societal collapse. \"If the old institutional and moral safeguards of a nation are neglected, then the anarchic impulse in humankind breaks loose,\" he writes.\n\nOn this conservative understanding, the killing of the United Health Care CEO is an exemplar of \"the anarchic impulse\": someone violating a time-honored principle of addressing political concerns through the ballot box rather than the bullet. It represents a man attacking the system that we, collectively, have decided on\n\nThe killing of Jordan Neely, by contrast, represents a defense of the moral order in the conservative mind. By acting belligerently and threatening passengers on the train, Neely had become a force of chaos and disruption. If the state wasn't going to intervene to protect the moral order against someone like Penny, then citizens would eventually be forced to act.\n\n\"When liberals destroy [the] rule of law, heroes like Daniel Penny are what stop violent thugs from terrorizing innocent citizens. He should be celebrated,\" Gill, the incoming Texas congressman, writes on X/Twitter .\n\nFor leftists and liberals, this logic sounds a lot like a justification for hierarchy - a fancy way of saying that the people at the top of the social system deserve more rights and protections, no matter how much harm they do. It amounts to a vindication of Frank Wilhoit's quip that \"conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.\"\n\nMoreover, the alleged defense of order can become a justification for its own kind of dis order. Daniel Penny is not just a one-off: There is a long and troubling history of conservatives endorsing vigilante killings of the \"right kind\" of people, with fairly recent examples including Kyle Rittenhouse and George Zimmerman. Conservative fetishization of individuals defending order, of a \"good guy with a gun,\" is part of why America has such a severe violent crime problem in the first place.\n\nUltimately, though, I find the very need to have this conversation troubling. It's not good for democracy to have competing factions - left, right, or otherwise - celebrating alleged killers, attempting to score political points with pamphlets written in blood. And the more we as a society normalize this gladiatorial ethos, the greater the risk becomes of these horrors repeating themselves.\n\nThe ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.\n\nAn Oval Office meeting on Monday revealed how Trump would like to rule - and why he might not be able to.\n\nAfter the tariffs, they're worried they made a MAGA mistake.\n\nThe right's muddled response to Trump's student deportations expose its paper-thin commitment to the principle.﻿\n\nThe chat logs revealed an administration that wants to both dominate the world and withdraw from it.\n\n﻿The MAGA movement loves Israel - but is increasingly hostile to Jews.\n\nThe online right loves talking about \"IQ.\" Guess why.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nOn Today, Explained, WNYC reporters Matt Katz and Samantha Max explain the complexity of the incident.\n\nby Avishay Artsy\n\nThe killing of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway train last week has sparked protests about the police handling of the case, brought new focus to conversations about crime in big cities, and raised questions about New York's policies governing the unhoused.\n\nNeely, a 30-year-old Black homeless man known to New Yorkers for his impersonations of Michael Jackson, was put in a chokehold by another passenger, 24-year-old Daniel Penny, a white Marine veteran from Long Island.\n\nPassengers on the Manhattan F train said Neely appeared to be in the midst of a mental health crisis. Neely reportedly shouted that he was hungry, thirsty, tired, and that he didn't care if he died or went to jail.\n\nA three-minute video, recorded by freelance journalist Juan Alberto Vasquez, showed Penny choking Neely, with several other passengers helping to restrain Neely or watching.\n\nNeely's death was ruled a homicide, but Penny has not been charged with manslaughter or murder. Police and the Manhattan district attorney's office are investigating the killing and interviewing other eyewitnesses.\n\nAttorneys for Penny released a statement Friday offering condolences and arguing he was a good Samaritan. Neely's family has called for justice for Jordan's killing.\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams, who cast the city as crime-ridden during his 2020 campaign, has faced public criticism for not condemning the killing. As Neely's death became national news, Adams told CNN , \"We cannot just blanketly say what a passenger should or should not do in a situation like that. We should allow the investigation to take its course.\"\n\nSamantha Max and Matt Katz, public safety reporters for WNYC and Gothamist, spoke to Today, Explained host Noel King about the killing of Jordan Neely and the response from law enforcement and public officials. They explained how the incident has become a \"kind of a Rorschach test\" for how Americans think about class, and about the value of Black life in America today.\n\nThe interview below has been edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to and follow Today, Explained on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Stitcher , or wherever you find podcasts .\n\nTell me what we know about Jordan Neely. Who was he?\n\nHe's somebody that had long struggled with mental illness. His life at a young age was quite tragic. His mother was murdered when he was 14. She was actually strangled to death, which just has an eerie resonance here. And he testified at the trial for the man who killed her, who was convicted. [The murderer] was a domestic partner of hers.\n\nHe made a living as a moonwalking Michael Jackson impersonator who danced on the subways and on the subway platforms of New York City since at least 2009. He was very well known to commuters. He was beloved by many people because he was very good at what he did. He was part of a little community of Michael Jackson impersonators who worked the streets of New York City. Our colleague spoke to somebody who knew him from foster care and said he used to share the money he made on the subway with other kids from foster care.\n\nOutlets who have gotten information leaked to them by law enforcement have reported on many arrests for low-level offenses that Neely had in his past. A victim of Neely's gave an on-the-record interview to The New York Daily News and said he was punched in the face by Neely just while standing on a subway platform a few years ago. Neely was arrested after that, and the victim thought Neely should be getting treatment for what seemed to him like untreated drug addiction and mental illness. So we know that he had many brushes with the law by nature of the fact that he lived on the streets and lived in the subways.\n\nIs what Jordan Neely was doing an uncommon thing to see on a subway in New York these days?\n\nIt is not uncommon. From my anecdotal experience, there are more people who are displaying signs of mental illness or drug use on the trains now than they were several years ago. I've had personal encounters. I was on my way to WNYC a few months ago to guest host a radio show, it was eight in the morning. The train was not empty in any respect. And a man who appeared at first to be just an aggressive panhandler somehow picked me out of the crowd, got in my face, spit in my face - I was wearing a mask, fortunately - and then moved on. And part of what I found a little unsettling about it was, nobody else on the train intervened. I understand that, but nobody even said anything to me afterward, like, \"hey, are you okay?\" or, \"hey, sorry about that.\" And I think what that indicates is, it's so normal. You know, I doubt the people, once they got off the train, thought much about it or texted a friend about the incident. So, yes, this is a common thing.\n\nThat being said, it's still very rare for there to be violent crimes happening on the subways, especially compared to historic times. But it has become a huge point of contention for the elected officials in New York City and in New York State.\n\nBoth Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul have made a huge point of flooding the subways with police officers. They are in the process of installing surveillance cameras on every single subway car. They're sending mental health professionals into the subways. The mayor and the governor have gotten a lot of criticism for plans that they've put in place to forcibly remove people who seem to be in the midst of a mental health crisis. A lot of New Yorkers are just really conflicted about it.\n\nWhat happened in the days after Neely was killed?\n\nThe medical examiner ruled that the death was a homicide. That is not a legal term, it's a medical term. But it's essentially a finding that someone has died at the hands of another person and the way that that death happened was through compression of the neck. So any question that we had about whether or not it was actually the chokehold that caused his death, the medical examiner ruled that that was what happened.\n\nOf course, from there you have people wondering, we have this ruling from the medical examiner, why have no charges been filed? And the Manhattan DA's office comes out with a statement saying essentially, please be patient, we are investigating and we're asking anyone who might have witnessed this to come forward. And, that's still where we're at right now.\n\nSam, you were at a protest and you talked about how people there were feeling. Let me ask you both: More broadly, as you talk to New Yorkers, what are you hearing?\n\nI think people are just really upset and disheartened. That being said, I think it is kind of a Rorschach test, because if you look at my Twitter DMs right now, there are some people that are not upset that this happened. And I think it really is just kind of a litmus test to see how people react to something like this.\n\nI was speaking with two men who were on the train, and they came onto the platform as all of this was going down. Their names were James Kings and Johnny Grima. They both throughout their lives have experienced homelessness. I think for them, it was just a really scary scene to stumble into because James Kings,[told] me he felt, as a Black man who has lived much of his life unhoused, like that could have been him. And he just was really scared by that and just feeling very unsettled by it. I think they both also felt really helpless, like they had stumbled onto the scene when it was too late for them to do anything. And yet they still felt like they should have done more.\n\nThis is totally, as Sam said, a prism for how people view so many different hot-button issues: safety in public places, the treatment of young Black men, the broadening mental health crisis in the wake of Covid, the effectiveness [and] the usefulness of policing. And it's become, through the media and social media, a major debate now in the larger national culture war. I mean, despite a lack of details that we have about what's going on, we already had Elon Musk liking a tweet referring to Jordan Neely as a \"worthless individual.\" You see that kind of rhetoric now.\n\nAnd then the question is for so many people, and the debate is, was the person who put him in a chokehold a bloodthirsty racist, or was he a hero who was protecting innocent commuters? Is this about the government's failure to provide shelter and food to the poor? Because Neely reportedly had complained about being hungry and thirsty before he was put in a chokehold. Or does this whole incident show the failure of government to provide law and order, and this is just evidence of the fact that people have to take matters into their own hands?\n\nSo this is going to be a continuing conversation. And I feel like it's going to shadow our politics in the city and maybe beyond the city for quite a while.\n\nWhen we bring our thoughts back to Jordan Neely, are there policies that might have prevented this incident? Is there something that should have been in place that currently isn't?\n\nThe subways have been flooded with cops and yet it is impossible to have a police officer on every single subway car all the time. So when this happened with Jordan Neely, there were no police officers there. And it took several minutes, even once they were on the platform, for police officers to arrive. So that is certainly question No. 1 of how many officers is enough, and whether or not police officers actually do make people feel safer and who they're making feel safer. Because certainly at the protests I was at, there were some people who felt less safe having the police officers around.\n\nThe mayor and the governor have been sending outreach teams into the subways, particularly at the stops that are at the end of the line, once the train has stopped, before it turns back around, where they are often finding folks experiencing homelessness. And the idea is that they'll be offering resources to them, trying to get them the care that they need. But it's still only scratching the surface of the amount of need that [exists].\n\nWe also have a huge shortage of affordable housing and places for folks to go and a bunch of psychiatric hospital beds that went offline during the pandemic and are just now starting to be brought back online. There's just more need than there is capacity to serve at this point.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nA conversation with Sen.

      "text": "Daniel Penny hired by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nFebruary 5, 2025 / 4:41 PM EST / CBS New York\n\nNEW YORK - Marine veteran Daniel Penny has a new job.\n\nIn December, Penny, 26, was found not guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway car. The more serious manslaughter charge against Penny had already been thrown out after jurors said they couldn't reach a decision.\n\nPenny, a Long Island native, has been hired as a \"deal partner\" by prestigious Silicon Valley investment firm Andreessen Horowitz in its American Dynamism division.

Unfortunately, he could not be revived, and was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nNeely's death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner . The cause of death was compression of the neck.\n\nA jury found Penny not guilty after 20 hours of deliberations.

      "text": "Who is Daniel Penny? What we know about the Marine veteran acquitted in Jordan Neely's subway death\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  December 10, 2024 / 5:27 AM EST / CBS New York\n\nNEW YORK -- Daniel Penny has been acquitted in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely last spring on the New York City subway .\n\nA jury of five men and seven women weighed whether Penny was guilty of second-degree manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide in Neely's death.\n\nThe more serious manslaughter charge was thrown out after jurors said they could not reach a decision. The jury came back with a not guilty verdict on the lesser charge Monday.\n\nHere's everything we learned about Penny over the course of the case.\n\nPenny served four years with the U.S. Marine Corps, and his platoon sergeants testified at trial . They spoke about the Marine Corps values of honor, courage and commitment, saying if a member does not uphold those values, they will not be promoted.\n\nPenny's attorneys asked if he had a reputation of being \"calm and peaceful,\" to which one sergeant replied, \"absolutely.\"\n\n\"You have to be someone who displays empathy above reproach,\" he said.\n\nAnother sergeant added if you \"give him a task, I know it's going to be completed and done right.\"\n\nPenny's martial arts instructor from the Marine Corps, Joseph Caballer, also testified about the chokehold he used on Neely , saying Marines are trained not to hold a choke longer than five seconds. On cross examination, the instructor said five seconds is not applicable in the real-world and each \"situation dictates.\"\n\nCaballer said properly applying a choke would \"render your aggressor unconscious,\" then Marines are told to release pressure immediately, otherwise it \"could lead to injury or death.\"\n\nHe went on to testify about the differences between a \"blood choke\" and an \"air choke,\" and walked the jury through video of the chokehold that was used, frame by frame. In one particular shot, Caballer said it appeared Penny's forearm was pressing against Neely's trachea.\n\n\"Is this an improper blood choke?\" prosecutors asked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Caballer said.\n\n\"Is it potentially lethal?\" prosecutors asked.\n\n\"Yes, absolutely,\" Caballer said.\n\nOn cross, Caballer said it was hard to tell if pressure was being applied at certain times and that during a struggle, arm placements can shift. Caballer added he couldn't tell from the video whether Penny was ever applying a \"full\" blood or air choke.\n\nAfter leaving the Marines, Penny took time to travel and then applied to colleges, his mother, Gina, said on the stand . He was 24 years old at the time of the incident.\n\nHis mother said he was pursuing a degree in architecture from the New York City College of Technology and planned to later transfer. He was living at an apartment in the East Village, teaching swim lessons at a gym and working at a restaurant in Brooklyn.\n\nShe also said he was taught honesty, humility and kindness growing up, did well in school and sports, and played the bass in a couple Long Island orchestras. She looked at him while testifying, saying she loved him with all her heart.\n\n\"Of course I would be here for my son,\" she said.\n\nPenny released a video statement through his attorney in the days following the deadly encounter. He said he was acting in self-defense as Neely acted erratically on an F train in SoHo.\n\n\"The three main threats that he repeated over and over was, 'I'm going to kill you,' 'I'm prepared to go to jail for life,' and 'I'm willing to die,'\" Penny said in the video. \"I was scared for myself, but I looked around, I saw women and children. He was yelling in their faces ... I didn't want to be put in that situation, but I couldn't just sit still and let him carry out these threats.\"\n\nHe said he was not trying to kill Neely and race was not a factor.\n\n\"Some people say I was trying to choke him to death, which is also not true. I was trying to restrain him. You can see in the video, there's a clear rise and fall of his chest,\" said Penny. \"I didn't see a Black man threatening passengers. I saw a man threatening passengers, a lot of whom were people of color.\"\n\nPenny was charged 11 days after the incident and released on $100,000 bail. An online fundraiser was set up to help with his legal expenses , garnering more than $3,222,053 to date.\n\nNeely was a 30-year-old subway performer known for his Michael Jackson impersonations.\n\nRecords show he struggled with homelessness and mental illness after his mother was murdered in 2007.\n\nHis death sparked days of protests and questions about how New York City responds to people in mental health crisis .\n\n\"My son didn't have to go through this. I didn't have to go through this, either. It hurts. It really, really hurts,\" his father, Andre Zachery, told CBS News New York after the verdict. \"What's going to happen to us now? Had enough of this. System is rigged. Come on, people. Let's do something about this.\"\n\n\"No one deserves to be choked to death,\" said Gwen Carr, Eric Garner's mother . \"I tell this family, do not give up, because that's what they want you to do. They want to discourage you, just like they tried to discourage me. Ten years later, I'm still fighting.\"\n\n\"This verdict represents the blatant legalization of civilian vigilantism, sending a dangerous message that citizens can now take matters into their own hands, even if it leads to someone's death,\" the Rev. Al Sharpton, who spoke at Neely's funeral , said in a statement.\n\nCBS News New York learned Neely agreed to out-patient mental health treatment as part of a plea deal in a prior arrest, but he left the program within a matter of weeks. As a result, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.\n\nAlice Gainer joined CBS News New York as a reporter and anchor in January 2013.

We all were scared for him,\" Raiser said.\n\nOn Friday, the jury sent notes they were deadlocked on the top charge of second-degree manslaughter . The judge dismissed the charge, sent them home early and instructed them to begin deliberating on the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide Monday morning .\n\n\"Was he prepared to go to prison?\" Gainer asked.\n\n\"He knew it was on the table. Of course, when that top count was dismissed, that became less of a possibility, but it was still a possibility and one in which he was concerned with, but he understood that was a consequence of going to trial and he was willing to accept that,\" Raiser said.\n\nThe jury deliberated for about an hour or less, unanimously finding the 26-year-old Marine veteran  not guilty in the chokehold death of 30-year-old Neely on board the subway last year.\n\nProsecutors told jurors Penny's intentions were good in wanting to protect others from an erratic and threatening Neely, but argued he held the chokehold for too long .\n\n\"There was a lack of proof that he continually applied pressure sufficient to render him unconscious and then continue that pressure until he died,\" Raiser said.\n\nPenny's attorneys, also military veterans, understood Penny's actions.\n\n\"Why he stepped up the way that he did, why he was able to overcome that kind of sense of fear and be able to put himself in danger,\" Raiser said.\n\nDemonstrators outside the courthouse taunted Penny daily, shouting \"justice for Jordan Neely\" and \"murderer.\"\n\n\"He does, of course, have remorse for any loss of life,\" Raiser said.\n\nGainer reached out to the Manhattan district attorney's office to request a sit-down interview and has not heard back.\n\nRaiser said now that the trial is over, Penny plans to work full-time and continue with school, where he is studying architecture.\n\nDozens of people, including community activists, gathered at Union Square on Tuesday night to protest the verdict .\n\nOrganizers said the city is also to blame for failing to address the homelessness crisis and not providing sufficient mental health care to vulnerable New Yorkers .\n\n\"This is a callous and inhuman way of looking at the situation. Daniel Penny is not a good Samaritan, he's a murderer, and he was protected by the same system that failed Jordan Neely,\" activist Sean Blackmon said.\n\nNeely's father has filed a civil lawsuit against Penny .\n\nAlice Gainer joined CBS News New York as a reporter and anchor in January 2013.

Penny could have faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted of manslaughter, which is no longer on the table.\n\nFriday morning, the jury informed the judge they were unable to reach unanimity on the manslaughter charge, but the judge ordered them to keep deliberating. At around 3 p.m., the jury came back with a second note, saying they were still unable to agree.\n\nThe defense moved for a mistrial, but the judge granted the prosecution's request to dismiss the charge, clearing the way for the jury to decide on criminally negligent homicide.\n\nThe jury was sent home for the day and will return on Monday.\n\nPenny, 26, is charged in the chokehold death of Neely aboard a subway last year. The Marine veteran pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges.\n\nThe judge instructed the jury at the beginning of deliberations that they must agree on the manslaughter charge before they can even consider the second charge of criminally negligent homicide. The jury has been told all along that if they were to find Penny guilty of second-degree manslaughter, they would not have to issue a decision on the lesser count.\n\nThe jury started deliberating on Tuesday and has sent several notes since.\n\nJurors requested to watch cell phone and police bodycam footage of the incident, as well as Penny's interview at the police station. They also wanted to hear readback of the defense's cross examination of New York City Medical Examiner Dr. Cynthia Harris , who performed Neely's autopsy, and ruled his cause of death compression of the neck .\n\nJurors also asked for part of the judge's instructions, as well as the legal definitions of \"recklessness\" and \"negligence,\" to be re-read to them. They also have asked the judge for clarification on the term \"reasonable person.\"\n\nProsecutors have argued that while Penny's intentions were good in restraining Neely, he had him in a chokehold for too long. Penny's defense has argued he wasn't using pressure during the hold, just holding Neely down. A defense witness also disagreed with the Medical Examiner's cause of death determination , arguing Neely died due to a combination of factors including drugs and sickle cell crisis.\n\nJesse Zanger is the managing editor of CBSNewYork.com.

      "text": "Marine vet Daniel Penny defense fund nears $3M in Jordan Neely chokehold death as DA tips hand on evidence\n\nDonations - and evidence - are piling up in the subway-chokehold homicide case against Daniel Penny.\n\nThree months after his Manhattan arrest for the disturbing, caught-on-video death of homeless street performer Jordan Neely, nearly $3 million now sits in Penny's legal defense fund.\n\nAnd more than 365 pieces of evidence - including police and prosecutor notes from interviews with 30 civilian witnesses, and thousands of pages from Neely's police and medical records - have been turned over to the defense, according to an evidence list in Penny's public court file .\n\n\"The average campaign is about $3,000,\" Jacob Wells, co-founder of GiveSendGo, the Christian fundraising platform, said of Penny's defense fund. \"So this is 1,000 times the magnitude of what you would see in a normal campaign.\"\n\nLawyers say they'll use the cash to fight charges that the Marine veteran was reckless, or at least negligent, in using a fatal chokehold to subdue Neely, who witnesses and prosecutors say had verbally threatened passengers on a Manhattan subway train.\n\nMoney left over will cover the cost of any lawsuits, Penny's defense lawyer, Thomas Kenniff, told Insider.\n\nNeely's family members contend - as do prosecutors - that Penny's chokehold was criminally excessive, continuing for more than two minutes after eyewitness video shows Neely stopped moving.\n\nLawyers for Neely's family did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but have told reporters they will file a wrongful death lawsuit. Whatever money is left over at the conclusion of Penny's civil and criminal cases \"will be donated to a charity with a mental-health purpose to it,\" Kenniff said.\n\nPenny's top donors reflect how boldface-named, ultra-conservatives have rallied to Penny's side , including GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy ($10,000), Kid Rock ($5,000), and right-wing podcaster Tim Poole ($20,000).\n\nBut the bulk of donations have been\"forty, fifty dollars on average, and there are many thousands of them,\" said Kenniff. Many call Penny a hero in their donation posts, and invoke the Marine motto, \"semper fi,\" meaning \"always faithful.\"\n\n\"To me, that speaks louder than any single donation from someone with notoriety,\" Kenniff said of the flood of small and anonymous donations. \"It speaks to the grass roots support that Danny is getting and how vulnerable and frustrated people are, that someone who steps forward to protect people finds the criminal justice system turned against them.\n\nMeanwhile, throughout the spring and summer, prosecutors have been steadily turning over evidence to his lawyers, some of which may wind up helping Penny's case.\n\nProsecutors have, to date, interviewed 19 NYPD officers and two-dozen civilian witnesses - half of whom directly witnessed Neely's death, according to the evidence list.\n\nThe list does not show the actual interview notes or name those people who were interviewed. But it does show that prosecutors have interviewed one of the two other male subway passengers seen in video helping to restrain Neely during Penny's chokehold.\n\nThe man is identified in the record only as \"Eyewitness #6.\"\n\nThe evidence list also includes something called \"Eyewitness #6 proffer agreement,\" suggesting that at some point, this witness was at least offered some kind of deal by prosecutors. The potential deal is not described and, to date, no additional arrests have been announced in connection to the fatal chokehold.\n\nA spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney's office declined to comment on the ongoing case.\n\nThe list offers a glimpse into the case against Penny, 24, who remains free on $100,000 bail.\n\nKey among the prosecution's witnesses is \"Eyewitness #1,\" who appears to be Juan Alberto Vázquez, the freelance journalist who recorded disturbing, widely-shared video of the chokehold. Significantly, the Vázquez video captured a bystander warning Penny, mid-chokehold , \"You're going to kill him.\"\n\nEyewitness #1's video is the longest witness video mentioned in the evidence list; a second eye-witness turned over a shorter video and two screenshots to prosecutors.\n\nBody-worn-camera footage from 19 NYPD officers has also been turned over to the defense, the evidence list shows.\n\nFour EMS workers who rushed to the scene have spoken to prosecutors, the list also shows.\n\nAudio from four 911 calls made from the subway car is also a part of the case.\n\nProsecutors also turned over to the defense a copy of the Marines training manual that Penny would have received as a 17-year-old recruit.\n\nGrand jurors who indicted Penny were shown a copy of the Marine training manual , the list reveals. The manual describes the chokehold taught to all Marine recruits as \"non-fatal.\"\n\nMuch of the evidence prosecutors have turned over to the defense involves Penny's own words, including his voluntary statements to the NYPD, and what he said in texts, emails and social media posts.\n\n\"I had him pretty good,\" Penny told officers who recorded his statements on their body-worn cameras on a lower Manhattan subway platform, less than ten minutes after Neely's May 1 death, according to court documents.\n\n\"A man was acting irate, dropping things on the floor, saying he doesn't care if he goes to jail, he doesn't care if he gets killed,\" Penny told officers.\n\nA more formal videotaped statement Penny made to police - filmed with two camera angles - has also been turned over to the defense, the list shows.\n\nThe list likewise provides insights into Penny's potential defense.\n\nIncluded in the evidence turned over to his lawyers, Kenniff and Steve Raiser, are details from Neely's extensive medical and criminal history.\n\nThat includes 6,000 files from the city-run Bellevue Hospital, and details from at least four \"prior incident witnesses\" who had contact with Neely in a criminal context. Penny's lawyers have alleged that Neely had a history of four arrests for unprovoked assaults, according to the New York Times.\n\nNeely had a history of using K2, a powerful synthetic marijuana, outreach workers told the Times. Toxicology and full autopsy reports have not yet been turned over by prosecutors, the evidence list reveals.\n\nAs for Penny's new status as a fundraising millionaire, Wells, the GiveSendGo founder, told Insider that only one other fundraiser on his platform has ever raised more money.\n\nSome $10 million was raised in a GiveSendGo drive on behalf of the families of Canadian truck drivers who stopped working rather than submit to a government COVID vaccine mandate, he said.\n\nBoth Penny and the Neely family are pursuing their own idea of justice, he said.\n\n\"We would be happy to host a campaign for the young man who passed away, and his family, and the expenses facing them,\" Wells said.\n\nKyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who crossed state lines with an AR-15 during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he shot three people - two fatally - also hosted his defense fund on GiveSendGo.\n\nRittenhouse, who was acquitted of all charges in the shooting, raised over $250,000 on GiveSendGo.\n\n\"We want to see justice and free speech served, and we don't take a position on innocent or guilty,\" he said. \"What we do support is the American justice system of due process and the right to a defense.\"\n\nThat right to a defense extends to everyone, including some folks that Christian crowdfunding platform sees as, well, un-Christian, he said.\n\n\"I'll give one case. There's an individual being charged in New Hampshire for stating racist views publicly. Views we abhor,\" he said. \"White supremacist views.\"\n\n\"We told him as much as we dislike what you say, we're not going to prohibit you from raising money for your defense,\" he said. \"Even the people we disagree with, we love.\"\n\nJump to"

He had to,\" Mills said.\n\nPenny, 24, turned himself in to the New York Police Department's 5th Precinct in lower Manhattan Friday morning and was arrested on a charge of second-degree manslaughter in connection to the death of 30-year-old Neely.\n\nDuring Penny's arraignment at Manhattan Criminal Court, Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said that Penny held Neely for several minutes, even after he stopped moving.\n\nWitnesses to the deadly ordeal have said Neely was screaming about being hungry and thirsty before Penny put him in a chokehold.\n\nSteinglass said at the arraignment that \"several witnesses observed Mr. Neely making threats and scaring passengers\" before Penny confronted him from behind and \"placed him in a chokehold, taking him down to the ground.\"\n\nWhen the subway arrived at the next stop in Manhattan, Penny \"continued to hold Mr. Neely in the chokehold for several minutes,\" Steinglass said.\n\nTwo other men on the train then \"aided\" Penny \"by restraining Mr. Neely's arms,\" the prosecutor said.\n\n\"At some point, Mr. Neely stopped moving,\" said Steinglass, explaining, \"The defendant continued to hold Mr. Neely for a period and then released him.\"\n\nFirst responders who arrived at the scene rushed an unresponsive and unconscious Neely to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n\nThe New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ruled that Neely died due to \"compression of neck\" and classified his death as a homicide.\n\nPenny, who was captured on cell phone video putting Neely in the chokehold, was released on $100,000 bond following his court appearance. Penny has been required to surrender any passports within 48 hours and must get permission from the court if he wants to leave the state of New York.\n\nIf convicted of manslaughter, Penny would face a minimum of three-and-a-half years in prison, and as much as 15 years behind bars.\n\n\"Ask yourself, is that enough? Is that enough for someone who choked somebody out on the train and took their life?\" Mills said during his Friday press conference.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement on Friday that his office \"determined there was probable cause to arrest Daniel Penny and arraign him on felony charges\" after evaluating the \"available facts and evidence\" in the case.\n\n\"Jordan Neely should still be alive today, and my thoughts continue to be with his family and loved ones as they mourn his loss during this extremely painful time,\" Bragg said.\n\nJump to"

It's a tragic thing, but New York City is at fault, not the Marine.\"\n\nIn a statement shared with Insider, an attorney for Penny said the Marine veteran confronted Neely to protect himself and his fellow New Yorkers without knowing if his safety was assured.\n\n\"He risked his own life and safety, for the good of his fellow passengers,\" attorney Steven M. Raiser said. \"The unfortunate result was the unintended and unforeseen death of Mr. Neely.\n\nRaiser added that he's \"confident\" Penny will be fully absolved of wrongdoing once the \"facts and circumstances surrounding this tragic incident are brought to bear.\"\n\nFreelance journalist Juan Alberto Vazquez, who recorded the video of the chokehold, said Penny had Neely in a chokehold for \"at least 15 minutes.\"\n\nA lawyer for Neely's family, Lennon Edwards, said he took the case \"because 15 minutes is too long to go without help, intervention, and without air,\" per USA Today.\n\nIn a conversation with Insider, however, Lichtman called the second-degree manslaughter charge \"foolish,\" citing the nearly four-minute video that shows Neely struggling against Penny's chokehold as two other passengers appear to try and further restrain Neely.\n\n\"The person in the video who is pinning Mr. Neely's arm down while Penny has his arm around Mr. Neely's neck has made public statements. He's said that at no point did they think that Mr. Neely was in danger of dying,\" Lichtman said.\n\n\"He was fighting back,\" Lichtman added of Neely. \"And according to press accounts, he had been threatening people on the subway.\"\n\nCharges are set to come after nearly two weeks of increasing public pressure and protests throughout the city.\n\n\"Bragg's base - the people who voted him in to office were demanding an arrest,\" Lichtman said. \"So, Alvin Bragg, the political animal that he is, jumps right to it and charges.\"\n\nEyewitnesses on the subway said Neely, a 30-year-old Black man, was screaming about being hungry and thirsty before Penny, a white man, put him in a chokehold.\n\nTo date, no evidence has surfaced that Neely physically assaulted anyone on the train.\n\nNew York police told Insider this month that authorities took the unconscious and unresponsive Neely to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Penny was questioned by authorities the day of the incident, but was later released.\n\nThe medical examiner's office determined that Neely died from \"compression of neck\" and classified his death as a homicide.\n\nPenny released an earlier statement via his lawyer last week, expressing condolences to Neely's friends and family while directly calling out Neely's \"documented history of violent and erratic behavior.\"\n\n\"When Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves, until help arrived,\" the statement said. \"Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death.\"\n\nMay 11, 2023, 8:09 p.m. ET: This story has been updated to reflect a statement from Daniel Penny's attorney.\n\nJump to"

In a video of the incident, two other people can be seen helping Penny restrain Neely.\n\nWhile the erratic behavior scared some passengers, an eyewitness told The New York Times that Neely never tried to assault any passengers. Neely was yelling about being hungry and thirsty, and said he didn't mind \"going to jail and getting life in prison\" and was \"ready to die,\" shortly before Penny put him in the fatal chokehold, the witness told the Times.\n\nIn an extended video released Friday , another passenger can be seen approaching Penny, saying you're \"going to kill him\" and that he should be concerned about a \"murder charge.\"\n\nPenny's lawyers, however, said Penny was only protecting himself.\n\n\"When Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves, until help arrived,\" the statement from Penny's attorneys said. \"Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death.\"\n\nRaiser and Kenniff did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe former Marine could claim he acted in self-defense , though Neama Rahmani , the president of West Coast Trial Lawyers and a former federal prosecutor, previously told Insider it appeared to be \"vigilante justice.\"\n\n\"The force used, in my opinion, was excessive under the circumstances,\" Rahmani said. \"Personally, I think self-defense is used far too often in this country to justify violence.\"\n\nNew York City's chief medical examiner ruled Neely's death a homicide by compression to the neck, Insider previously reported. Penny has not been charged with any crimes , prompting protests in Manhattan .\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Former Marine Daniel Penny surrenders to police in subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely\n\nThe former Marine seen on cellphone video putting Jordan Neely, a homeless New York City subway rider, in a fatal chokehold earlier this month surrendered to authorities Friday morning.\n\nDaniel Penny, 24, turned himself in to the New York Police Department's 5th Precinct in lower Manhattan and was arrested.\n\nThe office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said on Wednesday Penny would be charged with second-degree charged with second-degree manslaughter for Neely's death.\n\nMinutes after Penny surrendered, his attorney, Thomas Keniff, told reporters his client turned himself in \"voluntarily and with the sort of the dignity and integrity that is characteristic of his history of service to this grateful nation.\"\n\nIf convicted, Penny would face a minimum of three-and-a-half years in prison, and as much as 15 years, under New York state sentencing guidelines.\n\nAuthorities later led Penny out of the police precinct in handcuffs and placed him into a car ahead of his arraignment at Manhattan Criminal Court.\n\nWitnesses to the May 1 incident on board an F train said Neely, a 30-year-old Black man, was screaming about being hungry and thirsty before Penny, a white man, put him in a deadly chokehold.\n\nThere has been no evidence so far that Neely physically attacked anyone on the train, and the incident has sparked protests throughout the city.\n\nPenny had been questioned by the NYPD on the day of the incident, but he was initially released without being charged.\n\nThe New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ruled that Neely died due to \"compression of neck\" and classified his death as a homicide.\n\nCivil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton said in a statement on Friday as Penny turned himself in that the expected charge against Penny \"who thought he was above the law is just step one in justice for Jordan Neely.\"\n\n\"The video of him grabbing Jordan and strangling him to death is disturbing and any jury should see it as such,\" said Sharpton, who called for the two other straphangers seen on the video appearing to help restrain Neely to be \"held accountable for their actions.\"\n\nSharpton added, \"The justice system needs to send a clear, loud message that vigilantism has never been acceptable. Being homeless or Black or having a mental health episode should not be a death sentence.\"\n\nNeely's family has requested Sharpton deliver the eulogy for Neely in Harlem next Friday, according to Sharpton.\n\nPenny, in a statement released through his lawyers last week, expressed his condolences to Neely's family and friends and said that he \"never intended to harm\" Neely.\n\n\"Mr. Neely had a documented history of violence and erratic behavior, the apparent result of ongoing and untreated mental illness,\" the statement read.\n\nIt continued: \"When Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves, until help arrived. Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death.\"\n\nJump to"

Any proceeds collected which exceed those necessary to cover Mr. Penny's legal defense will be donated to a mental health advocacy program in New York City.\"\n\nPenny turned himself in to the New York Police Department's 5th Precinct in lower Manhattan on Friday morning and was arrested.

Jeenah Moon/AP hide caption\n\nDaniel Penny leaves Manhattan Criminal Court on Friday in New York.\n\nDaniel Penny, the 24-year-old man who put Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold on the New York City subway more than a week ago, was arraigned and criminally charged in a Manhattan court room Friday.\n\nPenny, a former U.S. Marine who is white, is facing a felony charge of second-degree manslaughter for the death of Neely, a 30-year-old Black man who was homeless. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.\n\nPenny did not enter a plea and was released after posting the $100,000 bail set by the judge. He was also ordered to surrender his passport within 48 hours of arraignment and not to leave the state of New York.\n\nHis next court date is July 17.\n\nNeely's death has raised questions about race, justice, homelessness and mental health in America. Advocates for the homeless in New York City have blamed Neely's death on the city's policies surrounding people experiencing homelessness.\n\nProtests have erupted since his death on May 1, with many calling for more resources for mental health care and to help fight the city's homelessness problem . They have similarly pressed the city's leaders and District Attorney Alvin Bragg to bring criminal charges against Penny sooner. Some thought his office was taking too long to file charges against Penny.\n\nBragg has said the investigation has included numerous pieces.\n\n\"After an evaluation of the available facts and evidence, the Manhattan D.A.'s Office determined there was probable cause to arrest Daniel Penny and arraign him on felony charges. The investigation thus far has included numerous witness interviews, careful review of photo and video footage, and discussions with the Medical Examiner's Office. As this case proceeds, we will be constrained from speaking outside the courtroom to ensure this remains a fair and impartial matter,\" Bragg said in a statement shortly after the arraignment. \"Jordan Neely should still be alive today, and my thoughts continue to be with his family and loved ones as they mourn his loss during this extremely painful time.\"\n\nPenny's attorneys, Steven Raiser and Thomas Kenniff, said they believe their client would be \"fully absolved of any wrongdoing,\" Gothamist reported.\n\nNeely and Penny were riding on the same subway car when Neely began shouting that he was hungry and thirsty. \"Several witnesses observed Mr. Neely making threats and scaring passengers,\" Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said reading from the bail application read in court Friday.\n\nThat's when Penny approached Neely from behind and placed him in a chokehold. He continued to keep him there for several minutes, with two additional passengers helping Penny by restraining Neely's arms.\n\nPenny is receiving support from some members of the public. A GiveSendGo fundraiser for Penny's legal fund, set up by his attorneys, already exceeded $370,000 after his arraignment Friday.\n\nGothamist reports that the website \"bills itself as a Christian fundraising platform and has supported several divisive right-wing cases.\" That includes fundraisers for the Jan. 6 defendants and Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted of killing two men and shooting a third during unrest in Wisconsin in 2020.\n\nA previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Daniel Penny pleaded not guilty. In fact, he did not submit any plea during arraignment.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Daniel Penny's defense team says he was protecting other riders. Prosecutors say he went too far.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Closing arguments are expected today in the trial of a Marine veteran accused of choking a man to death on a New York City subway. Prosecutors say Daniel Penny held Jordan Neely in a choke hold for about six minutes. That came after witnesses say that Neely started shouting threats at other subway riders. Samantha Max of member station WNYC has been in the courtroom throughout the trial, and she's here with us now to tell us more about it. Good morning. SAMANTHA MAX, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: First, I'm going to ask you to walk us through the incident itself, exactly what happened. MAX: So in May 2023, Daniel Penny is on his way to the gym. He was 24 at the time, and he's a former Marine. Jordan Neely is a former Michael Jackson impersonator. He was unhoused at the time and also had severe schizophrenia, according to court documents. So Neely boards the train just as the doors are closing and he starts yelling something along the lines of that he's hungry, thirsty, ready to die or go to jail, according to witnesses. And then within less than 30 seconds, Penny puts Neely in a chokehold. And he keeps holding, even after the train doors open, even after Neely stops moving. By the time he lets go, Neely is unresponsive and never wakes up. Penny has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges. MARTIN: We mentioned that you've been following this trial throughout the month. It's been going on for more than a month. Who are some of the witnesses that you've heard from? MAX: So we heard from lots of people who were actually on the subway that day who kind of painted a picture of what happened. We heard from the military trainer who taught Penny how to use chokeholds, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy. And then the defense also brought in their own forensic pathologist, who shared kind of an alternate theory of how Neely could've died. MARTIN: And what about Penny? Did he testify? MAX: No, but we did learn more about him. The defense called a few different character witnesses, including his mom, some friends, fellow Marines. They described him as kind, calm and a peaceful person with integrity. And then jurors also watched videos of Penny, including an interview with detectives at the precinct. Here's an excerpt from that conversation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DANIEL PENNY: I'm not a confrontational guy. And I'm not out here, like, trying to attack people, you know? It's not me, not how I was trained. UNIDENTIFIED DETECTIVE: Yeah. PENNY: You know, I just felt the need - that this guy was saying that he's going to kill people, that he's prepared to go to jail for life. MAX: And then Penny called Neely a, quote, \"crackhead\" and said he was, quote, \"acting like a lunatic.\" He also told detectives that he stepped in to protect women and children on the train. MARTIN: As we said, we expect to hear closing arguments. What are you expecting to hear from each side? MAX: So I'm expecting the prosecution to say what they've already been saying, which is that Penny went too far and his actions caused Neely's death. And then the defense we're expecting to say that Penny was trying to protect himself and fellow subway riders, that Neely was moving around and that's why Penny kept holding him in a chokehold. It's impossible to know at this point what jurors will decide. But we know from jury selection that these are people who regularly ride the subway. They know, you know, what happens on the subway, so it will be interesting to see how they decide what's appropriate in a situation like this. MARTIN: That's Samantha Max.

He was 24 at the time, and he's a former Marine. Jordan Neely is a former Michael Jackson impersonator. He was unhoused at the time and also had severe schizophrenia, according to court documents. So Neely boards the train just as the doors are closing and he starts yelling something along the lines of that he's hungry, thirsty, ready to die or go to jail, according to witnesses. And then within less than 30 seconds, Penny puts Neely in a chokehold. And he keeps holding, even after the train doors open, even after Neely stops moving. By the time he lets go, Neely is unresponsive and never wakes up. Penny has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges. MARTIN: We mentioned that you've been following this trial throughout the month. It's been going on for more than a month. Who are some of the witnesses that you've heard from? MAX: So we heard from lots of people who were actually on the subway that day who kind of painted a picture of what happened. We heard from the military trainer who taught Penny how to use chokeholds, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy. And then the defense also brought in their own forensic pathologist, who shared kind of an alternate theory of how Neely could've died. MARTIN: And what about Penny? Did he testify? MAX: No, but we did learn more about him. The defense called a few different character witnesses, including his mom, some friends, fellow Marines. They described him as kind, calm and a peaceful person with integrity. And then jurors also watched videos of Penny, including an interview with detectives at the precinct. Here's an excerpt from that conversation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DANIEL PENNY: I'm not a confrontational guy. And I'm not out here, like, trying to attack people, you know? It's not me, not how I was trained. UNIDENTIFIED DETECTIVE: Yeah. PENNY: You know, I just felt the need - that this guy was saying that he's going to kill people, that he's prepared to go to jail for life. MAX: And then Penny called Neely a, quote, \"crackhead\" and said he was, quote, \"acting like a lunatic.\" He also told detectives that he stepped in to protect women and children on the train. MARTIN: As we said, we expect to hear closing arguments. What are you expecting to hear from each side? MAX: So I'm expecting the prosecution to say what they've already been saying, which is that Penny went too far and his actions caused Neely's death. And then the defense we're expecting to say that Penny was trying to protect himself and fellow subway riders, that Neely was moving around and that's why Penny kept holding him in a chokehold. It's impossible to know at this point what jurors will decide. But we know from jury selection that these are people who regularly ride the subway. They know, you know, what happens on the subway, so it will be interesting to see how they decide what's appropriate in a situation like this. MARTIN: That's Samantha Max. She covers public safety and the courts for WNYC in New York City. Thank you, Samantha. MAX: Thank you. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

MAX: And then Penny called Neely a, quote, \"crackhead\" and said he was, quote, \"acting like a lunatic.\" He also told detectives that he stepped in to protect women and children on the train. MARTIN: As we said, we expect to hear closing arguments. What are you expecting to hear from each side? MAX: So I'm expecting the prosecution to say what they've already been saying, which is that Penny went too far and his actions caused Neely's death. And then the defense we're expecting to say that Penny was trying to protect himself and fellow subway riders, that Neely was moving around and that's why Penny kept holding him in a chokehold. It's impossible to know at this point what jurors will decide. But we know from jury selection that these are people who regularly ride the subway. They know, you know, what happens on the subway, so it will be interesting to see how they decide what's appropriate in a situation like this. MARTIN: That's Samantha Max. She covers public safety and the courts for WNYC in New York City. Thank you, Samantha. MAX: Thank you. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The defense called a few different character witnesses, including his mom, some friends, fellow Marines. They described him as kind, calm and a peaceful person with integrity. And then jurors also watched videos of Penny, including an interview with detectives at the precinct. Here's an excerpt from that conversation.

      "text": "Daniel Penny arraigned in chokehold death of Jordan Neely\n\nFrom\n\nBy\n\nSamantha Max\n\nDaniel Penny, the 24-year-old man who put Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold on the New York City subway last week, faces manslaughter charges.\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST: But first, to New York. Today, the man who put Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold on a subway last week was arraigned in Manhattan criminal court. Daniel Penny faces one charge of second-degree manslaughter. Samantha Max of member station WNYC was in the courtroom and is here to tell us what happened. Hi, Sam. SAMANTHA MAX, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: OK, so these two men were on the subway together last week. Can you just remind us what unfolded on that train? MAX: So Daniel Penny is a 24-year-old white man who lives in New York City, and he was riding the subway when Jordan Neely - he's a 30-year-old Black man - boarded and started yelling, according to an eyewitness. And this witness who posted a video on Facebook says that Neely was shouting that he was hungry and thirsty, that he was fed up and didn't care if he went to jail or died. And at some point after that, Penny put him in a chokehold, and the two of them fell to the ground. A video of the incident shows that he kept his arms wrapped around Neely's neck for several minutes, even after Neely went limp. And Neely was pronounced dead that same day. CHANG: OK. And all of that happened almost two weeks ago. What happened today? MAX: Penny was charged with second-degree manslaughter. So in New York, that means you are accused of recklessly causing someone's death. It's a class C felony. He could spend up to 15 years in prison if he's convicted. So this morning, he turned himself into police, and then a few hours later, he walked into one of the arraignment rooms in the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse, had his hands cuffed behind his back while he was in the courtroom. Prosecutors asked for $100,000 bail, and defense attorneys didn't object to that, though they did note that Penny had voluntarily turned himself in and that he had served in the Marines. Penny's attorneys say that he put Neely in a chokehold to protect himself and his fellow New Yorkers. A crowdfunding page to cover Penny's legal costs has been gaining a lot of money, more than $460,000 last time I checked. CHANG: Wow. MAX: And this particular fundraising platform has also hosted fundraisers for people who stormed the U.S. Capitol and for Kyle Rittenhouse, who you might remember shot three people during a Black Lives Matter protest in 2020. CHANG: So it sounds like outside the courtroom, there are quite a few people defending Penny's actions. Is that right? MAX: Yes. Even though there is no evidence at this point that he faced a physical threat, some people think he was protecting himself. And, you know, New Yorkers are concerned about crime at this moment in time, especially on the subways. But other people are really upset. You know, the fatal encounter has sparked this whole debate about whether people who are mentally ill or who are experiencing homelessness have the resources that they need, including people like Jordan Neely. CHANG: OK. So where do things go from here for Penny, real quick? MAX: The DA will share the evidence with a grand jury, which can then decide whether to indict Penny for manslaughter or any other charge. And then Penny has already posted bond, but he's due back in court in July. CHANG: That is Samantha Max of member station WNYC. Thank you, Samantha. MAX: Thank you. Copyright © 2023 NPR.

So in New York, that means you are accused of recklessly causing someone's death. It's a class C felony. He could spend up to 15 years in prison if he's convicted. So this morning, he turned himself into police, and then a few hours later, he walked into one of the arraignment rooms in the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse, had his hands cuffed behind his back while he was in the courtroom. Prosecutors asked for $100,000 bail, and defense attorneys didn't object to that, though they did note that Penny had voluntarily turned himself in and that he had served in the Marines. Penny's attorneys say that he put Neely in a chokehold to protect himself and his fellow New Yorkers. A crowdfunding page to cover Penny's legal costs has been gaining a lot of money, more than $460,000 last time I checked. CHANG: Wow. MAX: And this particular fundraising platform has also hosted fundraisers for people who stormed the U.S. Capitol and for Kyle Rittenhouse, who you might remember shot three people during a Black Lives Matter protest in 2020. CHANG: So it sounds like outside the courtroom, there are quite a few people defending Penny's actions. Is that right? MAX: Yes. Even though there is no evidence at this point that he faced a physical threat, some people think he was protecting himself. And, you know, New Yorkers are concerned about crime at this moment in time, especially on the subways. But other people are really upset. You know, the fatal encounter has sparked this whole debate about whether people who are mentally ill or who are experiencing homelessness have the resources that they need, including people like Jordan Neely. CHANG: OK. So where do things go from here for Penny, real quick? MAX: The DA will share the evidence with a grand jury, which can then decide whether to indict Penny for manslaughter or any other charge. And then Penny has already posted bond, but he's due back in court in July. CHANG: That is Samantha Max of member station WNYC. Thank you, Samantha. MAX: Thank you. Copyright © 2023 NPR.

Today, the man who put Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold on a subway last week was arraigned in Manhattan criminal court. Daniel Penny faces one charge of second-degree manslaughter. Samantha Max of member station WNYC was in the courtroom and is here to tell us what happened. Hi, Sam. SAMANTHA MAX, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: OK, so these two men were on the subway together last week. Can you just remind us what unfolded on that train? MAX: So Daniel Penny is a 24-year-old white man who lives in New York City, and he was riding the subway when Jordan Neely - he's a 30-year-old Black man - boarded and started yelling, according to an eyewitness. And this witness who posted a video on Facebook says that Neely was shouting that he was hungry and thirsty, that he was fed up and didn't care if he went to jail or died. And at some point after that, Penny put him in a chokehold, and the two of them fell to the ground.

You know, the fatal encounter has sparked this whole debate about whether people who are mentally ill or who are experiencing homelessness have the resources that they need, including people like Jordan Neely. CHANG: OK. So where do things go from here for Penny, real quick? MAX: The DA will share the evidence with a grand jury, which can then decide whether to indict Penny for manslaughter or any other charge.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nMAX: Penny was charged with second-degree manslaughter. So in New York, that means you are accused of recklessly causing someone's death. It's a class C felony. He could spend up to 15 years in prison if he's convicted. So this morning, he turned himself into police, and then a few hours later, he walked into one of the arraignment rooms in the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse, had his hands cuffed behind his back while he was in the courtroom. Prosecutors asked for $100,000 bail, and defense attorneys didn't object to that, though they did note that Penny had voluntarily turned himself in and that he had served in the Marines. Penny's attorneys say that he put Neely in a chokehold to protect himself and his fellow New Yorkers. A crowdfunding page to cover Penny's legal costs has been gaining a lot of money, more than $460,000 last time I checked. CHANG: Wow. MAX: And this particular fundraising platform has also hosted fundraisers for people who stormed the U.S. Capitol and for Kyle Rittenhouse, who you might remember shot three people during a Black Lives Matter protest in 2020. CHANG: So it sounds like outside the courtroom, there are quite a few people defending Penny's actions. Is that right? MAX: Yes.

Penny is a 26-year-old Marine veteran who used a deadly choke hold on an unhoused man on a New York City subway last year. The verdict in this case drew protests and intense reaction inside the courtroom. Reporter Charles Lane of member station WNYC was in the court. Hi there. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: Good afternoon. SHAPIRO: Tell us what happened on that subway car last year. LANE: So Jordan Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator. He boarded the train, and he starts yelling that he's hungry and thirsty, ready to die or go to jail. That's according to witnesses. Neely experienced mental illness, and he had been living in and out of shelters. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He had been hospitalized multiple times. He also used synthetic marijuana. And so Daniel Penny takes him down and holds him in a choke hold for about six minutes. Prosecutors say that while Penny's intent was laudable at first, he went, quote, \"way too far and held tightly for too long.\" On the other side, defense said that Penny was acting to protect not just himself but others, and that people on the train were terrified. SHAPIRO: And he was originally charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The jury spent several days deliberating last week. They told the judge they couldn't reach a verdict. Why were they having such a hard time? LANE: Well, the question that they seemed to wrestle with most was - and they actually sent this to the judge in a note - was, quote, \"what does a reasonable person mean?\" Meaning, like, would a reasonable person have done what Penny did in those same circumstances? When the jury was deadlocked, the judge dismissed the more serious manslaughter charge, leaving just the criminally negligent homicide charge to consider, and, ultimately, they found Penny not guilty. SHAPIRO: And what was the reaction in the courtroom when the verdict was read? LANE: Yeah, after the jury announced the verdict, the courtroom just burst into commotion. At first, there was applause, but then Neely's father, Andre Zachery, turned around and yelled obscenities at the person behind him. His lawyers tried to subdue him, but then the judge ejected him from the courtroom. Soon after that, more shouting broke out as people, upset at the verdict, began calling the country racist. Neely was Black, and Penny is white. After court, Donte Mills, who's the lawyer for Neely's family, he said that they were let down by the justice system. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONTE MILLS: We're devastated, upset, angry, hurt. Over and over again, we keep coming to the system, asking the system to let us know that our lives have value. LANE: The family of Jordan Neely has filed a civil lawsuit against Penny, alleging negligence over his death. SHAPIRO: This case prompted a debate on a range of issues. Can you talk more about the broader issues that this raised? LANE: Yeah, people felt a lot of empathy for Neely, who obviously had his struggles, but they also saw Penny as someone who tried to intervene in a situation where people were genuinely afraid. Even before the verdict was read, protests outside the courthouse could be heard. The chanting, we could hear it all the way up on the 13th floor, and they were calling for justice for Neely. On the other side, some conservatives hailed the verdict as a win. Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said on social media that the jury deserves credit for doing the right thing. And many people in New York City are feeling a real lack of safety, especially on the subway. Felony assaults and petty assaults - petty thefts are up. SHAPIRO: All right, that's Charles Lane of member station WNYC. Thank you. LANE: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Penny is a 26-year-old Marine veteran who used a deadly choke hold on an unhoused man on a New York City subway last year. The verdict in this case drew protests and intense reaction inside the courtroom. Reporter Charles Lane of member station WNYC was in the court. Hi there. CHARLES LANE, BYLINE: Good afternoon. SHAPIRO: Tell us what happened on that subway car last year. LANE: So Jordan Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator. He boarded the train, and he starts yelling that he's hungry and thirsty, ready to die or go to jail. That's according to witnesses. Neely experienced mental illness, and he had been living in and out of shelters. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He had been hospitalized multiple times. He also used synthetic marijuana. And so Daniel Penny takes him down and holds him in a choke hold for about six minutes. Prosecutors say that while Penny's intent was laudable at first, he went, quote, \"way too far and held tightly for too long.\" On the other side, defense said that Penny was acting to protect not just himself but others, and that people on the train were terrified. SHAPIRO: And he was originally charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The jury spent several days deliberating last week. They told the judge they couldn't reach a verdict. Why were they having such a hard time? LANE: Well, the question that they seemed to wrestle with most was - and they actually sent this to the judge in a note - was, quote, \"what does a reasonable person mean?\" Meaning, like, would a reasonable person have done what Penny did in those same circumstances? When the jury was deadlocked, the judge dismissed the more serious manslaughter charge, leaving just the criminally negligent homicide charge to consider, and, ultimately, they found Penny not guilty. SHAPIRO: And what was the reaction in the courtroom when the verdict was read? LANE: Yeah, after the jury announced the verdict, the courtroom just burst into commotion. At first, there was applause, but then Neely's father, Andre Zachery, turned around and yelled obscenities at the person behind him. His lawyers tried to subdue him, but then the judge ejected him from the courtroom. Soon after that, more shouting broke out as people, upset at the verdict, began calling the country racist. Neely was Black, and Penny is white. After court, Donte Mills, who's the lawyer for Neely's family, he said that they were let down by the justice system.

When the jury was deadlocked, the judge dismissed the more serious manslaughter charge, leaving just the criminally negligent homicide charge to consider, and, ultimately, they found Penny not guilty.

Timothy A. Clary/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nDaniel Penny is walked out of the New York Police Department 5th Precinct on May 12 after he surrendered to authorities after being charged with second degree manslaughter in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely.\n\nIn his first interview since placing Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold, former U.S. Marine Daniel Penny insisted that the confrontation between the two \"had nothing to do with race,\" and he was \"not a white supremacist.\"\n\n\"Everybody who's ever met me can tell you, I love all people, I love all cultures,\" Penny told the New York Post . \"I was actually planning a road trip through Africa before this happened.\"\n\nPenny, 24, who is white, faces a felony charge of second-degree manslaughter for the death of Neely, a 30-year-old Black man who was homeless. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. His next court date is July 17.\n\nThe altercation took place on May 1 on a New York City subway train. Neely, who used to perform on subway platforms as a Michael Jackson impersonator, was shouting that he was hungry and thirsty and willing to die . Moments later, Penny put Neely in a chokehold for several minutes. Neely was pronounced dead that same day.\n\n\"I can tell you that the threats, the menacing, the terror that Jordan Neely introduced to that train has already been well documented,\" Penny told the Post .\n\nHowever, there has been no reported indication that Neely physically attacked any person.\n\nPenny added that Neely's death was tragic and the real blame should be on \"the system.\"\n\n\"It's tragic what happened to him. Hopefully, we can change the system that's so desperately failed us,\" he said.\n\nPenny went on to say that he felt no shame. When asked if he would do it again, he nodded and said, \"I would - if there was a threat and danger in the present.\"\n\nPenny was arrested more than a week after the incident and after protests calling for him to be charged. Activists drew comparisons between Neely's death, shown in a viral video, and the deaths of Eric Garner and George Floyd , who died at the hands of white police officers.\n\nBut Penny repeatedly told the New York Post that race had nothing to do with the confrontation between him and Neely.\n\n\"I judge a person based on their character. I'm not a white supremacist,\" he said.\n\nNeely's funeral service took place on Friday at Harlem's Mount Neboh Baptist Church. The Rev. Al Sharpton, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and New York Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado were among those who attended.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Jeenah Moon/AP hide caption\n\nDaniel Penny, center, is walked by New York Police Department detectives out of the 5th Precinct on Wednesday.\n\nNEW YORK - A man charged with manslaughter for putting an agitated New York City subway rider in a fatal chokehold has been indicted by a grand jury, an expected procedural step that will allow the criminal case to continue.\n\nDaniel Penny was charged by Manhattan prosecutors last month in the May 1 death of Jordan Neely, a former Michael Jackson impersonator who struggled in recent years with homelessness and mental illness.\n\nGrand jury proceedings are secret and spokespeople for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg declined to comment Wednesday, but the indictment was confirmed by New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\n\n\"I appreciate DA Bragg conducting a thorough investigation into the death of Jordan Neely. Like I said when the DA first brought charges, I have the utmost faith in the judicial process, and now that the Grand Jury has indicted Daniel Penny, a trial and justice can move forward,\" Adams said in a statement.\n\nNeely was shouting at passengers and begging for money when Penny pinned him to the floor of the moving subway car with the help of two other riders. Penny, a former U.S. Marine, then held Neely in a chokehold that lasted more than three minutes.\n\nPenny has said he was protecting himself and other passengers, claiming Neely shouted \"I'm gonna' kill you\" and that he was \"ready to die\" or go to jail for life.\n\nA freelance journalist who recorded Neely struggling to free himself, then lapsing into unconsciousness, said he was acting aggressively and frightening people but hadn't assaulted anyone. Neely was Black. Penny is white.\n\nPenny's lawyers, Steven Raiser and Thomas Kenniff, said in a statement that Neely had not intended to kill Neely, just hold him until police arrived.\n\n\"While we respect the decision of the grand jury to move this case forward to trial, it should be noted that the standard of proof in a grand jury is very low and there has been no finding of wrongdoing. We're confident that when a trial jury is tasked with weighing the evidence, they will find Daniel Penny's actions on that train were fully justified,\" Raiser said.\n\nNeely's death prompted protests by many who saw it as an example of racial injustice, but some people have rallied around Penny, including several of the Republican candidates for president . A fund set up to pay for Penny's legal defense has raised more than $2.8 million, according to his lawyers.\n\nPenny, 24, was released on $100,000 bond following his May 12 arraignment. He will need to return to court to be arraigned on the new indictment.\n\nUnder New York law, prosecutors needed a grand jury indictment to move forward with the case.\n\nIf convicted, Penny could face years in prison.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Neely, a man who was suffering an apparent mental health episode aboard a subway car, died after being placed in a headlock by a fellow rider on Monday. Jake Offenhartz/AP hide caption\n\nPolice officers watch Wednesday as protesters gather in the Broadway-Lafayette subway station to protest the death of Jordan Neely in New York. Neely, a man who was suffering an apparent mental health episode aboard a subway car, died after being placed in a headlock by a fellow rider on Monday.\n\nAdvocates for the homeless are calling for accountability in the death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man who died this week on a New York City subway train after he was placed in a fatal chokehold by a fellow passenger for several minutes.\n\nNeely, a Black man who had performed on subway platforms as a Michael Jackson impersonator, had been complaining of hunger and thirst while riding an F train in Manhattan on Monday, according to journalist Juan Alberto Vazquez, who witnessed the incident. Vazquez described his account in a Facebook post in which he shared a four-minute video showing the encounter.\n\nNeely shouted that he was fed up, that he didn't care if he went to prison and that he was ready to die, Vazquez wrote. Neely then took off his jacket and aggressively threw it on the subway-car floor, but did not appear to want to attack anyone, according to the journalist. Then, a white 24-year-old passenger on the train put Neely in a headlock and held him in the position for 15 minutes, Vazquez said. Two other bystanders also stepped in to help the man restrain Neely.\n\nThe city's medical examiner ruled the death was a homicide caused by compression of the neck from the chokehold. No arrests have been made following the incident.\n\nLawyers for Daniel Penny, the 24-year-old who restrained Neely in a chokehold, told Gothamist in a statement that their client \"never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death.\"\n\nThe attorneys, Steven Raiser and Thomas Kenniff, said that \"when Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves, until help arrived.\"\n\nThe lawyers relayed Penny's condolences to those close to Neely. The statement ended with a call for elected officials to address \"the mental health crisis on our streets and subways.\"\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office, meanwhile, is conducting its own investigation into Neely's death.\n\n\"This situation cries out for justice,\" said Shelly Nortz, deputy executive director for policy at the Coalition for the Homeless. \"I want to see this person held accountable for killing a fellow New Yorker. Allowing this to happen only encourages others to do the same.\"\n\nIn response to the killing, Nortz and other advocates for the homeless place direct blame on the city's policies and rhetoric surrounding people experiencing homelessness. They say the policies criminalize people living on the streets, many of whom experience mental illness.\n\nJawanza Williams, the director of organizing at Voices Of Community Activists & Leaders (VOCAL-NY), said in a statement that \"people have been deputized\" by Mayor Eric Adams' and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's \"hyper-conservative, fear-mongering rhetoric.\"\n\nProtesters march through the Broadway-Lafayette subway station to protest the death of Jordan Neely on Wednesday in New York. Jake Offenhartz/AP hide caption\n\nProtesters march through the Broadway-Lafayette subway station to protest the death of Jordan Neely on Wednesday in New York.\n\n\"The murder of Jordan Neely is a direct result of the sustained political, systemic abandonment and dehumanization of people experiencing homelessness and mental health complexities,\" the statement read . \"Neely's blood is on their hands, and any semblance of justice here requires accountability and a reversal of Adams' austerity budget and Hochul to stop blocking progressive policy in Albany.\"\n\nReducing New York City's homelessness and crime have both been a primary focus of Mayor Adams' agenda. He and Hochul have sent out outreach workers to and stepped up police presence in the subway system - where officers are mandated to enforce new transit rules that include a ban on sleeping - to make the city feel safer. Last year, the mayor announced plans to hospitalize more homeless people by involuntarily providing care to those considered to be in \"psychiatric crisis.\"\n\nAdvocates fear the city's approach is shaping residents' perceptions of people who are homeless as being violent.\n\n\"There's been this constant implicit and sometimes explicit link between homelessness and crime - homelessness and lack of safety,\" said Sara Newman, director of organizing at the Open Hearts Initiative. \"The same goes for mental illness. And the solution to that is to make people who are experiencing homelessness or mental illness go away.\"\n\n\"When you have the highest leaders in the state and city validating that kind of perception and link, I think it makes people feel like it's OK to stand by when someone is being murdered for not actually hurting anyone,\" she added.\n\nIn reality, Nortz of the Coalition for the Homeless noted, people experiencing homelessness or mental illness are at a greater risk of being harmed than of harming others.\n\nNeither the office of the mayor nor the governor have returned NPR's requests for comment.\n\nAdams took heat for his lack of rebuke in comments made following Neely's death. Asked whether it's appropriate for people to take matters into their own hands in a situation, Adams told CNN on Wednesday , \"We cannot just blanketly say what a passenger should or should not do in a situation like that. We should allow the investigation to take its course.\"\n\nThe same question was put to Hochul.\n\n\"I think it's a case-by-case situation,\" she told reporters . \"But it became very clear that the individual was not going to cause harm to these other people. And the video of three individuals holding him down until the last breath was snuffed out of him, I would say, was a very extreme response.\"\n\nShe also said Neely's family deserves justice.\n\nNewman hopes Neely's death makes people, elected officials in particular, rethink their approaches to policies and rhetoric that affect people experiencing homelessness and mental illness.\n\n\"It shouldn't take something horrible happening to be a wake-up call for people about how dangerous the dehumanization of our neighbors is,\" she said.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "They Held Down a Black Teen Who Had Tried to Shoplift. He Died From Asphyxia. Why Was No One Ever Charged?\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nWhen the clerk at VJ's Food Mart confronted Corey Stingley, the 16-year-old handed over his backpack. Inside were six hidden bottles of Smirnoff Ice, worth $12, and the clerk began pulling them out one by one.\n\nStingley watched, then pivoted and quickly moved toward the door, empty-handed. But there would be no escape for the unarmed teen in the light blue hoodie.\n\nThree customers, together weighing 550 pounds, wrestled the 135-pound teen to the floor of the West Allis, Wisconsin, store. They pinned him in a seated position, \"his body compressed downward,\" according to a police account. One of the men put Stingley in a chokehold, witnesses would later tell investigators.\n\n\"Get up, you punk!\" that man, a former Marine, reportedly told Stingley when an officer from the police department finally arrived. But the teen didn't move. He was foaming at the mouth, and his pants and shoes were soaked in urine.\n\nHe'd suffered a traumatic brain injury from a loss of oxygen and never regained consciousness. His parents took him off life support two weeks later. The medical examiner ruled Stingley's death a homicide following his restraint in \"a violent struggle with multiple individuals.\"\n\nThat was more than 10 years ago.\n\nNone of the men, all of whom were white, were criminally charged in the incident that killed Stingley, a Black youth. Police arrested Mario Laumann, the man seen holding Stingley in an apparent chokehold, shortly after the incident in December 2012. But the local district attorney declined to prosecute him or the other two men, arguing they were unaware of the harm they were causing.\n\nWhen a second police review led to a reexamination of the case in 2017, another prosecutor sat on it for more than three years, until a judge demanded a decision. Again, there were no charges.\n\nProsecutors move on, but fathers don't. Refusing to accept that the case had been handled justly, Corey Stingley's dad, Craig, last year convinced a judge to assign a third district attorney to look at what had happened to his son.\n\nThat prosecutor, Ismael Ozanne of Dane County, is scheduled to report back to the court on Friday. He could announce whether charges are warranted.\n\nThe case has parallels to a recent deadly subway incident in New York City. Both involve chokeholds administered by former Marines on Black males who had not initiated any violence. But unlike in Wisconsin, New York authorities acted within two weeks to file a second-degree manslaughter charge in the case.\n\nWhile the New York subway incident grabbed national headlines, Corey Stingley's death - which happened the same day as the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut - did not gain much notice outside of southeast Wisconsin.\n\nYears later, Craig Stingley tapped an obscure statute dating back to Wisconsin's frontier days to convince the system to take a fresh look at his son's death. The law states that if a district attorney refuses to issue a criminal complaint or is unavailable to do so, a private citizen can petition a judge to take up the matter. Today, it's loosely referred to as a \"John Doe\" petition, though in this instance there was no doubt who restrained Stingley's son: Laumann, who has since died, along with two other store patrons named Jesse R. Cole and Robert W. Beringer.\n\nNo one is alleging that the men set out to kill Corey Stingley. His father is asking the prosecutor to consider a charge of reckless homicide or even a lesser offense for using extreme force to detain his son.\n\n\"He wasn't trying to harm anyone. He was trying to leave that store,\" said Craig Stingley, who thought his son made a youthful mistake. \"I believe he was scared.\"\n\nVJ's Food Mart is a typical small convenience store, packed with chips, candy, soda, beer, cigarettes and liquor. On Sunday mornings it offers a special deal on hot ham and rolls, a local tradition for an after-church meal. To combat theft, the store is equipped with security cameras.\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2012, Thomas Ripley and Anthony Orcholski stopped by the store for beer and snacks. Only a few steps in, they saw that three men had someone firmly pinned on the ground.\n\nSecurity video shows Ripley and Orcholski pausing next to the pile of people and watching intently. In statements to police they both said they saw Laumann lying on the ground with his arms around Stingley's neck in a \"chokehold.\" Beringer had grabbed Stingley's hair, they said; the third man, Cole, had his hands on Stingley's back.\n\nRipley told police the teen was not moving and appeared to be limp.\n\n\"I don't think he could breathe,\" Ripley would later testify during a special review of the case to determine if there should be charges.\n\nOrcholski told a detective that he was concerned about the teen on the ground and may even have instructed the men to let Stingley go.\n\nA decade later, Orcholski is still bothered by what he saw. \"I'm upset,\" he told ProPublica. \"Three men thought they were going to be heroes that day because a 16-year-old boy was shoplifting. There could have been numerous different ways to restrain him other than choking him to death.\"\n\nHe added, \"It's common sense: When you squeeze somebody that hard for that long, they're not going to be alive after it.\"\n\nThe security video is grainy, and much of the confrontation took place out of view of the cameras.\n\nAuthorities had a third witness, though. Troubled by what he'd seen, store customer Michael Farrell felt compelled to go to the West Allis police station that evening and give a statement.\n\n\"I felt bad. I'm a dad,\" he explained, court records show.\n\nFarrell told police he could see through the store's glass door that a man with a \"crazed look on his face\" had someone in a chokehold, very near the entrance. The guy was \"squeezing the hell out of this kid and never let up,\" he said. Farrell picked Laumann out of a photo lineup. (Farrell and another witness, Ripley, couldn't be reached for comment for this story.)\n\nCorey Stingley and his dad lived just a couple of blocks from the store, making them one of the few Black families in a predominantly white neighborhood and city on the border of Milwaukee. Comments from the three men who held Stingley down imply that they saw him as an outsider.\n\nRipley told police that Beringer, 54, held Stingley by the hair and shook the teen's head a couple of times. \"You don't do that,\" he said Beringer scolded Stingley. \"We're all friends and neighbors around here.\"\n\nWith Stingley subdued, the store clerk held a phone to Beringer's head so he could talk to a police dispatcher. \"We have the perp, three of us have the perp on the ground holding him for you,\" Beringer said, according to a transcript of the 911 call.\n\nPolice estimated that the men held Stingley down for six to 10 minutes. When Stingley stopped struggling, Cole later told police, \"I thought he was faking it.\"\n\nHe added: \"I didn't know if he was just, you know, playing limp to try and get real strong and pull a quick one, you know.\"\n\nWhen an officer arrived, she handcuffed Stingley with Beringer's assistance but then realized that he wasn't breathing and called for help.\n\nBeringer walked outside the market, according to Farrell, only to be confronted by another bystander who said, \"You guys killed that kid.\"\n\n\"We didn't kill anyone,\" Beringer responded.\n\nAt nearby Froedtert Hospital, doctors concluded Stingley's airway had been blocked while he was restrained.\n\nHe had petechial hemorrhages - tiny red dots that appear as the result of broken blood vessels - to his eyes, cheeks and mouth. A deputy medical examiner attributed this pattern to \"pressure applied to the neck.\" There also was a bruise at the front of Stingley's neck, she testified.\n\nShe noted that his asphyxia also could be linked to compression of the chest.\n\nDoctors put Stingley in a medically induced coma, attached him to a ventilator and inserted a feeding tube. As the situation became increasingly hopeless, his family spent Christmas at his bedside. Four days later, his parents made the agonizing decision to take him off life support.\n\nIn the New York subway case earlier this month, it took less than two weeks for the Manhattan district attorney to charge Daniel Penny, a former Marine, with second-degree manslaughter for the choking death of Jordan Neely, a homeless man who had yelled at other subway passengers. A prosecutor emphasized that Penny continued to choke Neely even after he stopped moving.\n\nPenny's lawyers have defended his actions by saying he was protecting himself and other passengers. Laumann, in contrast, never claimed Corey Stingley was a danger. But he did dispute that he put his arm around the teen's throat.\n\nInterviewed by police that night, Laumann, then 56, recalled \"just leaning on him.\"\n\nPressed by a detective, Laumann appeared less confident, saying, \"A headlock is when you got your arms locked, right? And I didn't have him locked.\" He added: \"I had my arm around like this, yeah, but I didn't have him in a headlock. Unless maybe I did, maybe I - I don't, no, I, I don't remember that, no.\"\n\nHis account conflicted with that of witnesses. And Laumann's older sibling Michael, also a former Marine, isn't so sure, either. Chokeholds are a part of basic combat skills, he said, used to restrain a person and take them down.\n\n\"That's the first thing they teach you, not only in boot camp but also in subsequent infantry training. It becomes an automatic restraint, to save your own life,\" Michael said. \"I'm not saying that Mario did that. Because I don't know the situation. But all I'm saying is that when you're in the Marine Corps you're taught how to save your own life. And to save the lives of your brotherhood. Sometimes it becomes, say, an automatic response.\"\n\nMichael Laumann said he and Mario - who died last year at age 65 - seldom talked, and when they did, the store incident never came up.\n\nMario Laumann, who worked in construction after leaving the Marines, lived about two miles from the store. His family had been dealing with a variety of crises. His wife was battling cancer. She had been arrested four years earlier for driving under influence of prescription medications. She died in 2013.\n\nAnd, by the time of the encounter with Stingley, Laumann's youngest son, Nickolas, was serving time in prison for sexual assault of a 15-year-old girl, intimidation of a victim and theft.\n\nWriting online while in prison, Nickolas said his father would \"scream at me\" for drug use and \"whoop my ass.\" The police report about Stingley's death notes that Laumann had been arrested twice for battery, but charges in both cases had been dismissed.\n\n\"Mario did have a temper,\" another brother, Mennas Laumann, said recently.\n\nThe three men who held Stingley down didn't know each other. Beringer, who lived next door to the food mart, told police he only recognized Laumann as \"a neighborhood guy.\"\n\nLike Laumann, Beringer had had previous encounters with police. In 1996, Beringer pulled a gun on a Pakistani-born man and told him he hated \"fucking Iranians,\" according to a police sergeant's sworn criminal complaint. Beringer pleaded guilty to misdemeanor gun charges and was jailed briefly then put on probation. A judge ordered him to complete a course in violence counseling or anger management and continue with mental health treatment, court records show.\n\nBeringer, who no longer lives in West Allis, declined to talk to ProPublica. He came to the door of his apartment building and when asked to discuss Stingley's death said, \"No, no, see you later,\" and closed the door.\n\nThe third man to wrestle Stingley to the ground, Cole, was a 25-year-old electrician who lived about a mile from the store. He'd gone there to get cigarettes. The prior year he had pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, for carrying a Glock handgun in the center console of his car and a magazine with 11 hollow-point bullets in the glove box. Cole didn't respond to ProPublica's attempts for comment.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the incident, all three men cooperated with police.\n\nCole said that as he and the others tried to halt Stingley's attempt to flee, the teen took a swing at him and landed a punch. He ended up with a black eye.\n\nAsked by police why he restrained the teen, Laumann replied: \"Because he's a thief.\"\n\nSeveral days after the struggle, West Allis police arrested Laumann and processed him for second-degree reckless injury. It was up to Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm to decide whether to prosecute him and the other men.\n\nChisholm eventually arranged for a judicial proceeding where sworn testimony could be heard. There, the three men invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in declining to answer questions. The original witnesses recounted seeing Stingley grabbed around the throat.\n\nThough Farrell said he couldn't recall telling police that Laumann was \"squeezing the hell out of\" Stingley, he didn't back away from his original description of a chokehold.\n\nMonths went by with no word on charges. But Craig Stingley, a facilities engineer, couldn't just sit and wait. He rallied support from politicians in the community and tried to keep the pressure on Chisholm.\n\nStingley brought state Sen. Lena Taylor to meetings with the prosecutor to discuss the case. They came away discouraged. Taylor got the impression that the case was challenging for prosecutors on many levels. The video was not sharp, for one thing. Taylor also believed that race relations in Milwaukee County fed Chisholm's concern that a jury might not convict anyone in the case.\n\nAt one meeting, Taylor said, she questioned what would have happened if the people involved had been of different races. \"They wouldn't let a group of Black guys do that to a young white guy, without any consequences,\" she said.\n\nMore than a year after the incident, in January 2014, Chisholm announced he would not bring charges, on the grounds that the men did not intend to injure or kill Stingley and didn't realize there was a risk to his life or health. \"It is clear that the purpose of restraining Corey Stingley was to hold him for police,\" Chisholm wrote in a five-page summary of his investigation.\n\n\"None of the actors were trained in the proper application of restraint,\" he added\n\nCorey's mother, Alicia Stingley, was stunned. \"It's just mind-boggling to me, just the decision that was made that it was more so because he didn't think he could win a case or didn't think what they did was on purpose,\" she said. \"There were no repercussions for a grown man taking a young child's life - by choking him.\"\n\nFor Craig Stingley, it's inconceivable the men did not know his son was in distress during the prolonged time they held him down. Applied properly, a chokehold \"can render an aggressor unconscious in as little as eight to thirteen seconds,\" according to a 2015 Marine Corps instructor guide.\n\nChisholm is still the district attorney. Through an assistant, he declined comment, citing the new review. Among the questions sent by ProPublica to Chisholm was whether he investigated Laumann's training in restraints as a Marine.\n\nChisholm's decision sparked media coverage and community protests. To Craig Stingley, Corey was more than a symbol, he was a cherished son.\n\n\"He was my buddy,\" Stingley said, describing how he and Corey would watch sports together. A skilled athlete, Corey Stingley was a running back on his high school football team and a member of the diving team. He took advanced placement classes in school and made the National Honor Society at school, his father said. He also worked part-time at an Arby's.\n\nHis social media accounts include references to girls and partying. It also catalogs his love of Batman, the Green Bay Packers and Christmas and shows him gently mocking his friends and family.\n\n\"My dad just got texting and he's experimenting with winky faces,\" he wrote in 2012, ending with \"#ohlord.\"\n\nCraig Stingley and his ex-wife filed a wrongful death suit in 2015 against the three men and the convenience store, which led to a settlement. Records show that Laumann's homeowners insurance paid $300,000, as did Cole's. (Beringer didn't have homeowner's insurance.) There was no admission of wrongdoing by the defendants. In court filings the three men said their actions were legal and justified, citing self-defense and their need to respond to \"an emergency.\"\n\nA good portion of the proceeds from the suit went to pay for hospital and funeral costs and lawyer fees, Stingley said.\n\nIn the civil suit, an expert forensic pathologist hired by the Stingley family's lawyer concluded the teen died because his chest was compressed and he was strangled.\n\n\"Once his airway became completely obstructed,\" Dr. Jeffrey Jentzen of the University of Michigan wrote, \"Corey would have experienced severe air hunger, conscious fear, suffering and panic with an impending sense of his own death for a period of 30 seconds to approximately one minute until he was rendered into a fully unconscious state.\"\n\nCraig Stingley still obsessed about what had happened and how to revive a criminal case. He relived his son's death over and over, watching the surveillance video of his last moments frame by frame, looking for something new.\n\nUsing a movie maker app on his computer, he slowed the video down and grabbed individual frames. He concluded that Cole initially had his son in a headlock, but that Laumann too had an arm around his neck before bringing him to the ground. That conflicted with Laumann's statement to police.\n\nStingley took his findings to the West Allis police, where a detective agreed they'd missed this detail. The department wrote a supplemental report for Chisholm, who asked a judge to appoint a special prosecutor for another look.\n\nRacine District Attorney Patricia Hanson got the case in October 2017. But what followed was more waiting.\n\nStingley said he called Hanson's office routinely in the years that followed, but she never met with him. Reached via email recently, Hanson declined to comment.\n\nThe case \"has not even been assigned a referral or case number after three years in that office,\" state Rep. Evan Goyke complained in a December 2020 letter to Milwaukee County Circuit Court Chief Judge Mary Triggiano. \"This is unacceptable,\" he wrote.\n\nIn later correspondence, Triggiano noted Hanson had refused to say when her decision would be forthcoming because in the midst of the pandemic, she had a lot of cases needing attention.\n\nIn March 2021, Hanson told the court in a one-page memo that she had reviewed Chisholm's file and agreed with his earlier decision: \"I do not find that criminal charges are appropriate at this time.\"\n\nJohn Doe proceedings allowing citizens to directly ask a court to consider criminal charges date back to 1839, when Wisconsin was still a territory, according to an account in state supreme court records. The law is used infrequently, legal experts said, and rarely successfully.\n\nPetitions have been filed by prisoners, by activists alleging animal cruelty in research experiments and by citizens claiming police misconduct. The efforts typically fail, ProPublica found in reviewing court dockets, news accounts and appellate rulings. In Milwaukee County, Wisconsin's most populous, there were only 19 such cases in 2020, dockets show, including Stingley's. None succeeded.\n\nOther states have similar methods of giving citizens a voice, but none are exactly like Wisconsin's. According to the National Crime Victim Law Institute, six states - Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Oklahoma - allow private citizens to gather signatures to petition a judge to convene a grand jury to investigate an alleged crime. In Pennsylvania, individuals can file a criminal complaint with the district attorney; if rejected, they can appeal to the court to ask it to order the district attorney to prosecute.\n\nMilwaukee attorney Scott W. Hansen, who has served as special prosecutor in a John Doe case, is critical of the Wisconsin process. He said it allows citizens to present a one-sided, skewed version of facts to a judge, \"without benefit of cross-examination or adverse witnesses.\"\n\nThe law, however, does state that the citizen's petition must present facts \"that raise a reasonable belief\" a crime was committed.\n\nFormer state Supreme Court Justice Janine Geske described the John Doe petition as a check and balance on prosecutors by citizens. \"If people believe a crime has been committed, and you've got prosecutors not living up to their responsibilities, and you think somebody ought to be held accountable, it's a way to have some judicial review,\" she said.\n\nStingley has known all along that the odds were against him, so turning to a longshot petition didn't daunt him. Writing to Chief Judge Triggiano in late 2020, he alleged \"dereliction and breach of legal duty\" by the Milwaukee and Racine county district attorneys to conduct thorough criminal investigations into his son's death.\n\nRead More\n\nTriggiano assigned the case to Judge Milton Childs. He formally appointed Ozanne, the first Black district attorney in Wisconsin, as special prosecutor last July. Ozanne's inquiry has included reviews of court transcripts and interviews with West Allis police and others.\n\nCraig Stingley was pleased that Ozanne and his staff met with him for several hours to listen to his concerns and to hear about his son.\n\n\"When I left that meeting,\" Stingley said, \"my son got his humanity back.\"\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?

      "text": "Former Marine Charged in Jordan Neely's Death. Here's What to Know\n\nT he former marine who placed a 30-year-old homeless man in a fatal chokehold on an NYC subway earlier this month has been charged with second-degree manslaughter after many called for his arrest.\n\nOn Friday, Daniel Penny, 24, turned himself into the New York City police department and appeared in court before being released on bond. He has not yet entered a plea, but his lawyers have argued he was acting in self-defense.\n\nProsecutors said they're seeking a grand jury indictment in the case.\n\nOn May 1, Jordan Neely , was on a Manhattan F train and had been reportedly screaming about being hungry, thirsty, and tired when he was pinned down and placed in a chokehold by Penny.\n\nWhen officers arrived on the scene, Neely was unconscious. He was transported to the hospital where he later died, according to the New York Police Department. Penny was questioned by police after the incident and then let go.\n\nIn a four-minute long video circulating online, Neely can be seen on the floor as other passengers helped restrain him for several minutes. Some initially praised the former Marine as a good Samaritan, but city officials and advocates began calling for an arrest in the case.\n\nThe New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner officially ruled the death a homicide on May 3, and protests began at subway stations around the city and on social media, calling for justice and referring to Neely's death as a lynching.\n\n\"This is not an issue of public safety,\" Dave Giffen, executive director for the Coalition for the Homeless, a New York City-based nonprofit, says. \"As much as the mayor wants to cast it as that, homeless people are far more likely to be a victim of a violent crime scenario than to be perpetrators of violent crimes.\"\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nNeely died in the hospital on Monday afternoon, and on Wednesday the city's chief medical examiner determined his cause of death to be \"compression of the neck.\" His death was ruled a homicide, which means his death was caused by another person, without equating that to intentional murder or culpability.\n\n\"As part of our rigorous ongoing investigation, we will review the Medical Examiner's report, assess all available video and photo footage, identify and interview as many witnesses as possible, and obtain additional medical records,\" a statement from the District Attorney's office said last week.\n\nPer New York law, a person is permitted to use physical force on someone else to defend themself or others, but can only use deadly force if they have reason to believe that their life is threatened.\n\nNew York City's homeless community has had a tumultuous year , following controversial policies from Mayor Eric Adams, including increased police presence around subway stations and homeless encampments.\n\nMany have pointed out how Neely's death reflects the disproportionate number of BIPOC homeless individuals in the U.S, and how they're frequently targets of violence. In New York specifically, over 80% of homeless individuals are Black or Hispanic, while comprising only 53% of the city's population.\n\nNeely's choking by a white man prompted some to question if the attack was racially motivated and why the alleged assailant is free. \"The murderer gets protected w/ passive headlines + no charges. It's disgusting,\" New York Representative Alexandria Occasio-Cortez tweeted May 3, before Penny was charged with manslaughter.\n\n\"It's just beyond comprehension that the attacker was not charged,\" Giffen said. \"This was an incident of an ex-marine on a subway car, brutally murdering another human being because he found that human beings behavior, inconvenient or disruptive,\" Giffen says.\n\nChandra Crawford, the chief equity officer at the National Alliance to End Homelessness, Black individuals and minorities who experience homelessness face a \"double whammy\" of stigma.\n\n\"You have a negative construction of a person experiencing homelessness, and then it's coupled with that negative and fearful image of a Black man,\" Crawford says. \"We know that you don't necessarily have to be a person experiencing homelessness to face danger, because of the darkness of your skin.\"\n\nProtestors have held vigils, handed out pamphlets and are demanding better social services for unhoused people and for law enforcement to hold perpetrators of violence accountable.\n\n\"NYC is not Gotham,\" the city's Comptroller, Brad Landon tweeted May 2. \"We must not become a city where a mentally ill human being can be choked to death by a vigilante without consequence. Or where the killer is justified & cheered.\"\n\nRoughly 20 - 25% of the U.S. homeless population suffers from some form of severe mental illness, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\n\"In general, anybody who is living unsheltered, or in shelters for that matter, and has psychiatric disabilities, wants to get treatment. It's rare to find people that don't want to get housing and to get help,\" Giffen says.\n\n\"From what I understand, Jordan Neely did want help at the time that he was killed. He was expressing his frustration of not being able to get to some of the basic items of survival that any human being needs,\" Giffen adds.\n\nPenny is set to return to court on July 17.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Nobody Cares About Homeless People Until They Die\n\nJordan Neely was 30. His mother was murdered by her boyfriend when he was 14. He was not a troublesome student, but he didn't make it through school. He loved dancing, adored Michael Jackson, and made some cash impersonating him on the subway, but he didn't have a stable living situation. Jordan Neely had also been arrested 42 times, according to CNN . He had a drug problem. His behavior was erratic. In 2021, he hit an old lady and was arrested again, and in February a judge spared him prison in exchange for agreeing to go to a rehab center and not use drugs for 15 months. He left the center after two weeks.\n\nVery few people cared about any of this until Jordan Neely was killed.\n\nA lot of people now have opinions and concerns about Neely, who was screaming and had thrown his coat on the floor of the New York City subway, according to witnesses, when Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old Marine, with the help of others, held him in a chokehold until he died. A lot of people have a lot of views of what was wrong with what happened, how Neely should have been treated and who failed him, and whose fault it is, and who should have done what, but extremely few people really want to regularly interact with the community to which Neely belonged.\n\nIn some ways, Daniel Penny did what nobody else wanted to do-he engaged with Neely. He had a tragically poor understanding of how to handle the situation and seems to have believed, possibly influenced by cultural stereotypes about poor and Black people, that Neely presented an imminent threat. To many, his actions ended up more like a lynching than an intervention. His lawyer says that Penny \"never intended to harm\" Neely. (Had Neely been afforded a lawyer before he was judged, he or she might have argued that Neely never meant to hurt anyone either.)\n\nOne of the reasons Neely is dead is that Penny brought a combatant's skills to a negotiator's problem. People see those who are homeless or mentally ill as a threat in a way they don't see people with purely physical ailments and their fear can cloud their judgment. \"Associating erratic behavior [like Neely's] with dangerous behavior to me is a cognitive leap,\" says Josiah Haken, who runs City Relief , an organization that sets up mobile outreach stations for people who are living on the streets throughout New York City. \"That is a direct result of a narrative that we tell in our society about the dangerous Black homeless man.\"\n\nI've been mugged on the New York City subway. I understand what it is to suddenly have one's life threatened between stops. But I've also slept, as a volunteer, at a homeless shelter, and I've learned that nobody not in an actual war has more reason to fear being attacked than people who are unhoused. They are much more often the victims than the perpetrators of violence. One of the women at the shelter kept her shoes on while she slept, the better to run away if necessary.\n\nThe number of people experiencing the kind of chronic homelessness that cursed Neely increased by 16% between 2020 and 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. He belonged to a subset of the unhoused population who have been without a place to live for a long time and are often dealing with a disability that makes them a bad fit for shelters or congregant housing. They're the ones who often end up on the streets and in public view.\n\nPerhaps partly because of this increase, homelessness advocates have noticed a waning in empathy for those experiencing homelessness and mental-health challenges across the board recently. \"It feels like these days, there's less tolerance for people who are having a harder time, people who are living on the margins of our city,\" says Brian Ourien, the director of communications at The Bowery Mission , the oldest rescue mission in the U.S. \"During the pandemic, there was a heightened involvement, a heightened engagement, and heightened giving. But post pandemic, all of that has been decreasing, including giving, engagement and empathy.\"\n\nThe pandemic and the unprecedented restrictions necessitated by its arrival may have played a role in people's increasing trepidation toward those living on the margins Ourien mentions. Two years of heightening threats have left folks out of practice at de-escalation. Moreover, they don't have a lot of examples around to imitate. They don't see people toning it down on their social media feeds; they don't see it on the streets, in the schools, in the stores, in the places where we (used to) all learn how and when to take the temperature down a notch.\n\nHaken, who wrote a book on homelessness, Neighbors With No Doors, says the use of police to deal with those experiencing homelessness has made an anxious people even more afraid. \"My first thought [when I heard about Neely], honestly, was that we created the situation by reinforcing negative stereotypes, and utilizing police to respond to homeless folks, rather than care coordinators, social workers, outreach professionals,\" he says. \"We made our bed. And this is the consequence.\"\n\nRecent data has shown that murders of unhoused people have been on the rise. Just in the past few days, eight undocumented migrants were killed when a car slammed into them as they sat on the curb in Brownsville, Texas. In April, a former San Francisco city official was accused of attacking residents of a local tent community, with, among other things, bear spray. Instead of compassion, homeless people are getting hostility.\n\nMentally ill folks who are homeless are doubly cursed, because they don't have a good spokesperson. There's no Gabby Giffords to explain what it's like to be paralyzed by a bullet, no Randy Pausch to plead the case for more pancreatic cancer funding. There are just people whose brains have betrayed them, who haven't eaten or slept, who have been the subject of public revulsion. Those folks have a tough time advocating for themselves. Their attempts often look like ranting or aggression. It's hard for those they encounter to be empathetic toward someone who's yelling and spitting at them. It's much easier to care about them in the abstract-like when they're dead.\n\nIt's tempting to point the finger at the families of those who are mentally ill, to ask what happened to all the people who are supposed to care about them. Why would bystanders care if their family of origin didn't? And it's true that far fewer people end up on the street when they're mentally ill if they have intact families who know them, watch their medication, keep an eye on their moods, provide stability. People with mental illness can run through the folks trying to help them pretty quickly, and if they don't have a loved one watching out for them, they can spiral fast.\n\nBut sometimes it's the families that caused the harm in the first place. There was abuse or cruelty. \"Underlying a lot of homelessness is a lack of trust,\" says Ourien. \"People have had promises broken by family, friends, even people who were wanting to help them.\" One guest at the Bowery Mission told Ourien that when he addressed him by his name, it was the first time he'd heard it in 20 years.\n\nNeely's death is a tragedy and an outrage. But the life of every unsheltered person is also its own kind of tragedy and outrage. Protests of Neely's death are appropriate, but the afflictions that took him to that subway car and to that fate are being visited upon thousands of people right now. And until we see those people as worthy of our attention and compassion, of dignity, and begin to treat them that way when we encounter them, there will only be fear and distrust and more unnecessary deaths. \"Homelessness can be overcome through the power of community; mental-health challenges can be overcome through the power of community,\" says Ourien. \"We find that community, a safe community, where there's a lot of camaraderie and shared growth, that builds trust.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Daniel Penny acquitted in chokehold death of homeless man on NY subway\n\nA 26-year-old man has been acquitted of homicide for putting an unarmed homeless man in a fatal chokehold, a case that sparked weeks of protests and reignited debates over public safety, mental illness and race.\n\nJurors deliberated for five days before declaring Daniel Penny not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in the death of 30-year-old Jordan Neely on a New York City subway train on 1 May 2023.\n\nThe verdict comes after prosecutors agreed to drop a more serious charge of second-degree manslaughter on Friday, as jurors could not reach an agreement.\n\nThe move allowed the jurors to move on to consider the second lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide.\n\nThe verdict, announced on Monday, was met with loud applause in the Manhattan court. Mr Penny - who served four years in the Marines before studying architecture - appeared to smile while his attorneys hugged.\n\n\"We couldn't be more pleased that a jury of Danny's peers acquitted him of any wrongdoing,\" his lawyers said in a statement afterwards.\n\n\"New Yorkers can take some comfort in knowing that we can continue to stand up for one another without sacrificing our rights or our freedoms.\"\n\nMr Neely's father, Andre Zachery, was removed from court for shouting after the verdict. Chants of \"no justice, no peace\" could be heard echoing outside.\n\n\"It hurts. It really, really hurts,\" Mr Zachery said outside court. \"What's gonna happen to us now? I've had enough of this.\"\n\nMr Neely's death sparked protests across the city and reignited debates over public transportation safety and how the city cares for those struggling with mental health issues and homelessness. Some also highlighted the issue of race - Mr Neely was black; Mr Penny is white.\n\n\"Jordan Neely was murdered,\" New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a left-wing Democrat, wrote on X at the time of his death, adding, \"he was houseless and crying for food in a time when the city is raising rents and stripping services\".\n\nBut many conservatives defended Mr Penny's actions, saying he had stepped in to keep the public safe.\n\nOn Monday, following the verdict, Vice-President-elect JD Vance wrote on X that \"it was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place\".\n\n\"Thank God justice was done in this case,\" he said.\n\nLast spring, witnesses said that Mr Neely - who suffered from severe mental illnesses - began shouting at other subway passengers, asking for money and screaming that he was hungry and wanted to go back to jail.\n\nOne woman on the train said that Mr Neely made lunging movements that scared her enough to shield her young child from him.\n\nProsecutors said Mr Penny placed Mr Neely in a chokehold for six minutes, compressing his neck even after he stopped moving.\n\nThey argued that Mr Penny had acted \"recklessly\" by restraining Mr Neely for several minutes even after he lost consciousness.\n\n\"He's dying,\" said an unseen bystander in one passenger's video. \"Let him go!\"\n\nMr Penny's legal team argued that he only stepped in after Mr Neely began threatening passengers. They also cited testimony from a forensic pathologist who said Mr Neely could have died from other contributing factors.\n\nA medical examiner ruled Mr Neely's cause of death as compression to the neck.\n\nMr Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator who performed in Times Square. He had dozens of previous arrests on charges such as evading fares, theft and assaults on three women.\n\nFamily members say his mental health issues began more than 15 years earlier, when his mother was strangled to death and stuffed in a suitcase by her boyfriend.\n\nIn a statement released on Monday afternoon, Neely family attorney Donte Mills said they were \"devastated\".\n\n\"Everyone matters. Even if you're homeless, have mental health issues, have an addiction - you matter,\" Mr Mills said.\n\n\"This verdict says otherwise. Daniel Penny got away with murder.\"\n\nThe manslaughter charge against Mr Penny would have carried a 15-year maximum sentence, while the negligent homicide charge would have carried a four-year-maximum.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Was Daniel Penny 'reckless'? Jurors deliberate on subway chokehold death\n\nA jury of 12 New Yorkers ended their first day deliberating the legal fate of Daniel Penny, a former US Marine accused of putting a homeless man in a fatal chokehold, without a verdict.\n\nMr Penny, 26, has faced a month-long trial in a Manhattan courtroom after pleading not guilty to charges of second-degree manslaughter and negligent homicide.\n\nProsecutors have cast him as reckless when he restrained 30-year-old Jordan Neely on a subway train, while Mr Penny's attorneys say he stepped in to protect anxious riders.\n\nAfter prosecutors finished their closing arguments on Tuesday, the judge read about an hour of instructions before sending jurors off in the afternoon to reach a verdict.\n\nMr Penny's trial has reignited conversations about safety on public transportation in the largest US city and how the local government cares for residents struggling with homelessness and mental health issues.\n\nOn Monday, Steven Raiser, Mr Penny's attorney, asked jurors to put themselves in Mr Penny's shoes, saying that he and other subway passengers had \"very little room\" to move or run when Neely's outburst began.\n\n\"Danny acted to save those people,\" Mr Raiser said. \"Who would you want on the next train ride with you?\"\n\nAssistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran, meanwhile, told jurors the defendant had used \"way too much force for way too long, in way too reckless a manner\".\n\n\"The defendant was given all the signs that he needed to stop. He ignored them, he kept going, until a man died. He must be held accountable for that,\" Ms Yoran said on Tuesday.\n\nMr Penny could face up to 15 years behind bars if convicted of manslaughter.\n\nThe May 2023 incident quickly became a political flashpoint, with conservatives praising Mr Penny as a hero, and critics, including civil rights activists, saying he acted as an unjustified vigilante when he killed Mr Neely, who is black.\n\nOn 1 May, witnesses say that Mr Neely - who lived with severe mental illnesses - began shouting at other subway passengers, asking for money and screaming that he was hungry and wanted to go back to jail.\n\nLawyers for Mr Penny, who is white, say the Long Island native intervened out of fear Mr Neely would hurt other passengers, pinning him down for several minutes as he lost consciousness.\n\nMr Penny's month-long trial has featured a host of evidence, including bystander videos of the chokehold, 911 calls and police body camera footage, as well as testimony from witnesses and people from Mr Penny's past.\n\nMr Penny declined to testify during the trial, but the 12 anonymous New York jurors heard from the police who responded to the incident and subway passengers who witnessed the events.\n\nTheir testimony was divided, with some saying they felt threatened by Mr Neely's erratic behaviour and others concerned over Mr Penny's chokehold.\n\n\"I truly believed that I was going to die in that moment,\" said Caedryn Schrunk, a witness on the New York F train that day.\n\nAnother man, Johnny Grima, said Mr Penny would not allow him to intervene when he asked to put Mr Neely on his side rather than in a chokehold.\n\n\"I'm concerned about the man, because he's not moving,\" Mr Grima told the court.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office did not dispute Mr Penny's desire to protect other passengers. Ms Yoran said during opening statements that this motivation was \"even laudable\".\n\n\"But under the law, deadly physical force such as a chokehold is permitted only when it is absolutely necessary, and only for as long as it is absolutely necessary,\" she said. \"The defendant went way too far.\"\n\nProsecutors also argued that as a former Marine, Mr Penny should have been aware that the chokehold could kill Mr Neely - and could have used less lethal methods to restrain him.\n\nMr Penny's lawyers suggested other factors besides the chokehold could be responsible for Mr Neely's death, including a combination of his drug use, schizophrenia and sickle cell trait. They cited testimony from a forensic pathologist whom they called as an expert witness.\n\nA medical examiner ruled that Mr Neely died from neck compression, a finding she maintained during the trial.\n\nMr Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator who performed in Times Square and was known throughout the city from his performances.\n\nHe had dozens of previous arrests on charges such as evading fares, theft and assaults on three women.\n\nFamily members said his mental health issues began more than 15 years earlier, when his mother was strangled by her boyfriend.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Daniel Penny is guest of Trump and Vance at football game\n\nA New York City subway rider who was acquitted this week of killing a homeless man during a confrontation on a train has joined US President-elect Donald Trump  as a guest of honour at a popular American sporting event.\n\nDaniel Penny, who became a conservative cause celebre, was pictured attending the Army v Navy American football game near Washington DC with Trump and Vice-President-elect JD Vance.\n\nAhead of the game, Ohio Senator Vance said in a post on X that he was \"grateful\" Mr Penny, a former US Marine, had accepted his invitation to be in Trump's suite on the Army side.\n\nA jury cleared Mr Penny of criminally negligent homicide on Monday for using a fatal chokehold to restrain Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man, who had been shouting at other passengers and asking for money, last year.\n\nThe Army v Navy game is an annual fixture that marks the end of the college American football season and is the final game of the season's Commander-in-Chief's Trophy series.\n\nIt is one of the great American sporting rivalries, representing the fierce competition between two branches of the US Armed Forces.\n\nIn a photo taken from outside Trump's suite in Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland, on Saturday, Mr Penny could be seen talking with Trump and Vance.\n\nSpeaking about Mr Penny's acquittal earlier this week, Vance said this week on X that Mr Penny was \"a good guy, and New York's mob district attorney tried to ruin his life for having a backbone\".\n\nThe incoming vice-president added that it was \"a scandal\" that New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg ever prosecuted the case.\n\nMr Neely's death, and the subsequent trial, became a flashpoint, with some accusing Mr Penny of being a vigilante, while others defended him, arguing he was looking out for other passengers' safety.\n\nMr Penny's lawyer, Steven Raiser, said in a statement that his client was honoured by the invitation to Saturday's game.\n\n\"He's not viewing it as a political statement. He's viewing it as just basically an honour,\" Mr Raiser told Reuters news agency.\n\n\"If it were a president in office who was a Democrat, who invited him to the Army-Navy game as a way to show support to the military and for his country, he would have gladly accepted that as well.\"\n\nAlso at the game was Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick for defence secretary, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has recently been rumoured to be in the running to replace Hegseth, should Trump withdraw the offer.\n\nHegseth's nomination has come under intense scrutiny amid questions about his qualifications and personal conduct.\n\nTrump's nominee to be director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, his nominee to be director of the FBI, Kash Patel, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson and Trump ally Elon Musk were also at the game.\n\nMr Penny's not-guilty verdict earlier this week came after prosecutors agreed to drop a more serious charge of second-degree manslaughter, as Manhattan jurors could not reach an agreement.\n\nHe has said he never intended to kill Mr Neely, who had a history of mental illness.\n\nThe May 2023 subway incident sparked protests across New York and reignited debates over public transportation safety and how the city cares for those struggling with mental health issues and homelessness.\n\nAttention will now turn to a civil lawsuit filed by Mr Neely's father, who is seeking damages for alleged civil assault and battery.\n\nMr Penny's lawyer previously described that legal action as a distraction.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Judge in Daniel Penny case dismisses manslaughter charge\n\nA judge presiding over the trial of Daniel Penny, a former Marine accused of choking a homeless man to death on a New York City subway, has dismissed a charge of second-degree manslaughter against him, after jurors failed to reach an agreement.\n\nNew York jurors still have one less severe charge of criminally negligent homicide to consider.\n\nOn the fourth day of deliberations, the 12 jurors sent two notes saying they were \"unable to come to a unanimous vote\" on the first count, which would be required for a conviction.\n\nThe judge sent them back to try again, but they still could not agree, prompting prosecutors to ask the judge to dismiss the manslaughter count.\n\nMr Penny faced two charges over the killing of 30-year-old Jordan Neely on a subway in May 2023.\n\nProsecutors say Mr Penny held Mr Neely in a fatal chokehold for six minutes after restraining him on the subway. Mr Penny's attorneys say he was trying to protect others on the train, after Mr Neely began asking for money and screaming that he was hungry and wanted to go back to jail.\n\nHis death sparked continuing protests across the city. Occasionally, protestors' chants in support of Mr Neely could be heard in the 13th floor courtroom.\n\nAfter receiving the first note from the 12 New York jurors, Judge Maxwell Wiley told them it made sense it was taking days for jurors to weigh the case.\n\n\"That's a long time, but given the factual complexity of the case, I don't think it's too long,\" he said, before sending them back to deliberate further.\n\nAfter a second note from jurors saying they remained deadlocked, the top count of manslaughter was dismissed and the judge sent them back to deliberate yet again.\n\n\"You are now free to consider count two. Whether that makes any difference or not, I have no idea,\" he said.\n\nThe jury will return next week to continue its deliberations.\n\nThe manslaughter charge would have carried a 15-year maximum sentence, while the negligent homicide charge has a four-year-maximum.\n\nMr Penny's month-long trial featured a host of evidence, including bystander videos of the chokehold, 911 calls and police body camera footage, as well as testimony from witnesses and people from Mr Penny's past.\n\nMembers of Mr Neely's family have watched in the courtroom as the video of the subway incident was played over and over. Mr Neely's father also filed a civil suit against Mr Penny.\n\nMr Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator known throughout the city for his performances in Times Square.\n\nHe had dozens of previous arrests on charges such as evading fares, theft and assaults on three women.\n\nFamily members said his mental health issues began more than 15 years earlier, when his mother was strangled by her boyfriend.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Daniel Penny pleads not guilty in NY subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely\n\nA former US Marine who placed a homeless man in a fatal chokehold on a New York City subway train has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges.\n\nDaniel Penny, 24, was indicted in court on Wednesday on counts of second-degree manslaughter and negligent homicide.\n\nWitnesses said Jordan Neely, 30, was shouting at other subway passengers and asking for money when Mr Penny pinned him down for several minutes on 1 May.\n\nVideo of the confrontation sparked protests and counter-demonstrations.\n\nMr Penny faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the manslaughter charge. He was arrested on 12 May and released on $100,000 (£80,000) in bail.\n\nHe has said he was acting in self-defence in the incident on a northbound F train subway car in Manhattan.\n\nWitnesses said Mr Neely was shouting about how he was hungry and willing to return to jail or die. There is no indication he physically attacked anyone.\n\nThe incident was filmed by bystanders, and a video captured by a freelance journalist on the train shows Mr Penny holding Mr Neely around the neck for two minutes and 55 seconds.\n\nHe continued to restrain Mr Neely, including after he stopped moving, say prosecutors.\n\nEmergency responders tried to resuscitate him, and he was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nThe city medical examiner said his death resulted from compression of the neck and ruled it a homicide.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he hopes the Neely family is \"on the path towards healing as they continue to mourn this tragic loss\".\n\nMr Penny did not address reporters as he entered the Manhattan court for Wednesday's brief hearing.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Penny addressed the incident on social media and said he did not intend to kill Mr Neely.\n\n\"I was scared for myself but I looked around there were women and children, he was yelling in their faces saying these threats. I just couldn't sit still,\" he said.\n\nOutside court, attorneys for Mr Penny expressed confidence he will ultimately be found not guilty.\n\n\"There is not a living, breathing soul in Manhattan that has not experienced a variation of what not only Mr Penny but other individuals experienced on that subway car,\" lawyer Thomas Keniff said.\n\nThe defendant was ordered to return to court on 25 October for a pre-trial hearing.\n\nA self-defence argument was the most logical way for Mr Penny to proceed, attorneys told the BBC.\n\nThe case is \"dependent on whether or not there was an imminent harm posed to himself or others, and whether or not his conduct was excessive\", said Dmitriy Shakhnevich, a criminal defence attorney and professor at John Jay Law School.\n\n\"That's really it,\" he said. \"There's nothing else in this case.\"\n\nThat standard would be quite high, said Lance Fletcher, a former prosecutor who now works as a New York defence attorney.\n\n\"They have to say, he killed this guy and it wasn't justified, and no reasonable person would think it was justified,\" Mr Fletcher said. \"And that's going to be tough.\"\n\nPerception \"has a huge impact on the case\", said Mr Fletcher, \"since this case is all about justification\".\n\nMr Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator who frequently performed in Times Square.\n\nHe had 42 arrests on charges such as evading fares, theft and assaults on three women, according to US media reports.\n\nMr Neely began experiencing mental health issues after his mother's murder by her boyfriend in 2007, his aunt, Carolyn Neely, told the New York Post last month.\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams has said Mr Neely's previous offences highlight the need to improve the city's mental health system.\n\nThe case has become politically charged with conservatives - including Florida Governor and presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis - praising Mr Penny as a hero.\n\nHis detractors, such as US civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, have characterised Mr Penny as a vigilante in the mould of Bernard Goetz, a white man who shot and injured four black men on a New York subway in 1984.\n\nMr Penny's supporters have raised nearly $3m (£2.37m) for his legal defence.\n\nBut Neely family attorney Donte Mills said on Wednesday: \"For everyone who thought donating $3 million would somehow make this go away or buy his pass: It's not going to happen. You can ask for a refund.\"\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

He stared straight ahead as he walked to sit next to his lawyers.\n\nNew York Judge Maxwell Wiley said the first few days of jury selection would involve picking Manhattan residents who are able to sit on a trial that is expected to last six weeks. The voir dire process of jury selection - when prospective jurors are asked questions about their background and potential biases - is expected to begin Friday.\n\nMr Penny, who has said he was acting in self-defence, faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the manslaughter charge.\n\nProsecutors say he put Mr Neely in a chokehold \"that lasted approximately six minutes and continued well past the point at which Mr Neely had stopped purposeful movement\".\n\nFellow passengers filmed the incident, with a freelance journalist recording Mr Penny holding Mr Neely around the neck for several minutes.\n\nWitnesses said Mr Neely was shouting about being hungry and willing to return to jail or die, but there was no indication he physically attacked anyone.\n\nEmergency responders could not resuscitate him and Mr Neely was pronounced dead at hospital.\n\nThe city medical examiner ruled his death a homicide, caused by compression of the neck.\n\nMr Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator who performed in Times Square and was known throughout the city.\n\nHe had dozens of previous arrests on charges such as evading fares, theft and assaults on three women.\n\nFamily members say he had mental health issues that began more than 15 years earlier, when his mother was strangled to death by her boyfriend.\n\nMr Penny, a Long Island native who served in the Marines, wrote on social media that he did not intend to kill Mr Neely.\n\n\"I was scared for myself but I looked around there were women and children, he was yelling in their faces saying these threats.

      "text": "Daniel Penny Found Not Guilty in Subway Death of Jordan Neely\n\nNEW YORK CITY-A Manhattan jury on Dec. 9 acquitted Daniel Penny of criminally negligent homicide over the death of Jordan Neely, a mentally ill homeless man whom Penny put in a chokehold and wrestled to the ground on a subway in May 2023.\n\nOn Dec. 6, Judge Maxwell Wiley agreed to dismiss the top charge of manslaughter in the second degree when the jury could not reach a unanimous decision after three days of deliberation.\n\nAs soon as the jury foreperson said \"not guilty,\" cheers and applause briefly rang out near the front of the courtroom before the court officers told everyone to quiet down under threat of removal.\n\nThe verdict brings a conclusion to a closely watched trial that took a little more than one month, from voir dire and the seating of a jury at the end of October to witness testimony throughout November up to last week's closing statements and jury deliberations.\n\nWitnesses all agreed that Neely got onto an uptown F train at Manhattan's Second Avenue station and immediately began screaming that he was hungry, homeless, and did not care if he went back to prison.\n\nTheir testimony differed slightly as to the explicitness of Neely's threats. Some said he had cried out that he was willing to hurt others if they did not give him what he sought.\n\nLori Sitro, who had her small son with her on the train when Neely got on, said Neely's conduct made her fear for the boy's safety so much that she placed his stroller in front of the boy to shield him from Neely.\n\nThe boy was too small to move quickly off the train with her, according to Sitro. She expressed gratitude toward Penny for taking swift action to protect passengers.\n\nSitro's testimony was consistent with that of others present, such as Yvette Rosario, who said Neely's conduct scared her so badly that she thought she might pass out, and she placed her head on a friend's chest.\n\nDan Couvreur said the incident went far beyond other tense moments that he had experienced on the subway.\n\nAnother witness, Alethea Gittings, called Neely's words \"very loud, very menacing, very disturbing\" and thanked Penny for stepping in to protect her and others on the train.\n\nThe lead prosecutor, Dafna Yoran, noted in her closing statements to the jury on Dec. 3 that some of the jurors might now feel grateful to Penny for springing into action to protect passengers and that weighing his potential guilt or innocence would not be easy.\n\nYoran said it might be hard to convict a man who had tried to do the right thing and did not act with the intent to take someone's life.\n\nThe defense argued that, in light of the testimony of those present on the F train, Penny had acted bravely and selflessly and that the government was trying to make a scapegoat of a good man.\n\nProsecutors brought Dr. Cynthia Harris, a New York City medical examiner who had performed Neely's autopsy, to the stand.\n\nHarris said she had found synthetic cannabinoids in Neely's body that were more potent than marijuana and were, in fact, on par with cocaine in terms of their ability to make someone aggressive.\n\nShe said the vascular compromise and airway compromise that Penny's chokehold inflicted were the causes of Neely's death. These resulted in \"a low-oxygen state for the brain to be at,\" a condition \"sufficient to cause death,\" Harris testified under oath on Nov. 15.\n\nThe defense sought to counter those claims and raise reasonable doubts about the prosecution's theory by putting on the stand Satish Chundru, a certified forensic pathologist.\n\nUnder direct examination from defense lawyer Steve Raiser, Chundru said that a number of factors, acting in concert, had brought about the death of Jordan Neely.\n\nChundru said Harris should have considered the role of other factors, such as the drugs in his system, his schizophrenia, and a sickle cell trait that became a crisis under the stress of the chokehold.\n\nHe said red blood cells in the body of someone with this trait change shape under stress. Instead of their usual round form, they take on what Chundru described as a \"crescent moon or banana shape\" and no longer carry out their critical life-supporting function of conveying oxygen to tissue cells.\n\nDuring the chokehold, Neely suffered a sickle cell crisis, and he died as a direct consequence of it, Chundru testified.\n\nHe argued that blaming the death solely on the chokehold ignored the extent of Neely's sickle cell condition and its propensity to have fatal complications during an incident that would not be deadly for the average person.\n\nLawyers for both sides continually played this footage on screens in the courtroom and shared conflicting theories as to when Neely lost consciousness and the meaning of nonverbal evidence, such as the position of his tongue and motions of his legs while he lay prone in Penny's chokehold.\n\nYoran sought to impeach testimony from Chundru that depicted Neely as conscious and still struggling at a point in a video when Yoran argued that Penny had made Neely lose consciousness.\n\nYet another aspect of the case had to do with Penny's character.\n\nThe judge leaned in favor of the prosecution's arguments that character witness testimony was immaterial in a case of this kind, but Wiley briefly allowed Penny's lawyers to put witnesses on the stand who had served with Penny in the Marines.\n\nThese witnesses attested to his character as a decent, responsible person who followed rules, got along well with others, and, at least in their personal experience, was never the subject of complaints or negative comments.\n\nYoran used the testimony of Joseph Caballer, who had taught Penny combat techniques during their time together in the Marines, to try to strengthen her case that Penny's actions went beyond what his training authorized or condoned.\n\nThe chokehold that Penny applied to Neely, Yoran repeatedly asserted, was proper neither from the point of view of Penny's and Neely's bodily positioning nor the amount of time that Penny kept Neely in the hold.\n\nAccording to Yoran, Penny should have quickly released Neely as soon as Neely lost consciousness and was no longer capable of harming anyone, but instead kept Neely in the hold for about six minutes, causing an asphyxial death."

      "text": "After Manslaughter Dismissal, Jury in Daniel Penny Trial Returns to Consider Lesser Count\n\nNEW YORK-Jurors will return to a lower Manhattan courthouse on Dec. 9 to consider the charge of criminally negligent homicide against Daniel Penny, following the dismissal of the other charge he faced, second-degree manslaughter, on Dec. 6.\n\nBoth charges stemmed from a May 1, 2023, incident in which Penny put Jordan Neely into a chokehold after Neely came onto an uptown F train at Manhattan's Second Avenue station and began shouting and threatening passengers.\n\nNeely did not survive, and Penny's trial has turned on questions about the causes of his death and whether Penny's actions were justified.\n\nThe case has drawn national and international attention, with some viewing Penny as a hero who put his own life on the line to protect men, women, and children on the subway, and others branding him a vigilante who applied too much force.\n\nLast week, jurors began their deliberations on Dec. 3 and continued through to Dec. 6, making several requests to Judge Maxwell Wiley for a second chance to review key pieces of evidence and testimony first presented to the jury in November.\n\nThe length of the deliberations, and the repeated requests to see evidence again, led to speculation that the jury might be having trouble achieving unanimity about Penny's guilt and that things could even be headed for a mistrial.\n\nShortly after 11 a.m. on Dec. 6, the judge announced that he had received a note from the jury, stating: \"At this time, we are unable to come to a unanimous vote on Count One, manslaughter in the second degree.\"\n\nThis led to a discussion in which the judge told Penny's defense counsel and the prosecutors that his official recognition that the jury was deadlocked on the first charge was required before the jury could give up discussing it and move on to the second count.\n\n\"I still have to decide that a unanimous agreement is impossible on Count One before they can render a verdict on Count Two,\" he said.\n\nThe judge then asked the lawyers on both sides how they felt about the situation.\n\nProsecutor Dafna Yoran was not against continued deliberations, but Penny's counsel tried to persuade the judge not to issue an Allen order directing the jury to press ahead and continue to try to reach unanimity.\n\nBut the judge issued the order anyway and had the jury come back into the courtroom.\n\nOnce they were seated, the judge reminded them that it is not supposed to be easy to achieve unanimity in criminal cases, but stressed that he had faith in their ability to reach a decision based on the evidence and the law.\n\nThe judge also explicitly directed the jury not to make a decision based on personal feelings of like or dislike for one or other party in the trial.\n\nHowever, late on the afternoon of Dec. 6, the status of the deliberations had not changed.\n\nThe jury still could not come to a unanimous decision on the second-degree manslaughter charge.\n\nThe judge agreed to dismiss that charge, leaving the jury to consider the charge of criminally negligent homicide when it resumes deliberations on Dec. 9."

      "text": "Legal Experts React to Daniel Penny's Acquittal in Death of Jordan Neely\n\nDaniel Penny's acquittal on charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely is unlikely to foster a more tolerant climate for citizens who seek to protect others in danger, although it may have consequences for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the charges against him, legal experts told The Epoch Times.\n\nThe Dec. 9 verdict in the trial, which began with jury selection at the end of October before continuing through November and well into December, sparked highly emotional reactions from both supporters of Penny and sympathizers with Neely, the homeless man who died after Penny restrained him during an incident on a Manhattan subway last year.\n\nJust before 11:30 a.m. on Dec. 9, a jury foreperson announced that the jury had reached a unanimous verdict to acquit Penny on the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. The judge dismissed the second-degree manslaughter charge on Dec. 6 after the jury had deliberated for four days and could not come to a unanimous vote.\n\nPenny's supporters are pleased that he will not face jail time for taking swift action to restrain Neely-who had drugs in his system and a record of arrests for violent crimes-when Neely threatened to harm passengers on the train.\n\nNeely's friends, family, and sympathizers have maintained that Penny should have faced legal consequences for keeping Neely restrained for about six minutes, which they argue caused an asphyxial death.\n\n\"Given the current climate of crime and conditions in New York City, I'm not surprised by the verdict in the Penny trial,\" he told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"Many New Yorkers might see themselves or their loved ones in the Daniel Penny trial. The case touches on significant issues like public safety, self-defense, and the challenges of living in the city.\"\n\nAlcazar does not find it unusual for the jury to have come to a unanimous vote on the criminally negligent homicide charge after its deadlock on a related but more serious manslaughter charge.\n\nHe said this is because the two charges related to the same actions on the part of the defendant placed different evidentiary burdens on prosecutors.\n\nIn other words, government lawyers could not prove both charges through the same evidence or legal standards, Alcazar said.\n\nHe said that, in his view, following the acquittal, Bragg's decision to prosecute Penny will now face all the more acute scrutiny.\n\n\"A hung jury or acquittal can lead to public scrutiny and criticism. ... The specific repercussions will depend on several factors, including public sentiment, media coverage, and the broader political climate in New York,\" Alcazar said.\n\nPenny's lawyers argued during their summation that the government sought to use Penny as a scapegoat for what they depicted as the city's own failures to protect the public and keep order and said the prosecution had political motives.\n\nEven though Penny was not convicted, people who might otherwise be willing to act as \"Good Samaritans\" will have reservations about taking any action that might land them in legal trouble for months and incur tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees, according to Kushner.\n\nKushner said the effect on people in future situations on the subway or in other settings in which someone is in danger is not hard to predict.\n\n\"In terms of the concept of the 'Good Samaritan,' for people actually on the subway, this puts a damper on it. Penny still has to go through a civil suit, and even at the press conference I saw [after the verdict], the Black Lives Matter and other agitators really threatened him. This is serious,\" he said.\n\n\"Penny should not have been charged in the first place, and if you look at the whole situation and the videos of what happened, it's a travesty.\"\n\nHe said the deterrent effect on prospective \"Good Samaritans\" in the future will be all the more pervasive because of the widespread, 24/7 coverage that the Penny case has received in New York City and beyond, citing television coverage, TikTok, and social media platform X as near-constant purveyors of news and commentary on the case.\n\nKushner said he sets the Penny case apart from others involving alleged vigilantes, such as the case of Bernhard Goetz, who in December 1984 shot four young black men whom he believed were trying to rob him on a Manhattan subway. Although the Goetz case drew wide attention, sparked highly emotional reactions, and fueled debate about self-defense and race, much as the Penny case has done, Kushner does not view the cases as equivalent, partly because social media was not ubiquitous in 1984.\n\n\"If you look back, historically, there was that Goetz case on the subway all those years ago. You might have had one of these cases in past decades, but it wasn't known to as wide a number of people,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, the 'Good Samaritans' are going to step back and say, 'Wait, should I get involved with this?'\"\n\nBragg's office did not respond by publication time to a request for comment."

      "text": "News Brief: Suspect in Shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Charged in PA; Daniel Penny Found Not Guilty in Subway Death of Jordan Neely; NYC Mayor Working to Bypass City Council on Sanctuary Law\n\nGood morning, and welcome to The Epoch Times News Brief for Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2024. I'm Bill Thomas, we have some urgent stories to share with you right now, and here's what's going on.\n\nPolice arrest a suspect in the high-profile murder of a prominent health care executive, a Manhattan jury reaches a verdict in the controversial subway chokehold trial, and the mayor of one of our country's biggest sanctuary cities says he might have to take extreme measures to work with the incoming Trump administration on illegal immigration.\n\nAlso, lawmakers introduce a bill that could radically change the U.S. Supreme Court, and the president of Ukraine reveals the devastating toll his country has taken as a result of its war with Russia.\n\nYou should know that Mangione has already been charged with a variety of offenses in Pennsylvania, including forgery, carrying a firearm without a license, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime, and falsely identifying himself to law enforcement.\n\nShe said that officers who responded to the call questioned the suspect, who was \"acting suspiciously,\" as well as carrying multiple fraudulent IDs along with a U.S. passport. Additionally, police say one of the fake IDs matches the New Jersey ID used to check into a Manhattan hostel prior to the shooting.\n\nTisch later said that police officers found a \"handwritten document that speaks to both his motivation and mindset\" in the shooting, and that he possessed an \"ill will toward corporate America.\"\n\nThe NYPD also said that Mangione was in possession of a \"ghost gun\" that was capable of firing a 9-mm round, that it may have been made using a 3-D printer, and that it had a suppressor, or a silencer, attached to it.\n\nThey said that at some point, the suspect will be extradited back to New York to face charges, and that meanwhile, they're backtracking his steps from Manhattan to Pennsylvania.\n\nIn case you're not aware, Thompson was killed last week-in what police said was a targeted attack-as he walked alone to a hotel where UnitedHealthcare's parent company, UnitedHealth Group, was holding its annual investor conference.\n\nSo you know, as soon as the jury foreperson said \"not guilty,\" cheers and applause briefly rang out near the front of the courtroom, before the court officers told everyone to quiet down or else they'd be removed.\n\nHowever, among Neely's family and supporters, there was a much different reaction, and the court officers asked two people to leave because of their enraged comments and demeanor.\n\nTo refresh your memory, Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man, was acting erratically and shouting at subway riders in May last year. He lost consciousness and died after Penny, with the help of two others, put him on the floor, and placed him in a chokehold. Penny pled not guilty to the charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, saying he was acting in self-defense.\n\nLast week, Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed the top charge of manslaughter in the second degree after the jury could not reach a unanimous decision following three days of deliberation, and yesterday's not-guilty verdict for criminally negligent homicide now officially ends the trial.\n\nYou should know that the prosecution and defense differed sharply as to the causes of Neely's death. They also disagreed regarding the necessity of using deadly physical force to protect passengers on the train from Neely, as well as the validity of claims by the defense that Penny's actions were justified under New York law.\n\nDuring the trial, the jury heard from an array of witnesses, including people who were present on the subway train and saw Penny and Neely struggle. They also listened to testimony from some of Penny's former Marine comrades, as well as a pair of medical experts who contradicted each other's accounts of Neely's official cause of death.\n\nAdams told CBS News he wants criminals who are illegal immigrants to be deported first, and that he may try to bypass the city's sanctuary law to get it done.\n\nAdams said the City Council has \"made it clear\" that they won't change the sanctuary city law to allow cooperation with federal immigration officials, and he thinks \"they're wrong.\" The mayor also said he's now going to \"plan B\" and looking at all of his options-including what he can do by using \"executive orders\" to accomplish his goals.\n\nDuring the interview, Adams said he has repeatedly told President Joe Biden and his staff that \"we have to deal\" with the \"small number of violent offenders\" who are making their way into the United States. In particular, he pointed to a \"very dangerous Venezuelan gang\" which he said is preying on other migrants and asylum seekers.\n\nBy the way, Adams and Homan are scheduled to meet very soon, and last week, the mayor said that he's anxious to hear the incoming border czar's \"actual plan\" regarding deportation and how it's going to be implemented.\n\nFor his part, Homan is a former acting director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and he has issued multiple warnings to sanctuary cities all across the country, and well ahead of Trump's inauguration next month.\n\nThe new resolution has been introduced by Sens. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.), and it would limit newly appointed justices to 18 years on the bench and lead to a new opening roughly every two years.\n\nSo you know, the proposed amendment will not change the number of sitting justices, which is currently set at nine by law. However, it would establish a transition period to ensure that vacancies occur at regular intervals.\n\nThe senators who introduced the legislation say they are taking \"urgent\" and \"necessary\" action to restore public trust in our nation's most powerful court.\n\nThey also say the amendment makes sure the Supreme Court will never have more than nine justices, and that it allows the president to appoint a new justice every two years with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate.\n\nSo you know, in order to be enacted, a constitutional amendment has to be passed by a two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress, and must also be ratified by three-quarters of the states.\n\nHe also says the latest data shows that nearly 200,000 Russian soldiers have been killed and more than 550,000 have been wounded during that same period.\n\nSo you know, Zelenskyy just released the figures on the social media platform X after meeting with both Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron last weekend during the ceremonial reopening of the world-famous Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, France.\n\nIn a Truth Social post following the meeting, Trump says that too many lives are being needlessly wasted and too many families are being destroyed.\n\nHe also says that if the war keeps on going, \"it can turn into something much bigger, and far worse.\" He called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" and the start of negotiations.\n\nTrump closed by saying he knows Russian President Vladimir Putin well, that it's his time to act, that China can help, and that the entire world \"is waiting.\"\n\nFor his part, Zelenskyy said his meeting with Trump went well. However, he said that a cease-fire \"cannot simply end with a piece of paper and a few signatures.\"\n\nThis is a story with significant global implications and one we'll all be watching very closely over the next several weeks and months.\n\nAnd now, it looks like our time is just about up for today, so we're gonna call it a wrap for the Tuesday edition of the Epoch Times News Brief.\n\nIf you're like us and keeping track, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, and that's because the big holiday is only 15 days away. Also, Hanukkah falls on Dec. 25 this year as well, so this will be an extraordinary holiday season.\n\nTo make contact with the News Brief crew, reach out and we're at [email protected] and you can also leave comments for us on the Epoch Times app which you can download for free on either the App Store or Google Play\n\nDon't forget the News Brief Motto: We're portable, affordable, and always on-demand.\n\nAnd finally, as we do each and every day on this program, we wrap everything up with a very notable quote and this one comes to us from Charles M. Schulz who said:\n\n\"Life is like a ten speed bicycle. Most of us have gears we never use.\"\n\nSchulz was an American cartoonist and the creator of the comic strip Peanuts-Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and all the rest.

      "text": "Forensic Pathologist Testifies in Daniel Penny Trial That Jordan Neely Didn't Die of Chokehold\n\nNEW YORK CITY-As defense testimony continued in the trial of former Marine Daniel Penny, forensic pathologist Dr. Satish Chundru was called to the witness stand to provide expert testimony on the cause of Jordan Neely's death on May 1, 2023, on a New York subway.\n\n\"This is not a chokehold death,\" Chundru stated under questioning from criminal defense attorney Steven Raiser.\n\nUsing medical charts and illustrations of the human anatomy and cellphone video taken at the scene of the incident, Chundru set forth his explanation for what could have caused the death of Neely, who witnesses said was menacing passengers on an uptown F train at Manhattan's Second Avenue station on May 1, 2023, before Penny stepped in to restrain him using a chokehold. Penny is on trial on charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide related to Neely's death.\n\nWhile Harris had stressed the vascular compromise and airway compromise that she said caused an asphyxial death, Chundru instead attributed Neely's death to a range of factors, including schizophrenia, the drugs in his system, sickle cell disease, and the chokehold. He stipulated that the last factor could not by itself have been lethal.\n\nThe expert witness criticized Harris's approach to analyzing the possible causes of the fatality, saying that a thorough forensic analysis requires careful consideration of all potential factors.\n\n\"These are very complicated cases, so you want to make sure you get all the information to make a final decision when you kind of see everything,\" Chundru said.\n\n\"You want to gather all the information, wait for all the tests to come back, and then go through the process of elimination.\"\n\nAccording to Chundru, in a healthy human body, red blood cells have a round shape and deliver oxygen to the capillaries before making their way back to larger blood vessels.\n\nIn the case of someone with sickle cells, the same thing happens in the absence of stress, he said. However, at a heightened level of stress, the cells become sick.\n\n\"So now, instead of a round cell, you have a sickle cell. It's like a crescent moon or a banana shape. They don't carry oxygen,\" the pathologist said. \"They start sticking to the blood vessel wall, and they kind of block everything from going forward.\"\n\nIn the case of Neely, the condition was severe enough for his body to have a highly adverse reaction to the stress of Penny's hold, Chundru stated.\n\n\"He had extensive sickling from the brain tissue all the way down to the kidneys and everything in between. The sickling was in all the blood vessels, and so literally, most of them were blocked.\"\n\nChundru described Neely's condition as \"a sickle cell crisis\" in which blood vessels did not deliver oxygen to his tissue cells.\n\nReviewing cell phone footage showing Neely and Penny lying on the subway car floor with Penny's arm around Neely's neck, Chundru disputed prosecution claims that Neely had lost consciousness-a precondition for a chokehold death, according to the definition he had advanced earlier.\n\nChundru said he believes that at a point in the video when prosecutors maintained Neely had passed out, Neely and Penny were, in fact, still struggling.\n\n\"What we notice here is that both of them are very stressed, Mr. Penny is very focused on restraining Mr. Neely, you can see by the facial features of both of them,\" he said.\n\nHe said that, contrary to the claims of Harris and the prosecutors, Neely did not become unconscious for a sustained period of time prior to his death. Hence, it did not meet the definition of a chokehold death.\n\nChundru estimated Neely's death to have occurred four minutes and 30 seconds into the video.\n\n\"He never went unconscious before that, which is what you need if it's a chokehold death,\" he said.\n\nAsked what factors he thought were to blame for Neely's death, Chundru stated, \"The combined effects of sickle cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint, and the synthetic marijuana.\"\n\n\"Doctor, in your opinion, did Mr. Penny choke Mr. Neely to death on May 1, 2023?\" Raiser asked.\n\n\"No,\" Chundru replied.\n\nThe trial resumes on Nov. 22 with further testimony."

      "text": "Daniel Penny Speaks After Acquittal in Subway Case\n\nDaniel Penny has spoken publicly following his acquittal on charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway in May 2023.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News on Dec. 10, Penny said he had put himself in a \"very vulnerable position\" during his encounter on the subway with Neely but felt compelled to act.\n\nPenny, 26, who served four years in the U.S. Marines, stated that while he is \"not a confrontational person,\" Neely was \"threatening to kill people.\"\n\nDays before that decision, New York Supreme Court Judge Maxwell Wiley, who oversaw the trial in Manhattan Criminal Court, dismissed a second-degree manslaughter charge against Penny after the jury deliberated for four days and failed to reach a unanimous verdict.\n\nPenny had pled not guilty to both charges.\n\nLawyers for Penny had argued at trial that their client did not mean to kill Neely and was protecting himself and other people when he placed Neely in a chokehold for roughly six minutes.\n\nThey said that Penny, who did not testify at the trial, restrained the former street performer after the latter launched into an outburst that frightened fellow riders.\n\nNeely, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, fell unconscious after the chokehold and was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. A medical examiner determined that Neely died of \"compression of neck\" but Penny's defense team challenged that finding.\n\nNeely also had synthetic marijuana in his system at the time of his death and had previously been convicted of assaulting people at subway stations.\n\nSupporters of Neely, including his family, contend that Penny went too far in his response and should face serious charges.\n\nThe case sparked national debate and left New Yorkers divided over issues of homelessness and public safety.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News, Penny said he did not \"want any type of attention or praise\" for his actions.\n\nAsked why he placed Neely in a chokehold, the ex-Marine said he would \"never be able to live with myself\" if Neely had been able to do what he was threatening to do to other passengers.\n\nPenny also acknowledged the criticism he has faced following his actions\n\n\"I'll take a million court appearances and people calling me names and people hating me, just to keep one of those people from getting hurt or killed,\" he said.\n\nPenny also criticized city officials, whom he did not identify specifically but described as \"self-serving.\" He said they had refused to acknowledge their role in creating the conditions that led to his encounter with Neely.\n\n\"These are their policies, and I don't mean to get political, I don't really want to make any enemies. ... but these are their policies that have clearly not worked,\" Penny said.\n\n\"Their egos are too big just to admit that they're wrong,\" he added.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office brought the case against Penny, said after the acquittal that prosecutors \"followed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end.\""

      "text": "Closing Arguments Made in Trial of Daniel Penny, Accused in NY Subway Death\n\nNEW YORK CITY-Lawyers in the Daniel Penny trial made their closing arguments on Dec. 2, hoping to sway the jury on whether Penny is guilty of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide for the death of Jordan Neely on May 1, 2023, on a New York subway train.\n\nThe defense relied on testimony from Dr. Satish Chundru, and even portions of testimony from one of the prosecution witnesses, medical examiner Dr. Cynthis Harris, to make its case that Neely died from sickle cell crisis, not from strangulation.\n\nCriminal defense lawyer Steve Raiser repeatedly told the jury that there was no way that Penny could have known that Neely, a total stranger, had any unusual medical condition and that Penny acted to protect other passengers on the uptown F train.\n\nThe defense's characterization of Neely as aggressive and explicitly threatening when he stepped onto the F train that day went uncontested by government lawyers. In fact, Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran openly admitted that Neely's conduct terrified passengers on the train, far surpassing any disturbing experiences they might have had on the subway before.\n\nBut Yoran spent a great deal of time explaining when it is justifiable under New York law to use deadly force and insisted that Penny's actions went far beyond what the law allowed.\n\nChundru had testified under oath that Neely died because, during the stress of the incident, his sickle cell traits escalated into a full-blown sickle cell crisis, which was evident throughout much of his body on postmortem examination.\n\nRaiser presented excerpts from prosecutors' opening arguments on a screen in the courtroom as he spoke to the jury, prompting frequent objections from Yoran, which the judge overruled.\n\n\"In their opening statement, [prosecutors] made it very clear that they were talking about a chokehold death, not sickling that's related to a chokehold, or some kind of gray area in between,\" said Raiser.\n\n\"They have to show a chokehold death that has nothing to do with sickling, that's what that statement says,\" he said.\n\nRaiser contradicted the government's position that while Neely might have had a sickle cell trait, the condition was \"largely benign.\"\n\n\"Well, I have to disagree with that, because when Mr. Neely had a massive sickling crisis, his condition was no longer benign,\" Raiser said.\n\nIt was at this point that Raiser cited Harris's testimony, pointing out that Harris-called to the stand as a prosecution witness-had admitted to him under cross-examination that it was possible that at the 3:09-minute mark of a cellphone video of the incident, Neely may not have been just unconscious but dying from sickle-cell crisis.\n\nHarris \"flat-out admitted\" that the sickling the postmortem examination revealed may have killed Neely, said Raiser.\n\nThis was more than enough to foster reasonable doubt about the government's argument as to the cause of Neely's death, he said.\n\nHe reiterated that Penny had taken actions to protect passengers and had no way of knowing about, or preventing, a medical condition in the man he gripped and held for the police.\n\n\"There is no possible scenario where Danny knew that Mr. Neely was going to enter into a sickle cell crisis and die,\" he said.\n\nHe reminded the jury of portions of Chundru's testimony that stressed the dangerous combination of the powerful intoxicant K2 and a schizophrenic condition acting upon Neely.\n\nIn closing, Raiser reminded the jury that witnesses who had little or nothing to gain from coming to testify in court had praised Penny's actions and said they were grateful for what he did.\n\nBy some accounts, Neely said he did not care if he died. By others, Neely actually encouraged passengers to take his life. And still other accounts said that Neely explicitly threatened to kill people on the train.\n\nRegardless of what Neely said, the law is very clear about where and when the use of deadly force is permissible, Yoran argued.\n\nMaintaining a legal system in which deadly force is excusable only when it is \"absolutely necessary\" is critical, \"so that we can preserve life, even the life of an offender,\" Yoran said.\n\nCiting testimony from Joseph Caballer, who had served with Penny in the Marines, Yoran said that the chokehold is taught in the Marines as a \"nonlethal maneuver\" and that its proper use would not have resulted in a death.\n\n\"The idea is that you very strategically use your arms to press on the veins and arteries on both sides and the front of the neck, to stop blood from going into and out of the brain. The person then loses consciousness after about 15 to 20 seconds, and you let them go immediately,\" she said.\n\nBut Penny kept Neely in a chokehold while prone on the floor for about six minutes, Yoran stated.\n\nIt did not seem to concern Penny that Neely did not have a weapon in hand, she argued. Returning to the definition of justifiable deadly force, Yoran said that one must have a reasonable belief that the individual perceived as dangerous has a weapon and is ready to use it. The theoretical possibility that the person may have a weapon hidden away somewhere falls flat, she said.\n\nNeely did not have any weapons on him, and Penny never claimed to have seen one.\n\n\"And so, even if he had been justified in using deadly physical force when he first took Mr. Neely down, he would no longer be permitted to use deadly physical force to keep Mr. Neely down for the police,\" Yoran said.\n\nThe arguments summarized weeks of hotly contested testimony from both defense and government witnesses. The jury is expected to begin deliberations tomorrow after the prosecution wraps up its closing arguments."

      "text": "Six minutes. That's all it took for two men to meet on the F train in New York City-and for their lives to change forever. It began a little after 2 p.m. on Monday, May 1, 2023. Jordan Neely, a homeless black man who suffered from schizophrenia, began screaming on the F train that he was looking for food. According to witnesses, Neely said he was \" ready to die .\" That he would \" kill a motherfucker .\" The other riders were scared.\n\nOne of the passengers on that train was Daniel Penny, a then-24-year-old former Marine. A white man. Penny put Neely in a hold that lasted for six minutes . Afterward, Neely, 30, was rushed to the hospital and declared dead. Penny went to a police precinct, where his statement kicked off a legal case that's ongoing right now in Manhattan. If he is found guilty of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, he could spend 15 years in prison.\n\nBut the case of Daniel Penny and Jordan Neely isn't just another sad story from a city afflicted with homelessness and crime. It's a Rorschach test of America and our divided views on race. On one side are those who say Penny is a racially motivated murderer, a vigilante who thought he could put his hands on a poor, black man because he was poor and black.\n\nOn the other side are those who believe Penny is a hero who protected his fellow riders when they were faced with an immediate threat at a time when the police and the government have failed to keep the public safe.\n\nOver the past month, I've been covering Penny's trial. It is expected to go to a jury next week. I have heard the cases put forth by both the prosecution and the defense-but I've also watched video evidence screened for the jury. Now, for the first time, we have threaded together video footage from police body cameras and bystander phones to reveal, minute by minute, the scene on the train, the actions of the police, and the real-time reactions of witnesses.\n\nIn collaboration with Free Press video journalists Tanya Lukyanova and Jana Kozlowski, we have structured this compilation to unfold in real time, just as it did on the day Neely died. Some of this footage has appeared on broadcast TV, but most has not been seen before by the public-certainly not in full. You will see the hold Penny used to contain Neely. You will see a passenger tell an officer that Neely scared the \" living daylights out of everybody \" when he boarded the train. You will see paramedics attempt to revive Neely, and what they found in his pockets when they searched his clothes for a weapon.\n\nClick below to watch what really unfolded on May 1, 2023, when Jordan Neely boarded an uptown F train and met Daniel Penny:\n\nOlivia Reingold is a writer for The Free Press.

      "text": "On May 1, 2023, Daniel Penny became a national lightning rod when he placed Jordan Neely, a homeless black man widely described as \"threatening\" by witnesses, into a chokehold on the New York City subway.\n\nNeely was shortly thereafter pronounced dead, and the case quickly became a political Rorschach test , with Penny seen by some as a hero and by others as a racially motivated murderer. Eighteen months later, Penny is on trial for manslaughter. Last Thursday, prosecutors showed the jury video of Penny's initial interrogation by police. It gets to the heart of why this case has captivated America.\n\nA few hours after the incident on the F train, Daniel Penny accompanied police back to their Chinatown headquarters. In footage of his interrogation, obtained by The Free Press, Penny seems to think he's at the police precinct to tell them about the \"lunatic\" who \"started threatening people\" on the train. The conversation starts out in a friendly tone. But as the questioning continues, Penny appears to realize that these aren't just any police officers. And they don't consider him a Good Samaritan, but a criminal suspect.\n\nNo posts"

The majority of people want more Daniel Pennys, not more Jordan Neelys.  At least Kamala waffles pathetically. Most of the left just dives in head first.\n\nVery well done!  Have you offered this to the networks?\n\nWhat if your wife or daughter was on that train?  Its not like people had been getting assaulted on the NYC (and other cities) subway during this time.  If its my wife and daughter on that train, it would be me on trial.  And if I'm on that jury, Penny walks no question.\n\nOh, did you miss the fact that he was\" accosted\" and Goetz was not? So, you're not making the point you intended to :)\n\nYou're a Goetz and Penny supporter. Not surprising. Two people who acted without any assault accosting taking place\n\n\"This is no longer fun...\" Yes, getting owned usually isn't, but that is a very self-aggrandizing way of bowing out. ;)\n\nIf Daniel Penny was black, what would have happened?  He would have probably been declared a hero.  The police would have taken statements and that would have been the end of it.\n\nToo bad we don't have cell phone video of the situation prior to Penney's actions.\n\nAnother great reason to subscribe to The Free Press.  Phenomenal reporting.\n\nLocked in a subway car with a man who is ready to die or go to jail -- clearly wanting to do harm.  How scary that must have been!\n\nI wonder what people would think if Neely was white?\n\nAre you kidding? A crazed white man is just as dangerous as a crazed black man. Enough of the race BS.\n\nMy point is -- would it have been news worthy or picked up by AOC if Neely was white?  I agree any crazed criminal of any race or culture is scary but what the press and advocates focus on these days is the color of one's skin and what will get more groups outraged.\n\nI think I heard the police arrive and actually ask who was black or white....\n\nTo help clarify this question: \"I wonder what people would think of Penny's actions, had Neely been white?\"\n\nJust flat out , excellent reporting.\n\nIsn't it possible to detain someone, especially with 3+ strong men in the train car, without having them in a choke hold? I don't understand why a choke hold is always used in these situations when they so often lead to death.\n\nI wondered that too. Why didn't the other people help?\n\nControl the head and you control the body (usually).\n\n1) yes it is possible, 2) it is more difficult than you can guess, and 3) the correct application of a carotid restraint does not \"choke.\" Without comment on whether Perry appropriately reacted or perceived a loss of consciousness, I'm not aware of the need to collect the dead bodies of thousands of people each year who are on the receiving end of such restraints every year in gym, military, and police academy settings.\n\nBecause none of the other men did anything, and a choke hold was the only way for a single person to restrain a dangerous man intent on doing harm. They should give Daniel Penny a meddle.\n\nmedal.\n\nAs I said before, people who don't ride urban mass transportation don't have the empathy required to comment intelligently on this topic. There have been several murders in the past year alone on NYC trains and platforms, but even that's not enough to understand what it's like to be trapped in a confined space and be within one second of losing your life. The comments below prove it.\n\nThe deceased shouted to everyone that he didn't care what happened to him. I take him at his word. He said he didn't care if he went to prison. I take him at his word. He threatened passengers. I take him at his word. That's not \"acting erratically.\" One thing I do know, if he had murdered someone on that train, T-1000 would see it on the news and not give it a second thought.\n\nLegally, Neely's words constitute assault.\n\nNah. You don't support both.\n\nThe instructions are fascinating. Really. I think it is \"reasonable\" for me to jump/choke out anyone acting erratically on a subway train."

      "text": "It's Tuesday, December 10. This is The Front Page , your daily window into the world of The Free Press -and our take on the world at large. Coming up: Assad's fall exposes Washington's delusions, Norway's crippling assault on free enterprise, the disaster that is \"multilevel classrooms,\" and more.\n\nBut first: Daniel Penny walked out of court a free man. But why was he ever prosecuted?\n\nIt's been 19 months since Daniel Penny entered a New York City subway car as a college student and exited as a homicide suspect. But yesterday, a Manhattan jury acquitted him.\n\nThe Free Press has been covering the story since the very beginning. Our video team compiled a detailed play-by-play of exactly what happened between Penny and Jordan Neely on that fateful day on the F train. Olivia Reingold has reported from Penny's hometown , on the police's initial interrogation , and from the courtroom throughout his trial .\n\nOlivia was in the courtroom when the verdict was announced. The words \" not guilty ,\" she says, were followed by applause from Penny's sympathizers. Penny walked out with a \"smile on his face-the look of relief,\" Olivia notes . Meanwhile, a black woman shouted \"racist motherfucker\" and was escorted out of the courtroom by a police officer. Outside the court just after the verdict , Hawk Newsome, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter Greater New York, said: \"We need some black vigilantes. People wanna jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud? How about we do the same?\"\n\nIt's a good thing that justice was delivered to Daniel Penny. But a just verdict does not erase this cynical, wrongheaded, and unwarranted prosecution.\n\nIn an editorial this morning, we argue that the case should never have gone to trial, and we take a close look at the man who brought it, Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nBragg's approach to enforcing the law-or rather, not enforcing it-has been a disaster, as has been true of every city that voted in a so-called progressive prosecutor. As of November 2024, according to the New York Post , there were 27,122 reported felonies, up 16.9 percent from before Bragg took office. Meanwhile, rape has jumped 7.4 percent across Manhattan, robbery 8.9 percent, felony assault 16.8 percent, and grand larceny 29.8 percent. These are crimes that overwhelmingly affect the poorest New Yorkers.\n\nThe DA's decision to prosecute Daniel Penny was no anomaly. Bragg's tenure has been marked by priorities that don't serve the public-like the decision to go after Trump on spurious charges of falsifying business records-and a nonchalant attitude toward actual criminals. This has had a predictable outcome: rising crime rates and an enormous amount of cynicism among New Yorkers.\n\n\"Next year, the Manhattan DA will be up for reelection, with the Democratic primary in June. He deserves a serious challenger,\" we argue. \"So does New York.\"\n\nRead our editorial, \" Daniel Penny's Innocence-and the Shame of Alvin Bragg .\"\n\nAssad's Fall Has Humiliated Iran-and Washington\n\nOn Sunday, Joe Biden tried to take credit for the recent dramatic events in the Middle East. Assad's biggest backers-Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia-\"are far weaker today than they were when I took office,\" he argued.\n\n\"Try not to laugh,\" writes Eli Lake in his column today. \"Syria has toppled its tyrant in spite of the Biden administration, not because of it.\" And the fall of Assad, Eli says, is only the latest instance of foreign policy conventional wisdom in Washington being exploded by events.\n\nRead Eli Lake on what really toppled Assad-and why it has nothing to do with the Biden administration.\n\nWhy I Left Norway\n\nWhy are so many entrepreneurs fleeing Norway? The simple answer: They are being taxed on money they don't have.\n\nToday in The Free Press , Fredrik Haga, the co-founder of a successful Norwegian company, Dune, tells the story of trying to build it in his native land, but ultimately having to leave Norway because of its \"unrealized gains tax.\" Unable to pay the tax, Haga left friends and family behind for Switzerland.\n\nIn one way Haga was lucky. He got out before the government imposed an onerous \"exit tax\" on entrepreneurs who try to take their companies elsewhere. \"After shooting itself in one foot, the government is now aiming a bazooka at the other one,\" warns Haga. Read his piece on the self-defeating logic of \"tax the rich\" ideology.\n\nMy School Experimented with 'Education Equity.' It Failed.\n\nIn the fall of 2021, Newton public schools in Newton, Massachusetts, introduced \"multilevel classrooms\"-combining students of all abilities in one class with a single teacher. The initiative was designed to help struggling students and in particular black, Latino, and low-income students, who were disproportionately represented in lower-level classes.\n\nSo, how did it turn out? Not well. Ryan Normandin , the Faculty Council chair at a Newton high school, writes that teachers and students alike view the experiment as a failure.\n\n\"Students-at all levels of performance, but especially our students who need the most support and for whom this model was intended to help most-aren't having their needs met,\" he explains. One teacher recounted finding a colleague crying in the closet over the multilevel approach. \"The Faculty Council met with department heads all the way up to the superintendent, and what we found was shocking,\" writes Normandin.\n\nRead his full account of the failed experiment.\n\nAs some of you noticed, there was a faulty link in our plug for our upcoming live event about Jerusalem in yesterday's Front Page . Our apologies. It's now fixed! And this is going to be a fantastic conversation.\n\nTo reserve tickets to the event with Simon Sebag Montefiore and Bari on Wednesday, January 22, at the Streicker Center in New York City, click again here . Get them now before we sell out!\n\nWho is Abu Mohammad al-Jolani? Or, to use his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa-the Syrian rebel who led the insurgency that toppled the Assad regime . On the one hand, he has been designated a terrorist by the U.S. government, has links to al-Qaeda stretching back to 2003, and has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. But on the other hand, he defied ISIS and broke with al-Qaeda in 2016. And he told PBS in 2021 that his insurgent group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, doesn't want to fight with the West and intends to tolerate religious minorities . We'll see soon enough.\n\nPolice identified a top suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson as an Ivy-educated former data engineer named Luigi Mangione. Authorities nabbed 26-year-old Mangione yesterday at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, with a ghost gun and a silencer as well as a handwritten manifesto and four fake IDs. Mangione was allegedly upset with the healthcare industry because of its treatment of his sick relative, according to the New York Post . Meanwhile, in January, he posted a book review of the Unabomber's manifesto on a now-private Goodreads account, praising him as a \"political revolutionary.\"\n\nOn Sunday, South Korean prosecutors announced they would investigate the country's president, Yoon Suk Yeol, for possible treason and abuse of power . The probe comes after Yoon's use of martial law last week, which he declared after accusing the opposition liberal Democratic Party of attempting \"to overthrow the free democracy.\" Lawmakers voted unanimously against the measure, which was revoked in a matter of hours. On Saturday the disgraced leader survived an impeachment effort after his party boycotted the vote. The country's justice department has banned him from leaving the country while the investigation is ongoing.\n\nJapan's fertility rate reached a record low last year, at 1.2 births per woman. This week, in an effort to encourage parents to have more children, Tokyo announced that, starting in April, it will institute a four-day workweek for city employees. \"We'll keep reviewing our work styles flexibly so that nobody has to give up their careers due to life events such as childbirth and childcare,\" said Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike. In a previous attempt at boosting procreation, Tokyo launched a state-sponsored dating app .\n\nJoe Biden has 40 days left as president, and he's keeping a very low profile with the press, as Politico has noticed . Over a period of two weeks following Trump's victory, Biden spoke a total of seven words to the media. (Alas, Politico doesn't report what those seven words were.) One former White House official described Biden's hands-off approach as \"cavalier and selfish.\" Another senior Democrat told Politico \"There is no leadership coming from the White House. There is a total vacuum.\" In Washington, he continued, \"It feels like Trump is president already.\"\n\nTaylor Swift's economic powerhouse of a tour came to a close on Sunday in Vancouver. Her Eras Tour lasted almost two years and is estimated to have made over $2 billion, making it (of course) the highest grossing tour of all time. The three-hour-long, culturally defining show was seen by over 10 million Swifties in 21 different countries. Read Agnes Callard 's piece \" A Terrorist Plot Canceled the Show. But We Swifties Found Each Other on Cornelia Street \" for a Free Press dispatch from Swift's tour.\n\nMadeleine Kearns is an associate editor at The Free Press. Read her recent piece \" Should a Government Help People Die? ,\" and follow her on X @madeleinekearns .\n\nthe \"Free Press\" seems to be pretty much Fox News lite.

      "text": "\"You feel like a man for killing a black man?\"\n\nThose words were hurled from the back of a courtroom earlier this month at Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old former Marine charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the killing of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man and sometime street performer whose tragic death on the F train on May 1, 2023, was captured on video.\n\nPenny is white. Neely was black.\n\nTo Rachel Cyprien, the woman who did the shouting as Penny exited the courtroom, there are no two ways of looking at what happened on the subway that day, when Penny placed Neely, widely described as \" erratic \" and \" threatening \" by fellow passengers, into a fatal choke hold. It is simply \"another lynching of a black man.\"\n\n\"He's a white man, a Marine, a trained killer who killed a black man, a homeless man, and no one cared,\" said Cyprien, a real estate broker who wouldn't state her age but kept a metal cane in the crook of her elbow.\n\nTo her-and many others-Penny is a villain, while Neely, a former Michael Jackson impersonator who grew up in and out of New York homeless shelters , could've used \"the smallest gesture of humanity,\" in the words of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-rather than Penny's choke hold. In this, Cyprien was echoing a consensus that quickly emerged after the video of the incident went viral: that this was \"another Black man publicly executed,\" as then-Rep. Jamaal Bowman put it on X .\n\nWithin days, protesters were taking over subway stations, disrupting rush-hour traffic with chants like \"homeless lives matter.\" In the following weeks dozens were arrested , with police even seizing an unlit Molotov cocktail from a protester. At a funeral service in Harlem, Reverend Al Sharpton laid Neely to rest by remarking that Good Samaritans help the homeless, not \"choke them out.\"\n\nWhether you saw the former Marine as a \"Good Samaritan,\" in the words of Florida governor Ron DeSantis, or his actions as a \"lynching,\" according to Julia Salazar , a New York state senator, seemed to depend more on preconceived assumptions about public order, self-defense, and the role of racism in American life than on the actual known facts of the case.\n\nThe fact, for example, that Neely suffered from severe untreated mental illness, bound up with a history of violence and drug abuse. The fact that he had been arrested more than forty times, most recently for punching a 67-year-old woman in a subway station. The fact that a judge cut his prison sentence short to enroll him in a minimum of fifteen months in a treatment program, which he walked away from after less than two weeks. The fact that no attempt was made to locate him, but there was an open warrant for his arrest when his increasingly erratic behavior on the F train began to alarm passengers, including Penny, who put him in the choke hold that ultimately killed him. And the fact that witnesses noted that two other men helped hold him down that day, including a man of color, as Neely tossed garbage and screamed that he was \" ready to die \" or \" go to jail \" because he was tired of being hungry.\n\nDaniel Penny is not being tried for a hate crime-no evidence has yet emerged that shows he was motivated by racism that day. But those facts have done little to puncture the narrative about white supremacy that followed him into court on October 3, his first major court appearance before his trial. That trial begins Monday. He faces up to twenty years in prison for what happened on that spring afternoon, in which he entered the subway at Second Avenue as a student and left at Broadway/Lafayette as a homicide suspect.\n\nOn the thirteenth floor of New York City's criminal court, Penny sat sandwiched between his lawyers, two athletic-looking men from Long Island, opposite a duo of female prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's office. Their purpose that day: to have a judge decide on the admissibility of footage that has been kept under wraps since the incident. The footage captured at least a half-hour of video from police body cameras, pulled from multiple officers on the scene, and Penny's full interrogation at the local police precinct that followed.\n\nThe prosecution wants this evidence admitted because they believe it is damning-especially when Penny tells an officer \"I just put him out,\" referring to Neely. The DA argues that Penny recklessly endangered Neely by choking him for six minutes.\n\n\"It doesn't matter that other witnesses said that this person that was taken out had scared people before that,\" Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran told the judge. \"That has absolutely no relevance to whether the defendant is responsible ultimately.\"\n\nThomas Kenniff, one of Penny's defense lawyers, argued that all of the witnesses described Neely as the \"initial aggressor, terrifying, unhinged, you know, threatening life and limb of the other passengers on board.\" At the same time, witnesses described Penny's actions as \"very restrained.\"\n\nKenniff added: \"It wasn't really a choke hold. He was just containing him.\"\n\nThe New York Times boiled the full day of testimony, in which five NYPD officers testified about the incident, into a story titled \" Penny Minimized Duration of Chokehold During Questioning, Video Shows ,\" pointing out the alleged inconsistencies between Penny's initial descriptions of the event and video evidence captured by police. To Gothamist , a local NPR-affiliated publication, the takeaway was that Penny \"told police at the time that he had put the man 'in a choke.' \" Even the New York Post focused on Penny's statement \"I just put him out\" in what it called \"dramatic video\" from the day of the incident.\n\nAlmost all of the reports left out that after the alleged choke hold, an officer administered a dose of the opioid antidote Narcan to Neely-which could point to the victim's history of drug abuse. The same officer who administered the Narcan, Sergeant Carl Johnson, later called Penny a \"Good Samaritan\" in his summary of the crime. And in a 14-minute video compilation played by the defense, one woman was shown standing in shock on the subway platform, telling an officer that Penny \"literally saved the train.\"\n\nWhen we broke for lunch, I caught Rachel Cyprien, the black realtor who'd taken the day off to watch the hearing, outside the courthouse to ask if any of those revelations-the Narcan, the witness statements describing Neely as \"threatening,\" and the favorable descriptions of Penny in the police write-ups-changed anything for her.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"This is all bullshit. This is just a show because they're going to let him off.\"\n\nThen, she added, \"This is another George Floyd.\"\n\nLess than 24 hours later, the judge released his decision : The footage in question is fair game. In the trial, which starts with jury selection on Monday, the 12 jurors will get to see for themselves what transpired that fateful day.\n\nOn May 1, 2023, as progressive commentators and members of the Squad raced to portray Penny as a racially motivated murderer, the people of his hometown, West Islip, a hamlet of Long Island, were left wondering how it was that people could get the man they knew so wrong.\n\nA few weeks after Neely died, I spent four days in West Islip to ask Penny's family, friends, and neighbors: What kind of man is he, really?\n\nI encountered Stacey Volke outside the local elementary school. When I asked her if she knew Penny, she grimaced like she was holding back tears. Or anger.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"And he's one of the best boys you'll ever meet-a great kid from a great family.\"\n\nShe said Daniel is the son of her childhood friend Stephen Penny, who grew up \"four to five houses down\" from her on a tree-lined drive just steps away from the bay. It's the kind of street where residents fly American flags out front, and cars have bumper stickers bearing the Marine Corps motto Semper Fi . Now, the average house on the block is worth more than a million dollars, but Penny told the New York Post -in one of his two media interviews to date-that the three-bedroom, three-bath house he grew up in dates back generations.\n\n\"My grandmother was raised there,\" he said of the tan cottage, first purchased by his great-grandfather in the 1960s. \"And then my father and his brothers were raised there. And then me and my sisters were able to grow up there.\"\n\n\"We wouldn't have been able to live that lifestyle on the water if it wasn't for my family,\" said Penny, who grew up surfing and playing lacrosse.\n\nLike most people in West Islip, an area that Donald Trump won by a landslide in the last two presidential elections, Volke was on guard, feeling that the media had tarnished the reputation of her friend's son. She added that she planned to donate to the defense fund started by Penny's lawyers, which at the time had already surpassed $2 million, because \"just the legal fees alone could destroy them.\"\n\n\"They say because he's military trained he should've known what he's doing,\" she said of the criminal charges Penny is facing. But, she added, \"Adrenaline can get the best of anyone.\"\n\nAnd \"there were two others\" who held Neely down on the train that day, she continued. \"Why aren't they being tried?\"\n\nThe next day I met a waitress, wearing a gold cross around her neck, working a weekend lunch shift at a local diner. She turned out to be a former classmate of \"Danny,\" as most locals refer to Penny.\n\nI asked her what she knew about the way Penny grew up. Was he imbued with \" white privilege ,\" as his critics claimed?\n\n\"I always just thought of him as middle class,\" said the waitress, who declined to give her name. \"Nothing fancy. Just regular.\"\n\n\"He's not capable of doing anything terrible and the subways in the city-those are terrible,\" she added. \"There's always a gray area.\"\n\nSuffolk County, where West Islip is located, is one of the largest veteran communities in the country. The fire station has a 9/11 memorial out front, with the names of firefighters carved in stone-an ode to the nearly 100 town residents , including firefighters and law enforcement officers, who died in the attacks.\n\nWhen he was just shy of 19, Penny enlisted in the Marines. He never saw combat but got to travel, serving two years in a unit that was deployed in Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Jordan, Greece, and Spain.\n\nThen, in June 2021, he \"separated from service,\" a Marine Corps representative told The Free Press , declining to specify if that qualified as an honorable discharge. In 2022, he moved to New York City in search of a new path. Last winter, he enrolled in an architecture program at a local Brooklyn college, working two jobs on top of his classwork.\n\nThen on May 1, 2023, he met Jordan Neely.\n\nEver since then, Penny has become a Rorschach test: a mirror that reflects not what you think of Daniel Penny but what you think of white men, black men, racism, policing, mental illness, and the thing that we call \"the system.\" In the days after the killing, that's what Jordan Neely's Aunt Carolyn wanted to talk about. \"The whole system just failed him. He fell through the cracks of the system,\" she told the New York Post .\n\nPenny has been virtually silent since the day his life changed forever. Though The Free Press asked for an interview at least a half-dozen times, all requests were denied. At the hearing I attended, he didn't say a word.\n\nWhen I visited West Islip last spring looking for Penny, a lifeguard told me to try Gilgo Beach, saying \"I think that's where he normally surfs.\" Another lifeguard told me to check out Democrat Point, a hard-to-reach section of a nearby state park.\n\nI never saw him. But later, on a whim, I checked the blog of one of his old Marine buddies. There Penny was, snapped in a photo, taken on the shores of a Long Island beach.\n\nBy then, Penny had been charged with the crime that had divided America. But at that moment he seemed carefree. Shrouded in a dark hoodie, baseball cap, and sunglasses, he is kneeling next to a pickup truck in the photo. It's a clear day, and he is posing next to a sticker on the truck's bumper that reads: Justice for Daniel Penny.\n\nLooking at the camera, Penny is grinning as he flashes a thumbs-up.\n\nOlivia Reingold is a writer for The Free Press.

The rush to judgement by the 'woke' crowd was, and is, predictable.  Penny is being pilloried not for what he did, but for who he is, as if race/color is the only thing that matters.

      "text": "It's Monday, October 21, and this is The Front Page , your daily window into the world of The Free Press -and our take on the world at large. Coming up: Hezbollah hits Bibi's house while the U.S. investigates its leak of Israeli war plans; Trump says China knows he's \"fucking crazy\"; and much more. But first, Olivia Reingold and Kat Rosenfield weigh in on the trial of Daniel Penny.\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old former Marine, met Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man, on a New York subway car. When Neely began frightening passengers, Penny tried restraining him by placing him in a choke hold. Neely died minutes later.\n\nPenny is white; Neely was black. Immediately, those facts were the only ones that seemed to matter in the court of public opinion.\n\nSome people saw the Marine as a \"Good Samaritan,\" as Florida governor Ron DeSantis put it. Others, like Julia Salazar , a New York state senator, equated his actions to a \"lynching.\" Opinions seemed to depend more on preconceived assumptions about American life than on what actually happened on the F train that day.\n\nToday, Daniel Penny's trial begins in a courtroom in New York City. He has been charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison.\n\nWe've been following the Penny case from the outset .\n\nWeeks after Neely's death, Olivia Reingold visited Penny's hometown in West Islip, Long Island, to ask those who've known him longest what he's really like. And a few weeks ago, Olivia attended an important pretrial hearing in which she heard the prosecutors present their case against him.\n\nThe case, Olivia writes, has become \"a mirror that reflects not what you think of Daniel Penny but what you think of white men, black men, racism, policing, mental illness, and the thing that we call the system.\"\n\nRead Olivia Reingold on \" The Trials of Daniel Penny .\"\n\nOur columnist Kat Rosenfield sees the Daniel Penny episode as \"traceable to 2020, the year that cities across America were swept by progress that looked an awful lot like chaos .\"\n\nThe coronavirus disrupted New York's chronically understaffed mental health services, and those \"who fell through the cracks all seemed to land\" in the subway. Then came the summer of \" fiery but mostly peaceful \" protests, and of liberal commentators defending lawlessness in the name of social justice.\n\n\"When the social fabric of the city begins to unravel, it frays underground first,\" Kat writes. Sure enough, between March 2020 and April 2023, no fewer than 27 people were murdered on the subway-shot, stabbed, or shoved in front of an oncoming train. Ten people were injured in the spring of 2022 when a gunman opened fire on a northbound N train in Brooklyn. The same month, a screaming man grabbed a woman by the hair and dragged her around the subway car; she mouthed help me as fellow passengers looked on in horror. The clip went viral.\n\nAnd Daniel Penny? \"One side sees racism everywhere; the other, the insidious influence of wokism. But on this one point, they agree: The system is broken, our faith in it misplaced,\" writes Kat.\n\nRead Kat Rosenfield on \" Daniel Penny and New York's Vigilantes .\"\n\nIs the Leak by U.S. Intelligence Meant to Sabotage Israel?\n\nThings move fast when it comes to Israel news. Israelis barely had time to celebrate the death of Yahya Sinwar when, over the weekend, two stories broke: first, the leak of highly classified documents, following quickly on the heels of a Hezbollah drone strike on Benjamin Netanyahu's private home.\n\nIn normal times, the attempted assassination would make headlines for weeks, but the leak is arguably more dangerous, considering the likely possibility it was done by Americans. Jay Solomon has the story:\n\nTwo factors are weighing on Israeli military planners as they decide how and when to strike Iran in retaliation for its recent missile attacks: the potential cost of inaction against Tehran and the political pressures from Washington to show restraint just weeks ahead of the U.S. presidential election. These two considerations now appear in conflict with one another.\n\nOn Saturday, Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia, launched an explosive drone from Lebanon and struck Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private home in the coastal city of Caesarea. The apparent assassination attempt was just the latest Iranian and Hezbollah aggression that Israeli officials have vowed to avenge. Netanyahu released a statement, saying that Iran had made a \" bitter mistake .\"\n\nThe drone attack coincided with a leak in recent days of highly classified U.S. intelligence documents concerning Israel's potential attack plans on Iran, according to people who've seen the files. These documents were prepared by two U.S. branches of the intelligence community-the National Security Agency and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency-and posted on the Telegram social media platform. One person who's seen the documents said they point to a likely breach of operational security between Washington and Jerusalem, and could force the Israel Defense Forces to either reassess its plans for striking Iran or delay them.\n\nThe Biden administration's Middle East policy has already been rocked by the suspension last year of Robert Malley, the State Department's special envoy to Iran. The FBI is currently investigating whether the diplomat illegally downloaded classified information onto his personal devices, which may have been accessed by the Iranians through a hack. Administration officials were alarmed last summer when they detected sensitive U.S. documents appearing in Iranian state media, including some of Malley's own.\n\nCongressional investigators told me earlier this year that they're also trying to learn if Malley may have shared some of his documents with a network of academics-some of them his former colleagues-who've kept close ties to the Iranian government through a Tehran-backed program called the Iran Experts Initiative .\n\nIsraeli officials have told The Free Press in recent weeks that they're concerned that elements inside the U.S. national security establishment could use leaks to try and limit the Jewish state's range of actions against Iran. President Joe Biden has already stated that he's against Israel hitting Iran's nuclear facilities. And the latest leak could cause Netanyahu's government to decide to share even less of its military planning-a major step given the implications for the U.S. of any Israeli attack on Iran.\n\nCurrent and former Israeli officials have told me that they view the U.S. presidential election and the ensuing political transition in Washington as a potential window to move ahead with its strike plans on Iran. Part of the reason, they say, is that they're unsure of what Vice President Kamala Harris's position will be if she wins in November. She's made some statements on the campaign trail criticizing Israel's ongoing war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas-also an Iranian proxy-in the Gaza Strip. The Democrat Party presidential candidate again called for a ceasefire in Gaza on Saturday.\n\nWith just 15 days to go until the election, national polls show Donald Trump leading Kamala Harris. And Trump has also crept past Harris in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Georgia, three swing states Joe Biden won in 2020. Harris may be on track to win the popular vote , but the Electoral College bias favors Republicans by roughly two percentage points. So says Nate Silver , who adds, \"In an era of intense partisanship and close elections, this is inherently difficult for Democrats to overcome.\"\n\nRelated: Donald Trump is more popular at this point in his campaign than he was at the same stage in either of his previous runs for office. As of October 17, Trump had an approval rating of negative 9 points. True, that means more Americans disapprove of him than approve of him. But that's better than his approval rating in October 2020 when it was negative 12 points, and it's much better than his negative 27 rating when he actually won the presidency. For what it's worth, Kamala Harris's approval rating is negative 1.\n\nMore than half of Americans feel worse off today than they did four years ago, a new Gallup poll shows. The survey's response most resembles that of the 1992 election year, when Bill Clinton beat incumbent George H.W. Bush.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board asked Donald Trump if he would use military force against a blockade on Taiwan. The former president said he \"wouldn't have to\" because China's president Xi Jinping \"respects me and he knows I'm fucking crazy.\" Trump spoke similarly of Vladimir Putin, with whom he said he has \"a great relationship,\" but who he claims to have warned that if Russia went into Ukraine, \"I'm going to hit you right in the middle of fricking Moscow.\" Trump added, \"You're going to be hit so hard, and I'm going to take those fucking domes right off your head.\" It's rare for the \"good cop, bad cop\" routine to be played by the same person.\n\nEvery day between now and the election, tech billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk will give $1 million to a randomly chosen voter who signs his super PAC petition \"pledging to uphold the rights to free speech and to bear arms.\" The first lucky winner collected his check on Saturday at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Josh Shapiro, the Keystone State's Democratic governor, questions whether the Musk giveaway is legal, saying on Meet the Press that it \"raises serious questions that folks may want to take a look at.\"\n\nIs The New York Times getting religion on DEI? First came a lengthy investigation last week by star reporter Nicholas Confessore into the DEI practices at the University of Michigan. It is withering in its description of Michigan's powerful, massive-and largely pointless-DEI bureaucracy and how it's done far more harm than good. Then, on Sunday, David French devoted his op-ed column to a thoughtful assessment of why university DEI programs are so closed-minded. \"In my experience, the more ideologically. . . pure an institution becomes, the more wrong it is likely to be,\" he writes. To which we can only say: Welcome aboard, New York Times !\n\nNext month, New Yorkers will vote on Proposition 1 . The amendment purports to be about enshrining abortion rights into the state constitution, which is odd given that New York's abortion laws are already among the most permissive in the country. In reality, Democrats are using a popular issue \"as a vehicle\" for a radical agenda, warns Maud Maron in Tablet . The law would add anti-discrimination provisions related to \"age\" and \"gender identity\" to the state constitution, which \"should set off alarm bells with parents\" as it can be used to transition children's gender without parental consent.\n\nNorth Korea has sent 1,500 troops to eastern Russia for training ahead of a likely deployment in Ukraine, South Korea's spy agency reported on Friday. On Thursday, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky said his government has evidence that 10,000 North Korean troops are preparing to fight against Ukraine.\n\nIn better news: Data from the CDC shows drug overdose deaths fell 12.7 percent between May 2023 and 2024 to 98,820. (It marks the first time in three years the yearly estimate has fallen below 100,000.) Experts aren't sure what's behind the sudden improvement. \"I wish I knew so I could bottle it,\" an emergency physician told NBC News.\n\nWriters at Nature magazine have recommended the global science community move away from \"region-specific seasonal markers\" like summer and winter, after they received invites \"to events that speak of fall or autumn\" despite being based in the Southern Hemisphere, which is currently experiencing spring. They write: \"It leaves us wondering: are we invited at all into this season different from our own?\" Which leaves us wondering: Is this what scientists actually think about these days?\n\nWatch: The Brave Youth Who Took Hezbollah to Court\n\nPreviously on Hezbollah's Hostages , our weekly animated series featuring brave opponents of the terror group, we introduced you to a Hezbollah fighter turned voice of resistance , victims of the group's sex trafficking and drug trade operations , and an Arab man who risked assassination to advocate peace with Israel. Last week, we took you inside the group's shadow capital , one of the most terrifying suburbs in the world.\n\nMadeleine Kearns is an associate editor for The Free Press. Follow her on X @madeleinekearns .\n\nTo support The Free Press, become a paid subscriber today:\n\nAnd if you're enjoying The Front Page, consider forwarding it to someone else you think might like it.\n\nI'm not in NY City nor have I ridden one of its subways in a long time. I am in neighboring N. Jersey and glance at the two City tabloids every day - Post & Daily News.  That's where several times a week at the time of Neely's death we saw stories of assaults, stabbings, people being pushed onto the tracks, shootings, rapes etc.   Subway crime had to be REALLY bad for Gov. Huchul to send in the National Guard to police the subways. I would want to hear from the two individuals who both helped hold down Neely. If they speak favorably on Penny's behalf, it would be NOT GUILTY from me.\n\n\"Harris may be on track to win the popular vote, but the Electoral College bias favors Republicans...\"\n\nWhat?  So running up the score in California and New York is completely unbiased.  The EC is fundamental to our constitution designed to prevent the tyranny of the majority.  WO it Presidential candidates would only campaign in 4-6 states (27-35% of the population).\n\nNo posts"

Other subway riders at the scene reported feeling terrorized as Neely said he was \"ready to die.\" There were also legitimate questions about whether the chokehold Penny held him in actually killed him. When the police questioned Penny, he said that his only intent had been to protect the others in the subway car that morning.\n\nYet Bragg threw the book at Penny, charging him with both manslaughter in the second degree, which carries a potential 15-year prison sentence, and criminally negligent homicide, which has a four-year maximum sentence. On Friday, after the jury deadlocked on the manslaughter charge, Bragg's office conspired with the judge to drop it and have the jury focus on the lesser charge instead. Not only was this an unethical gaming of the system, it completely backfired when, after deliberating for less than an hour on Monday morning, the jury came back with its \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nNo posts"

Penny's defense argued that he had done so as to protect bystanders and subdue Neely until police could arrive. They also had argued that it was unclear whether Penny's chokehold was indeed the cause of Neely's death. Prosecutors did not dispute that Neely's behavior was threatening to others on the train, and that Neely was high on synthetic cannabinoids.\n\nPenny originally faced charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The manslaughter charge was dropped by the prosecution on Friday after jurors could not come to a unanimous verdict on it.\n\nThe prosecution attempted to make race a salient factor in the trial, with the prosecutor, Dafna Yoran, referring to Penny as \"the white man\" and \"murderer\" throughout the trial. Yoran is also known as a proponent of \"Restorative Justice,\" having earlier reduced the charges against a man caught on camera killing an elderly college professor from felony murder to manslaughter.\n\nLast Wednesday, Neely's father, Andre Zachary, also launched a lawsuit against Penny, which was described as a distraction by Penny's lawyers. \"We will not be distracted by this attempt to attack Danny while he is under such tremendous stress,\" defense attorney Steve Raiser stated on Thursday.\n\nMason is a contributor at The American Conservative and a senior editor at the American Postliberal .\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "State of the Union: Alvin Bragg is reportedly charging Daniel Penny with two felony counts.\n\nDaniel Penny was indicted last week in New York for his involvement in the death of Jordan Neely. The indictment hasn't been unsealed, but the New York Post reports that New York County prosecutor Alvin Bragg filed second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges against Penny, who will reportedly be arraigned later this month in Manhattan Superior Court.\n\nSecond-degree manslaughter carries a more substantial sentence in New York than criminally negligent homicide. Second-degree manslaughter, which occurs when a person \"recklessly causes the death of another person,\" is a Class C felony, and carries a 15-year maximum sentence. Under New York law, a person acts \"recklessly\" when he is aware that his conduct poses \"a substantial and unjustifiable risk\" of causing a proscribed result (in this case, another person's death), and that his taking the risk \"constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.\"\n\nCriminally negligent homicide, by contrast, is a Class E felony, and carries a 4-year maximum sentence. It is defined as causing another person's death \"with criminal negligence,\" that is, when the person who caused another's death \"fail[ed] to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk\" that their conduct would do so.\n\nThe two charges differ only in their assessment of the offender's mental state at the time he committed the crime. Second-degree manslaughter applies to an offender who is aware of his conduct's recklessness, while criminally negligent homicide applies to an offender who is culpably ignorant of the same.\n\nNeither charge should apply in Penny's case because, in restraining a mentally ill man with multiple felony convictions who made death threats against other passengers, the risk he took was neither \"unjustifiable\" nor \"a gross deviation from the standard of conduct a reasonable person would observe\" if confronted with the same situation. That most \"reasonable people\" these days would decline to intervene says more about the average person's timidity than Penny's criminal liability.\n\nWhy did Alvin Bragg reportedly include both charges on the indictment? Former New York prosecutor Andrew McCarthy suspects Bragg is trying to induce a jury to settle on criminally negligent homicide as a compromise verdict:\n\nI suspect that Bragg is engaged in strategic charging here. In light of Neely's menacing behavior on the subway car before Penny intervened, the prosecutor grasps that a jury could easily conclude that Penny was justifiably acting in self-defense (which legally extends to the defense of other people as well). If Bragg had charged just one count, the issue would come down to \"guilty or not guilty?\" - and the jury could find that not guilty was the fairer result.\n\nIf Penny wants to avoid creating the incentive for a compromise verdict, he could seek to strike the criminally negligent homicide charge by arguing it is being applied to the same underlying conduct as the manslaughter charge. If he does that, though, he'd risk setting himself up for north of a decade in prison if the jury feels the need to convict:\n\nFor his part, then, Penny faces a tough choice. He could argue that the negligence count is just a subset of the recklessness count - i.e., that Bragg has taken what is really one offense and multiplied it into two to increase the chances of getting a conviction. But the remedy for that would be to eliminate the less-serious negligence charge - meaning, if he weren't acquitted, he'd be looking at a harsher sentence.\n\nOnce again, apparently, New York is facing Daniel Penny with an impossible decision.\n\nJohn Hirschauer was assistant editor of The American Conservative .

      "text": "The Penny verdict marks the end of an era.\n\nDaniel Penny was acquitted Monday of the charge of the criminally negligent homicide of Jordan Neely after a New York jury was unable to come to an agreement on the more severe charge of manslaughter. The trial itself was a farce, a case that under normal circumstances would never have been brought. Neely, a mentally-ill criminal and drug addict with more than 40 arrests to his name, entered a car on the Manhattan F train and threatened the passengers, screaming that he was going to kill someone and that he was ready to go to prison for life. When the danger that Neely posed to the passengers became apparent, Penny, a former U.S. marine, stepped in and restrained him with a chokehold, with two other passengers assisting him. Penny continued restraining Neely for six minutes until the police arrived, and the unconscious Neely died shortly afterwards.\n\nIn a functional society, Penny would not be a hero, because this event would never have happened. Public transportation would be safe from the depredations of criminals and the degradation of the drug-dependent and the mentally ill. In our less-than-ideal society, Penny is a hero, and ought to be recognized as such: Of his own initiative, and at significant risk to himself, he defended innocent bystanders-including mothers and young children-from the actions of a deranged and violent individual. (Neely had recently been released after spending 15 months in jail for assaulting an elderly woman and breaking her nose).\n\nIn New York, however, because Penny is white and Neely was black, they tried to make him a scapegoat, a racist, and a murderer.\n\nThe gears of the American racial animosity-industrial complex began to hum almost as soon as the events were publicized. Al Sharpton, the perennial provocateur, delivered the eulogy at Neely's funeral, blaming his death on systemic racism. Protestors jammed the subway system, demanding that Penny be charged and accusing him of murdering Neely out of racial animosity. Mainstream media outfits published articles equating Neely's death with lynching. This was yet more proof that black people could be \"murdered like animals in public spaces,\" one such article stated. Neely's estranged father, who had apparently not provided him with a place to live during his long years of chronic homelessness, suddenly appeared in front of the cameras to lament his son's death and demand that prosecutors hit Penny with a murder charge. Everything was set to make Neely yet another undeserving avatar of racial grievance and to tar Penny with the collective sins, real and imagined, of \"White America\".\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was more than happy to play his own part in the familiar drama. Bragg, a Democrat, was elected on a promise to lighten the prosecution on theft and shoplifting in order to promote \"racial equity.\"\n\n\"These cases do not belong in criminal court. The punishments are disproportionately harsh, and fall disproportionately on the backs of people of color,\" Bragg stated on his website. \"This makes them morally indefensible.\" He ultimately charged Penny with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, declining the murder charge for potential lack of evidence.\n\nThe prosecutor he placed on Penny's case was of the same ideological cast: In 2019, Dafna Yoran requested a reduced sentence in a felony murder case where the defendant had assaulted and killed an elderly Korean professor during a robbery.\n\n\"I really felt incredibly sorry for him that he had gotten to that point in his life where he felt there was no choice but to commit this robbery,\" she said in an online seminar where she discussed race and \"restorative justice.\" During the prosecution, Yoran played up the racial angle in court, referring to Penny as \"the white man\" and \"murderer\" and framing the situation as yet another racially motivated killing, evocative of George Floyd, Michael Brown, and the various other cases that have inflamed American racial tensions in the 21st century.\n\nThe playbook was the same as the one that left the country in flames in 2020. This time, however, the sparks fell on less forgiving fuel. The country has learned a few things since the Summer of Floyd, it appears. The pseudointellectual nonprofiteering of Ibram X. Kendi, Robin DiAngelo, and Patrice Cullors has been exposed as a rapaciously self-interested sham. The public became first disenchanted and then outraged with progressive attempts to pare back policing: Furious with rising crime and generalized public disorder, even the left-wing strongholds of San Francisco and Los Angeles kicked out their progressive prosecutors. Parents, discovering with horror the maliciously racialized curriculum propagandizing their children in public schools, reacted sharply, driving activists from school boards and propelling a wave of successful school-choice initiatives. The backlash even reached academia: Subtle frustration with the politicization of scientific journals broke out into a public outcry by academics against requirements that all research papers submit explanations of how their contents advance diversity and equity in society at large.\n\nBy the time the trial had drawn to a close and the time for a verdict was reached, perhaps the most unkindest cut of all had been struck against the progressive race consensus: the election of Donald Trump with the greatest proportion of minority support received by a Republican candidate in 20 years. One of the defining factors in that election was the weakness of Kamala Harris, an accidental candidate whose arrival at the top of the Democratic ticket was the result of Joe Biden's capitulation to the progressive racial grievance wing. The country as a whole had rendered its own verdict: out with the politics of racial division, out with the perpetual ritual denunciation of America and Americans, out with the insatiable demands for abasement and self-flagellation.\n\nAs the jury contemplated the verdict, progressive protesters packed the courthouse, as they have many times before. This time, however, the outcome was different. There would be no more humiliation. Daniel Penny was acquitted, but it was America that was freed.\n\nThe expected litany of execrations and calumnies has followed, but even those seem perfunctory. Their speakers seem to recognize that they are merely parroting the performances of a bygone era; whatever power over the American imagination they might have once had has disappeared.\n\nIn contrast with the progressive politicians and Twitter revolutionaries, Penny himself is remarkably circumspect about the ordeal. \"All this attention and limelight is very uncomfortable.... I didn't want any attention or praise, and I still don't. The guilt I would have felt if someone did get hurt, if he did do what he was threatening to do, I would never be able to live with myself,\" he said . \"I'll take a million court appearances and people calling me names and people hating me, just to keep one of those people from getting hurt or killed.\"\n\nIn a certain sense, that's really all there is to it. People were in danger, and a brave American veteran stepped in to protect them. The story never needed to be more than that.\n\nBut in another, very real sense, the Penny case marks a momentous turning point in American life. The dead hand of racial ressentiment that has gripped this country has lost its strength. It has done immeasurable damage, institutionalizing itself across the broad swathe of American private and public life, and its undoing will be a generational project.

      "text": "The Daniel Penny charges show we are still living in the world 2020 wrought.\n\nLast Tuesday, the Manhattan district attorney's office announced that Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old Marine Corps veteran, will face second-degree manslaughter charges.\n\nThe week prior , Penny was on the New York City subway's F Train when Jordan Neely, a homeless, mentally ill 30 year old who has been arrested more than forty times, began threatening passengers on the train. After Neely's threats to the passengers, which included Neely reportedly claiming, \"I don't mind going to jail and getting life in prison\" and \"I'm ready to die,\" Penny was one of several male passengers who took action to restrain Neely. Penny put Neely in a chokehold while others restrained his arms, and when Neely went unconscious, the men and other passengers checked on his vitals. Neely later died, which observers claimed was due in part to first responder's failure to quickly arrive on the scene.\n\nIn the wake of the tragic incident, protestors took to the subway system, demanding Penny's arrest. New York's Gov. Kathy Hochul said Neely died for simply \"being a passenger\" and that it was \"very clear that he was not going to, you know, cause harm to these other people.\" New York City Comptroller Brad Lander called Penny a vigilante. Others weren't so tame. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said Neely's death was a \"public murder.\" Other state and local elected officials went so far as to call it a \"lynching.\"\n\nUnlike George Floyd's death in 2020, however, Neely's death has not kicked off another one of our perennial national \"reckonings on race.\" But it didn't need to.\n\nLasting effects from our racial reckoning in 2020, and the Soros-bought district attorneys that have implemented and overseen its pseudo-codification, continue to define the criminal justice system in America's urban hubs. In these circumstances, mass civil disobedience is purely performative. There's no reason to create disorder when the regime openly facilitates it.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Accountability hosted a hearing titled \"'Mostly Peaceful': Countering Left-Wing Organized Violence\" that explored the state-sanctioned disorder that has continued since. I attended the hearing to see my friend Julio Rosas, a senior writer for Townhall and whose book about his on-the-ground experience at some of the nation's largest riots I previously reviewed for the magazine, testify before the committee.\n\nIn his opening remarks , North Carolina's Rep. Dan Bishop, the subcommittee chairman, said, \"Time and again, across the nation, Americans have seen both episodic and in some cases sustained violence against people, especially law enforcement, and property damage from so-called anti-fascist and anarchist groups.\"\n\n\"I anticipate that my Democratic colleagues will reply with the official line from all the security agencies that right-wing extremism represents the most lethal, terroristic threat to the homeland,\" Bishop later stated. He was right: Subcommittee Democrats, who stayed for one round of questioning to produce their soundbites and then leave (except subcommittee ranking member Rep. Glenn Ivey), did precisely that.\n\nIvey and subcommittee Democrats also made use of a chart produced by the Washington Post based on data compiled by the Anti-Defamation League's (ADL) Center on Extremism, which shows that in cases where deaths occur, right-wing extremism is overwhelmingly to blame. But a cursory glance of the ADL's data shows it's riddled with errors.\n\nBy the ADL's own admission, the data is \"derived primarily from public sources,\" i.e. news reports from corporate media. It's a blatant example of what Federalist Editor-In-Chief Mollie Hemingway calls \"circular reporting\": The Washington Post reports on data compiled by the ADL stripped from reporting from the Washington Post (and sources like it).\n\nFurthermore, the ADL report admits that not all of the killings they record as extremist killings have extremist motives. More than a quarter of the extremist killings the ADL cites from 2022 \"either have no clear motive or were committed for a non-ideological motive.\"\n\nAnother admission from the ADL: \"As with any such list, the inclusion or exclusion of certain borderline cases may be the result of judgment calls based on the best evidence available, judgments with which others may reasonably disagree.\"\n\nDemocrats repeatedly suggested that property damage really wasn't that big of a deal, and cited testimony from FBI Director Chris Wray that Antifa is mostly an ideology . Citing Wray was meant to etherealize Antifa, but are all extremists ideologues of some stripe? It's worth noting that rarely, if ever, was Chris Wray's name mentioned along with the title \"FBI Director.\" One wonders why that might be.\n\nIn one of the more memorable attempts to get a soundbite, New York Rep. Daniel Goldman told his Republican colleagues, \"you're trying to gaslight us up here as if Antifa, which Mr. Rosas, apparently the expert now in organized terrorist activity, has overruled the FBI director who says... Antifa is an ideology not an organization. No, no, no. Let's not listen to the FBI director. Let's listen to-sorry, what's your title?-senior writer at Townhall, who is going to tell us that the FBI director is wrong.\" Rosas leaned into the microphone and said \"yes\" before Goldman reclaimed his time.\n\nLater, Arizona Rep. Eli Crane gave Rosas a chance to respond. \"Well, I think it's funny...to be lectured by an heir to Levi Strauss Corporation, and honestly, that's probably why he doesn't consider property damage to be that big of a deal because not only does he have that, but he also has what some would describe as an impossibly good stock portfolio,\" Rosas said.\n\n\"But what I can tell you is that in these riots that happened three years ago,\" Rosas continued, is that \"yes, big corporations did suffer damage and looting... But a lot of the businesses, they were small businesses, they didn't come from multimillion dollar families or corporations.\" The carnage in 2020 took away the livelihoods of many of these community businesses. If they were lucky enough for their businesses to survive, the continued, regime-approved disorder-even in places where local governments decided to refund the police-has made it difficult for communities to once again stand on their own two feet.\n\nAfter the hearing, I spoke with Rep. Crane about our nagging hangover from the summer of love.\n\n\"They're destroying these cities. I think that's obvious,\" Crane told me. \"And it's sad, because these aren't data points. These aren't graphs that we're talking about. These are people's lives. These are families, these are business owners.\"\n\n\"It's horrible to watch because you look at cities like New York and Chicago. They're beautiful, amazing cities, full of heritage and history, and people don't feel safe there.\" The disorder, Crane suggested, is a tyranny of a different kind.\n\nThough ostensibly \"law and order\" Democratic mayoral candidates have managed to win primary and general elections, they've done little to deliver. Anarcho-tyranny remains the operating premise of nearly every progressive urban center in the United States. It's as if instead of sending up the bat signal, Gotham decided to illuminate the sky with the Riddler's question mark.\n\nWithout the right to defend your property, you don't actually have a right to it. Without the right to ensure your safety and the safety of your community, you don't actually have the right to life. The only way to ensure your freedom, and possibly your survival, is to stay silent and subservient to the chaos that surrounds you.\n\nGeorgia's Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a member of the subcommittee, told me in the Cannon building hallway outside the hearing room that Neeley's death was \"absolutely was not [Penny's] fault.\"\n\n\"He did everything he could to stop him from hurting anyone on the train that day, and then he took the appropriate actions,\" she said. Penny, Greene argued, \"is the target of left wing political extremism in the government. He's the target of the D.A. [Alvin] Bragg, who is abusing his power as the district attorney while he should be prosecuting real crimes.\"\n\nBut for Bragg and his ilk, what Penny did was a real crime, a real crime not just committed against Neely, but against the regime. The Soviets used to send such dissidents to Siberia. In Manhattan, they'll attempt to send this dissident to the correctional facility a few blocks away from the courthouse.\n\nBradley Devlin is the former political editor for The American Conservative .

      "text": "What does sitting idly by do to our character?\n\nPerhaps Daniel Penny will not go to prison. The 24-year-old Marine veteran put the troubled Jordan Neely in a chokehold on New York's subway last week, joining two other passengers in restraining the erratic derelict. Neely was declared dead at a local hospital, and his death was ruled a homicide . But Penny has not been arrested yet, and a New York Times Sunday feature on the incident is subdued, almost sympathetic to the man we are told was an aspiring bartender. Of course, the Times can't help spelling certain things out, with its strange honorific capitalization: \"Mr. Penny, who is white, was questioned by the police, but has not been charged with a crime for killing Mr. Neely, who was Black.\" Protestors have called for Penny's arrest, but this sad tale may very well become a story national tastemakers agree is simply a tragedy-encapsulating a host of social pathologies, yet not cause for a new summer of unrest and activism with Penny and Neely as dual sacrificial victims.\n\nNeely's death does not only, as the New York Times put it, reveal \"the deep fault lines in the ways New Yorkers, and Americans beyond, view race, homelessness, crime and how some people seem to be treated differently by the police.\" It also illustrates a fault line in virtue, between prudence and courage, particularly for men in contemporary America. Like the Kyle Rittenhouse case, in which a young man engaged in very stupid virtuous behavior and escaped prison because he was extremely lucky throughout, if Penny escapes a sentence he will be another exception that proves the rule. As Peachy Keenan observed, from a \"don't ruin your life\" perspective, the smart thing when someone is being violently antisocial in a public space is to do nothing. But what does it mean for the character of the American man, when he trains himself to sit idly by?\n\nIf you live in a major American city and ever take public transit, by now the experience is a familiar one. A person who in a more just country would likely be either incarcerated or institutionalized-Neely had been arrested some forty-two times, including once for punching a 67-year-old woman in the face-has an emotional outburst that seems set to escalate into assault at any moment. Everyone else aboard the train or bus does their best to ignore the disturbance, hoping it will simply go away-for the disturbed person has become part of the urban scenery at this point, a species of weather. We stare at phones, or at shoes, or at the map on the wall, anywhere but where we might make eye contact. Depending on the city, this may happen to you more than once a week.\n\nCharacter is formed by habit. We are what we repeatedly do. Virtue is performed; the courageous man acts courageously and wisdom is found in the words and deeds of a wise man. In making passivity the smart, default response to disorder and danger, we are forming cities of cowards. Of course, this account of human nature-the language of virtue and habituation and character-has itself been under assault for more than a century, replaced by a pragmatic, calculating sense of smarts. As C.S. Lewis famously wrote in 1943's The Abolition of Man : \"In a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honour and are shocked to find traitors in our midst.\" Now, in public disorder, this spiritual disorder finds its embodiment, as those who might have done something do nothing, and so make the next call for action that much more difficult to heed.\n\nDeeply related, and also at issue, is how the country thinks about public spaces and public order more generally. A refrain from those people outraged by Penny and the other passengers' intervention has been that you and I do not have a right to be comfortable in public spaces. This is a stupid objection on the face of it; taken as stated, the unwell or criminal have no right to be comfortable either, then, and their noise or threats of violence can be met in kind. Of course, what people who say this sort of thing actually mean is that vagrants have a right to do whatever they want-reduced from fellow citizens, whose well-being we should care about, to sacred cows trampling where they will-and you and I do not have a right to expect, let alone demand, public order, that laws be enforced and that the state work in service of the citizenry's health and flourishing.\n\nAt a certain point, the neglect we see in American cities begins to look less like the unintended consequences of naive idealism and more like policy. In describing this emergent purpose, we might define it by what it seems to reward and punish, or at least what it selects for and against: for passivity against self-government; for cowardice against courage.\n\nMicah Meadowcroft is research director of the Center for Renewing America and a contributing editor of The American Conservative .

      "text": "Elites of any political persuasion ignore widespread anger over the healthcare system at their own peril.\n\nThe dirtbag left and the populist right were, for once, in agreement-they didn't want Luigi Mangione caught.\n\nDespite a nationwide manhunt, breathlessly promoted by millionaire gabbers in the legacy media, the people of America-the ones who vote, the ones who pay the taxes for the wars, the ones whose family members have been bankrupted by healthcare companies utilizing AI chatbots to find fault with their life-saving health claims-were fed up.\n\nThe dirtbag left, as voiced by the former Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz, was nothing short of disappointed as news broke that Mangione had been captured on Monday in Pennsylvania. Lorenz admitted to Piers Morgan on that evening's show that she felt \"joy\" upon learning of the assassination. Morgan, as he is wont to do, was outraged. Joy? How could anyone feel \"joy\" about the death of another human being?\n\nThe Daily Wire chief Ben Shapiro was similarly incensed. Though he spent the better part of Monday defending and praising Daniel Penny, a former marine who subdued a homeless black man for five minutes on an NYC subway ultimately leading to his death, Shapiro held no such sympathies for Mangione, who had instead targeted the wealthy, white CEO of a company that is known for denying the life-saving claims of its clients.\n\nTo Shapiro, the 26-year-old Ivy Leaguer who brazenly assassinated UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in mid-Manhattan last week was not an antihero lashing out at a corrupted health system, he was some punk kid animating blood-soaked terrors of the new left. There was simply no rhyme or reason to Mangione's action other than that he was just another America-hating leftist who wanted a successful member of the capitalist power class destroyed.\n\nFor Shapiro, and for many other well-heeled pundits across the centrist media axis, this was an open and shut case of far-left boogeyman extremists flaunting their anti-life positions for America to see. In Shapiro's own words: \"The revolutionary left is creeping into the mainstream. Liberals are people who disagree with me on public policy but aren't in favor of, you know, the murder of their opponents. The left is a different thing.\" In Shapiro and Morgan's minds, the celebration of Thompson's death (and it was celebrated) could be simply chalked up to leftwing lunatics like Lorenz and the BlueSky resisters who are hellbent on the destruction of all that is morally right and sound in our country.\n\nBut there's a major problem with this hypothesis: It's not true. As evidenced by the comment section below Shapiro's own YouTube video on the topic, even his own, die-hard conservative fans had heard enough from the California lawyer.\n\nThe top comment on his video titled \"The EVIL Revolutionary Left Cheers Murder!\" read simply: \"We got conservatives and liberals hugging each other in the comments section.\" Another: \"I'm not buying this 'left vs right' shit anymore Ben, I want healthcare for my family.\" And yet another: \"Right winger here, you are wrong Ben, this man denied 35% of claims. The facts do not care about any of our feelings. Respectfully, I think this take was out of touch.\"\n\nAnd the anger didn't dissipate there. \"I'm a Republican. I voted for Trump and I'm unsubscribing from Ben,\" read another highly-rated response. Comment after comment disagreed with Shapiro and other right-wing partisans attempting to explain away the real meaning of Luigi, the boy who killed. \"Saw my lifelong hardworking father become bankrupt as a result of claims being denied after getting cancer,\" wrote one commentator who got more likes than Shapiro's own video on the subject. \"You are out of touch, man.\"\n\nAnd it wasn't just Shapiro and Morgan who attempted to paint the deplorable public who met the murder with a shrug as heartless, soulless, cowardly vigilantes. CNN and Fox News were vexed by the killing, with both networks struggling to frame the killing in a context that best benefited their advertisers. Though it was difficult for their anchors to grasp the horror, Mangione's message was being received loud and clear by their viewers. And many, to the shock and awe of the punditry class, liked it.\n\n\"None of these news programs are talking about the incredible lack of empathy from the general public about this because of how these insurance companies treat people when they're at their most vulnerable,\" the comedian Bill Burr said in response to the assassination. \"After we've all given them our money every f-king month and now we finally need you and all you do is deny us.... I gotta be honest with you, I love that f-king CEOs are f-king afraid right now. You should be. By and large, you're all a bunch of selfish, greedy f-king pieces of sh-t and a lot of you are mass murderers, you just don't pull the trigger so it looks clean.\"\n\nIn Mangione, large parts of the American public identified clear markers from their own lives. He reminded them of Travis Bickle, of Alain Delon. Mangione's smile, seen only in a grainy picture caught on a CCTV camera at the hostel where he stayed in NYC, provoked swoons across the net. Not only had this man attacked an institution many of them despised, he was good looking too.\n\n\"If the guy is fit, you must acquit,\" read one viral post on X. \"He's even hotter with his mask and shirt off,\" wrote another. Mangione's looks were so celebrated that the New York Times instructed its newsroom to \"dial back\" the use of Mangione's photo on its stories. Fox News went the other direction, dedicating hours upon hours of air time Mangione's face as its hosts took turns complaining about Americans who were attracted to the alleged killer.\n\nThe host Jesse Watters dedicated an entire portion of his nightly show Tuesday to a segment his producers titled \"Libs Have the Hots for Alleged Killer.\" Watters said that women were attracted to \"the bad boy factor\" Mangione possessed, that they dreamed of being Bonnie to his Clyde. Watters finished by claiming that some women have just a \"sick fantasy\" for \"damaged guys.\"\n\nThe women of Fox News didn't fare much better as they attempted to placate the whims of their advertisers. Dana Perino was \"disgusted\" that \"some people say this is because of the insurance industry.\" Obscured from her take was the killer's own words, which Fox News and CNN have both refused to release as of this writing. In the manifesto, confirmed by the Daily Beast, Mangione makes it clear that his actions were indeed \"because of the insurance industry.\"\n\n\"The US has the #1 most expensive healthcare system in the world, yet we rank roughly #42 in life expectancy,\" Mangione wrote. \"United is the largest company in the US by market cap, behind only Apple, Google, Walmart. It has grown and grown, but has our life expectancy? No [sic] the reality is, these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allowed them to get away with it.\"\n\nThough we've come to expect CNN to suppress manifestos such as these, it's rich for Fox News, whose anchors bemoaned the suppression of the Nashville transgender killer's manifesto, to do the same when the words attack their cash cows. And the hosts at Fox News weren't done. In most Orwellian fashion, Emily Compagno called on employers to \"check the social media\" of employees to see if they cheered on Mangione, to hell with personal privacy and the First and Fourth Amendments.\n\nWanted posters with the names and faces of healthcare company CEOs were plastered onto street lamps in Manhattan Tuesday. Thompson's face was included with a big, fat X mark over it. On the internet, Mangione was being made a star. In one viral video glorifying Mangione, clippers edited Charlie XCX's \"Spring Breakers\" over videos of Mangione being arrested and his valedictorian speech at Baltimore's prestigious all-boys Gilman school. A folk singer went viral on TikTok with a Dylan-esque jig called \"There ain't no U in United Health.\" T-shirts with his likeness surrounded by hearts were being printed by the thousands. Even a poll created by the hard-right X account \"End Wokeness\" found surprising support for Mangione with nearly 15,000 users voting that the assassination was \"justified.\"\n\nAnd the internet was not the only place where Mangione found uncomfortable favor. In the streets of Italy , walls were graffitied with \"Deny, Defend, Depose\" and \"Luigi Mangione Our Hero.\" An X account that shared the image received more than 15,000 likes. On Highway 99 in Seattle, a roadway sign was hacked to read: \"One less CEO. Many more to go.\" In Santa Fe, New Mexico, someone posted fliers around town that read \"Deny, Defend, Depose.\"\n\nThose who knew Mangione couldn't believe it was him. TMZ shared video of Mangione in college, smashing a beer against his head before chugging it. Classmates referred to him as \"the life of the party.\" A former roommate described the killing as \"incompatible\" with Mangione's personality. A friend of Luigi's said the news was \"unfathomable.\"\n\nThen came the donations. Mangione's lawyer, Thomas Dickey, said they were pouring in from all parts of this country. The CNN host Kaitlan Collins couldn't believe what she was hearing. And although Dickey said he was unlikely to accept the donations, Collins and the group panels that followed struggled to comprehend just how many Americans saw this kid as the American Antihero.\n\nBut Bill Burr could see it. And so too could millions of Americans, many of whom ran to social media to cheer on the assassin. \"For (CNN) to be like, 'Why would anyone do this!?!' They're denying claims and people are dying. The food supply is poisoned. The motive out there is wild,\" Burr concluded.\n\nThen came Luigi's tweets . Although X owner Elon Musk initially scrubbed Mangione's alleged X account, the page was reinstated just hours later and was recently granted a verification badge. For the past few days, Luigi's past tweets have been going viral across the platform. He voiced concerns about declining birth rates in Japan, examined the consequences of the decline of Christianity, complained about DEI, shared Peter Thiel speeches, decried wokeism, supported nuclear energy, and poked fun at the atheist Richard Dawkins. From his tweets, he seemed to be a New Right-leaning, libertarian tech bro who followed an exotic mix of accounts ranging from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and AOC to Joe Rogan and Ezra Klein.\n\nThe right dug that he spoke their language, and the left saw a handsome mercenary who had done their dirty work. As Shapiro, Watters, Morgan, Collins, Perino, Compagno, and others chewed through their typical material on the TV, the internet was abuzz, marveling at Mangione's eclectic tweets and manifesto.\n\nFirst came the revelations about his reading habits. Ted Kaczynski, Dr. Seuss, Aldous Huxley, Orwell, and Malcom Gladwell were just some of the authors Mangione reviewed on his GoodReads account. Mangionie had shared a quote from Seuss's The Lorax : \"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, / Nothing is going to get better. It's not.\" The books on back pain and psychedelic therapy were there too. A lot of it was source material the online right had already read and digested. Depending on where you fell, ideologically, the motive was in there somewhere.\n\nFor some, it was clear that Mangione went off the grid when he became interested in the use of psychedelics to treat his unyielding back pain. A viral 2023 tweet about granola crunching, yoga millennial moms getting their minds scrambled on ayahuasca retreats in the jungle was retweeted by Musk and many agreed that the same had happened to Mangione.\n\n\"I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done,\" Mangione wrote in his manifesto. \"Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming... Obviously the problem is more complex, but I do not have space, and frankly I do not pretend to be the most qualified person to lay out the full argument. But many have illuminated the corruption and greed (e.g.: Rosenthal, Moore), decades ago and the problems simply remain. It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play. Evidently I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty.\"\n\nMangione doesn't seem like some punk leftist driven mad by hallucinogenic-induced terrors. His thoughts are not elliptical; they are concise and charged. The scion of one of the richest legacies in all of Maryland and a child of a family who were made wealthy via their (ironically) knee-deep interests in the healthcare industry, Mangione had achieved in everything he attempted before chronic back pain changed his life forever.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Mangione took off for Hawaii where he earned a spot at a \"co-living\" space in Hawaii managed by RJ Martin. Mangione's back pain was so intense that he told Martin it was impossible to have sex or date anyone as a result.\n\nMartin described Mangione as \"an ideal member\" of the co-living space. \"Our mission statement is that we're a community of givers and that we leave things better than we found them,\" Martin said. \"We look for people who are looking to give back. And he fit the bill.\" Mangione opted for spinal surgery to treat spondylolisthesis in 2023. And based on an x-ray image of Mangione's back that appears on his Twitter banner, the alleged killer likely received a lumbar fusion, a metal brace inserted into his lower spinal vertebrae.\n\nIf Magione's manifesto is taken at face value, even the richest amongst us struggle at the hands of a system that prioritizes capital over people. Despite voicing fair critiques of the American health system, it goes without saying that Mangione is no hero. His brutal murder of Thompson, a middle-classer who rose to the very top of the American corporate totem pole, speaks to the precarious and violent nature of America, 1492 to now. He is not the first, nor the last, to selfishly snuff out the life of another vain pursuit of his own particular revenge.\n\nBut Mangione, who escaped into the American interior before being busted at a McDonald's in Altoona, is the exact sort of anti hero the internet has always craved and cheered on. From Breaking Bad and Joker to V for Vendetta and the Sopranos , America's fictional tastes reflect a people who revel in cheering on complicated bad guys. It's an uncomfortable truth we are all struggling, in our own ways, to process this week.\n\nIn a post to X on Wednesday, Elon Musk responded to Mangione's manifesto. Musk wrote \"nothing would do more to improve the health, lifespan and quality of life for Americans than making GLP inhibitors super low cost to the public,\" a statement out of step with the incoming HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy's natural vision of a healthy America. Musk's statement hid a troubling truth. One bullet and a page of scribbled words had spurred President-elect Donald Trump's new favorite friend to address the crumbling American healthcare system on his worldwide platform.\n\nOn the other side of the political ocean, Sen. Elizabeth Warren weighed in on the situation Wednesday evening stating, \"People can only be pushed so far.\" Some called for Warren to be thrown off her committee assignments. Others cheered her. Warren wasn't done. She called the killing \"a warning that if you push people hard enough, they lose faith in the ability of their government to make change.\" Rep. Alexandria-Ocasia Cortez took a similar line , claiming that \"anyone who is confused or shocked or appalled, they need to understand that people interpret and feel and experience denied claims as an act of violence.\"\n\nThe fact that Mangione's actions are being discussed at such lengths across the political spectrum indicates much more than naked vigilantism. It suggests a certain rage bubbling underneath the staid surface of modern America toward institutions beyond the people's control. It's an anger that animates itself in all sorts of ways, both political and cultural regardless of political affiliation. After all, this is the country we built-a violent one. And it's been a violent year.\n\nSpencer Neale is the Features Editor at The American Conservative .

      "text": "Assassination of Healthcare CEO sends shockwaves through political discourse.\n\nIn the days following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, the left side of social media erupted in what ranged from a bizarrely gleeful reaction -or \" joy ,\" to use former Washington Post and New York Times reporter Taylor Lorenz's preferred terminology-to at least not an especially empathetic one.\n\nOne Columbia University professor who billed himself as a \"trauma expert\" and \"anti-violence,\" though also a \"Commie,\" wrote a viral post saying, \"Today, we mourn the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, gunned down.... wait, I'm sorry - today we mourn the deaths of the 68,000 Americans who needlessly die each year so that insurance company execs like Brian Thompson can become multimillionaires.\"\n\nA progressive author claimed on another website that \"the jacket the CEO-murderer wore is flying off the shelves\" and wondered if Democrats had failed to capitalize on the \"popular anger\" that was out there in the country this election year.\n\nThe suspect in the CEO killing, Luigi Mangione, appears at first blush to have somewhat more complicated politics than the cooks of the initial hot takes about the fatal shooting. But among the interesting issues raised by this crime, including the ethics of the American healthcare system and vigilante justice, is whether there is a huge reservoir of untapped anger on the left.\n\nCompared to eight years ago, public response to Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election has been muted. Buildings were boarded up in a few places in Washington, D.C., but there were no large riots or public disturbances. Democrats and even left-wing activists mostly seem resigned to his return to power. Perhaps that will change in January, but even the paroxysms of rage against the hosts of Morning Joe for \" normalizing \" the once and future president didn't have the same feeling as the Resistance in its heyday.  Much of the outrage that is on display today comes from the Trump-era grifter networks, like orange man Bibles and other MAGA merch but marketed to different, pink hat-wearing people.\n\nYet anecdotally, I do regularly encounter both in public and on social media partisan Democrats and anti-Trump voters making \"Stop the Steal\"-style claims about the 2024 election, typically involving Elon Musk, the Russians or just a generalized lack of will to stop Trump among. None of this is amplified by Democratic politicians or media figures of any significance, but in my admittedly blue-state-biased experience-I'm from Boston and live in the Northern Virginia suburbs of D.C.-as widespread as some of the conspiracy theories about Kremlin-altered vote totals that were actually reflected in the polls during Trump's first term.\n\nTrump was himself the target of two assassination attempts, though we know less about those would-be assassins' motivations than Mangione's apparent manifesto. (Though we know a little bit about the surviving suspect and the Trump-Russia conspiracies appear to have some relevance.)\n\nBut the people trafficking in 2024 election conspiracy theories are more fringe and less influential than those celebrating, or at least excessively nuancing, the healthcare CEO's slaying, who are in turn less influential than those sowing division over Daniel Penny's acquittal in New York. \"We need some black vigilantes,\" New York BLM co-founder Hank Newsome said after the verdict. \"People want to jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud? How about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us?\"\n\nFew leading Democrats are trying to stoke whatever rage exists on the first two fronts. President Joe Biden, perhaps feeling a bit of schadenfreude toward Democrats who unceremoniously dumped him and lost anyway, has been magnanimous in the aftermath of Trump's win. Vice President Kamala Harris has spoken like a self-help guru to her supporters. Both appear determined to offer Trump the normal White House transition that he famously denied them four years ago.\n\nAfter Mangione was apprehended in Altoona, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who many Democrats wish was on the 2024 ticket and could be the party's presidential nominee in 2028, said, \"The killer is not a hero. He should not be hailed as one.\"\n\nThis is responsible leadership, whether that is what the base wants or not. But in the current environment, it can be difficult to determine whether \"very online\" people are numerically insignificant despite their large internet presence or represent something larger.\n\nBiden won in 2020 in part by ignoring online discourse. Trump won four years later by tapping into low-propensity voters on the internet. Democrats who listened to Joe Rogan were more informed about what was happening in the campaign, and more prepared for Trump's eventual election, than consumers of older media like the more liberal cable news channels.\n\nTime will tell whether there is a deeper rage and whether it looks to be calmed by Kamala Harris's joy or Taylor Lorenz's .\n\nW.

      "text": "Daniel Penny's 'toxic' masculinity saved lives\n\nDaniel Penny was found not guilty by a Manhattan jury and has been cleared of all charges for the death of Jordan Neely. Penny placed Neely in a chokehold on the subway to keep him from harassing passengers in May 2023.\n\nNeely, 30, was a homeless street performer and Michael Jackson impersonator who was shouting, throwing things, and making threats on the F train in SoHo. According to Penny and other witnesses, Neely was yelling that someone was \"going to die today.\"\n\nThe homeless street performer was alive when the police got to him, but the police said that they didn't want to resuscitate him via mouth to mouth because he was dirty and looked as if he could be carrying diseases.\n\nWhile Allie Beth Stuckey of \"Relatable\" believes the police reaction is \"very sad,\" she's undeniably pleased with the verdict.\n\n\"One woman who was on the train, one witness, thanked Penny for saving her life. Another passenger described this rant as a satanic rant, and many passengers said that Daniel Penny actually kept them safe that day,\" she comments, adding, \"The fact that he was alive when the police found him, that is very significant here.\"\n\nThe courage that Penny, who is a former Marine, showed in the situation has become increasingly rare and almost impossible to come by - especially considering the way his life changed following the incident.\n\n\"We've all seen videos go viral on X where a young woman is being either sexually assaulted, is being sexually harassed, and the men around them do absolutely nothing. Either because they're cowards, they don't want to be inconvenienced, or because they know something like this is going to happen to them, especially if you have a black suspect,\" Stuckey explains.\n\n\"That's just the case, when you've got a white person and a black person and the white person even just appears like the aggressor, you know that you are going to lose in the media. You know that you're going to lose in the court of public opinion,\" she adds.\n\nWhile Penny didn't lose in the court of public opinion this time, had Neely's death occurred four years ago, Stuckey believes we'd have seen a different verdict.\n\n\"I think if what happened to Jordan Neely happened four years ago, we would have seen a different verdict,\" she says. \"Which is actually very sad because verdicts should not depend upon the cultural moment, it should not depend upon social media outrage, it shouldn't depend upon protest or how loud one side is. It should only depend upon the facts.\"\n\nTo enjoy more of Allie's upbeat and in-depth coverage of culture, news, and theology from a Christian, conservative perspective, subscribe to BlazeTV - the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.\n\nBlazeTV Staff"

      "text": "UPDATE: Manslaughter charge against Daniel Penny dropped\n\nThe Marine veteran was charged with manslaughter for the death of Jordan Neely.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nAfter three days of deliberation, the jury in the trial of Daniel Penny reported Friday to the judge that they were unable to reach a verdict in the first count of manslaughter in the second degree, and prosecutors decided to drop the charge .\n\nPenny, a 26-year-old Marine veteran, was arrested after he got into an altercation with a man named Jordan Neely, who was making death threats against passengers on a subway train in New York City. Videos showed Penny subduing the man with a chokehold, which led to Neely's death. Penny was charged with manslaughter by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nOn Friday the prosecutors responded to the jury development by telling the judge they could drop the first count in order to continue with the case. The judge said that he was apprehensive about continuing the case against Penny and went to recess to consider the issue.\n\nOnce he returned, the judge agreed to drop the first count and continue the case with a second count. The second count is criminally negligent homicide, which carries a lesser punishment upon conviction.\n\nSeveral witnesses on the subway train have defended Penny and called him a hero for his actions, while some activists have accused him of racism because Neely was a black man.\n\nThis is a developing story, and additional information has been added.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Eric Adams weighs in on Daniel Penny trial: 'Those passengers were afraid'\n\nAdams noted the city's failures to provide mental health help.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) defended Daniel Penny as his trial ended arguments and the jury began deliberations. Penny could face up to 15 years in prison if the jury finds him guilty of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide for the death of Jordan Neely.\n\nThe trial highlighted how Penny took action to restrain Neely, who made death threats on a subway car while it was going to another station. Neely also said he did not care if he went to jail.\n\nChundru said Neely died from 'the combined effects of sickle-cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint, and the synthetic marijuana.'\n\n\"We're now on the subway, where we're hearing someone talking about hurting people, killing people,\" Adams said to radio host Rob Astorino, according to the Daily Wire . \"You have someone [Penny] on that subway who was responding, doing what we should have done as a city.\"\n\n\"Those passengers were afraid,\" he added.\n\nMultiple witnesses, even some called by the prosecution, said they were terrified of Neely and thought this particular man was more dangerous than other deranged people on the city's subway system.\n\n\"Then you look at the complete failure of our mental health system, a complete failure from the days of closing psychiatric wards and having those who needed help just turned over into the street without giving any safety net to accept them,\" Adams said about the city's ongoing problems with providing mental health care.\n\nThe Democrat mayor took issue with how the media has portrayed Neely, heavily emphasizing his Michael Jackson impersonation while downplaying his actions that led to Penny restraining him.\n\n\"It seemed like it was a young, innocent child who was brutally murdered, and it gave that impression when you look at the photo that was being used,\" Adams said.\n\nWhile the medical examiner of Manhattan testified that Penny's hold on Neely was the sole cause of death, going so far as to say that it would have been the cause of death even if Neely had enough drugs in his system \"to put down an elephant,\" a forensic pathologist called by Penny's defense team said that was not the case .\n\nDr. Satish Chundru testified he ruled out the air choke and the blood choke as the only cause of death because there were other contributing factors. Chundru said the bruising on Neely's neck and the \"almost negligible\" tiny spots of bleeding found on his eyelids were not consistent with a fatal chokehold.\n\nChundru said Neely died from \"the combined effects of sickle-cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint, and the synthetic marijuana,\" noting that schizophrenia results in an \"increased risk of sudden cardiac death.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Daniel Penny found not guilty in Neely chokehold case\n\nJudge dropped the manslaughter charge last week.\n\nThe jurors delivered their verdict in Daniel Penny's trial on Monday, finding the Marine veteran not guilty of criminally negligent homicide.\n\nPenny, 26, pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide for the death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia. Penny restrained Neely in a chokehold after he made death threats against passengers on a New York City subway car in May 2023.\n\n'Who do you want on the next train ride with you?'\n\nOn Friday, the judge dismissed the manslaughter charge when the jury of 12, made up of seven women and five men, twice indicated they could not come to a unanimous verdict . The jurors were not allowed to deliver a decision on the lesser count until the top charge was settled.\n\nDuring deliberation, the jury returned to the judge with at least seven notes to review the evidence and clarify definitions in the case.\n\nTo find Penny guilty, jurors were instructed that they had to conclude that his use of force was unnecessary and that he acted recklessly.\n\nThe cause of Neely's death was heavily debated.\n\nThe prosecutors argued that Penny restrained Neely in a chokehold for too long. Their case relied on shaky testimony from Dr. Cynthia Harris. After performing the autopsy, she labeled Neely's cause of death as \"inconclusive.\" However, after viewing video evidence of the incident, she amended his cause of death to \"asphyxia.\"\n\nDr. Satish Chundru, a forensic pathologist, rejected Harris' findings. He contended that Neely died from a combination of causes, including \"effects of sickle-cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint, and the synthetic marijuana.\"\n\nDuring his closing argument, Penny's lawyer, Steven Raiser, asked jurors, \"Who do you want on the next train ride with you?\"\n\n\"The guy with the earbuds minding his own business who you know would be there for you if something happened? Or perhaps you just hope that someone like Jordan Neely does not enter that train when you are all alone, all alone in a crowd of others frozen with fear?\" Raiser questioned.\n\n\"This case is about a broken system, a broken system that does not help our mentally ill or our unhoused,\" he continued. \"In fact, it is that broken system that led us, that is interwoven into the very fabric of this case.\"\n\nAlthough Penny is no longer facing criminal charges, Neely's father, Andre Zachary, initiated a lawsuit against him last week. Zachary accused Penny of negligent assault, battery, and causing serious injury, resulting in Neely's death.\n\nLike Blaze News?

He wasn't the victim; he was the aggressor; he was the criminal on that subway car that day, who was seriously threatening other passengers,\" she said, pointing to Neely's \"long history of hurting [passengers].\"\n\nAnd to the person who yelled, \"It's a racist country!\" in the courtroom, Kelly had the following response: \"Hello madam or sir, that's not working anymore.

He was threatening to go to jail forever, go to jail for the rest of his life, and now I'm on the ground with him.\n\n'I'm on my back in a very vulnerable position... If I just let him go, now I'm on my back and he can turn around and start doing what he said - to me... killing, hurting,' Penny explained.\n\nAlthough the case sparked whirlwind attention across the nation, Penny said he is 'not a confrontational person' and someone who prefers to stay out of the spotlight.\n\nThe case itself and Penny's ultimate acquittal enraged BLM activists, who instantly called for revenge in the form of black vigilantes.\n\nAfter finding him not guilty, cheering and clapping erupted in the courtroom by some, while Neely's family yelled horrendous threats, calling Penny a 'racist c**t' and warning: 'It's a small world, buddy,' before being escorted out.\n\nPenny told Judge Jeanine Pirro after his acquittal that he would have felt responsible if someone did get hurt' after the homeless man threatened to kill people onboard the train that day\n\nDuring his interview, Penny also mentioned the 'self-serving' officials who used the fatal incident as part of a 'political game'.\n\nDespite not mentioning anyone directly, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, who spearheaded the case against Penny, has come under fire since the verdict was announced.\n\n'These are their policies. And I don't mean to get political, I really don't' want to make any enemies, really - although I guess I have already,' he told Pirro.\n\n'But these are their policies that have clearly not worked, that the people, the general population, are not in support. Yet, their egos are too big to agree that they're wrong.'\n\nAfter walking free, the 26-year-old quickly dashed to a downtown bar to celebrate his win with his lawyers .\n\nWith the trial out of the way, Penny is free to return his attention to his studies. When he was charged, he was studying architecture at the New York City College of Technology.\n\nHe was also working two jobs - one as a swim teacher and also at a restaurant in Brooklyn - which he gave up to focus on the trial.\n\nHe is also not completely out of the woods after Neely's family filed a civil lawsuit against Penny last week.\n\nPenny's legal team, Thomas Kenniff and Steven Raiser, said they will immediately set their sights on the lawsuit against their client.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

There was cheering and clapping in the courtroom as the verdict was announced after a tense weekend of waiting and questioning the judge's bias.\n\nNeely's family yelled horrendous threats, calling Penny a 'racist c**t' and warning: 'It's a small world, buddy.'\n\nThey were escorted out of the courtroom.\n\nJudge Wiley allowed the prosecution's request to drop the manslaughter charge even after previously questioning the legality of it last week.\n\nDaniel Penny, 26, pictured arriving at court on Monday\n\nPenny says he acted to protect himself and fellow passengers, but prosecutors have painted him as unskilled, saying he improperly administered a choke for a duration that resulted in the victim's death\n\nPenny's lawyers argued he acted in self-defense and in defense of other passengers after Neely terrorized their subway car and threatened them, but prosecutors say he overstepped into vigilantism and criminally killed Neely with a chokehold.\n\nThe state said it was 'admirable' at first that Penny stepped up to intervene, but that he failed to recognise Neely's humanity and went too far when he took him down.\n\nNeely, 30, was once among the city's corps of subway and street performers and was known for his Michael Jackson impersonations. He struggled with drug abuse and a mental illness, and had a criminal record that included assault convictions.\n\nNeely's death on the subway car last spring sparked racial tensions in the Big Apple as groups such as Black Lives Matter sought to paint Penny as an overzealous, white ex-Marine targeting an innocent black man.\n\nHowever, the national attention on the trial also saw many conservatives question why Penny, who was studying to be an architect, was even charged.\n\nDespite a wave of public support and testimony from others on the train who said Penny acted out of bravery, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg's office pushed ahead with the prosecution. While two other men helped Penny subdue Neely, they were never charged.\n\nBragg was under intense pressure to charge Penny, with Democrats and protesters calling his death murder. Protests erupted near the Broadway Lafayette subway station where Neely died.\n\nDuring closing statements defence attorney Steven Raiser theorised that the District Attorney's office caved to pressure from furious protesters who divided the case on racial lines early on.\n\nPenny has been described by fans as a hero and 'modern day Batman' who selflessly came to the aid of women and children on the train despite the risks to himself.\n\nPenny was released from custody on a $100,000 bond after handing himself in to the NYPD. Under the bail terms, Penny's parents put up $10,000 in cash and guaranteed the other $90,000 if he were to flee.\n\nA crowdfunding effort for the ex-Marine received over $3million in donations . The page hit $1million in the hours after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis tweeted a link to it.\n\nDonald Trump was one of many Republican voices to express support for Penny, saying he 'was in great danger and the other people in the car were in great danger.'\n\nDuring the monthlong trial, the anonymous jury heard testimony from subway passengers who witnessed the roughly six-minute chokehold, as well as police who responded to it, pathologists, a psychiatric expert, a Marine Corps instructor who taught Penny chokehold techniques and Penny's relatives, friends and fellow Marines.\n\nJurors watched videos recorded by bystanders and police body cameras and saw how Penny explained his actions to officers on the scene and later in a stationhouse interview room.\n\nNeely, 30, was once among the city's corps of subway and street performers and was known for his Michael Jackson impersonations (Pictured in 2009)\n\nDespite a wave of public support and testimony from others on the train who said Penny acted out of bravery, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg's office pushed ahead with the prosecution\n\nManhattan DA Alvin Bragg was under pressure from protesters to bring charges against the Marine. Protests erupted near the Broadway Lafayette subway station where Neely died\n\n'I just wanted to keep him from getting to people,' he told detectives, demonstrating the chokehold and describing Neely as 'a crackhead' who was 'acting like a lunatic.'\n\n'I'm not trying to kill the guy,' he insisted.\n\nPenny did now take the stand in his own defense, with one of his lawyers noting that jurors did hear from Penny, in the form of his recorded statements to police minutes and hours after he put Neely in a chokehold.\n\n'Virtually everything he said then is consistent with credible testimony of his fellow passengers,' Penny's attorney Daniel Kenniff said.\n\nA key debate between the prosecution and defense was whether Neely died from the chokehold.\n\nProsecutors noted the veteran continued to grip Neely's neck after the train stopped and anyone who wanted to get out could do so, after bystanders urged Penny to let go, and even after Neely had been still for nearly a minute.\n\nMultiple witnesses said Neely shouted about needing food and something to drink, whipped his jacket to the floor and said he didn't care if he died or went to jail. They differed in descriptions of his movements and whether they were threatening. Several said they were alarmed by him and some were thankful when Penny subdued him.\n\nA number of other passengers testified that they were scared of Neely and relieved that Penny grabbed hold of him.\n\nDaniel Penny emerges from the NYPD's 5th Precinct after being booked on a single manslaughter charge last year\n\nA crowdfunding effort for the ex-Marine received over $3million in donations\n\nA man who later stepped in and held down Neely's arms, however, told jurors that he urged Penny to let go but that the veteran kept choking Neely for a time.\n\nThe defense contended Penny held on because Neely tried to break loose at points and that the pressure on the man's neck wasn't consistent enough to kill him.\n\nDr. Satish Chundru, who was called to testify by Penny's attorneys, blamed Neely's death on a combination of a sickle cell crisis and the effects of schizophrenia and synthetic marijuana.\n\nThe former Miami-area medical examiner's statement came in stark contrast to one delivered just days earlier, from the doctor who conducted the city's autopsy.\n\nCity official Dr. Cynthia Harris had maintained it was neither drugs nor the victim's genetic disorder that took Neely's life, while also ruling out cardiac arrest.\n\nDr. Alexander Bardey, a defense expert who reviewed Neely's medical history, said on the stand he suffered severe schizophrenia for years, including believing dead rapper Tupac Shakur was ordering him to 'change the world.'\n\nNeely also suffered 'paranoid fears that people want to hurt him,' 'grandiose delusions that people are jealous of him', and reported hearing 'the devil's voice.'\n\nDespite the shocking nature of Neely's history, Manhattan prosecutors had sought to bar Bardey's testimony from the trial, and attempted to have evidence of Neely's mental illness and drug abuse withheld from Penny's jury.\n\nPenny, a former infantry squad leader said he did not mean to kill Neely but that he felt like he needed to step in to protect fellow passengers\n\nPenny's military service, which included two deployments, earned him various ribbons and awards, and he reached the rank of sergeant before leaving active duty in 2021. He is seen with his three sisters and his mom\n\nIn his testimony, Bardey said he reviewed thousands of pages of Neely's medical records dating back to 2015.\n\nBardey previously worked for Rikers Island jail, and witnesses said Neely was screaming about his willingness to return to the prison when he threatened subway passengers.\n\nHe said he had worked on hundreds of cases involving schizophrenia patients, and said Neel's case was among the worst of his career.\n\n'His symptoms, I would classify as severe,' Bardey testified.\n\n'He describes paranoid fears that people want to hurt him, grandiose delusions that people are jealous of him, said that Tupac instructed him to change the world, and that's what he was doing.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

      "text": "Daniel Penny stands to make millions after not guilty verdict in Jordan Neely's death\n\nBy BRITTANY CHAIN FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 18:07 EDT, 9 December 2024 | Updated: 18:58 EDT, 9 December 2024\n\n249\n\nView comments\n\nDaniel Penny stands to make millions as a martyr of the BLM movement after being found not guilty following a blockbuster trial in Manhattan.\n\nThe 26-year-old Marine veteran was facing charges of second degree manslaughter and negligent homicide following the subway death of mentally ill homeless street performer Jordan Neely .\n\nBut after more than 20 hours of deliberations over four days, jurors told the court they were unable to reach a verdict on the manslaughter charge and the state sensationally withdrew the charge in a desperate, last ditch effort to avoid a mistrial.\n\nBy Monday, jurors returned a verdict of not guilty to negligent homicide to Justice Maxwell Wiley.\n\nThey quickly found him not guilty - paving the way for his bright future full of book deals, TV appearances and even a career in politics.\n\nSince the very beginning, Penny won sympathy from conservatives who said he was right to step in when Neely acted out on the subway.\n\nNow, with the trial behind him and renewed support from the likes of the Trump family, Penny's future is brighter than ever.\n\nDaniel Penny leaves Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday after being found not guilty of criminally negligent homicide. The manslaughter charge was dropped last week\n\nIndustry experts believe Penny could be in for a windfall in excess of $1million after the criminal case against him concludes.\n\n'He could become a symbolic figure for a certain segment of society, opening doors to mainstream and conservative media alike,' James Pipe is a legal expert and advocate at freegrantsforfelons.org, told Daily Mail.\n\nPipe noted a conviction would 'necessarily preclude offers' because publishers and producers are notoriously 'drawn to controversial figures.'\n\nHe said a 'compelling memoir or exclusive first interview' could be worth up to $500,000, while a documentary or film deal could exceed $1million.\n\n'A significant factor will be how Penny and his team handle public relations after the trial.\n\n'If he can frame his story in a way that resonates with the public or aligns with ongoing social conversations, the financial opportunities could be transformative,' Pipe said.\n\n'However, backlash or boycotts from opposition groups could dampen prospects.'\n\nPipe said Penny would also need to consider civil lawsuits against him, and how any 'post-trial earnings' could be impacted by those suits.\n\n'Public scrutiny will likely follow him for years, which could affect the longevity of his public persona and his ability to secure deals long-term,' he said.\n\nBefore the subway incident, Penny was a mild-mannered 24-year-old who'd left the Marines and spent time traveling the world\n\nPenny celebrated the court victory at the Stone Street Tavern on Monday afternoon\n\nValerie Zucker said she envisions a 'one hour special or documentary' in the future.\n\nShe said there could be hurdles to face 'from Neely's' camp, but that immediately after the trial would be a great time for Penny to 'clear the air and change public perception on his vision of what took place that day.'\n\nAnd while Penny is still a divisive figure amongst the public, Zucker said there could be a pathway into politics for Penny down the track.\n\n'I don't think [it happens] right away,' she said. 'There's some backlash.\n\n'Maybe something in the future.'\n\nPenny's acquittal enraged BLM activists, who instantly called for revenge in the form of black vigilantes.\n\nThe 26-year-old quickly dashed to a downtown bar to celebrate his win with his lawyers and ponder his next move.\n\nEven before the verdict came back, there were calls from Republicans for him to be heralded a hero.\n\nRep. Eli Crane, R-Arizona has been so impressed by Penny and his swift action against Neely that, according to Fox, he wants to award him Congress ' highest civilian honor - a Congressional Gold Medal.\n\n'Daniel Penny's actions exemplify what it means to stand against the grain to do right in a world that rewards moral cowardice,' he said.\n\nHe went on to describe the justice system as 'corrupt' and one which 'allows degenerates to steamroll our laws and our sense of security, while punishing the righteous.\n\n'Mr. Penny bravely stood in the gap to defy this corrupt system and protect his fellow Americans. I'm immensely proud to introduce this resolution to award him with the Congressional Gold Medal to recognize his heroism,' he said.\n\nThe Marine veteran has kept a dignified silence since he was charged in May 2023\n\nPenny with his mother, Gina Flaim, on November 19\n\nPenny intervened when Neely jumped on the train and began threatening other commuters, including mothers, children and students. Neely was shouting that somebody would 'die' and that he was willing to 'go back to Rikers.'\n\nHe placed Neely in a chokehold which the state argued lasted six minutes. His defense told jurors that he was not applying consistent pressure for the length of that time, and that he was simply restraining Neely until police arrived.\n\nAnd while New York's 'Son of Sam' laws prevent convicted criminals from selling their stories to publishers, Penny is innocent and has been convicted of no crime .\n\nHe could theoretically sell his sensational life story to the highest bidder, or write a book himself about the ordeal.\n\nLegal expert and advocate at freegrantsforfelons.org James Pipe told DailyMail.com Penny could be in for a windfall in excess of $1million.\n\n'He could become a symbolic figure for a certain segment of society, opening doors to mainstream and conservative media alike,' he said.\n\nPipe noted a conviction would 'necessarily preclude offers' because publishers and producers are notoriously 'drawn to controversial figures.'\n\nHe said a 'compelling memoir or exclusive first interview' could be worth up to $500,000, while a documentary or film deal could exceed $1million.\n\n'A significant factor will be how Penny and his team handle public relations after the trial. If he can frame his story in a way that resonates with the public or aligns with ongoing social conversations, the financial opportunities could be transformative,' Pipe said.\n\n'However, backlash or boycotts from opposition groups could dampen prospects.'\n\nSimilarly, Valerie Zucker of Zucker Media Group said she envisions a 'one hour special or documentary' in the future.\n\nShe said there could be hurdles to face 'from Neely's' camp, but that immediately after the trial would be a great time for Penny to 'clear the air and change public perception on his vision of what took place that day.'\n\nAnd while Penny is still a divisive figure amongst the public, Zucker said there could be a pathway into politics for Penny down the track.\n\n'I don't think [it happens] right away,' she said. 'There's some backlash.\n\n'Maybe something in the future.'\n\nThe case has already attracted interest from several writers who have been present daily in the courtroom and are working on books about the outcome.\n\nWith true-crime documentaries on the rise, there is also a strong possibility that Penny will find himself back in the spotlight via a streaming special about the case.\n\nConservatives have long offered support for Penny since the case gained widespread national attention and became a lightning rod for racial debate.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy donated $10,000 to Daniel Penny's staggering legal fund, which has now reached $3million. He has also repeatedly spoken out about Neely's lengthy rap sheet, accusing the Manhattan District Attorney's office of sharing 'responsibility for his death for creating an anti law enforcement culture.'\n\n'Habitual felons like Neely should not roam freely to terrorize and prey on innocent members of our communities,' he said.\n\nPenny also has the strong backing of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis , sparking questions about if Penny would consider a tilt in politics himself, given he has access to two recent presidential candidates.\n\nThe May 2023 incident sparked uproar in America - BLM says it was the racist killing of a mentally ill black man by an overzealous white military faithful.\n\nWith the trial out of the way, Penny is also free to return his attention to his studies. When he was charged, he was studying architecture at the New York City College of Technology.\n\nHe was also working two jobs - one as a swim teacher and also at a restaurant in Brooklyn - which he gave up to focus on the trial.\n\nHe is also not completely out of the woods after Neely's family filed a civil lawsuit against Penny last week. Penny's legal team, Thomas Kenniff and Steven Raiser, released a statement Friday afternoon revealing they will immediately set their sights on the lawsuit.\n\nThe duo said the conclusion of the criminal trial would 'allow us to focus on the civil lawsuit, filed two days ago, for the same allegations contained in the criminal indictment.'\n\nPipe said Penny would also need to consider civil lawsuits against him when he considers what his next step will be, because any 'post-trial earnings' could be impacted by those suits.\n\n'Public scrutiny will likely follow him for years, which could affect the longevity of his public persona and his ability to secure deals long-term,' he said.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Neely died shortly afterward.\n\nFollowing a six-week trial at Manhattan Supreme Court , prosecutors made a bombshell decision to drop the manslaughter charge against him as the jury remained deadlocked.\n\nMarine veteran Daniel Penny, 26, received the coveted Semper Fidelis achievement award by the Marine Corps League at Iwo Jima Day in Boston\n\nOutside of the State House, Brig. General Enoch 'Woody' Woodhouse, one of the Tuskegee Airmen, took Penny's hand, looked him in the eye and said, 'I'm proud of you son'\n\nPushing ahead with lesser charges of negligent homicide, the jury returned a not-guilty verdict days later, prompting a small smile from Penny in the courtroom.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's ceremony, John M. MacGillivray, of the Marine Corps League wrote that the award goes to 'worthy and inspirational recipients'.\n\n'We believe that Daniel Penny and attorneys Raiser and Kenniff deserve such recognition and hope that they will consent to accept these awards,' he said.\n\nRaiser, in turn, said he, Kenniff and Penny 'were honored to be in the same room being honored alongside many veterans of prior wars, including an Iwo Jima veteran and a retired general who served as one of the Tuskegee Airmen.'\n\nKenniff also noted that outside of the State House, Brig. General Enoch 'Woody' Woodhouse, one of the Tuskegee Airmen, took Penny's hand, looked him in the eye and said, 'I'm proud of you son.'\n\n'That is a moment I don't think any of us will forget,' he said.\n\nWhile the veterans honored Penny for his heroism, others were left outraged by his acquittal.\n\nNeely's father, Andre Zachery, for example, blasted the decision outside the courthouse.\n\n'It really, really hurts,' he said. 'I had enough of this. The system is rigged.'\n\nPenny was acquitted of the manslaughter of Michael Jackson impersonator Jordan Neely, 30\n\nThe ex-Marine placed Neely, 30, into a chokehold for roughly six minutes, as caught on camera\n\nBlack Lives Matter leader Walter 'Hawk' Newsome, who said he was Neely's uncle, even went as far as threatening Penny in the courtroom with 'black vigilante' action.\n\nHe shouted, 'it's a small f**king world, buddy', amid the chaos which followed the verdict being announced at Manhattan Supreme Court on December 9.\n\nThen, speaking to media and later protesters outside the courthouse, Newsome said it was time for 'black vigilantes.'\n\n'Everybody else has vigilantes. We need some black vigilantes,' he said.\n\n'People want to jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud, how about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us.'\n\nFollowing a six-week trial at Manhattan Supreme Court , prosecutors made a bombshell decision to drop the manslaughter charge against him as the jury remained deadlocked\n\nSome protested Penny's acquittal outside the Manhattan Criminal Court\n\nBut the day after being found not guilty, Penny sat down with Judge Jeanine Pirro and said he would have felt responsible 'if someone did get hurt' after he said Neely threatened to kill people onboard the train.\n\n'The guilt I would've felt if someone did get hurt, if he did do what he was threatening to do, I would never be able to live with myself,' Penny said.\n\nHe told the former judge that he felt that he was 'in a very vulnerable position' as he held Neely back on the floor of an F train.\n\n'He was just threatening to kill people. He was threatening to go to jail forever, go to jail for the rest of his life, and now I'm on the ground with him.\n\n'I'm on my back in a very vulnerable position... If I just let him go, now I'm on my back and he can turn around and start doing what he said - to me... killing, hurting,' Penny explained.\n\nAlthough the case sparked whirlwind attention across the nation, Penny said he is 'not a confrontational person' and someone who prefers to stay out of the spotlight.\n\nPenny has now been picked up by Silicon Valley investment firm Andreessen Horowitz\n\nHe has now been picked up by Silicon Valley investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, according to an internal memo obtained by The Free Press .\n\n'He will learn the business of investing and he will work to support our portfolio companies,' David Ulevitch, a general partner at the firm, wrote in the note.\n\nThe finance heavyweight addressed Penny's seismic court case , which bitterly divided Americans across racial, political and social lines.\n\nUlevitch praised Penny's 'courage' and urged fellow employees at the investment firm not to reduce him to 'the worst moment' in his life.\n\n'I believe, as I know many of you do, that Daniel acted with courage in a tough situation,' he wrote in the memo to staff.

      "text": "Daniel Penny prosecutors show shocking evidence to jury before they begin deliberations - as former Marine stands accused of killing homeless man Jordan Neely\n\nBy BRITTANY CHAIN IN MANHATTAN FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 13:32 EDT, 3 December 2024 | Updated: 20:48 EDT, 3 December 2024\n\n827\n\nView comments\n\nProsecutors have shown grisly evidence at Daniel Penny 's trial just moments before the judge sent the jury for deliberations.\n\nThe 26-year-old Marine veteran denies charges of manslaughter and negligent homicide after the May 2023 death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway car.\n\nNeely died on the floor of the uptown-bound F train in Manhattan after Penny placed him in a chokehold for six minutes to stop him threatening commuters .\n\nAssistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran on Tuesday displayed a graphic photo of inside Neely's eye, taken during an autopsy after his death, which shocked the room.\n\nThe image was blasted across four screens - two facing the jury, a third facing the viewing gallery and a fourth directly in front of the defendant.\n\nMeanwhile Penny's lawyer tore into the prosecution after journalists were peppered with emails from the DA's office ordering them to include certain details in their stories.\n\nIn his closing arguments defense attorney Steven Raiser pointed out no expert witness during the trial could prove key elements beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nHe also accused the government of bowing to public pressure, and feeling compelled to make a quick arrest due to the media attention in the case.\n\nDaniel Penny arrives at Manhattan Supreme Court Tuesday as closing arguments in his case over the subway killing of a homeless man were heard\n\nAssistant DA Yoran on Tuesday warned the jury their verdict should not rely upon whether they themselves would be grateful for Penny's intervention, or weigh testimony from the Marine veteran's loved ones that he is a 'good man.'\n\n'What is so tragic about this case, is that even though the defendant started out doing the right thing... a man died,' she said.\n\n'He was given all the signs he needed to stop. He ignored them. He must be held accountable for that.'\n\nShe continued: 'You're not here to decide whether you'd want to ride alone on the train with Jordan Neely.\n\n'That is not what this case is about. The only thing you need to determine here is whether or not the evidence here proves the defendant killed Jordan Neely.'\n\nYoran implored the jury to find Penny guilty of manslaughter - a charge which carries a maximum term of 15 years behind bars.\n\nShe told jurors in great detail how Mr Neely 'clawed at his own neck with his nails' as he fought against the chokehold in those crucial first few minutes, before ultimately urinating on himself and losing consciousness.\n\nShe described the negligent homicide charge - the lesser of the two - as essentially a fallback charge which should be applied if the jury is not convinced Penny committed manslaughter.\n\n'You, the jurors, should unequivocally state with your verdict that no person's life can be so unjustifiably snuffed out,' she said.\n\nProsecutors have told Daniel Penny 's manslaughter trial that the former Marine 'knew he had eliminated the threat' before he released mentally ill homeless man Jordan Neely\n\nA court sketch shows Penny sitting next to his defense attorney Steven Raiser as Raiser addressed jurors\n\n'If the defendant is not justified in killing Mr Neely, then killing him is a crime. But what crime is it? Manslaughter in the 2nd degree is a reckless killing - not intentional.'\n\nYoran told jurors being 'reckless' in this case, requires Penny to have been aware his actions put Mr Neely at 'substantial risk of death.'\n\n'You have to be aware, and that what you're doing is a major departure from what a reasonable person would do,' she said.\n\n'If you do not believe the defendant was consciously aware, that is criminally negligent homicide - that is the failure to perceive the risk,' she said.\n\n'The difference is known, or should have known.' Ms Yoran claimed the evidence shows that Penny was aware of the consequences of his actions.\n\n'The defendant has just spent the last six minutes glued to Mr Neely's back... all to make sure he doesn't attack anyone or get away,' she said.\n\nSharing footage of Penny standing to the side of the train immediately after ending the chokehold, Yoran asked jurors to consider why he felt comfortable at this point in stepping away.\n\n'Why is he not concerned about that, all of a sudden? Because he knows Mr Neely is no longer a threat. That he is out.\n\n'If the defendant believed that all he had done was render Mr Neely temporarily unconscious, he would have immediately moved to secure him in another way because he would have believed Mr Neely would wake up at any second and either attack someone or run away.\n\n'If he was going to have revived, he would have revived in a matter of seconds. The defendant clearly knows Mr Neely is not waking up any time soon.\n\n'There is only one explanation for that: he knows Mr Neely is not going to wake up. He knows he has eliminated the threat.'\n\nMs Yafna also cited Penny's Marine Corps training, arguing that he should have had a clearer understanding of the risks of his actions given his military experience.\n\n'Beyond that, she said it is 'common sense.' 'We all know we need air to breathe and that it goes through your throat.\n\nPenny's fate is now in the hands of jurors, who are deliberating\n\nDaniel Penny (pictured) has been at the center of a four-week trial\n\nPenny is pictured holding Jordan Neely in a chokehold on a NYC subway train on May 1 2023\n\n'You know how fragile throats are. It's hard to imagine that there is anyone out there who wouldn't be aware of that possibility - if not probability.'\n\nWhile Yafna argued she does not have to prove a motive, she said it was clear based on the evidence that Penny had overlooked Mr Neely's 'humanity.'\n\nShe shared footage from Penny's police interview in which he repeatedly referred to Neely as 'just a crackhead.'\n\nAt the time, Penny did not know Neely was dead. He also was not aware that police had brought in the District Attorney's office, who were behind double-sided glass and instructing police which questions to ask, according to the defense.\n\nBut Yoran said it was telling that Penny never once asked about Neely's wellbeing during this interview.\n\n'During his whole interview, the defendant never says 'oh hey, how is that guy doing? Is he okay? Did he make it?' Imagine not even caring enough to ask that.\n\n'The defendant, as empathetic as he may be, seems to have a real blind spot for Mr Neely,' she said.\n\n'Maybe we, too, have othered them. Lumping them all together like this the way he does. But the context is telling here.\n\n'When the defendant is talking like this, he knows he very likely killed him. Can you imagine a reasonable person speaking like this about a human being that he or she had just killed?\n\n'There is something else that is glaringly missing in this statement. Any regret. Any remorse. Any self-reflection of 'maybe I went too far.' Earlier on Monday, the defense rested their case.\n\nDefense attorney Steven Raiser told jurors that closing first put his case at a slight disadvantage - because he would have no further opportunity to respond to the claims Ms Yoran would make in her own closing arguments.\n\nAs such, he urged jurors to consider what he and his legal team would say in response if given the opportunity, based on the evidence presented.\n\nHe had earlier asked jurors to imagine they themselves were on the train when Neely approached.\n\nRaiser argued that even the state's own expert witnesses couldn't prove key elements beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n'If their own experts have doubt... why shouldn't you?' He asked the 12 jurors who have listened to four weeks of intense testimony.\n\nRaiser showed footage of the train carriage and used audio of train doors opening and closing, helping to set the scene he was trying to get jurors to envision.\n\n'Imagine you're on that train too. Strangers brought together by fate,' he said.\n\n'The doors begin to close, but a hand reaches in and pries the doors open again... you see a look in Jordan Neely's eyes described... as violent and desperate.\n\n'Where do you go? Nowhere. There is nowhere to go. Who will he hurt? Will it be me? Will it be my child? Will it be my friend?'\n\nRaiser described those commuters as 'frozen in fear.' He told jurors there was an obvious reason that there was no footage of Neely's outburst - they were too scared to move.\n\nThe first video evidence begins a minute after Penny got Neely to the ground, and captures much of the remainder of the ordeal, including the distressing moments Neely took his last breath.\n\nRaiser quoted several experts and witnesses who testified during the trial. He reminded the jurors that Neely was described as one of 'the most severely psychotic cases' one medical professional has 'ever seen.'\n\nHe also noted that Neely had synthetic drugs in his system - namely K2 - and that first responders opted to issue Narcan, used to reverse the effects of opioids, before they administered CPR.\n\nBeyond those details, Raiser told the jury that the state failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nHe said there were doubts about Neely's cause of death, and about whether the threshold of what constitutes a chokehold death had even been met.\n\nRaiser argued that the state's own witness, the medical examiner, had raised doubts about whether he fell unconscious first or if Neely was in the early stages of dying during the time frame the state argues he first fell unconscious.\n\n'Unconsciousness always precedes death in a chokehold death,' he told the jury. 'Why are we here with such an utter lack of evidence?' Raiser asked.\n\nAnswering his own question, Raiser accused the government of bowing to public pressure, and feeling compelled to make a quick arrest due to the media attention and widespread protests the case sparked.\n\n'The case was marked as high profile,' he noted.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

He already has an author page on the firm's website (shown above), with his headshot pictured beside their logo\n\nHe will be working for the firm's American Dynamism branch, which 'invests in founders and companies that support the national interest', according to the page.\n\nUlevitch said Penny will strengthen the firm's relationships with the Department of Defense and public safety sector, drawing on his military background.\n\nIt's a major comeback for Penny, whose fate hung in the balance just two months ago when he faced up to 20 years in prison if convicted over Neely's death.\n\nPenny's life changed forever on May 1, 2023, when Neely, a black homeless man and Michael Jackson impersonator with more than 40 previous arrests, wandered into his subway car.\n\nNeely, 30, who had a history of mental illness, began 'threatening' passengers , until Penny placed him in a chokehold he had learned during his time in the Marines for roughly six minutes, as caught on camera. Neely died shortly afterward.\n\nPenny faced a six-week trial at Manhattan Supreme Court, in what became one of New York City's most high-profile cases. The courtroom was packed out with journalists and the families of both Penny and Neely.\n\nThe former Marine's freedom hung by a thread at the conclusion of his trial in December when prosecutors made a bombshell decision to drop the manslaughter charge against him, due to the jury being deadlocked.\n\nPushing ahead with lesser charges of negligent homicide, the jury returned a not-guilty verdict days later, prompting a small smile from Penny in the courtroom.\n\nNeely's father, Andre Zachery, blasted the decision outside the courthouse. 'It really, really hurts,' he said. 'I had enough of this. The system is rigged.'\n\nPenny with his mother, Gina Flaim, on November 19\n\nSome hailed Penny as a 'hero' for defending fellow New Yorkers from a threatening passenger, while others felt that Neely deserved justice through a conviction.\n\nBlack Lives Matter condemned the incident as a racist killing of a mentally ill black man by an overzealous white military faithful.\n\nOne of their leaders, Walter 'Hawk' Newsome, who said he was Neely's uncle, even went as far as threatening Penny in the courtroom with 'black vigilante' action.\n\nHe shouted, 'it's a small f**king world, buddy', amid the chaos which followed the verdict being announced at Manhattan Supreme Court on December 9.\n\nThen, speaking to media and later protesters outside the courthouse, Newsome said it was time for 'black vigilantes.'\n\n'Everybody else has vigilantes. We need some black vigilantes,' he said.\n\n'People want to jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud, how about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us.'\n\nThe day after being found not guilty, Penny sat down with Judge Jeanine Pirro and revealed that he would have felt responsible 'if someone did get hurt' after the Neely threatened to kill people onboard the train.\n\n'The guilt I would've felt if someone did get hurt, if he did do what he was threatening to do, I would never be able to live with myself,' Penny said.\n\nNeely's father, Andre Zachery, blasted the decision outside the courthouse. 'It really, really hurts,' he said. 'I had enough of this. The system is rigged.' (Pictured: Jordan Neely)\n\nPenny, 26, joined President-elect Donald Trump and future Vice President JD Vance at the Army-Navy game in December 2024, days after he was acquitted in the Manhattan trial\n\nHe told the former judge that he felt that he was 'in a very vulnerable position' as he held Neely back on the floor of an F train.\n\n'He was just threatening to kill people. He was threatening to go to jail forever, go to jail for the rest of his life, and now I'm on the ground with him.\n\n'I'm on my back in a very vulnerable position... If I just let him go, now I'm on my back and he can turn around and start doing what he said - to me... killing, hurting,' Penny explained.\n\nAlthough the case sparked whirlwind attention across the nation, Penny said he is 'not a confrontational person' and someone who prefers to stay out of the spotlight.\n\nPenny was last spotted back on the subway reading a book in mid-January. He appeared relaxed and wore a scarf covering his hair in a photograph shared online.\n\nHe has received support from President Donald Trump who invited him to his suite as a VIP guest along with JD Vance for an Army-Navy football game in December.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

(Pictured: Trump, Penny and Vance in the suite)\n\n'Standing alongside courageous Americans like Daniel Penny was special, as he embodies the courage of our nation's warriors, both in and out of uniform,' she told the New York Post.\n\n'This game is not just about football; it's a heartfelt tribute to service and unity, reminding us of the sacrifices made for our freedoms.'\n\nThomas Kenniff, Penny's head attorney, told the outlet that the Long Island native was 'very humbled and grateful to be invited.'\n\nPenny was arrested in May 2023 after he held Neely, a Michael Jackson impersonator, in a chokehold for a duration that resulted in the victim's death .\n\nAfter a bombshell decision to drop the manslaughter charge on December 6 , the jury returned days later where they decided that Penny did not commit criminally negligent homicide by subduing Neely.\n\nPenny and Vance are seen inside the suite during Saturday's game at Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland\n\nDefense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth , House Speaker Mike Johnson, Director of National Intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard , Florida Governor Ron DeSantis , and Tesla CEO Elon Musk were all in attendance\n\nA day after being found not guilty, Penny sat down with Judge Jeanine Pirro and revealed that he would have felt responsible 'if someone did get hurt' after the homeless man threatened to kill people onboard the train.\n\n'The guilt I would've felt if someone did get hurt, if he did do what he was threatening to do, I would never be able to live with myself,' Penny said.\n\nHe told the former judge that he felt that he was 'in a very vulnerable position' as he held Neely back on the floor of an F train.\n\n'He was just threatening to kill people.

This type of thing is very uncomfortable. All this attention and lime light is very uncomfortable.\n\n'I didn't want any attention or praise, and I still don't,' he said, adding that he's come to terms with it because his actions saved the lives of others.\n\n'And I'll take a million court appearances and people calling me names and people hating me just to keep one of those people from getting hurt, or killed.'\n\nThe case itself and Penny's ultimate acquittal enraged BLM activists, who instantly called for revenge in the form of black vigilantes.\n\nDuring his interview, Penny also mentioned the 'self-serving' officials who used the fatal incident as part of a 'political game'.\n\nDespite not mentioning anyone directly, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, who spearheaded the case against Penny , has come under fire since the verdict was announced.\n\n'These are their policies. And I don't mean to get political, I really don't' want to make any enemies, really - although I guess I have already,' he told Pirro.\n\n'But these are their policies that have clearly not worked, that the people, the general population, are not in support. Yet, their egos are too big to agree that they're wrong.'\n\nAfter walking free, the 26-year-old quickly dashed to a downtown bar to celebrate his win with his lawyers and ponder his next move.\n\nPenny told Judge Jeanine Pirro that he would have felt responsible if someone did get hurt' after the homeless man threatened to kill people onboard the train that day\n\nNeely (pictured), who struggled with drug abuse and mental illness, has a criminal record that included assault convictions\n\nEven before the verdict came back, there were calls from Republicans for him to be heralded a hero.\n\nRep. Eli Crane, R-Arizona has been so impressed by Penny and his swift action against Neely that, according to Fox, he wants to award him Congress' highest civilian honor - a Congressional Gold Medal.\n\n'Daniel Penny's actions exemplify what it means to stand against the grain to do right in a world that rewards moral cowardice,' he said.\n\nHe went on to describe the justice system as 'corrupt' and one which 'allows degenerates to steamroll our laws and our sense of security, while punishing the righteous.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy - who will co-lead Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with Musk - donated $10,000 to Daniel Penny's staggering legal fund, which has since reached $3million.\n\nHe has also repeatedly spoken out about Neely's lengthy rap sheet, accusing the Manhattan District Attorney's office of sharing 'responsibility for his death for creating an anti law enforcement culture.'\n\nNeely was once among the city's corps of subway and street performers and was known for his Michael Jackson impersonations. He struggled with drug abuse and a mental illness, and had a criminal record that included assault convictions.\n\nPenny faced 15 years in prison for charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally-negligent homicide after the incident on the subway car last spring, which was partially recorded and sparked a passionate national debate.\n\nAfter finding him not guilty, cheering and clapping erupted in the courtroom by some, while Neely's family yelled horrendous threats, calling Penny a 'racist c**t' and warning: 'It's a small world, buddy,' before being escorted out.\n\nPenny's lawyers argued he acted in self-defense and in defense of other passengers after Neely terrorized their subway car and threatened them, but prosecutors say he overstepped into vigilantism and criminally killed Neely with a chokehold.\n\nWith the trial out of the way, Penny is free to return his attention to his studies. When he was charged, he was studying architecture at the New York City College of Technology.\n\nHe was also working two jobs - one as a swim teacher and also at a restaurant in Brooklyn - which he gave up to focus on the trial.\n\nHe is also not completely out of the woods after Neely's family filed a civil lawsuit against Penny last week.\n\nPenny's legal team, Kenniff and Steven Raiser, said they will immediately set their sights on the lawsuit against their client.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

He ignored them. He must be held accountable for that.'\n\nShe continued: 'You're not here to decide whether you'd want to ride alone on the train with Jordan Neely.\n\n'That is not what this case is about. The only thing you need to determine here is whether or not the evidence here proves the defendant killed Jordan Neely.'\n\nYafna also noted that Penny is a Marine Corps veteran, arguing that he should have had a clearer understanding of the risks of his actions given his military experience.\n\nShe implored the jury to find Penny guilty of manslaughter - a charge which carries a maximum term of 15 years behind bars.\n\nDaniel Penny pictured in a court sketch at the Manhattan Criminal Court on December 3\n\nNew York police officers administer CPR to Neely on the New York subway car\n\nThe jury listens as assistant district attorney Dafna Yoran (not seen) presents closing arguments as Judge Maxwell Wiley presides in the trial of Daniel Penny\n\nPenny has denied both the charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.\n\nDeliberations are expected to continue Thursday, as protesters continue to gather outside the Manhattan courthouse to decry Penny and declare their support for a manslaughter charge.\n\nBut some of the protesters have become aggressive, defense attorney Thomas Kenniff said on Wednesday, describing how one man followed Penny to a car that was waiting for him after the trial one day and started banging on the doors.\n\nThe same man, he said, was 'repeatedly berating Mr Penny with violent and homophobic slurs' when he arrived at court on Wednesday.\n\nKenniff noted that the man had been in the courtroom audience and asked Wiley to bar the man from future proceedings.\n\nWiley - who said he saw the confrontation from his office window - declined, noting that the public has a right to access court proceedings.\n\nHe said that court officers occasionally 'limited people's access' because of their conduct inside the courtroom, but he was not inclined to eject anyone over their outside behavior.\n\nAt that point, Penny's lawyers expressed their concern that the jury may hear the protesters, but Wiley noted that he told the jurors to ignore anything they may hear from outside.\n\n'At this point, I think that we will assume that they're following their instructions,' the judge said.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Fox News contributor Paul Mauro and former NYPD lieutenant Darrin Porcher also weigh in on the case during 'America's Newsroom.'\n\nNEW YORK - Daniel Penny has been found not guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely.\n\nIt comes after jurors told the court Friday morning they couldn't reach an agreement on the top charge, second-degree manslaughter, and prosecutors moved to dismiss it, prompting the judge to controversially allow them to only deliberate the second charge.\n\nPenny, a 26-year-old Marine veteran and architecture student, was charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide for the subway chokehold death of Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia who barged onto the train shouting death threats while high on a type of synthetic marijuana known as K2.\n\nPenny's side of the courtroom erupted in cheers, prompting an angry response from Neely's side, including his father, Andre Zachary, who was escorted out of the courthouse along with several Black Lives Matter leaders after allegedly snapping.\n\nDANIEL PENNY RETURNS TO COURT FOR CLOSING ARGUMENTS IN SUBWAY CHOKEHOLD TRIAL\n\nDaniel Penny, center, poses for a photo while gathered at a bar with his attorneys, Steven Raiser, left, and Thomas Kenniff after being acquitted of criminally negligent homicide, Monday, Dec. 9, 2024, in New York.

However, he also condemned \"unacceptable\" behavior that he said had targeted his prosecutors.\n\nScreenshot from bystander video showing Jordan Neely being held in a chokehold on the New York City subway. (Luces de Nueva York/Juan Alberto Vazquez via Storyful)\n\n\"Unfortunately, over the duration of this trial, talented career prosecutors and their family members were besieged with hate and threats - on social media, by phone and over email,\" he said. \"Simply put, this is unacceptable, and everyone, no matter your opinion on this case, should condemn it.\"\n\nMaud Maron, a former public defender and parents' rights advocate who is running to unseat Bragg, condemned her opponent for bringing the case to begin with.\n\n\"The NYPD Officers who initially interviewed Daniel Penny and declined to arrest him got it right,\" she told Fox News Digital. :The Manhattan jury who heard all the evidence, deliberated and returned a verdict of not guilty got it right. The New Yorkers and their fellow Americans who were rooting for Daniel Penny as a hero and understood he should never have been charged in the first place got it right. The only person who got this wrong was Alvin Bragg. DA Bragg has pursued a reckless ideological agenda since his first day in office. Manhattan deserves a district attorney who will defend all New Yorkers, apply the law fairly and make Daniel Penny's heroism unnecessary by cleaning up the subways and streets of New York City.\"\n\nJordan Neely is pictured before going to see the Michael Jackson movie, \"This is It,\" outside the Regal Cinemas on 8th Avenue and 42nd Street in Times Square, New York, in 2009. (Andrew Savulich/New York Daily News/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)\n\nThe incident happened on May 1, 2023. Neely barged onto an F train in Manhattan screaming death threats. Witnesses testified that Neely's threats scared them more than a typical subway outburst would. They were thankful for Penny's intervention.\n\nNeely had a lengthy criminal record , an active arrest warrant, a history of psychosis and was high on K2, a synthetic form of marijuana that pathologists described as a stimulant. He also had the sickle cell trait genetic disorder.\n\nJust three days earlier, a straphanger had been stabbed with an ice pick on a J train, according to reports from the time . It was about a month after a PBS reporter got sucker punched on a No. 4 train. There was a shove a week before that, and the victim hit the side of a moving R train and survived .\n\nIn that climate of fear, witnesses said they were terrified by Neely, who shouted death threats at them.\n\nDaniel Penny was not found guilty in the death of Jordan Neely. Daniel Penny made a hasty exit from the courts after the verdict with his attorneys, Manhattan, New York, U.S., December 9, 2024 (Rashid Umar Abbasi for Fox News Digital)\n\nWitness Ivette Rosario, a 19-year-old student, testified that Neely shouted someone would \"die that day.\"\n\n\"I got scared by the tone that he was saying it,\" she said. \"I have seen situations, but not like that.\n\nPenny, in a voluntary interview with police after the incident, raised concerns about a series of subway shoving incidents involving mentally ill people on the city's transit system.\n\nDaniel Penny arrives at Manhattan Supreme Court in New York, NY on Tuesday, Dec. 3, 2024. (Rashid Umar Abbasi for Fox News Digital)\n\n\"He was talking gibberish...but these guys are pushing people in front of trains and stuff,\" he told detectives. There were more than 20 subway shoves in the year before Penny's encounter with Neely. He was released without charges after the interview.\n\nKyle Rittenhouse, who was also acquitted at trial after shooting three men in self-defense at a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest, congratulated Penny in a post on X.\n\nBut Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office secured a grand jury indictment days later, and Penny was arrested on May 12.\n\nJurors deliberated for a little less than four hours Tuesday and all day Wednesday, sending several notes to the judge. Among the items they asked for were videos of the chokehold and of Penny's interview with police, as well as the judge's instructions regarding justification for physical force and the definitions of recklessness and negligence.\n\nPenny would have faced a maximum sentence of four years in prison if convicted of the lesser charge.\n\nDaniel Penny arrives at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse building in New York City on Monday, Nov. 25, 2024 for the start of closing arguments.

I'm on my back in a very vulnerable position...If I'd just let him go, now I'm on my back and he can just turn around and start doing what he said - to me...killing, hurting.\"\n\nPenny was arrested in May 2023 nearly two weeks after he was questioned and released following a deadly encounter with Neely, who was high on drugs and threatening to kill people on a Manhattan F train when the 26-year-old architecture student grabbed him in a headlock from behind.\n\nWATCH: EXCLUSIVE DANIEL PENNY INTERVIEW ON FOX NATION\n\nDaniel Penny sits across from Fox News' Judge Jeanine Pirro for his first televised interview following his acquittal in the subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely (FOX Nation)\n\nThe guilt I would've felt if someone did get hurt, if he did do what he was threatening to do, I would never be able to live with myself. And I'll take a million court appearances and people calling me names and people hating me just to keep one of those people from getting hurt, or killed.\n\nPenny described himself as a non-confrontational person. He said all the attention he's received since the incident - strong praise from some, demonization from others - makes him uncomfortable.\n\n\"I didn't want any attention or praise, and I still don't,\" he said. \"The guilt I would've felt if someone did get hurt, if he did do what he was threatening to do, I would never be able to live with myself.

He had schizophrenia and a drug abuse problem. Three days before his encounter with Penny, a subway rider had been stabbed on another train with an ice pick, according to prior reporting. A PBS reporter had been sucker punched on another train, and more than 20 people had been shoved off of subway platforms in the year leading up to Penny's arrest.\n\nDaniel Penny arrives at Manhattan Criminal Courthouse in New York City on Monday, December 9, 2024.

Penny even referenced those other cases in a voluntary interview he gave to police after remaining on scene.\n\n\"He was talking gibberish...but these guys are pushing people in front of trains and stuff,\" he told detectives.

They were also grateful and relieved Penny intervened to protect them.\"\n\nJUDGE DENIES MARINE VET DANIEL PENNY'S MOTION FOR MISTRIAL IN SUBWAY CHOKE HOLD CASE DESPITE 'BIAS'\n\nA court sketch depicts Laurie Sitro giving testimony in Daniel Penny's trial at Manhattan Supreme Court in New York City on Nov. 8, 2024. Penny, a Marine veteran, is on trial for the 2023 death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway. (Jane Rosenberg)\n\nJudge Maxwell Wiley denied defense attorney Thomas Kenniff's motion to declare a mistrial on Thursday despite his concerns of \"bias\" from the witness and the prosecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's Office.\n\nKenniff described Neely as an \"unhinged nutjob\" and is arguing that Penny's actions were justified defense of himself and other passengers on the car. Wiley rejected the mistrial but told Kenniff, \"I see what you're getting at.\"\n\nWiley has a reputation for being fair to all sides, according to Louis Gelormino, a Staten Island-based defense attorney who told Fox News Digital he's tried homicide cases in front of the judge.\n\n\"He's very fair,\" he said. \"He gives a lot of thought to his decisions. I don't think he leans liberal or conservative, either way.\"\n\nDANIEL PENNY TRIAL: SUBWAY MADMAN RAISED FISTS BEFORE MARINE VET'S DEADLY CHOKEHOLD, WITNESS TESTIFIES\n\nA court sketch depicts Arethia Gittings giving testimony in Daniel Penny's trial at Manhattan Supreme Court in New York City on Nov. 8, 2024. (Jane Rosenberg)\n\nHowever, he said, Penny's defense is right to be concerned about the prosecution's apparent attempt to smear their client with racial undertones, given that he hasn't been accused of a hate crime.\n\n\"It seems like the prosecutors are trying to paint him as a racist,\" he said. \"That's the biggest argument from the defense ... combined with Grima's testimony. It's right at the line.\"\n\nThe defense argued that Penny is not getting a fair trial and raised a number of objections, saying the prosecution was trying to paint Penny as a \"White vigilante\" and improperly allowed witness Johnny Grima, a homeless man with a conviction for bashing someone with a bat, to call the defendant a \"murderer\" from the witness stand when he has not been accused of murder.\n\nOn Friday, Wiley denied a subsequent motion from Kenniff to have Grima's testimony stricken from the record. He said he could include a special instruction to jurors about witness testimony instead.\n\nA court sketch depicts Daniel Penny and prosecutor Dafna Yoran on the first day of testimony in Penny's trial at Manhattan Supreme Court in New York City on Nov. 1, 2024. (Jane Rosenberg)\n\n\"That's the point of the defense: This isn't a hate crime,\" Gelormino said. \"This isn't a racial issue. Nobody's declared it a racial issue.\"\n\nAt least not officially, but Kenniff pointed out in court that Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Danfa Yoran, in opening statements, hinted at a racial undertone by alleging that Penny \"didn't recognize Mr. Neely's humanity.\" Another prosecutor allowed a witness to repeatedly refer to Penny as \"the White man.\"\n\nTEEN WITNESS TO JORDAN NEELY CHOKE HOLD TESTIFIES SHE WAS 'SCARED' BY HIS SHOUTING, WANTED TO 'GET AWAY'\n\nDaniel Penny arrives at Manhattan Supreme Court in New York City on Oct. 22, 2024. (Adam Gray for Fox News Digital)\n\nProsecutors argue that Penny went too far when he put a belligerent, shouting Neely in a choke hold on a Manhattan subway car after he started screaming death threats.\n\nWitness Lauri Sitro testified Friday that in 30 years of subway riding, she's seen a lot of unstable people, but this \"felt different.\"\n\n\"I was scared for my son,\" she testified under cross-examination. \"It's not like you can take a 5-year-old and run to the next train.

(Luces de Nueva York/Juan Alberto Vazquez via Storyful)\n\nShe said it did not look like Penny was trying to \"choke the life out of him.\"\n\n\"I did not feel safe when he was moving around erratically,\" Sitro said. \"I've taken the subway for over 30 years, and I've seen a lot. I've seen a lot of unstable people, and this felt different to me. It made me put a barrier between me and my son.\"\n\nSitro was not the only woman who told the court that Neely scared them when he barged onto the train, shouting threats and violently throwing his jacket. Several did, including Ivette Rosario , a teen straphanger who said she just wanted to \"get away,\" and Arethia Gittings, who said she \"was scared s---less\" and remained at the scene to speak with responding officers.\n\nKEY WITNESSES IN DANIEL PENNY, JORDAN NEELY CASE REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH DA BRAGG'S OFFICE: REPORT\n\nGittings testified that it did not look like Neely was going to give up as Penny and the other men held him down, that she was especially terrified by the encounter after enduring prior attacks on other subway cars and that it didn't look like Penny was applying pressure to Neely's neck but rather trying to hold him still as officers were on the way.\n\n\"I came back to thank Mr. Penny for what he had done in that worst scenario,\" she testified.\n\nAnother female passenger to testify was Caedryn Schrunk, a Nike brand manager who said Neely boarded the train and immediately filled the car with the stench of \"soiled sweatpants.\"\n\n\"I was scared that I was going to die in that moment,\" she told the court.\n\nSupporters of Jordan Neely protest a rally in support of Daniel Penny at Collect Pond Park on May 24, 2023, in New York City.

It was remarkable that so many witnesses for the prosecution had a similar feeling, Gelormino told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"I think it's interesting that they put on quite a few witnesses who said they were in fear for their lives,\" Gelormino said. \"So does Penny have a duty to release this guy, knowing he's a danger to everybody around him and himself? I don't know.\"\n\nThose witnesses have been a boost to Penny's defense, according to Rahmani, the former federal prosecutor, so much so that Grima's \"biased\" testimony may not outweigh them.\n\n\"Judge Wiley probably realizes that Penny is likely to be acquitted based on the testimony so far, in which case the mistrial motion will be moot,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Even in the unlikely event that Penny is convicted, the Appellate Division won't find prejudice with the race evidence that has come in so far.\"\n\nThis undated photo shows Jordan Neely with Carolyn Neely, an aunt. (Courtesy Mills & Edwards LLP via AP)\n\nPenny is facing charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. If convicted on both counts, he could spend up to 19 years in prison .\n\nThe legal threshold for manslaughter is recklessness or \"doing something so absurd, so out of the ordinary, that nobody else would do it,\" Gelormino explained. Negligence is easier to prove, that Penny failed to act the way a \"reasonable person would in that situation.\"\n\n\"You've got to get to Penny's frame of mind at that point, not anybody else. It's his frame of mind,\" Gelormino said.\"What was he thinking at that point? Was he thinking that this guy was still a danger at the time and would have continued to behave and threaten other people when he continued to hold him that way? Was it reasonable for him to think that, given the circumstances, given the fact that he said, 'I don't care if I'm going to jail, I don't care. I'm going to kill myself. I don't care if I die,' would a reasonable person be in fear at that time?

He is also accused of criminally negligent homicide.\n\nJurors were told they could only find Penny guilty of the lesser charge if they found him not guilty of manslaughter \"for some reason other than the lack of justification.\" If they find him guilty of manslaughter, they were told not to render a verdict at all on the lesser count. If they find him not guilty of manslaughter because prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Penny was not justified in his actions, they were told they must also find him not guilty of criminally negligent homicide.\n\nShortly after beginning deliberations, they asked the judge to reread instructions about how justification works.\n\nSee the verdict sheet\n\nAs Yoran wound down, she addressed the protesters outside.\n\n\"The defense would have you believe that because of the few protesters outside the chief medical examiner of New York would participate in fraud,\" she said. \"I can go on and on about how absurd and insulting this all is.\"\n\nThe defense objected, telling the judge it never alleged there was a mass conspiracy.\n\nDANIEL PENNY PROSECUTOR DANGLES RACE CARD AGAIN OVER DEFENSE OBJECTION DESPITE NO HATE CRIME CHARGES\n\nProsecutor Dafna Yoran departs Daniel Penny's trial at the Manhattan Supreme Criminal Court building in New York City on Monday, December 2, 2024.

Penny grabbed him from behind in a chokehold to stop the outburst.\n\nNeely had an active arrest warrant at the time of his death.

Regarding racial justice in the U.S.\n\nThe 26-year-old Penny, who is white, did not exert the pressure needed for the hold to be deadly, Penny's attorneys said.\n\nProsecutors, on the other hand, contend he used excessive force while putting the chokehold on Neely, a 30-year-old Black man who was a Michael Jackson impersonator.\n\nPenny, whose trial is expected to last six weeks, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. He faces a maximum of 15 years in prison if convicted of the manslaughter.\n\nThe New York City chief medical examiner's office ruled the cause of death was compression to Neely's neck as a result of the chokehold; the manner was ruled a homicide.\n\nPenny was interviewed a released by police on the day Neely died - a move highly criticized by officials who wanted an immediate arrest.\n\nNeely, who struggled with homelessness and mental illness, was shouting aboard a train in Manhattan the day he died, witnesses said.\n\nProsecutors agree that Neely was acting in an aggressively, according to court documents.\n\nSteven Raiser, one of Penny's attorneys, said about six witnesses will testify for the defense.\n\n\"You have an individual that's saying that he was frightened by this gentleman, Mr. Neely, and he had to act,\" Raiser said Thursday. \"We have several additional witnesses that come up and say, 'Yes, he's right.

That's what I'm used to seeing,\" according to grand jury minutes.\n\nAnother witness said, \"I personally didn't feel threatened.\"\n\nNone of the witnesses who testified before the grand jury said Neely claimed to have a weapon or that he came into physical contact with anyone prior to Penny choking him, prosecutors said in court documents.\n\nPenny served in the Marine Corps for four years before being discharged in 2021.\n\nHe pinned Neely to the ground with the help of two other passengers, according to prosecutors and the video, which shows Penny wrapping his legs around Neely's body as the two are on the floo.\n\nProsecutors said Penny had Neely in a chokehold for about six minutes.\n\nPolice said Neely lost consciousness during the fight. An eyewitness told the grand jury he was grateful for Penny's actions, but later, believed it was excessive, prosecutors said in court documents.\n\nRaiser said the defense will prove a chokhold was not used, but Penny restrained Neely.\n\n\"The video's been cited frequently as supporting the chokehold as going on too long,\" Raiser said. \"But in reality, the video proves that he wasn't applying pressure, and he was holding Mr. Neely.\"\n\nIJR, Contributor Writer\r\nShe was a Story Editor for Indpendent Journal Review since November 2022 and has written for IJR since February 2024.\r\n\r\nShe has been in the newspaper business in various capacities since 1998.\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

Newsome called on \"black vigilantes\" to avenge Neely's death and fight against white people who allegedly want to \"choke\" and \"kill\" black people for \"being loud.\"\n\n\"Like everybody else has vigilantes, we need some black vigilantes,\" Newsome said. \"People want to jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud, how about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us? I'm tired. I know you're looking for us to be like 'oh, go and march. Go and march.' No, this weekend, I want you to hold a community event, everywhere from the Bronx, to Houston, to Seattle, to Florida. Black people hold community events and talk about what you need.\"\n\nPassengers who witnessed the incident said Neely behaved in an erratic and threatening manner by screaming at commuters, throwing his jacket on the ground and saying that he did not care if he went to jail. Penny then came up from behind Neely and held him in the chokehold for about 15 minutes, where Neely eventually lost consciousness and was pronounced dead.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged Penny after a medical examiner ruled Neely's death a homicide in May 2023. The manslaughter charge , which was dismissed prior to the jury's verdict, came with a potential 15-year prison sentence, while the negligent homicide charge comes with a maximum four-year sentence.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy said during a Monday Fox News segment that the jury was in a \"deadlock\" likely due to many jurors buying into Bragg's alleged \"racialized\" narrative of the incident.\n\nProtesters supporting Neely gathered outside the courtroom prior to and following the verdict, chanting \"no justice, no peace\" and warning that the public \"will hear [them] tonight.\"\n\nBLM executives have publicly identified themselves as \"trained Marxist[s],\" including co-founder Patrisse Cullors, who confirmed in 2020 that she and her fellow organizers are Marxist ideologues focused on building a movement \"that could be utilized by many, many black folk.\" Activists sued BLM in September 2022 over allegations that its leader, Shalomyah Bowers, siphoned more than $10 million from the organization for her \"personal piggy bank.\"\n\nIn 2020, Cullors further used donations raked in by BLM following the death of George Floyd to purchase a $6 million home for personal use, a flight on a private jet and to fund a $4 million operating budget for two employees, according to National Review.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Andy McCarthy Says Bragg 'Played Games' From The Beginning Of Daniel Penny's Case\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy said Friday on Fox News that Democratic New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg \"played games\" with Daniel Penny's case, following the announcement that a Manhattan judge agreed to drop his top count of manslaughter.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran announced Friday afternoon that prosecutors would move to dismiss Penny's top count of second-degree manslaughter after the jury had already approached the judge twice, unable to reach a verdict on the charge. On \"Your World with Neil Cavuto,\" the Fox News host asked McCarthy for his thoughts on the \"significance\" of the judge's last-minute decision.\n\n\"I think Bragg played games from the beginning here, Neil. This really was never a recklessness case. The evidence doesn't lend itself to that. I think he threw in the recklessness charge in the hope that it would increase his odds of getting a conviction by giving the jury something to basically compromise on,\" McCarthy said.\n\n\"He knew that they probably wouldn't get him on the recklessness, so they could feel better about convicting him on the negligence, like they were being more fair. So what's happened here is exactly that, in the sense that the recklessness charge after four days and 30 hours of deliberations is finally gone,\" McCarthy added.\n\nMcCarthy went on to state that the jury would still have to return to court on Monday to deliberate on Penny's negligence charge. He called the case unfair and said it should never have involved manslaughter.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"But now the jury's being told it's got to come back and start from scratch on the negligence charge. And that's really not the way the case was tried, because that was not the way the indictment tees it up,\" McCarthy said. \"So I think it's really unfair to Penny in the sense that this should never have been. I don't think it should have been a case at all, but it should never have been anything other than a one count negligence case. I think then it would have been decided by now.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old former Marine's trial began last month after Bragg's office charged him with the death of 30-year-old homeless man Jordan Neely, following Penny's attempt to restrain Neely on the subway in May 2023. At the time of the incident, Neely had allegedly been screaming and threatening commuters, prompting Penny to try to subdue him.\n\nDuring the trial, Penny's defense medical expert, Dr. Satish Chundru, testified that Neely did not die from Penny's chokehold, but from the \"combined effects\" of synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia, and other factors, according to the New York Post.\n\nBecause only the lesser charge is being considered, the maximum sentence Penny could face is up to four years, according to NBC News.

      "text": "Leo Terrell Blasts Penny Trial Judge For 'Going Along' With Bragg's Plan For 'Gaming The System'\n\nCivil rights attorney Leo Terrell criticized Judge Maxwell Wiley Monday for allegedly \"going along\" with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's plan of \"gaming the system\" in the case against former Marine Daniel Penny.\n\nA Manhattan jury acquitted Penny on the criminally negligent homicide charge in the death of 30-year-old homeless man Jordan Neely, who the defendant held in a chokehold to protect surrounding passengers on a New York City subway train in May 2023. Terrell accused Wiley of going along with Bragg's attempt of \"gaming the system\" by suddenly dismissing a portion of the case when the jury was in a deadlock.\n\n\"Let me be very clear, Alvin Bragg was gaming the system,\" Terrell said. \"Look, when you file charges, you start off the case with the charges, you don't all of a sudden dismiss part of the case if you have a hung jury or a mistrial. You don't dismiss a part of the case and say 'well judge, let's go after this portion of the case.' He was gaming the system. Why, John [Roberts]? Because he was desperate for a win. He lost. He lost his case and he did everything. I'm embarrassed for the judge who went along with this scheme. The jury spoke unanimously not guilty on the negligence charge, which is the lower standard.\"\n\nWiley instructed the jury to reach an agreement on the second-degree manslaughter charge before considering the charge of criminally negligent homicide. The jury told the judge they were deadlocked on the manslaughter charge Friday, eventually prompting Wiley to dismiss the first charge at the prosecution's behest.\n\nBragg charged Penny with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide after a medical examiner ruled Neely's death a homicide in May 2023. The manslaughter charge carried a sentence of up to 15 years in prison, while the negligent homicide charge held a maximum of four years imprisonment.\n\nDr. Satish Chundru, a forensic pathologist hired by Daniel Penny's attorneys, said during the trial that Neely died from the \"combined effects of sickle cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint and the synthetic marijuana\" in his system, according to NBC News.\n\nTerrell said \"race hustlers\" attempted to \"intimidate the jury\" into convicting Penny for alleged racial purposes.\n\n\"And the point is very clear, you had people out here which I think has to be addressed,\" Terrell continued. \"You had race hustlers out there trying to intimidate the jury. People out there always playing the race card for 10 years, they'll play the race card again. This case wasn't about race, it was about a Marine veteran who was trying to protect people in the subway, who was terrorized and the jury saw it.\"\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy said during a Monday Fox News segment that the jury reached a \"deadlock\" likely due to many jurors buying into Bragg's alleged \"racialized\" narrative of the incident.\n\nProtesters in support of Neely gathered outside of the courthouse to call for retaliation in response to Penny's acquittal.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Daniel Penny's Tattoo Shows a Stunning Biblical Struggle - Do You Recognize It?\n\nThe tattoo depicts an epic struggle described in the Bible's Old Testament.  (@krassenstein / Twitter screen shot)\n\nThere is one small but critical detail about Daniel Penny that almost everyone seems to have missed.\n\nPenny is the Marine Corps veteran who put career criminal Jordan Neely in a chokehold on the New York subway May 1 after the latter started acting aggressively and threateningly towards other passengers.\n\nDespite the video clearly showing Neely behaving in an aggressive manner on the train, and despite witness accounts describing Penny as a hero, the left is still calling for his head, and now he is facing criminal charges in Neely's death.\n\nThe amount of media attention that this case is receiving both nationally and internationally would be overwhelming for most people, especially given the fact that many powerful people in both the government and media have already come to a conclusion about it.\n\nBut if one looks at Daniel Penny closely enough, there is evidence that he is tough enough to withstand this challenge.\n\nSeveral photos have emerged of a shirtless Penny in a forest, and although nobody has mentioned it, there is an interesting tattoo on his chest depicting a famous scene from the Old Testament.\n\nIt is barely visible, so most people will not notice it immediately, but on closer inspection, anyone who is familiar with the Bible will recognize that it is the C.E. Brock painting of Samson overpowering a lion.\n\nBREAKING: Daniel Penny, the man who put Jordan Neely in a chokehold on a New York subway will be charged with manslaughter according to the Manhattan District Attorney's office.\n\nA few things:\n\n1) Having watched the video I was under the impression that charges would likely be... pic.twitter.com/xZASd1LUrP\n\n- Brian Krassenstein (@krassenstein) May 11, 2023\n\nThis is Daniel Penny ... just a normal dude .. should he be exonerated from all charges ? ⚖️ ... .. how do you see this situation? .. #DanielPenny #SelfDefense #Thoughts pic.twitter.com/sdddVPjIss\n\n- Distinguished Hillbilly ?‍☠️ (@Infantry_bucky) May 15, 2023\n\nThe Book of Judges describes the legendary battle between Samson, who was endowed by God with superhuman strength, and the lion. \"Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him. And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.\" (Judges 14: 5-6)\n\nNo doubt, this tattoo will be used by the left to try and paint Penny as some sort of evil and aggressive man who thinks he is so tough and can go around hurting people. It may even come up in his trial as evidence of his character.\n\nBut that is not at all what the tattoo, or the story of Samson, is about. Samson was not a brute who went around hurting innocent people; he was a holy warrior who fought to defend the Israelites from their enemies.\n\nIn the face of relentless persecution by the Philistines, Samson was able to fight against them and save the people of Israel. The story of Samson, and Penny's tattoo, therefore tell the story of God's ability to triumph over chaos and disorder in the face of insurmountable obstacles.\n\nDespite the evidence proving his innocence, Penny still faces an uphill battle in court. There are people in Congress, in local government and in the media who have already convicted him of a crime.\n\nThere will also be a lot of pressure from leftist activists such as antifa and Black Lives Matter to convict him. The institutional power of these groups could really make things hard for Penny.\n\nBut if we put our trust in God, we know that God can overcome all of these obstacles and evil can be defeated.\n\nPenny's tattoo reminds us that we face many challenges in this world, but by putting our faith in God, we can overcome them all.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

      "text": "'A Year Going Through Hell': Jonathan Turley Says Bragg's Penny Prosecution Sent 'Mixed Message'\n\nGeorge Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said Tuesday that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's effort to prosecute ex-Marine Daniel Penny ended up sending a \"mixed message\" - step up to protect the public and the justice system may \"come after you.\"\n\nA Manhattan jury found Penny not guilty Monday on charges of criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely after a judge dismissed a manslaughter charge against the Marine veteran. Turley said that Penny spent \"a year going through hell\" because of Bragg's prosecution in the wake of Neely's death after Penny restrained on a New York City subway in May 2023.\n\n\"Fortunately, the result is something that everyone can celebrate. But, really, this jury was speaking not just in terms of themselves, but I think in terms of the city at large,\" Turley told \"Fox and Friends\" co-host Lawrence Jones. \"At the end of this process, this was a very strong voice that in New York, you really don't have to walk away, you don't have to just watch.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"But the problem here is the mixed message by Bragg. He put this person through hell. I mean, he put him through a criminal trial, he'll now face a civil trial brought by the family and the question is what was it that Bragg was representing?\" Turley continued. \"Ultimately, the criminal justice system protects the most fundamental values. What is the value here? Across the city in the other case involving the shooting of this CEO, you had the mayor saying, you know, this shows people need to step forward and act. Well, just blocks away, you just tried a guy, at least Bragg did, who did precisely that and he has spent a year going through hell.\"\n\nPolice in Altoona, Pennsylvania, arrested Luigi Mangione Monday following a five-day manhunt after United Health Group CEO Brian Thompson was killed in a Dec. 4 shooting just outside a Manhattan hotel while en route to a conference. Jones asked if Penny's acquittal would see the end of \"political prosecution.\"\n\n\"Well, the question is, who really is the constituency of Alvin Bragg? I think you saw many of those voices outside the courthouse that were filled with rage and anger at this verdict, some even threatening Penny not to remain in New York City,\" Turley responded. \"But you know, beyond that mob is the rest of New York City and they need to look at this case in a more broad sense: This is what you have come to.\"\n\n\"You have a prosecutor who takes an individual like this, who should be celebrated as a hero, in fact, was celebrated by a hero by people in that car and you have prosecuted him and fortunately, other people stepped forward to help support him,\" Turley continued. \"But that's the message that's being sent. You step forward, don't look for support.

      "text": "Daniel Penny Acquitted In Subway Chokehold Death Of Jordan Neely\n\nOAN Staff James Meyers 9:33 AM - Monday, December 9, 2024\n\nA Manhattan jury has acquitted Daniel Penny of any criminal wrongdoing in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely on a crowded subway.\n\nThe jury acquitted Penny of criminally negligent homicide, which could have put him behind bars for up to four years, in Neely's chokehold death in a crowded F train in May 2023.\n\nThis comes after the top charge of manslaughter was tossed on Friday after jurors twice said they couldn't reach a unanimous verdict.\n\nJurors sided with Penny's defense attorneys, who had argued that the Marine veteran was justified in rushing to protect others aboard the subway when he subdued the crazed man. Lawyers also questioned whether there was enough evidence that the chokehold caused Neely's death.\n\n\"Who do you want on the next train ride with you?\" one of his lawyers, Steven Raiser, said in his closing statement in Manhattan Supreme Court.\n\n\"The guy with the earbuds minding his own business who you know would be there for you if something happened? Or perhaps you just hope that someone like Jordan Neely does not enter that train when you are all alone, all alone in a crowd of others frozen with fear?\"\n\nAdditionally, the acquittal comes after jurors heard from more than 40 witnesses, including passengers who described Neely's terrifying outburst on the train before Penny approached him from behind and took him down at the Broadway-Lafayette station.\n\nOne subway passenger testified she was \"scared s-tless\" hearing Neely ranting about being \"willing to die and go to jail.\" She ended up thanking Penny for what he did, who also screamed that \"someone is going to die today.\"\n\nFurthermore, a mother who was with her 5-year-old son going to a doctor's appointment testified that she was so scared of a \"belligerent and unhinged\" Neely that she barricaded her son behind his stroller.\n\nEvidence revealed during the trial that Neely was not carrying a weapon at the time, with cops finding a muffin in his pocket.\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams (D-N.Y.) even came to Penny's defense , saying the Marine veteran did \"what we should have done as a city\" by protecting others that day.\n\nHowever, prosecutors argued that Penny went \"too far\" and that his actions turned criminal when he kept Neely in the hold after nearly all of the frightened passengers had fled the train.\n\n\"What's so tragic about this case is that even though the defendant started out trying to do the right thing, as the chokehold progressed, the defendant knew that Jordan Neely was in great distress and dying, and he needlessly continued,\" prosecutor Dafna Yoran said in her closing statement.\n\nTrial evidence revealed that Neely had the synthetic marijuana drug K2 in his system at the time of the incident. Jurors were also told during the trial that Neely was diagnosed with schizophrenia, telling doctors in 2021 that he heard the \"devil's voice.\"\n\nTo help his case Penny's mother, sister, friends and fellow Marines took the stand to testify for his character.\n\nThe defense's medical expert, forensic pathologist Dr. Satish Chundru, claimed that Neely died not from Penny's chokehold, but by \"the combined effects of sickle cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint, and the synthetic marijuana.\"\n\nDuring the trial Penny declined to take the stand. Jurors heard him tell arriving cops on the train \"I just put him out,\" before making a choking gesture with his arms.\n\nLater on, at Chinatown's 5 th Precinct, Penny claimed during an interrogation that he was trying to \"de-escalate the situation,\" and that he didn't want to hurt Neely.\n\n\"I'm not trying to kill the guy,\" the Marine veteran told two detectives, as prosecutors watched him through a one-sided mirror. \"I'm just trying to keep him from hurting anybody else.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Neely's death, and Penny's arrest 11 days later, caused a firestorm about whether Penny's actions were justified.\n\n\"This case is about a broken system, a broken system that does not help our mentally ill or our unhoused,\" Penny's attorney Raiser said at the end of his closing statement.\n\n\"In fact, it is that broken system that led us, that is interwoven into the very fabric of this case.\"\n\nStay informed!

It would encourage prosecutors to over-charge in the grand jury, with the option of withdrawing if hung, under coercion,\" Penny's lawyers said.\n\nThe judge told the jury that they will deliberate on a lesser charge on Monday.\n\nIf convicted of negligent homicide, Penny could receive up to four years behind bars.\n\n8:42 AM - A 12-person jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision on Daniel Penny's manslaughter charge.\n\nOn Friday, the jury sent a note stating that it is having a hard time reaching a unanimous consensus on whether or not to convict Penny of \"recklessly\" killing Jordan Neely after placing him in a six-minute chokehold on a subway in May 2023.\n\nLawyers defending Penny said that the 26-year-old Marine Veteran was protecting his fellow subway riders from Neely who yelled \"someone's going to die today!\" when he boarded the uptown F train.\n\nThey also say that there's no proof beyond reasonable doubt that the chokehold is what caused Neely's death.\n\nOn the other side, Manhattan prosecutors stated that Neely never threatened anyone in particular and that he didn't have any weapons on him, just a muffin in his pocket.\n\nThe hung jury first started deliberating on early Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIf they are unable to reach a verdict, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley will be required to give them an \"Allen\" charge. An Allen charge urges jurors to re-examine their positions in order for them to work towards finding a unanimous consensus.\n\nPenny faces up to 15 years behind bars if he is convicted on the manslaughter charge. If he is convicted on a less serious count, he faces up to four years in prison.\n\nThis is a breaking story. Check back for updates.\n\nStay informed!

      "text": "Jordan Neely's Father Sues Daniel Penny Amid Subway Chokehold Death Trial Deliberations\n\nOAN Staff Brooke Mallory 2:18 PM - Thursday, December 5, 2024\n\nAs the jury considers whether to find Daniel Penny guilty of manslaughter, Jordan Neely's father is now suing Penny for his son's death, which purportedly occurred from strangulation on a New York City subway car after Neely repeatedly threatened onlookers in his vicinity.\n\nThe 26-year-old Long Island Marine veteran is accused of negligent contact, assault, and battery that resulted in Neely's injuries and death last year in the lawsuit, which was submitted to the New York Supreme Court on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the case, Neely's father, Andre Zachary, \"demands judgment awarding damages in a sum which exceeds the jurisdictional limits of all lower Courts, which would otherwise have jurisdiction.\"\n\nAs jurors in Penny's four-week trial in Manhattan broke for the second time without returning a verdict, it was filed on Wednesday.\n\nOn May 1 st , 2023, Neely, 30, passed away after Penny, 26, held him in a chokehold after the seemingly disturbed homeless man started screaming at people and threatening those around him, instilling fear in bystanders on a packed F train.\n\nAnother interesting detail revolves around the fact that although mainstream media sources have reported that Penny put him in a chokehold for around \"6 minutes,\" an actual witness at the scene told police that Penny had held him for \"about two minutes and 55 seconds,\" the BBC reported in June 2023. One witness even recorded the chokehold with his phone.\n\nAccording to Penny and other witnesses, Neely had threatened to \"kill a motherf-er\" and stated that he didn't care if he was sent back to jail, asserting that \"someone\" was going to \"die today.\"\n\nNeely's death, according to defense lawyers, was caused by a combination of drug abuse, including synthetic marijuana, schizophrenia, a genetic disorder, and physical pressure from Penny holding him down from charging anyone.\n\nAccording to the Department of Behavioral Health, \"Synthetic marijuana can cause hallucinations, anxiety, paranoia,  confusion, elevated heart rate, unconsciousness, and even death. [It] can cause a person to become incoherent, disorderly, and aggressive. Effects can last for hours and, because the strains of synthetic marijuana are constantly changing, they are very difficult for doctors to treat.\"\n\nHowever, prosecutors argue that Penny went \"way too far\" and was \"criminally reckless\" in his struggle with Neely.\n\nOn Wednesday, the jury asked again to see the bodycam footage of Penny's precinct interrogation interview with investigators and the NYPD officers' arrival at the site while EMS attempted to revive Neely.\n\nOne unidentified police source also alleged that Neely was still alive when emergency personnel arrived, but they were reportedly hesitant to touch him out of fear that they could contract HIV, as he had open wounds, and because he reeked of fecal matter and urine. Nevertheless, this claim has not been confirmed and is merely hearsay.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, who will soon be heading the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside Elon Musk, previously expressed his thoughts on the matter on Fox News last year.\n\nIn 2015, Jordan Neely kidnapped a 7 year old girl In 2019, Jordan Neely punched a 64 year old man in the face. In 2021, Jordan Neely slugged a 67 year old woman in the face as she exited the subway, breaking her nose and fracturing her orbital bone. Neely was arrested 44... pic.twitter.com/He6lOEHQaz\n\nSome legal experts like Jeffrey Lichtman, a New York defense lawyer who previously defended drug lord El Chapo and alleged gangster John Gotti Jr., do not believe that this case will go anywhere. He argued that prosecutors will most likely not succeed in their case against Penny since the state must demonstrate that the defendant knew his actions could result in death, which he says is extremely difficult to prove.\n\n\"It's not like he snuck up behind him and hit him over the head with a brick or a bat,\" Lichtman stated, noting that Neely could have submitted to being held down, ending the struggle.\n\nPenny's statement to investigators was previously read aloud in court.\n\n\"I wasn't trying to injure him. I'm just trying to keep him from hurting anybody else,\" Penny told detectives in the videotaped interview shown to jurors. He also noted \"that's what we are taught in the Marine Corps.\"\n\n\"I was scared for myself but I looked around there were women and children, he was yelling in their faces saying these threats. I just couldn't sit still,\" Penny added.\n\n\"I just wanted to keep him from getting to people.\"\n\nPolice also told the press, specifically CBS News , that Penny had told other passengers to quickly call 911 during the struggle, before putting Neely into a \"recovery\" position.\n\n\"If a person is unconscious but is breathing and has no other life-threatening conditions, they should be placed in the recovery position. Putting someone in the recovery position will keep their airway clear and open. It also ensures that any vomit or fluid won't cause them to choke,\" according to NHS-UK.\n\nLast week, NYC Mayor Eric Adams stood up for the former Marine on a podcast.\n\nNEW: NYC mayor Eric Adams defends Daniel Penny for protecting subway passengers, blasts the media for portraying Jordan Neely as an \"innocent child.\" Adams said Penny did what New York City \"should have done as a city.\" \"You have someone on that subway who was responding, doing... pic.twitter.com/CO7r6GdeD4\n\nMeanwhile, social media users commented on the ongoing trial and the recent news of Neely's father's lawsuit, which has garnered much attention in the media.\n\n\"Jordan Neely's parents are suing Daniel Penny over the death of their son. Nevermind the coroner's report. Nevermind the fact that they abandoned him and forced him to live out on the street for years instead of having him institutionalized, when he posed a danger to them,\" said X user Ian Miles Cheong.\n\nThe Daniel Penny saga just gets more and more insane: at the time of his death, there was a warrant out for Jordan Neely's arrest - get this - for the assault of a woman on the subway.  How this even went to trial is beyond me. pic.twitter.com/2kT64NS41w\n\nStay informed! Receive breaking news blasts directly to your inbox for free.

According to Penny and other witnesses, Neely had been threatening to \"kill a motherf-er\" and stated that he didn't care if he was sent back to jail, asserting that \"someone\" was going to \"die today.\"\n\nNeely was previously arrested 44 times for assaulting women, one of them being 67-years-old, theft, evading fares, and even an alleged kidnapping of a 7-year-old girl in 2015.\n\nNewsome, who strangely claimed to be Neely's uncle, reportedly threatened Penny himself in the courtroom, declaring \"it's a small f**king world, buddy.\"\n\nThe BLM leader then spoke to reporters following Penny's acquittal, calling for \"Black vigilante justice.\"\n\n\"Everybody else has vigilantes. We need some black vigilantes,\" he stated. \"People want to jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud, how about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us.\"\n\nNew York BLM Leader, Hawk Newsome, calls for \"Black vigilantes\" after Daniel Penny's acquittal. #NYC #BLM #HawkNewsome #Breaking #Latest #News #OAN pic.twitter.com/06aa4EQZTO\n\n\"America will never fix the issue of black people because America needs a punching bag.

I want a step.\"\n\nDespite Newsome's condemnation, Dr. Satish Chundru, who testified during the trial, expressed that he did not believe Penny's chokehold was solely responsible for Neely's death.\n\n\"In your opinion, did Mr. Penny choke Mr. Neely to death?\" asked defense attorney Steven Raiser.\n\n\"No,\" Chundru stated in response, \"The chokehold did not cause death.\"\n\nChundru added that Neely's death was attributed to \"the combined effects of sickle cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint, and the synthetic marijuana,\" according to Fox News , adding that the medical records were not consistent with a fatal chokehold.\n\nStay informed!

      "text": "NY Jury Acquits Daniel Penny in Death of Deranged Man on Subway\n\nA New York jury found Daniel Penny not guilty for the death of Jordan Neely, a homeless Michael Jackson impersonator whom Penny put in a chokehold on a Manhattan subway car last year.\n\nAfter a seven-week trial that involved over 40 witnesses, the jury found Penny, a former Marine sergeant, not guilty of criminally negligent homicide.\n\nThe case earned national coverage in part because many saw the incident as indicative of general social dysfunction in cities around the country and of the woes of New York City's subway system-by far the country's biggest-which has been plagued by mentally ill homeless people. Some, including New York City mayor Eric Adams (D.), lauded Penny as a hero, whereas others, including Rev. Al Sharpton and New York's Black Lives Matter chapter, saw him as a reckless vigilante who must be punished. Supporters of Penny, a Long Island native who was living in downtown Manhattan, donated more than $3.2 million to his legal defense fund.\n\nAfter the jury verdict was read, cheering erupted in the courtroom from Penny's supporters, along with jeers from advocates for Neely. Mr. Neely's father, Andre Zachary, shouted out in protest and was removed from the courtroom by court officers. Also removed were the brother and sister Black Lives Matter duo, Hawk and Chivona Newsome. As she was removed from the courtroom, Chivona Newsome yelled, \"racist f- country.\"\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Penny was riding the F Train to the gym when Neely pried open the subway car's door at the Second Avenue stop under Manhattan's East Village and began a threatening rant that terrified passengers, according to witness testimony. Neely shouted that he was hungry, ready to go to jail, and ready to die.\n\nNeely, who a toxicology report would later show was high on K2, or synthetic marijuana, had a long history of mental illness and homelessness as well as an extensive arrest record. On his better days, he could be seen doing Michael Jackson impersonations on the subway. The judge did not allow his criminal record to be used as evidence.\n\nAs Neely, who was unarmed, ranted and raved on the train, emitting an overwhelming odor of feces, according to witness testimony, Penny, who'd been trained in the Marines on how to subdue a dangerous person, put Neely in a chokehold for nearly six minutes, according to videos captured by bystanders. Exactly when Neely lost consciousness and stopped struggling was a matter of dispute at trial. But police intervened at the next subway stop, and Neely was pronounced dead at the hospital an hour later.\n\nPenny told police detectives after the incident that he put Neely in the chokehold to defend himself and other passengers on the train and did not intend to kill the homeless man. During the interview, Penny described Neely as \"a crackhead\" (the defense tried unsuccessfully to have the videotaped interview removed from evidence). Penny was initially released and not charged, but several days later, after coming under public pressure from racial justice advocates who held protests and blocked the subway tracks, Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg charged Penny, who is white, in the death of Neely, who was black. Penny pleaded not guilty to the charges in June 2023.\n\nJurors deliberated for more than six days and, at one point, told the judge that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the manslaughter charge, which hinged on whether Penny acted \"recklessly\" when he restrained Neely. Penny's attorneys requested a mistrial during the deadlock, although the judge declined and ordered the jurors to continue deliberating.\n\nThe judge overseeing the murder case against Daniel Penny dropped the second-degree manslaughter charge against Penny on Friday after the jury came back again and said they were deadlocked.\n\nPenny's lawyers argued during the trial that the ex-Marine's chokehold was not what killed Neely and that Penny was regularly relaxing the chokehold during the struggle. The defense's expert witness said that Neely's compounding health issues-including schizophrenia, synthetic marijuana use, and a sickle cell trait that restricted the blood's ability to bring oxygen to the brain-combined with the struggle with Mr. Penny and led to his death.\n\nThe defense accused the prosecution of changing its conclusions about Neely's death as political pressure mounted. The medical examiner admitted that she ruled Neely had died from asphyxiation before she saw the toxicology results and that she wouldn't have changed her conclusions if Neely had enough fentanyl in his system \"to kill an elephant.\"\n\nProsecutors, in a legal maneuver, didn't contest that Penny did not intend to kill Neely. Rather, they countered that he acted \"recklessly\"  by keeping his hold for well beyond a reasonable amount of time, thus causing an unnecessary death. The lead attorney on the case, Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran, emphasized the racial dynamic between the two men as well and repeatedly described Penny as a \"white man.\" She also used language that echoed the rhetoric of the Black Lives Matter protesters who were in regular attendance outside the courthouse.\n\n\"Danny acted when others didn't,\" Penny's defense attorney, Steven Raiser, said during closing arguments. \"He put his life on the line. He did that for perfect strangers.\"\n\nPublished under: Alvin Bragg , Black Lives Matter , Daniel Penny , Eric Adams , Jordan Neely , Marine Corps , New York City\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

Jurors told the court twice on Friday that they were unable to unanimously decide on a verdict for the more serious charge.\n\nThe dropped charge was the latest dramatic development in the case, which has garnered nationwide headlines. Penny's trial is seen by some as a miscarriage of justice against a man who they say should be hailed as a hero, whereas others believe Penny acted with reckless abandon when he put Jordan Neely, the homeless man, in a chokehold after Neely threatened subway riders.\n\nJurors were sent home for the weekend after the judge's decision. They are expected to meet again Monday in hopes of hashing out a verdict.\n\nPenny's attorneys asked throughout the day for a mistrial. The judge rejected those requests and ordered the jury to continue deliberations.\n\nProsecutors have conceded that Penny did not intend to kill Neely, saying instead that Penny left him in a chokehold for too long, six minutes, after Neely boarded a subway car and threatened passengers.\n\nPenny's defense team has noted that a toxicology report showed synthetic marijuana in Neely's system, a drug that is known to cause psychotic breaks in its users. Neely, who once acted as a Michael Jackson impersonator in street performances, had a long history of mental health issues.\n\n\"Danny acted when others didn't,\" his defense attorney Steven Raiser said during closing arguments. \"He put his life on the line.

During deliberations, the jury informed the judge they were deadlocked on the higher charge of second-degree manslaughter. The judge then granted the district attorney's request to dismiss it. Penny said the dismissal was an attempt by the prosecution to convince the jury to convict him \"on something.\"\n\n\"It really showed their arrogance, their lack of understanding of what's really happening, and really what the public perception of crime [is], and, no matter what everyone else says on the news, it's pretty prevalent,\" Penny said. \"It just showed their arrogance that they were gonna get me on something-that's what it felt like.\"\n\nPenny, a former Marine, also criticized Dafna Yoran, the lead prosecutor, for weaponizing his military service against him.\n\n\"I gave up the best years of my life to serve the country,\" Penny said. \"The fact that this public official, a lady that gets paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, would discredit [my military service and awards] was very frustrating, and it's a shame that there are people like this in our government that are supposed to protect us, that are supposed to protect our rights.\"\n\nLast year, Penny placed Neely, a homeless Michael Jackson impersonator, in a chokehold on a Manhattan subway car after Neely threatened passengers, shouting that he was hungry, ready to go to jail, and ready to die, according to witness testimony. Penny-who is trained in how to subdue a dangerous person-put Neely in a chokehold for six minutes. Neely was pronounced dead an hour later.\n\nThe Marine veteran told Fox News that he would take the same actions again if put in a similar situation because it was the \"American thing to do.\"\n\n\"I would not be able to live with myself if I didn't do anything in that situation and someone got hurt. I would feel guilty for the rest of my life,\" Penny said. \"All people, if they're in a position to help, should always help.

Unfortunately, that means many good patriots must subject themselves to the Democratic Party's pro-crime agenda and face violence and harassment from those who should be locked away in prison.\n\nThey must face violence and harassment, that is, unless an Adonis happens to be riding the subway at the same time. Daniel Penny fit that role in May, when an unhoused Michael Jackson impersonator boarded his subway car and threatened to kill surrounding passengers.\n\nPenny, a former Marine, sprung into action. He proceeded to put the deranged individual in a chokehold, potentially saving several lives.\n\nBut in today's world, no good deed goes unpunished. The unhoused Michael Jackson impersonator tragically died shortly after police and paramedics arrived, and far-left, anti-American prosecutor Alvin Bragg brought charges against Penny more than a week later, accusing him, disgracefully, of second-degree manslaughter and negligent homicide. Penny faced years behind bars for what any sane person would consider a heroic action.\n\nThankfully, a jury of Penny's peers in deep-blue Manhattan agreed. Prosecutors couldn't even prove Penny was responsible for the mad man's death. He was acquitted in December. And even after Bragg turned his life upside down, Penny emerged with no regrets.\n\n\"I'll take a million court appearances and people calling me names and people hating me, just to keep one of those people from getting hurt or killed,\" Penny said in an interview shortly after the verdict.\n\nAfter Penny left court he was spotted in a local pub, beer in hand.

There, members of the organization shouted \"Murderer, Murderer\" and waved signs that said \"Convict Daniel Penny\" and contained links to the Black Opportunities website.\n\nBlack Opportunities shares close ties with Black Lives Matter Greater New York, which has also been involved in organizing protests against Penny since his trial started in October. Both organizations were founded by longtime Black Lives Matter activist Hawk Newsome, who has taken to calling Penny the \"Subway Strangler.\"\n\nPenny was charged with second-degree manslaughter and negligent homicide in May 2023, days after his altercation with a homeless man named Jordan Neely on the subway. Neely entered Penny's car and began threatening those onboard before Penny put him into a headlock, which a medical examiner found was the cause of Neely's death. Prosecutors rested their case on Tuesday. The jury is currently deliberating a verdict.\n\nPenny's arrest prompted many Americans to rally to his defense , calling him a good Samaritan who was protecting his fellow riders. Newsome has used other nicknames for the former Marine, labeling him a \"white supremacist hero.\"\n\n\"It is safe to assume that Danny Penny 'The Subway Strangler' is embracing the celebrity that comes with being a race-based white supremacist hero,\" Newsome said in an Oct. 29 press release one day before the jury in the case was finalized. \"Danny Penny shows up to court with a high-powered personal security team with three SUVs valued at over $250,000 collectively. And now he is using jury selection specialists who help defendants that hunt BLM protesters get away with murder.\"\n\nNewsome has sought to instill doubt in the jury before it renders its verdict, calling the jury selection process \"racist\" in a Nov. 1 press release . Newsome alleges that Penny's defense team struck a black woman from the jury \"because of her purple hair.\"\n\n\"The allegations of racist practices in the jury selection process cannot be taken lightly!\" Newsome said. \"Especially when we consider that 8 of the 9 the Stranglers defense team chose we [sic] people of color.\"\n\nThough Newsome is a prominent Black Lives Matter activist, he and his organizations don't share official ties with Black Lives Matter Global Network, the national charity that raised $90 million during the George Floyd riots in 2020. Those funds were later used to purchase ritzy mansions and enrich the friends and family of its co-founder, Patrisse Cullors.\n\nNewsome garnered headlines in 2021 for cutting ties with the national Black Lives Matter group and calling for an \"independent investigation\" into its finances. He launched Black Opportunities shortly thereafter.\n\nBut Black Opportunities is shrouded in financial secrecy as well. Although it currently accepts donations on its website , the IRS revoked its nonprofit status in May for failing to file any tax returns since its founding. No financial information about the group is publicly available, which nonprofits are required to provide.\n\nNor is it clear what charitable activities Black Opportunities engages in. Much of the organization's website is dedicated to selling apparel, such as sweatshirts and t-shirts that say \"F- THE MAYOR.\"\n\nEven with those tax problems, some New York Democrats haven't cut ties with Black Opportunities. In August, the organization held a block party in West Harlem that was sponsored by former New York City councilwoman Kristin Richardson Jordan (D.).\n\nNewsome did not return a request for comment.\n\nPublished under: Black Lives Matter , Daniel Penny , Jordan Neely , New York\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

During the incident last year, Neely threatened passengers, shouting that he was hungry, ready to go to jail, and ready to die, according to witness testimony. Penny-a former Marine trained in how to subdue a dangerous person-placed Neely in a chokehold for six minutes. Neely was pronounced dead an hour later.\n\n\"[Neely] was sick. He was not a threat. He was subdued. Still not a threat,\" Bowman wrote Tuesday. \"Daniel Penny choked him for 6 minutes. And killed him. We all watched it on camera, and he was still acquitted.\"\n\nNeely, who a toxicology report would later show was high on K2, or synthetic marijuana, had a long history of mental illness and homelessness as well as an extensive arrest record.\n\nBowman said Neely's death was the \"latest\" of \"countless incidents of brutal police violence and killings,\" citing the deaths of George Floyd, Eric Garner, Philando Castile, Trayvon Martin, and Breonna Taylor.\n\n\"The trauma from their murders lives in my bones,\" Bowman said. \"I marvel at the beauty and greatness of my people in spite of white supremacy. That is what I will continue to lean on.\"\n\n\"RIP Jordan Neely. The justice system failed you. Kyle Ritenhouse [sic] and Daniel Penny are free. You're gone. We must still fight,\" Bowman concluded.\n\nBowman, who is a member of the far-left \"Squad,\" lost his reelection bid this year in a race that largely centered on Bowman's hostility toward the Jewish state.\n\nPublished under: Daniel Penny , Jamaal Bowman , Jordan Neely , Racism , White Supremacy\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
